Why does sum(1,2)  lead to TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable, and sum(1,2,3)  lead to TypeError: sum expected at most 2 arguments, got 3, but it's OK if I add more parentheses?Meanwhile,  max(1,2,3) and max((1,2,3))  are all OK.
This is because python built in function sum() takes an argument of a iterable and a second argument of starting position in the iterable. sum(iterable[, start])This is why adding 3 arguments give you an error. you can read more in the docs: https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#summax() on the other hand accepts argument differently, max(iterable[, key]) andmax(arg1, arg2, *args[, key]) as found in https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#maxIt can accept both an iterable or a bunch of numbers as arguments and return the max.
sum takes one mandatory argument which needs to be any sequence of numbers i.e. list or tuple (but not string) of numbers.An optional second argument would be added to the result if given.
"Sums start and the items of an iterable from left to right and returns the total."Just to prove it and perhaps mess with your sanity:
