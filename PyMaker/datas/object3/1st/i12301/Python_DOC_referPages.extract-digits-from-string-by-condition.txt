I want to extract digits from a short string, base on a condition that the digits is in front of a character (S flag).example and result:I can split the string to a list to get the individual element, but how could I just get the 18 and 10? 
Use re.findall with the regex r'(\d+)S'. This matches all digits before a capital S.To get integer output, you can convert them in a list comp or use map
You could use a regular expression.
this should do the trick
