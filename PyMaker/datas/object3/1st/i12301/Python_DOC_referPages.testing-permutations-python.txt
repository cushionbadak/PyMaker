Natural Text
I need some help starting this please as I've just been staring at this blankly for quite a while nowMy intention is to iterate through each permutation of (a, b, c) where each is a value within in the limit. So I can test a function I'm working with to find the best possible outcome
This is a pretty direct application of the permutations iteratorThe permutations function will go through all 3 item permutations of the values in limit and assign those values to a,b, and c.Make sure that you realize that there are quite a few permutations to loop through.  As limit consists of 100 values, there will be 970,200 individual permutations, so if the operations you wish to do with these values take much time, your code might take a while to run.See here in the official python documentation for details on the permutations function.
