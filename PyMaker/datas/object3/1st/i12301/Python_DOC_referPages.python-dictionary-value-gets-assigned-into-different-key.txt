I am trying to code a word-count program in python. For this, I am using dictionary to store count of the words.Dictionary is of the format d[int] = [array of words].Upon adding a word, if word is already present in dict,it removes the word and appends to next key.Upon executing d[index].append(word), it somehow gets added as a new key. Am I doing something wrong? I am using python 3.4.3 and 2.7.9 on Ubuntu.
The problem in your code is that you do not break loopOn certain point of execution dictionary d has following contentNext word in the sentence is bat so your code does this:on the first iteration of the loop it finds bat in d[1], removes it from there and appends the word into d[2] list (at this point dictionary has proper content);on the second iterations it finds bat in d[2] and proceeds with its removal and creation of a new list in d[3].You need to break the loop once you have appended word into d[index]See http://ideone.com/sROy6m
It took me a while to realize what kind of datastructure you're using. It would be more efficient to reverse the order, and use the collections.Counter to count the words; should you need the reverse structure (aka words by count), you can build it later:prints:
