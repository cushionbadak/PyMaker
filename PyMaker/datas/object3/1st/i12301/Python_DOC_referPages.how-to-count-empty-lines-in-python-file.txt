I would like to print the total empty lines using python. I have been trying to print using:but not able to get proper outputI have been trying to print it.. it does print the value as 0.. not sure what wrong with code..print "\nblank lines are",(sum(line.isspace() for line in fname))it printing as:blank lines are 0There are 7 lines in the file.There are 46 characters in the file.There are 8 words in the file.
Since the empty string is a falsy value, you may use .strip():The above ignores lines with only whitespaces.If you want completely empty lines you may want to use this instead:
Please use a context manager (with statement) to open files:line.isspace() returns True (== 1) if line doesn't have any non-whitespace characters, and False (== 0) otherwise. Therefore, sum(line.isspace() for line in f) returns the number of lines that are considered empty.line.split() always returns a list. Bothandwould work.
