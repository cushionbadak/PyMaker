I'm using python 3.5.1 and running my file through command prompt on windows. The arguments are being passed after the program is run; ie the program prompts for input based on a previously generated list.I'm looking to read in multiple numbers on the same line separated by spaces.  Python 2.X it wouldn't have been an issue with raw_input but this is proving to be a challenge.If I enter two different numbers on the same line:Enter items to archive (1 2 etc):29 30  Traceback (most recent call  last):   File "G:\Learning\Python\need_to_watch.py", line 15, in         selection = list(map(int,input("Enter items to archive (1 2 etc):").split(",")))   File "", line 1       29 30           ^ SyntaxError: unexpected EOF while parsingI gave up on a single line and tried just doing it in a loop but I get a different errorIt tries to evaluate 'q' as a variable even though I haven't eval()'d anything.This question says to just use input().split() but it would appear that this no longer works....accepting multiple user inputs separated by a space in python and append them to a listI could try and catch the EOF exception, but that doesn't seem like the right way to do it, nor should it be necessary.
If you want to pass arguments to a python script, you may want to take a look at argparse instead: https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html
Or more concisely:
You try to evaluate everything as an int which is obviously not going to work. Try this instead:
