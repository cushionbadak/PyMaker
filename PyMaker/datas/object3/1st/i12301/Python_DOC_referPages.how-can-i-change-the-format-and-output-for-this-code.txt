Natural Text
I am working on a Python product which reads from a text file and adds up the numbers and shows the result on the screen. Here is my code. It works but I would like to modify the output a bit. Also, is there a way where I can modify the code to explain to a very new program(My brother in 10th grade, who will be starting Python as his very first programming language). Please notice that it is not a CSV file and should not be used as such. It is a text file with its contents separated by a comma.Right now the output comes like And the text file from which it reads looks like
What you want to do, to format your output, is to call a method named format on what is called a format string. You would change your line print(Current_category, Current_sum, file=reportfile) to something more like:This will print the value of Current_category, left-aligned, in a field that is 15 characters wide, then print a colon, and then print the value of Current_sum, again left-aligned, in a field ten characters wide. Each set of braces is a like a hole that the corresponding variable given to the call to format will fill, and the cryptic stuff inside the braces tells format how you want the variable displayed. There's a lot of options and information available here. Don't try to memorize everything, but read through it a bit, taking a look particularly at the examples and the section titled 'format specification mini language'. You should play around with this for a bit in the python shell until it looks familiar.Happy learning.
