I am using the Bottle micro-web framework within a closed python installation. The standard library of this python install is very limited. Unsurprisingly pip is not there so I can't import pip and go that route.I can get Bottle to run when I pull wsgiref from a previously installed Python on my computer and copy it into the directory of my running script but that's not a working solution for anyone who wants to run my script. I need to be able to download wsgiref from a suitable source.The closed python install comes from the The  Sims 4 PC game. This is a script called my_web_app.py that I wrote. bottle.py and the wsgiref directory are in the same folder as my_web_app.py which is in a folder called my_web_mod under \Electronic Arts\The Sims 4\Mods. The below code won't run without The Sims 4 but it's here for anyone to use in case they have the game and want to test.
Try setting up the sys.path from your script before importing anything. if wsgiref is next to your script it will might work
