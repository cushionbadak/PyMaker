Please explain to me the following. If I execute this:I get this:I understand the first three lines of the output. But why do I have to give the name of the first base class to super() in order to get the method of the second base class?
You are mucking with the Method Resolution Order, or MRO. Python class inheritance hierarchies are linearised, given a specific order, according to a system called the C3 linearisation.super() uses that order to find the next attribute (including methods) in that ordering. Given a current instance, and a class, it'll search the order for an attribute past the given class. For both Child* classes, the MRO lists the Child* class first, followed by Base1 and Base2. In your last example you told super() to go looking in that MRO starting from the next class after Base1, so only Base2.foo() remains to be found.You can ask any class for its MRO by calling the class.mro() method:super() can be used outside methods too; you can then easily see what happens when you pick different starting points for the search:
