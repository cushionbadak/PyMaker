I accidentally wrote:instead of:I searched the net and could not find anything. So what happened, why does Python think I mean what I am typing?Computers trust us too much. :)
This is the same as if you were to do like total_acc = -accuracy, except positive instead of negative. It basically is the same as total_acc = accuracy though, as adding a + before a value does not change it.This is called an unary operator as there is only one argument (ex: +a) instead of two (ex: a+b).This link explains it a little more.
If you are interested in catching this type of errors early, you can do that with static code analysis. For example, flake8:In this case, it is complaining about the extra space after the +, thinking that you actually meant total_acc = +accuracy. This would have helped you to discover the problem earlier.FYI, pylint would catch that too.
It thinks you're doing total_acc = +accuracy, which sets total_acc equal to accuracy. + before a variable without another value causes the variable's __pos__ method to be called. For most types, this is a nop, but there are certain types, e.g. Decimal that implement __pos__.
