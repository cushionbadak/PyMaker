I have tried to create a word counter in python, but my code fails to run.Could you please help me fix the problem?The current result is 
You could try the below code:Here, I'm using str(len(word)) instead of just len(word). Because len(word) returns a number and it's an int object. And you're doing str_object + int_object, and Python doesn't understand what do you really want to do. Let's see:So you have to convert the int_object (which returned by len(word)) to a str object use str() function.For example:You can also use str.format() instead of two +. Which can auto convert all objects to str, also it's more readable than your code.So just use:
You have an error:Or:
input takes a string input. If you wish to print, you must use print. len returns an integer value. Str converts it to string.
