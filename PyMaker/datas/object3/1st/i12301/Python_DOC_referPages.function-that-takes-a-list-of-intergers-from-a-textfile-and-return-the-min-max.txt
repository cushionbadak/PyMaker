I have a list like this oneon a textfile.I would like to calculate the min, max and avg but i am having trouble removing min, max and avg on the list.
It seems like you are using split(',') on something that is not a CSV file (comma-separated values). You could treat the first value in the list separately, using split(':')[1] to get the part after the :, but instead I suggest to use regular expressions to get all the numbers in the list:Also, it seems like you are applying your functions to the entire list of lists, instead of just to the respective lines. To get, e.g., the max for the "max" line, use print maximum(listnum[1])Seems like you are still having problems with this. As I said, you can not split the entire list by , because the entire list is not separated by ,. You can either use a regular expression to get both the operation and the numbers, or you can first split by : and then by ,. Just try this:Output:
