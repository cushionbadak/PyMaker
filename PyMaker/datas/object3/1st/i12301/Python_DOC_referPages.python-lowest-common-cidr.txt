Say I have two IPs: startip = '63.223.64.0' and endip   = '63.223.127.255'I understand that in python netaddr.iprange_to_cidrs(startip, endip) will give you a list of CIDR subnets that fit exactly between the boundaries.  However, I was hoping to go for one CIDR subnet that covers it all even if it gives a few more IPs.  I prefer a function that does it, but I would also welcome any math/logic to calculate it and eventually turn it into code. 
It looks like netaddr.spanning_cidr does the trick:
Have you tried the ipaddress module? It comes with Python 3, but is installable for Python 2.
