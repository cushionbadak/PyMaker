I have a simple test code that runs successfully on Linux, but it won't run on my windows 10 x64 computer. When I tried to start a celery worker, it complained about the unrecoverable error: PicklingError. (Celery version: 3.1.20)In my celery config, I've set the serialization to 'json', but it still didn't help at all. Here is the full error message:
I ran into the same problem. What was weird is that the problem only existed on Windows, on Linux Celery was running without any problems.Turns out I needed to pass the configuration module as name not as object:app.config_from_object('celeryconfig')instead ofapp.config_from_object(celeryconfig)Explanation from the Celery docs:TipUsing the name of a module is recommended as this means that the module doesn’t need to be serialized when the prefork pool is used. If you’re experiencing configuration pickle errors then please try using the name of a module instead.Apparently Celery needs to pickle the configuration when it's passed as an object which fails on Windows. If passed as module name it works.Thanks for pointing me in the right direction @JoyLy!
