Natural Text
I parse some ASCII text using python which return me strings like:UI8, SI32, etc...Based on those strings I need to compute the maximum value of the types and to replace them with following strings:unsigned char, signed long, etc...I found in python ctypes lib, but i was unable to find how to get maximum\minimum.Does Python have something exquivalent to std::numeric_limits in C++?
How many such strings are there?  It might be quickest to define them by hand yourself:Or you could put them in a dict.  I put them in static attributes of a class because it's about the neatest way of letting you refer to them in a way that "feels like" enum constants:More programmatically, if your type string is a variable, you could use it like this:The corresponding MinVal definitions are left as an exercise for the reader..
