I have a strange problem. Trying to write a network app in python. Currently I am using osx and I have troubles with sockets. My code works fine on debian, but when I try to use recv(buff_size) on a connected tcp socket I get this error:socket.error: [Errno 35] Resource temporarily unavailable 
Are you using non-blocking sockets, or timeouts? According to this table, Errno 35 is EAGAIN on OSX; according to Apple man pages recv(2):[EAGAIN]The socket is marked non-blocking, and the receive operation would block, or a  receive timeout had been set, and the timeout expired before data were received.It could also be possible that socket.setdefaulttimeout was called with non-zero value (in which case socket.getdefaulttimeout would return non-none value.See also Spurious recv() EAGAIN on OSX?; Blocking socket returns EAGAIN.
