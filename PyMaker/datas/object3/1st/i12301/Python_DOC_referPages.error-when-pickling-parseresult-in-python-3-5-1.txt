I have test code that works in Python 2.7.11, but fails in Python 3.5.1:The error message is as follows:__new__() refers to pyparsing.ParseResults.__new__(cls, toklist, name=None, asList=True, modal=True ).Is it still in general possible to pickle objects returned by pyparsing in Python 3.5.1 or has something changed?Could somebody provide a brief code sample of their use of pickle and pyparsing 2.0.7?My real grammar takes a few minutes to parse, so I really would appreciate being able to store the results before further processing.
This fails with protocol=2 (optional 3rd arg to pickle.dump), but passes if you use pickle protocol = 0 or 1.  On Python 2.7.10, 0 is the default protocol. On Python 3.5, pickle has protocols 0-4, and again, pickling ParseResults only works with protocols 0 and 1. But in Py3.5, the default protocol has changed to 3.  You can work around this problem for now by specifying a protocol of 0 or 1.More info on pickle protocols at https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html?highlight=pickle#data-stream-format
