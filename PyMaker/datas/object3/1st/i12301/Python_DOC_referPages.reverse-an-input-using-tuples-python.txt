Natural Text
I want to be able to write  function that will reverse a phrase such as 'Hello World' into 'World Hello'. So far i can get to:after this I'm assuming you need to slice the string and then that slice gets stored in a tuple, and at the end the variables will print out.
It would be stored in a list, not a tuple. Here's how you do it in 2 lines:orSo the function would be:which will return a list of reversed words from the phrase if called as follows: 
you can use the reversed built-inthe input string is split on whitespace, then passed to reversed, then joined againFor example use it as
You don't need to test if ' ' in inputphrase: as parts will contain just a single item in that case.It's a good idea to make your functions have a single purpose. You should have one function for getting the input, and another for reversing it. 
Python programming language provides a neat syntax to reverse a  tuple.The syntax is var[::-1] which returns a reverse copy of the var.Example:Output: Or you can do it this way.Output:
