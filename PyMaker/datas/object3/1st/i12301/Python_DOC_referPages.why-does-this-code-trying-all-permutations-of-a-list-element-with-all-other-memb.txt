Natural Text
I have a large corpus of text (~170kB) which I want to train for a NLP application.However, trying to make a list of all the elements of a list, paired with all the other elements of the same list one at a time, causes the program to exit with an exit code 137.

Or save the generated pairs to file for later.Specifically, use the product function:Equivalent to nested for-loops in a generator expression. For example, product(A, B) returns the same as ((x,y) for x in A for y in B).EDIT: Yes, your script requires large amounts of memory - this is the memory consumption on my machine:
