The python documentation has information on the grammar of formatting strings, however I can't seem to find information on how to read the table defining the grammar for the replacement field.There's also a similar table in the format specification section.I understand portions of the table, like the ::= separates the definiendum and definien, characters inside quotes are literals, and the | means "or", but the rest of the table escapes me. 
This kind of formatting is what's known as Backus-Naur Form. More information found on BNF here. Basically, BNF is a set of derivation rules.Defining the symbols:Anything other than the meta symbols ::=, |, and class names in closed in <,> are symbols of the language being defined (e.g. This Python example)The meta symbols ::= is to be interpreted as "is defined as"The | is used to separate alternative definitions and is interpreted as "or"The meta symbols <,> are delimiters enclosing a class name. A little bit of dissecting this example to get you started:replacement_field consists of an optional field_name, optional conversion and optional format_spec. The brackets ( the [ and ]'s ) indicate optional parameters.If you do pass in field_name to replacement_field, it consists of an arg_name function in which you pass attribute_name or element_index. Note element_index is mandatory because the brackets are in quotation marks, and thus escaping BNF form for optional.
