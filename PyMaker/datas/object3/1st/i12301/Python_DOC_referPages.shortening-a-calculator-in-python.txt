I have managed to create a small calculator in Python, but I am trying to shorten the code unsucsessfully. Can anyone help please?I am not able to do two operations at once either.
Use functions from the operator module or simple functions you define yourself to the calculation work, then map the operation name from the queencommand string to those functions:operator.add could be replaced by lambda a, b: a + b, etc. if you don't want to use a module for those operations.
Here is a fully fledged calculator. See if it helps:
