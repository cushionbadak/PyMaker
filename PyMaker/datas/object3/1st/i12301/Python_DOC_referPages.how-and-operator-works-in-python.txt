Could you please explain me how and works in python?I know when In interpreteroutput gives FALSEbut,output is TRUEhow does it work?what to do in such case where in my program I have to enter if condition only when both the values are there in the list?
This lines are equivalent toSince bool(1) is True, it's like writingnow since 5 is not in lis, we're getting True and False, which is False.
Despite lots of arguments to the contrary,meansIt does not mean:The page that Maroun Maroun linked to in his comments indicates that and has a lower precedence than in.You can test it like this:If this means (0 and 1) in [0] then it will evaluate to true, because 0 is in [0].If it means 0 and (1 in [0]) then it will evaluate to 0, because 0 is false.It evaluates to 0.
Your statement 1 and 5 in lis is evaluated as follows:and 6 and 1 in lis  is evaluated like this:The last statement evaluates to true as any number other than 0 is trueIn any case, this is the wrong approach to verify if multiple values exist ina list. You could use the all operator for this post:
