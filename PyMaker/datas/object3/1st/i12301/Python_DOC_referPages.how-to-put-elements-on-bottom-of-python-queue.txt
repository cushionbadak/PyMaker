I've a queue that is populated by different threads.I've a thread where I get items from the queue and I send them to another destination. When the last operation fails I want to put again the elements in the queue, but in the bottom of the queue because I want that the dequeuer Thread dequeue them as first priority. Is there a way to do that? Maybe using other class instead of Queue.queue?
How about a deque?Deques support thread-safe, memory efficient appends and pops from either side of the deque with approximately the same O(1) performance in either direction.
Here's an implementation -- it's basically Queue.put method with self._put(item) replaced by self.queue.appendleft(item)
