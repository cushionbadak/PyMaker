I am using Python v2.x Windows 64bit.The question is, I would like to extract a number (102) from a list, but I can only get a part of if.Here is a list: How to extract the speed of LeftWheel_Speed (102)?I tried data[9][-2], but what I get is ‘2’ rather than ‘102’.
Using re.search and a regex pattern, you can extract the integer value from the string.Here, re.search(r'\d+', data[9]) will return a match if data[9] has any decimal characters. Then retrieving this decimal characters using .group(0) and finally convert them to integer, using int() built-in method
Use iterable[start:end] to get a subset of them.Another thing you can do is, if you want to get a single integer from a string, is something along the lines of (python2.x):In Python3, filter returns a filter object which is an iterable. You can turn it into a list and join them for the same functional result.Note that this does not take into account separated numbers. For example, s = "123test456" will return 123456. If you want them separated, you will need to use something a bit more clever.Again, in python3, map returns a map object, so you just have to convert it to a list.
If all the items in the list that contain a single , can be considered key-value pairs, you can turn the data into a dictionary. That makes it easy to access the values that you are interested in.
at index 9 in the list the element is a string 'LeftWheel_Speed,102\r', [-1] will display the '\r' character, and thus [-2] will display the 2.  A string in python is list type, so you are looking at the second to last character. you need to split the string for each data element like:which first splits the string into 2 strings at the comma and print 102, but beware it still contains the \r character which you might want to remove:[:-1] will slice off the last character of the string (which is a list so you can do list slicing)EDIT: as commented below, '102\r'.strip() would be a more complete answer to removing special characters as it would remove them all
You can split it on ',' and display the second string
