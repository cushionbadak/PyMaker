I need multiple threads to access this heapq. So I want to make sure to conduct such operations using heapq.
No, using the heapq library is not threadsafe. Use a lock to coordinate access.Note that the library documentation links to the source code; you can always take a look yourself to see how it behaves. You'll see that the module operates on a regular Python list and there is no locking code.If all you want is a priority queue, then look no further than the Queue.PriorityQueue() class (renamed to queue.PriorityQueue in Python 3). It is fully thread-safe.
