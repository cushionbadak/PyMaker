this is perhaps a very simple questionI have a list that looks like this:I am struggling to find a simple python code that replaces when n or less consecutive 1s are found to 0s and creates a new list with the new valuesSo ifb = [0,0,0,2,3,2,0,2,0,3,4,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,4,5,1,1,1,3,2,0,2,0,0,3,4,0]ifn = 3b = [0,0,0,2,3,2,0,2,0,3,4,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,4,5,0,0,0,3,2,0,2,0,0,3,4,0] I have highlighted the new replaces values in each example
"One"-liner, using some itertools:groupby groups the initial list into groups of identical objects. Its output is an iterator of pairs (k, g) where k is the element that is the grouping key and g is an iterator producing the actual elements in the group.Since you cannot call len on an iterator, this listifies the groups and chains the resulting lists except lists of 1 of the appropriate lengthes. Those are replaced by lists of 0 of the same length.In single steps (using intermediate lists instead of generators):
You can try this:Output:
Non-oneliner using itertools.groupby():
Try this:
Longer than others, but arguably straightforward:
