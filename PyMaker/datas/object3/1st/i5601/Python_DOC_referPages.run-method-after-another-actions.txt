1. SummaryI don't understand, how I can run Python method after another actions.2. FileExample of my .py file:3. Expected algoritm3.1. Tests passedIf all tests passed, print to console:3.2. Tests failedIf, for example, one of my tests failure for SashaExample.txt:print First test failure for SashaExample.txt;continue first test for another files;if there are more errors as First test failure for AnotherExample.txt, print errors to console and continue test;exit(1) after running all tests.I need exit(1), that I can see, that I have errors in my tests, if I use Travis CI or AppVeyor.4. Not helped4.1. exit(1) after elseIf:Program end after first error. But I need to see all errors.4.2. Another attemptsI don't find, how I can solve my problem, in Google;I read about Python functions, methods, atexit, but I don't understand, how I can solve this problem.
This is a simple programming concept called FLAGS. Google it a bit and you will see is quite simple.
The problem appears to be that you need to call exit(1) at the end of the program if there were any failures.  If that is the case, you can use a variable, say failureFound, initialized to False (because you haven't found any yet) and set to True whenever you find a failure.  Then, at the end of the program, if failureFound is true, call exit(1).
