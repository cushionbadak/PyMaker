This question already has an answer here:How can I make a for-loop pyramid more concise in Python? [duplicate]                    4 answers                Get the cartesian product of a series of lists?                    11 answers                I have this code:I want to sum each elements in lists. i.e. 11 + 33 + 77, 11 + 33 + 88, … 22 + 33 + 77, 22 + 33 + 88… and put all the sums into a final listI have these lines:The codes work well but looked clumsy. If there are 20  or more lists to take part in the calculation, it doesn’t looked good at all.Could you please show me a better way? 
This sort of combination is called the Cartesian product. You can get it using itertools.product.outputYou can even use product if you don't know in advance how many lists you have:The product iterator yields tuples of the items from the iterables that you pass it. We then pass those tuples to the built-in sum function to perform the addition.Here's what the "raw" output from product looks like:output
