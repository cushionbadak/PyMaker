I have a XML file which has to be parsed for the following conditions . G1, G22, G15 in section D1 From D4 section, extract PARAMCODE,    UNIT AND VALUE for all the IP INTERVAL only for "30-11-2017". Do not    hard code this date but store in a variable for comparisonCalculate Time value from INTERVAL value of IP section for the date.    for E.g. if interval = 1, TIME = 00:30:00 and increment by 30 min's.    If INTERVAL = 2, TIME = 01:00:00, if INTERVAL =3 TIME = 01:30:00 so    on.I am able to parse into its main directory but not able to deep down    further. Can anyone help me with this.This is something I tried.This is my input file looks like
Values can be obtained using XPath, like this (Linux command line, XPath works or python too) for PARAMCODE attributeOutput sample:Then you can do any calculation you want with those values.If you want interval=1, the XPath could be:
First of all, we need to add your missing closing tags:Now, you can use either the .find() or the .findall()method (.find() will return a single element, while .findall() will returnmultiple elements). The syntax for finding elements is a little weird, butthis should work:From here you can find your G values:Now to find your IP values:
