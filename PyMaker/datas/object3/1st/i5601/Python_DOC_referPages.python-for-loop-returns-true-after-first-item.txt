The variable I have for checker is a list of four string containing variables.I planned to use it as a 'checker' to see if all input values of another function contained only digits.Problem: If the first item in a_list is not a number, checker returns False as it should. However, if the first item is a number while any others in the list aren't, checker returns True anyways. This causes the next function to proceed with the non-number variables and results in an error.How do I make it so my function checks the entire list before returning True?Or if need be, how do I make a new function that does what I'm looking for?Thanks
There are usefull built-in fuctions all (and any) for checking multiple conditions:
Don't return True in the loop. In the loop return False if an item is NOT a digit. Move return True after the loop has completed.
I'm assuming you want to check that all elements of a_list return True as a return value from isdigit().In this case, use the built-in function all all(str(s).isdigit() for s in a_list)for more information on any and all, check out this link on SO: any and all explainededit: thanks @RoadRunner for pointing out conversion to str as OP had it in it's example he gave.
This should check if all items in the list are digits
