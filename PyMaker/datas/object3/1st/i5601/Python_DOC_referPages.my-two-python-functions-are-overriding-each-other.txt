If I input all upper case letters I get this output:If I input all lower case letters I get this output:The password needs capital letters for a higher score   5   LOWERCASEThese results I am happy with.THE PROBLEM IS when I combine uppercase and lowercase letters I get this result:1) Even though there are both uppercase and lowercase letters the score is still 5 instead of 10.  2) The regex for uppercase letters stops working even though there are uppercase letters in the string.  Thank you!!! I hope I explained this well.
re.match looks for the characters at the BEGINNING of the given string. Use re.search instead. See also search() vs. match().
BriefYou don't even need regex for this. Python has isupper() and islower() functions available.CodeSee code in use here
