This question already has an answer here:Can't install modules 'os' and 'os.path'                    1 answer                I'm trying to install the os python module on Windows.In a cmd console, I typed:C:\Users\username> pip install osCollecting os  Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement os (from versions: )No matching distribution found for osSo I guessed the module was not available on Windows for some reasons, but I found references of it in some SO questions.Obviously, typing Windows and os in Google only gives me answers about Windows itself.So, how can I install the os module on Windows ?
OS is python's standard library. So no need to download it.
