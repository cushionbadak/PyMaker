Here is my code for a simple coin toss program, I am new to python.I am not getting any Errors, but the program will not print my "if" statements, it skips straight from input too input.I am sure there is more intuitve ways to generate a coin toss program, this was just the idea I had.Any thoughts? Here is a screenshot of my code.
Like the name randint already suggests, random.randint(1,2) returns an integer between 1 and 2 (both inclusive).If you perform 1 == '1' you compare an int with a str, which is always False. You should compare with 1 instead of '1'.You can also drop the elif, and use else, since we know that it will be 2 if it is not 1, so:
random.randint(1,2) returns the value of integer type. random.randint(a,b) document clearly says that it:Returns a random integer N such that a <= N <= b.But in your if you are comparing it against the value of string type, and hence your conditional statements are failing.You need to modify your conditional statements as:
