(Python 3.6)I have this folder structure:submodule.py:__ init __.py:start.py:I understand how and whyworks.But I don't understand why:also works, if I have not done:Nor:Neither in __ init __.py nor in start.pyThank you very much if anyone may clear my doubt.
When issuing from subpackage.submodule import subfunc, python does two things for you: one, search and evaluate the module named subpackage.submodule, put it into sys.modules cache; two, populate subpackage.submodule.subfunc object and bind name "subfunc" to the namespace of the current module:The import statement combines two operations; it searches for the named module, then it binds the results of that search to a name in the local scope.When importing subpackage.submodule, parent of submodule also got imported:While certain side-effects may occur, such as the importing of parent packages, and the updating of various caches (including sys.modules) ...On the last stage of importing subpackage.submodule, python would set the module as an attribute on its parent subpackage, this behavior is documented:When a submodule is loaded using any mechanism (e.g. importlib APIs, the import or import-from statements, or built-in __import__()) a binding is placed in the parent moduleâ€™s namespace to the submodule object.
If I'm getting this right, you have a folder called "package" in which there are 2 things: a .py file and another folder called "subpackage".Inside "subpackage" you have __init__.py and submodule.py which the latter contains a function that just prints "This is submodule".Now, when you call import subpackage, you call and "pull" everything that's inside "subpackage", including submodule and therefore, the subfunc() function.When you write subpackage.submodule.subfunc() there's really nothing amazing going there, you just call the mainfolder/container (subpackage.), then the .py file (submodule.) and finally the function itself (subfunc() ).
