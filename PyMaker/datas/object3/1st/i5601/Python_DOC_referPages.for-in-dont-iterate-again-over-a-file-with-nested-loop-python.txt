This question already has an answer here:Why can't I call read() twice on an open file?                    7 answers                I have a users.txt and password.txt and i need to iterate in both filesExample of users.txt:rootadminoracleusersExample of password.txttoorroootadministratorpasswordIn my loop just print the first user "root" and all of the password but dont print the others users, this is my code:This is the output but don't iterate over the others users What it's wrong?Username: root Password: 123456Username: root Password: 12345678Username: root Password: 12345678Username: root Password: 1234Username: root Password: passUsername: root Password: passwordAnd i need this output example:root: 123456root:passwordroot:tooradmin:123456admin:passwordadmin:toor
You are iterating over all the passwords with the inner loop on the first iteration of the outer loop. On the second iteration of the outer loop, there are no more passwords to iterate (fp's current position is at the end of the file). You could fp.seek(0) to reset fp after each user iteration:Or you could read the passwords once into a list:There's a tradeoff between file access and memory usage here. 
You have a nested for loop, which reads passwords (in the internal loop), for each users (in the external loop). What happened now, your external loop read first user (root), and the internal read all password, and print them together with root.  When your external loops tries to process second user, your password file is already reaching the end, nothing is printed.You need to read lines of these files separately, store it in an array and print later.Better yet, just use paste : https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/234208/combining-several-files-into-a-single-csv
