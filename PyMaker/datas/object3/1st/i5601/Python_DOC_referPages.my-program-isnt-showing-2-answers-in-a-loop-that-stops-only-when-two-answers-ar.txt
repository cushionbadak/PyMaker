I am trying to build a BlackJack game. The program starts, and uses the random module to generate 2 different numbers which tells you which card you have. Number 1 is the value, e.g. 8Number 2 is the suit, e.g. 4 = SpadesThe program gives me 2 cards sometimes, and the other half the time it gives me one card. Question: Why is this program not working as desired?
The problem here is your if-statements.If any card is a 9 or a 10, while the other card is not, then you will end up with only a single card.The reason for this is because a 9 or a 10 is not handled by any of your if-statements, but are excluded. Since the while-loop ends if any if-statement has been True, you end up with a single card.So, to follow your coding closely, I think it should be the following:EDIT: However, on how to improve the coding in itself, Patrick Artner's answer is very useful.
You could declare your lists fully: And create a full deck of them:To draw a card:Outputs:is called a list comprehension. It is a way to construct lists from stuff - i.e. ranges, other lists, iterators, ...Basic syntax : newList = [ str(x) for x in range(0,10)] will use the inbuilt range(0,10) which creates numbers from 0 to 9 and makes them a string and built a list from it - Link to doku:  https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensionsI build tuples (card, typ) for each element in cards (your list) and types your other list).You could use this deck and shuffle() it once, and then deck.pop() cards from it (faster, only one shuffling needed) or draw a random card every time random.choice(deck) and then remove it from the deck.See Lists for methods on a list.See buildins - you find the range() in that list and can get more infos.
