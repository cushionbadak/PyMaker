I am new to Python and OOP. For some reason I have some troubles to understand OOP  and not sure when to use class (objects) and when dictionaries.I have a file in following format:...Any advice how to create a class where my objecs will be items in 1st column and propertiers/attributes in 2-4 columns? TI am able to do this with dict but not sure how to use class here?Any guidlelines pls?ZDZ
From my experience, classes are best used when they have to do something; this is when you define methods/functions for them. if you're just wanting to store the data then using dictionaries is fine. i use multidimensional dicts in a lot of my code to keep it organized. unless there is something to be done, i stick with dicts.
