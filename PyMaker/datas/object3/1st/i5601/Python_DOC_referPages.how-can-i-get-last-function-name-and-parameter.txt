Such as:I want get the message:
Not sure why you want to do this, but the module inspect can help here:Output:
First of all, since you specifically stated that you use Python 3, I have to comment that your syntax is incorrect. Parenthesis are required for print(a) since Python 3 changed print to a function. Also, there should be a double equal sign in the second to last line, because you are checking an equality.This code should work perfectly fine:where you can assign anything you want to a before printing it.EDIT: After looking at the question again, I am quite unsure why you would expect/want the output to be "A(a)". You pass a function that is called A() to function B(), usually to do something with it.You can get the name of the function A() out by rewriting B to:However, as far as I know, there is no way for function B() to know which parameters function A() can take in this scenario.
