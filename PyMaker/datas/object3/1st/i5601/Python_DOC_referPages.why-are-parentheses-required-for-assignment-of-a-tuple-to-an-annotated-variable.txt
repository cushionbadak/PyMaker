When I have a line that looks like this:… I get a SyntaxError, but when I do this:… it's valid.Is this intentional? Is there an ambiguity in the parse tree with a type specifier and no parens?
It is intentional. In the original proposal for variable annotations on the python-ideas mailing list, Guido van Rossum writes:… and then, in the relevant GitHub issue: Multiple types/variablesAn obvious question is whether to allow combining type declarations  with tuple unpacking (e.g. a, b, c = x). This leads to (real or  perceived) ambiguity, and I propose not to support this. If there's a  type annotation there can only be one variable to its left, and one  value to its right. This still allows tuple packing (just put the  tuple in parentheses) but it disallows tuple unpacking. (It's been  proposed to allow multiple parenthesized variable names, or types  inside parentheses, but none of these look attractive to me.)
