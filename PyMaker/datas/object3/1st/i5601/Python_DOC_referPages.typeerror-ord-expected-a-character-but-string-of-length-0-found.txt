Natural Text
I was given this school project, which goal is to take a picture, apply the RLE method in order to compress it in a binary file (.txt), and save some space. And after struglling with it for 3 days now I'm having troubles.When I execute the pgrm, it gives me this error written in the tittle. Which is something I feel like impossible to correct, since it is writting itself in hex.Here's further information :A pixel is not coded here using bytes, like we usually do on format such as .bmp.Here RLE will search for identic pixel on a same lign, and count how many times it encounters it, by comparing 3 levels colors. Finally it stores in two additional bytes than the RGB ones : a and b.a is for the number of pixels.b is the number of 255 stacks of pixels. (Since I'm coding data into 8bits and that pictures are usually larger than 255*255 size) 
Your file is too short, your ran out of data. file.read(..) returns an empty string when the EOF is found. Perhaps your remaining bytes should just be left at 0?You are reading your data extremely inefficiently. Use the struct module to unpack your data into integers, and create a single long numpy array of (R, G, B) triplets, then reshape the data to form your image matrix:That said, using your sample file data I can't seem to construct a coherent image. Decompression produces data for 695046 pixels, which doesn't make for a coherent rectangular image (the highest short dimension that numbers factors into is 66, so extremely elongated). Even allowing for missing data at the end I can't seem to find any aspect ratio that produces a coherent image. The conclusion is that your input data is incomplete or incorrect.
