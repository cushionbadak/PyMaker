Natural Text
I want to open a text file and use  splitHere is the code I wrote at first:and here is another code I wrote because the first code I wrote didn't work:what is the difference between "r" and .read()?
The .read() function is for reading data from a file; So the file should be in read mode and the read mode is 'r' that you asked. So 'r'is Mode for File and .read() is a function for reading data.
read() is the actual function that does the reading of any "path-like object," returning a "file-like object" (this is due to the principle of duck typing). You can optionally pass it a parameter, which is a single character, indicating what "mode" to open the path-like object. Look at the signature for read():You can see that the default mode is 'r', thus, if you do not specify a mode, it will default to 'r' anyways, so including 'r' as you did is generally redundant.The documentation is here
The r, You can think of it as the purpose of opening a file. if you open a file with r, and then you can't do write with the handler! You should got some error as :read() just a way which you can got your data from file handler! there are also have readline() available.
