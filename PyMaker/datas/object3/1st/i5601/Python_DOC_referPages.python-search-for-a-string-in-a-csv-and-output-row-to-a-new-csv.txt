*Please note I am new to Python....I am attempting to write a script for a large CSV file. My aim is to search (like grep) the 2nd column of the CSV for a complex phrase containing a string, followed by a special character and then integer eg "Mainbalance-7-0" or "Mainbalance-8-0"The string is always 'Mainbalance".The special characters are always "-". The integer changes. If found the phrase is found, I want to output the whole row to a new csv file. I have looked at other answers on here but cant find the specifics of this.The input looks like:BAL,04,PSMS-5-13,0,BUCKET,WORDBAL,03,Mainbalance-6-0,36,MAIN,WORDBAL,020,PLUSC-122-0,36,MAIN,WORDBAL,05,Mainbalance-7-0,36,MAIN,WORDFor output to be:BAL,03,Mainbalance-6-0,36,MAIN,WORDBAL,05,Mainbalance-7-0,36,MAIN,WORDI have tried the below... With the file created with NO results printed. 
You should be iterating over the reader object as Stephen pointed out in comments and checking the third column of each row. Then, if checking a column value to start with Mainbalance is reliable enough, you can use str.startswith():Or, if a more detailed check is required, we can create a regular expression pattern like Mainbalance-\d+-\d+ where \d+ would match one or more digits:
The code does not work since 'Mainbalance*' is not a RegexChange the code by removing the star, then the code works.
