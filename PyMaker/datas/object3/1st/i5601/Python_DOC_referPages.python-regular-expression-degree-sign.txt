Natural Text
I came across the code below and I am wondering what the small circle/degree sign means. The code is supposed to extract text between Item 1A and Item B. Thank you!
The degree symbol, ° is treated as a literal character to be matched. Your input probably looks like this:So your regular expression starts its match at °Item1A and continues through the first subsequent °Item.
