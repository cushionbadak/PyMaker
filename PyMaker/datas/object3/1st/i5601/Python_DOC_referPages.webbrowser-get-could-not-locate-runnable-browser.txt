I am trying to access the internet with Google Chrome but every time I use webbrowser.open(url) it opens IE.So I checked to make sure I have Chrome as my default, which I do, and I tried using the get() function to link the actual Chrome application but it gives me this error instead:File "C:\Users\xxx\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python36\lib\webbrowser.py", line 51, in get raise Error("could not locate runnable browser") webbrowser.Error: could not locate runnable browserI also tried to open other browsers but it gives the same error. It also reads IE as my default and only runnable browser.What could be happening? Is there an alternative?Using Python 3.6.
I too faced the same problem. What you can do is to register the browser and then launch a new tab. Something like this:And it works. From the docs webbrowser.register(name, constructor, instance=None).
