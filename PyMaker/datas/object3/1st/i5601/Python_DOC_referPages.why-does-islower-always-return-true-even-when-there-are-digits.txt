This piece of code uses isdigit() and islower() which both check if a string includes only numbers (isdigit) or only lowercase letters (islower). If the string given through password contains only numbers or lowercase letters the value should return true and print only numbers if the string only contains numbers or only letters if the string contains only letters, which it does.However if the password contains numbers and letters for example "12345qwerty" it should return the value false, and go onto the elif statement to check if it has a number or letter included to say add 5 points, and if it still doesn't then it will say try again but it doesn't. It still returns the value as True and print the if statements argument which doesn't make sense, since the password "12345qwerty" contain both letters and numbers and should be returned as false.
str.islower() returns true when there are no uppercase letters in the string and there is at least one lowercase letter. That's not the same thing as all characters being letters.A string with a mix of letters and numbers produces True as well, provided all letters are lowercase:This is clearly documented:Return true if all cased characters [4] in the string are lowercase and there is at least one cased character, false otherwise.[4] Cased characters are those with general category property being one of “Lu” (Letter, uppercase), “Ll” (Letter, lowercase), or “Lt” (Letter, titlecase).If you wanted to test if there were only letters, use str.isalpha():You can combine that with str.islower() to test if there are only lowercase letters:
You can use any to determine if the string has booth numbers and letters and build your cases around that function:
