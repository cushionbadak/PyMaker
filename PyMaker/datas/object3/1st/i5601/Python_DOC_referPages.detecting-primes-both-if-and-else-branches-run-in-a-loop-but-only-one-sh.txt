This question already has an answer here:What is the best algorithm for checking if a number is prime?                    27 answers                Debugging a Python Prime Number Program                    5 answers                This code runs fine if I enter an even but acts abnormal when I input an odd or prime integer. It identifies composite accurately. Irrespective of prime or composite odd it prints  PRIME many times.(sometimes twice or thrice).The output is like:I think I have done some indentation error or implemented while loop incorrectly.please help.This question is not just about an algorithm for primality test but this addresses an implementation problem.
You print "PRIME" as soon as the current i does not n, but you should only output "PRIME" if no i divides n. You can do it like this:
You need to exit the loop when a factor is found, and print that the number is prime only after all factors have been tested. So your loop should look more like this:Note that the else lines up with the for, not with the if.
