Natural Text
I have the following code when writing to a text file:Now the code is doing what I want it to (writing to a new line every time), however if I wanted to write every list to the same line in the text file how would I do this using the print method as used above? I know I could use file.write, but how do I remove the newline character in the print statement? Slightly hypothetical but it was bugging me.
You can set the end parameter of print to be an empty string (or some other character):From the docs, you can see that it defaults to a newline:print(*objects, sep=' ', end='\n', file=sys.stdout, flush=False)Print objects to the text stream file, separated by sep and followed by end. sep, end, file and flush, if present, must be given  as keyword arguments.This is what is being printed to the file currently.
If you are using python 2.x, you can do the following:If using pytnon 3.x, you can do this:Check print documentation.
