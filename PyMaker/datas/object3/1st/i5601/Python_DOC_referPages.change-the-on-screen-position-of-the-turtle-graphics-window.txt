Is it possible to change the position of the turtle console on screen?My main objective is to write code that can move the window, that's all.I'm using Python 3.4.0 under Windows 10.If any extra information is needed please ask.
Why do folks always jump into tkinter before reading the turtle documentation?Yes, you can set the screen position of the turtle graphics window using the same setup() method you use to size it:startx, if positive, is the starting position in pixels from the left edge of the screen, or from the right edge if negative.  Similarly, starty, if positive, is the starting position from the top edge of the screen, or from the bottom edge if negative.  By default, the window is centered on the screen.Your title asks about the position of the Turtle Graphics window on the screen but the body of your question asks about the Turtle Console.  These might be considered two different windows.My main objective is to write code that can move the windowI can't tell if you just want to set the initial position of the window or actually move the window around the screen so I rewrote my example to demonstrate the later.
Yes. You need to get the root window that contains the Tkinter Canvas that the turtle is using as its TurtleScreen. Once you have that window you can change its geometry. Here's a simple demo.
