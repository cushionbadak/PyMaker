I got an errorMy code is the followingTraceback says a code of cv2.imwrite~ is wrong. I really cannot understand why this is wrong. Is this type of path error? Or am I wrong to use this method? How should I fix this?
If you look through your type error, it's actually because you're trying to use the + operator on a PosixPath type and a str. You'll need to convert the PosixPath to a string before you can use the imwrite.Maybe try:Alternatively, use the proper concatenation as described in the pathlib docs.
You cannot using operan + in PosixPath, but using /
