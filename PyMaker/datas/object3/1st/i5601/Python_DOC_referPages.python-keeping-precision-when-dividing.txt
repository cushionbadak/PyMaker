I need to divide 2 integers and display the result to at least 76 digits of accuracy. For example, when I divide 1 by 3, I need to display 0.33333333333... with 76 "3"s. When I divide in python and make it display 76 digits after the decimal point, it doesn't give me enough digits of precision, that is, some digits are wrong. I did:This gave me the result of: 0.3333333333333333148296162562473909929394721984863281250000000000000000000000, which is obviously not equal to 1/3. I am using python 3. Is there any better way of dividing and displaying decimal digits? Any help would be greatly appreciated!
