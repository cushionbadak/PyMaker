I'm trying to create a cartesian product list of all possible combinations between two lists, made from a master list.  But passing the "master_list" into the cartesian product function. I want the results:(0, 0)(0, 1)(0, 2)(0, 3)(0, 4)(1, 0)(1, 1)(1, 2)(1, 3)(1, 4)This works (below) in displaying desired results:However, this doesn't work (below), and this is what I really need.  The "master_list" list might be comprised of multiple lists dynamically.  What am I missing here?:The list "master_list" is being created dynamically within the code, so I can't type something like this below.  This example also works to show what I need.
You need to unpack it.
