I am writing a simple package in python. In the root directory, my structure currently is,my_packageinit.pymain_code.pytestsinit.pytest_main_code.pyI want to import all functions from  main_code.py in test_main_code.py. To achieve this, I didThis runs smoothly on my system. But when I push the code to github and tests are run on travis-ci, all tests fail and return NameError. It says given function name not defined. How do I make sure that tests run on travis-ci as well ?
Paths could be different if you run the test somewhere else, so I wouldn't trust any import related to a particular location.In any case, I always try to run the tests from the root of the project.Then, you can simply try:from my_package.main_code import *
