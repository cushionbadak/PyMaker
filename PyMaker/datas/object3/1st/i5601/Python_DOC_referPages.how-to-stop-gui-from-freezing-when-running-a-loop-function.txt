I am trying to add threading to a Python 3.63 Tkinter program where a function will run but the GUI will still be responsive, including if the user wants to close the program while the function is running.In the example below I have tried to run a simple printing to console function on a separate thread to the GUI mainloop so the user could click the X in the top right to close the program while the loop is running if they so wish.The error I am getting is:TypeError: start() takes 1 positional argument but 2 were given
See doc threading - start() doesn't use arguments but you use .start(self.count_to_1500) - and this gives your error. You could use or if you define EDIT: working example with thread which put in quoue and method which get data from queue.
Thread.start takes no parameters:  https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.htmlThe correct way to use a Thread is:The join is important. Without it you will have many zombie threads in your app, which will also prevent your app from shutting down cleanly.Another pattern is to use a daemon thread, which processes a queue. daemon threads are automatically killed when the program exits.To run several tasks at the same time, start many threads.Yet another method, use multiprocessing.pool.ThreadPool... which works, more or less, as the above.I recommend reading:https://docs.python.org/2/library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing-programming
