I would like to know how i can iterate through a list containing lists in python, however i would like to use the for loop method that uses index rather than iterating the normal way in python. is it possible to do that?here is the python code:this is the error I get in the console:what is the error in my code ?thanks in advance.
outer and inner are both ints. Thus, len(outer) is bound to fail:It is easier not to use indexes at all:Moreover, for flattening a list of lists, there are many well-documented approaches, a straightforward one being a nested comprehension like:For more, you can refer to Making a flat list out of list of lists in Python and Flatten (an irregular) list of lists.
Here the loop with indexes using enumerate.idx and idx2 are the current index of the for loops
In addition to the other answers, there is the standard library solution using itertools.Or (possibly) more explicitlyIf you just need the flattened 'list' to be iterable, you can omit the list call and use the returned itertools.chain object.
