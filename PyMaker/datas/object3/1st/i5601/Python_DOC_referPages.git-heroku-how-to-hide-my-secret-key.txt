Im using Python and Django to create a Heroku web app and Heroku gives me this error after the command 'git push heroku master': ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dlist.secret_settings' when attempting to do this:Here is what secret_settings.py (which is in the same folder as settings.py) contains:The problem is, this works when I test my web app on my local server (ie http://127.0.0.1:8000/), but its not working when I push these changes to Heroku. All I want to do is hide my SECRET_KEY, per others advice, as you can see. Ive looked at others suggestions and I can't seem to figure it out, choosing this method because it was understandable. Very frustrating. Beginner friendly answers/steps are greatly appreciated.  
I'm guessing you've configured Git to ignore secret_settings.py. That's the only reason I can think of to create a separate file.Heroku deploys are powered by Git. Since secret_settings.py isn't tracked by Git it doesn't get pushed to Heroku. You could add the file to your repository, but that would defeat the purpose of having a separate untracked file in the first place.The solution is to use an environment variable. This is well-supported on Heroku.In your settings.py file, set your SECRET_KEY using os.getenv() like this:This tells Django to load your SECRET_KEY setting from an environment variable called SECRET_KEY. If no such environment variable exists it will fall back to the optional default value. On your development machine it's probably fine to use the default.Finally, set the SECRET_KEY environment variable on Heroku. You can do this by running heroku config:set SECRET_KEY="YOUR_SECRET_KEY_VALUE" on your development machine, or via Heroku's web-based dashboard.Your secret_settings.py file is no longer required.
