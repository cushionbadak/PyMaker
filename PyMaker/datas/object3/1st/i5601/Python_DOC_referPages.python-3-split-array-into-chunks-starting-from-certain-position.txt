I have a python array of shape (19, 73984) - this represents 19 gray flatten images of 272 x 272px size. I want to be able to process this and feed it into a feed forward neural network but I want to be able to feed it in batches.I expect to have some kind of a function that will be ran in a for loop. That function should receive the dataset array, batch size and also the iteration's index value in order to know how many items should return and from which position. ex: def get_batch_data(i, dataset, batch_size):where i is a for loop iteration index that will be used to return a chunk of data starting for a certain position until the dataset is looped over.Is there a better way to do this or can you help me with this?Thanks!
Testdata:Easiest would probably be islice() from itertools:Doku: islice() which takes your list, a start value , an stop value and a stepper - and does what you want as one-liner.You could also leverage itertools.compress with a sliding True window for the elements you want: Compress only returns values from the first list that evaluate to True in the second list - the second list is build in a way that only the wanted elements evaluate to TrueDoku: compressOr do all by hand using slicing for the big array like this:Use like this:
