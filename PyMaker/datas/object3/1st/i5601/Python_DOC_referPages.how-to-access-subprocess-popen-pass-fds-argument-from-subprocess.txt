So the title is a bit long but it is the only thing I cannot find online, with a little bit searching. How do I access the pass_fds argument from subprocess? 
You need to explicitly inform the child of the fds passed in some way. The most common/simple mechanisms would be:Via an environment variable set for the childVia an argument passed to the child(Less common, but possible) Written to the child's stdinAll of these require the child's cooperation of course; it needs to define an interface to inform it of the fds passed.openssl's command line tool supports all these mechanisms for a similar purpose (communicating a passphrase to the child without putting it on the command line). You pass -pass and a second argument that defines where to look for the password. If the second argument is stdin, it reads from stdin, if it's -pass fd:# (where # is the fd number) it reads from an arbitrary file descriptor provided, -pass env:var (where var is the name of an environment variable) reads from the environment, etc.
Well maybe it's not the best technical answer but I wanted to dig about file descriptors. Following your question I made this two scripts. Os creates pipe and parent sends descriptors to child by pass_fds tuple. More info in python docs , os.read() description. After that parent's fdw is pushed as bytes to child proc and then used to send back some answer.Hope it helps.edit: Found this post in google forums.
