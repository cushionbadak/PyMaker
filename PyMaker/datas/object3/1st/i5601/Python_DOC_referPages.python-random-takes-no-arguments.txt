I am attempting to create nxn matrices which contain random variables between 0 and 1. I am created the following code (default of matrice size is 10x10): I am getting the error: random() takes no arguments (1 given). I have read the forum and I am not sure .choice is the way forward. How have I screwed up?
random method does not take arguments.If you would like to generate range of numbers between 0 to 1. Then you could do,Or with numpy.
Error is kind of explicit, but you can also check the random.random() doc.As you can see, random.random() does not expect any argument, but you given one (param.matrix_size).If you wants a random integer between two integers, uses random.randint() like random.randint(0, params.matrix_size)
