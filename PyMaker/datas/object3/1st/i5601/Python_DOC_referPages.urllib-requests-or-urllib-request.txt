under "urlib" library whether we have 'requests' module or 'request' moduleWhen running the below codeshell is throwing the warningwhen i do thiswhich shell successfully imports the requests modulebut when I change the above code toshell throws the error messageand pip tool installs both the modules (request, requests) successfully
urllib is a module one it own, same thing for requests. you do : It's urllib.request not urllib.requests and it explains the error the python interpreter is giving you. Here's the docs for urllibAs for the first shell error you're getting, python is already giving you a hint as how to solve it.So, instead of : You should do this : 
Just use requests module, this is not a built-in module but a third party library.By the way that warning you have has nothing to do with request(s) library, but it is with the BeautifulSoup parser.
