In key frames in Camera resectioning, I am trying to create a list of points that appears in a frame and then try to create a list containing the corresponding points in the following frames to keep tracking the points along the video to find the K matrix between them.I have the following class to store the points from each frame and to create a list of points for each frame and tracking them along all frames.when I try to run this code to store the points inside it, I got the following error:Traceback (most recent call last):   File "main.py", line 4, in        import pointTracking   File "/home/k/Desktop/CV/project/insertc/project12345/pointTracking.py",  line 17actually I don't know why I got that error, and I tried many things to check the python syntax styles.I am using python 3.4 
Variable annotations are new in Python 3.6, see e.g. what's new and PEP-526; you will need to upgrade to use this syntax. Note that you're assigning values, not annotating types, to the other two class attributes; this is presumably unintentional.
