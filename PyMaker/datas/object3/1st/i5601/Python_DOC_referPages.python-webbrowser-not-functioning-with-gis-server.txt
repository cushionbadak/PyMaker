I am trying to write a code that will download all the data from a server which holds the .rar files about imaginary cadastrial particles for student projects. What I got for now is the query for the server which only needs to input a specific number of particle and access it as url to download the .rar file. This is the "url" I want to open with the web browser module for a particle "1900/1" but this way I get an error: This XML file does not appear to have any style information associated with it. The document tree is shown below.When I manually input this url it downloads the file without a problem.What is the way I can make this python web application work?I used a webbrowser.open_new(url) option which does not work.
You're using the wrong tool. webbrowser is for controlling a native web browser. If you just want to download a file, use the requests module (or urllib.request if you can't install Requests).Note requests will handle encoding GET parameters for you -- you don't need to worry about escaping the request yourself.
