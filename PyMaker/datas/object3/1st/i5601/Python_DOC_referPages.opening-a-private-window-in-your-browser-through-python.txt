I've found a way to open a tab using webbrowser but that's not really what I'm looking for as it really needs to be a private window (a private tab is fine too).:/ any ideas ?
For chrome, you can usedepending on your OS, chrome may be installed under a different name such as google-chrome or chrome-stable
