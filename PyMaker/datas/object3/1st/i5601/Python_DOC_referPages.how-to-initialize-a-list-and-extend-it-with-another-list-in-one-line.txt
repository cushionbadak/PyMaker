This question already has an answer here:How do I concatenate two lists in Python?                    30 answers                This sounds like a super easy question, so I'm surprised that searching didn't yield any results:  I want to initialize a list of constants and extend it with a list from another source.This works:Which means it gives the expected results:However, doing the list initialization in one line doesn't work, myList is left undefined:Is there a way to initialize the list and extend it with another list (in a pythonic way) in one line?  Why doesn't my one line example work, or at least produce some sort of list?
