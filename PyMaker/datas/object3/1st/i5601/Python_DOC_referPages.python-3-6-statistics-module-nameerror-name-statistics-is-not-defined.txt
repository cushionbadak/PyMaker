While learning to use "statistics module" in python 3.6 I am facing the following error: NameError: name 'statistics' is not definedI am just testing statistics basic functions which should return mean, median, mode, stdev, variance.I am new to Python and I can't find where the error is.Code: What am I doing wrong?
If I do this in IDLE, all works as expected.So I don't get the error you report at x = mean(example_list).You haven't reported your stack trace (why not?) so it's not possible for me to tell, but I suspect you have named your test program statistics.py, and that is hiding the real statistics module.
"from" module "import" * brings in all the names defined in __all__ if that exists and all names except for those starting with an underscore if __all__ doesn't exist.You don't need to qualify the names imported (that is, prefix them with statistics). Just used them directly, median, mode, stdev, variance.
