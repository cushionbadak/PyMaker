I'm trying to import the shapefile "Metropolin_31Jul_0921.shp" to python using the following code:but i keep getting this error:Does anyone know what it means?I tried adding the directory but it didn't help.
Make sure that the directory which the shapefile is located in, includes all of the supporting files such as .dbf, .shx, etc. the .shp will not work without these supporting files.
