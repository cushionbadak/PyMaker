Today I was hit with strange error in my script:I'm reading data from socket sock.recv and result is buff.decode('utf-8') where buff is the returned data. But today I found pretty much "unicorn" where one of the characters returned "▒" <-- this is what throw decode utf-8 into exception. Is there some pre process that would either remove or replace such a strange character?
There is a second parameter for .decode()  named errors. You can set it to 'ignore' to ignore all non-utf8 characters, or set it to 'replace' to replace them with the diamond question mark (�).
