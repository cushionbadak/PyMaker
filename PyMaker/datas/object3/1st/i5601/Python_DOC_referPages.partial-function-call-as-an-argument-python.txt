This question already has an answer here:Python: passing a function with parameters as parameter [duplicate]                    4 answers                Creating Python function with partial parameters                    1 answer                pass function to function with different number of variables                    2 answers                Pass a function as a variable with one input fixed                    4 answers                Is there any way a following code works?f2 function misses z. So, I want f1 to pass an argument, x, to f2 as z.I will appreciate any help.
Yes, this is what functools.partial is all about:partial takes as input a function f, an an arbitrary number of unnamed and named parameters. It constructs a new function where the unnamed and named parameters are filled in already.It is somewhat equivalent to:But functools will reduce the overhead significantly compared with the above implementation.
Another option showing  lambda expressions:Partial as shown by @Willem is more suited for your specific problem, but lambda expressions are good to know for flexibility - the expression can become much more complex then just a partial call.
