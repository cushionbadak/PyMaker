I was wondering if anyone has any ideas of how to convert the values contained in nested lists, so you end up with a list of a list of sets? e.g I have:I am trying to convert this so the 0 is {0}, 1 is {1}. i.e.:I currently have:I keep getting this error:Does anyone know how I can fix this?
set() takes the values from an iterable and adds each value separately. You passed in an int, which is not iterable at all.You would have to wrap your individual values in an iterable, like a list:A much easier option would be to use the {...} set literal notation:If the list doesn't need updating in place, you can also use a nested list comprehension to create a new list-of-lists-of-sets structure:If you must update in place, at least just iterate over the outer rows, and use enumerate() to generate the indices for the inner columns:If you have other references to the original list of lists, stick with with setting the values directly, otherwise use the list comprehensions. Both work:
You can pass each element in {} to create a set, otherwise you have to pass set() an iterable sequence, which a single integer is not.
