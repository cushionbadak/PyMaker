Natural Text
I'm new to regular expressions and would like to understand how findall() and lookahead can be used to find all occurrences of a given pattern within a string. I am having problems with alternating characters. Here is an example of what I want:Here is my attempt with findall():It only returns 2 matches but I want all three. I read this tutorial but did not quite understand. I triedCan someone please tell me how to use this lookahead concept in this case and provide a brief explanation of how it works?
I think you just need to search either there is an 'ab' and 'a' right after,You don't need to catch it as 'aba', you can use this look ahead:which gives you 3 matches.you can also capture it inside a group and then iterate each one of them and concatenate 'a' so you'll end with the desired text 'aba' for each match
Official doc about findall says it"Return a list of all non-overlapping matches in the string."
