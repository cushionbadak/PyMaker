Natural Text
I got an example of the usage of @property from this blog: https://tomayko.com/blog/2005/getters-setters-fuxors. After running below code from the article, I noticed that self.email and self._email are equal and don't know why?By executing the code step by step, I noticed that these two variables are always the same. How did this happen? I wonder what is the function behind it and support this. 
I am not sure to grasp what you are trying to do but The variable _setemail is mentionned two times but neither of them is mentionned for your output. Also look up the LEGB rule that might help you to understand what the program will prioritize.
