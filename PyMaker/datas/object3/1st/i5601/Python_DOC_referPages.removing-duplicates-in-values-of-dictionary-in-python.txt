Sorry the topic's title is vague, I find it hard to explain.I have a dictionary in which each value is a list of items. I wish to remove the duplicated items, so that each item will appear minimum times (preferable once) in the lists.Consider the dictionary:'weapon2' and 'weapon3' have the same values, so it should result in:since I don't mind the order, it can also result in:But when "there's no choice" it should leave the value. Consider this new dictionary:now, since it cannot assign either '2' or '3' only once without leaving a key empty, a possible output would be:I can relax the problem to only the first part and manage, though I prefer a solution to the two parts together

This is probably not the most efficient solution possible. Because it involves iteration over all possible combinations, then it'll run quite slow for large targets.It makes use of itertools.product() to get all possible combinations. Then in it, tries to find the combination with the most unique numbers (by testing the length of a set).From the examples:
this could help
