Natural Text
I'm new to python, so bear with me on this one.I want to make a script that searches within all excel files in a specific folder, to see if they contain an '@' sign. If it finds a match it should write to a log.txt files with the name of the excel file. I don't have the name of the excel files in advance.So far I'm stuck at just read in one file, and return true if it finds the string. What I got isThis returns the content of sheet1 in the excel file correctly, but the search to find a match, doesn't seem to work. Any ideas? Maybe Im doing it all wrong.
You should read through Pandas - Working with Text Data specifically the section on strings that match or contain a pattern.Unfortunately you cannot search a DataFrame with the string methods common to core Python. Instead you would use a StringMethod, like so:Also, I don't believe it is necessary to use open when using pd.read_excel. E.g Can be rewritten:As far as iterating over files in a folder take a look at the builtin module glob.
This an answer without using pandas
