I am working on program that reads items from one queue, modify that and push it to second queue. This should be done by multiple CPU due to computationally expensive modify function. Program is stuck in printing loop print(qOut.get()).
In order to be able to share your queues between processes you must create them using a Manager:Managers provide a way to create data which can be shared between different processes, including sharing over a network between processes running on different machines.
