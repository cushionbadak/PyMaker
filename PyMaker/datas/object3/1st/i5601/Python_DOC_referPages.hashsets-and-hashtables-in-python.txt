Is there any HashSet implementation in Python? I know HashTable can be represented using dictionaries, but how do we represent HashSet implementation.I am NOT looking for a data structure with the same methods as HashSets but rather someone with  a CONSTANT lookup time, or the order of O(1);Also, I want to know if the lookup time in a Python Dictionary is constant aka O(1)
I think the HashSet implementation you are looking is set(). This answer may help you: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5139724/whats-the-difference-between-hashset-and-setAnd yes, the average time complexity for python dictionary O(1). You may read on why we use the term: "Average time complexity":Time complexity of accessing a Python dict
