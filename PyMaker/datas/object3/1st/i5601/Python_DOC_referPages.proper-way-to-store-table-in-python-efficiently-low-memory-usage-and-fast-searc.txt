I need to store few tables of strings in python (each table contains few million records). Let the header be ("A", "B", "C") and ("A, "B") is the data primary key. Then I need following operations to proceed fast:Add new record (need O(1) complexity).Find / update, delete record with (A="spam", B="eggs") (need O(1) complexity).Find all records with (A="spam", C="foo") (need O(k) complexity, where k is the number of result rows).I see a solution based on nested dicts structure for each index. It fits my needs, but I think, there is a better existing solution.
As suggested in the comments use a database. sqlite3 is small and fairly easy. It creates a database that exists in a single file and you interact with it.Here is an adapted example from the APINote: example is in python3
