Natural Text
I have a list of vector looking strings i.e.: '[1, 5, 7, 2, n]' and want to convert them to a vector, I tried:The same if I change the sep value to ' ', how do I get it distinguish the values correctly?
The problem are the brackets.I suggest that you use ast.literal_eval and then convert the result to a numpy array.

A naive but simple approach would beyou can then convert that to a numpy array
