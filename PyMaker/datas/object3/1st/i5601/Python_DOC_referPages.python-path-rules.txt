I've started a project using Object Oriented Programming but I have some trouble understanding some basic rules about paths.Here's the arborescence of my project:main.pyDatabase.pyInstantiation in main.py VS in Database.pyIf I make the instantiation in the main.py file and run it then I don't need to change anything in the Database.py file.But, if I make the instantiation in the Database.py file and run it then I need to change the connect method to this :I don't understand why I need to do that and why I don't have to change the sys.path.insert() command in Database.py if I make the instantiation in the main.py file... Why shouldn't it be just sys.path.insert('database/') instead ?I hope I'm being clear here, I just don't get how we should write paths inside our scripts depending on what script we intend to run and depending on if there are embedded scripts into others such as classes call into a main program.Thanks for your explanations!
If you're initializing in main.py, then the directory of your main.py file become's the root for the program instance. Hence all the reference for the files will be initiated from the directory where the main.py file exists.If you initialize from database.py than your database folder directory becomes root directory for your program instance and you need to reference all other files according to database folder directory.Hope this helps.
