I noticed that after calling init_printing method of sympy, variable's representation have a better visual appealing. I know that is usually done inheriting repr method. But when I call __repr__ method, result is different. Why? Before init_printing being called, this is the result:After init_printing being called, this is the result:Why the repr method doesn't return the same as evaluating the representation of the variable?
That function installs a custom sys.displayhook() function, which is used in the interactive interpreter to echo the result of expressions:sys.displayhook is called on the result of evaluating an expression entered in an interactive Python session. The display of these values can be customized by assigning another one-argument function to sys.displayhook.The implementation is found in the sympy.interactive.printing module:In other words, this has nothing to do with how the objects implement __repr__.
