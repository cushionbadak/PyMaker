This question already has an answer here:Converting Epoch time into the datetime                    7 answers                Localizing Epoch Time with pytz in Python                    3 answers                While scraping data from the internet, I am getting a number as a response instead of the date-time string. Below are few example:I want to convert these number to the corresponding date in the format "dd/mm/yyyy". Though preserving the timezone is not a mandate, but it is good if I could get the string based on the timezone to which my dates belong.The dates I am trying to extract from the number belongs to "CAT+2:00:00" timezone.
The time that you are having is the UNIX time (also known as Epoch or POSIX time). You can convert it into the datetime object and then format it as:Edit: Based on desired time you mentioned, looks like you expect the time to be in "CAT+2:00:00" timezone. In order to do that, you may use pytz module with timezone "Africa/Harare" as:You can get the list of all timezones using pytz.all_timezones.Also take a look at List of tz database time zones wiki.
If you are using time() function it is number of ticks since 12:00am, January 1, 1970.
you can use utcfromtimestamp() from datetime to convert timestamp to yyyy/mm/dd format:if you want to have the time as well, use '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S' in strftime method. this link will help you to get your desired format from strftime
