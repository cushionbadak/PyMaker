I got an error,ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'rest_framework' when I run command python manage.py runserver .Traceback saysI already run command pip3 install djangorestframework,when I run this command again, Requirement already satisfied: djangorestframework in /usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages shows in terminal.Python version is 3.6.2.What is wrong in my code?How should I fix this?I use Anaconda virtual environment.
Did you add rest_framework in your setup?May be this post will help you. Have a look.
It looks as if pip3 install has installed the package into /usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages, instead of your environment /Users/xxx/anaconda/envs/env/lib/python3.6/site-packages.If you use python -m pip, then the package will be installed in the same version of python that you use when you run python manage.py runserver. This is the suggested command in the Python docs.
Add the module you intend to use in your django project by telling the django to collect it from lib by including them in your settings file something like this But let me tell you one of the best practices I follow to keep it neat. I create another list called THIRD_PARTY_LIBS which I'll concatenate to the original INSTALLED_APPS something like thisThank you! 
You must add rest_framework to your INSTALLED_APPS section in settings.py file. If that doesn't solve your error, re-check your running environment. As per your question you run python manage.py runserver command and you were using python 3.x. So you should run python3 manage.py runserver
(depending on the version of python you are) This solved it for me.
