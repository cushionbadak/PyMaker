I'm working on a script where I have a list of tuples Append method cannot work
You can solve it by creating your tuple-inputs from a list like so:If you need multiple tuples you have to call this multiple times and put each tumple inside another list. After the tuple is created, you cannot modify it.
Tuples are immutable, meaning that their value cannot be changed where they're stored in memory, but rather pointing the variable to a different instance in memory.Therefore, it does not make sense to have an append() method for an immutable type. This method is designed specifically for lists. In your case, you might want to switch to a list rather than a tuple.
Append method cannot workExactly. Tuples are immutable. So provide all contents during creation. Like:Demo:
Instead of tuple.append(ele) you could do tuple += ele,[*]. It's less efficient because it copies the whole tuple every time, but since you apparently have a person enter data manually, I assume it won't be much.Btw, don't call it tuple. You're shadowing Python's built-in, plus you'd better use a meaningful name that describes the contents.[*] To the inevitable noobs ignoring the comma and claiming that that doesn't work: Don't ignore the comma, and do test it.
This works on Python 3.6.
