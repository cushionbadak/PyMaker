I have this json and I was wondering if someone can help me figure out to just get the '1. open' values for the following json. Using python. Thanks
Use json module to convert JSON into python's dictionary. And then it is easy.Result:If you have problem with structure then you can alwasy use print(item) and print(type(item)) to display item and its type, and print(item.keys()) to see keys if it is dictionary.
