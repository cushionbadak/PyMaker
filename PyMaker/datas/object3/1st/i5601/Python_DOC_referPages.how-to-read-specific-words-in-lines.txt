Natural Text
I'm new to this and currently I'm trying to create a sign up and log in system for my assignment and I did this. When I run this code, it'll save all the inputs into 'Database.txt' like thisNow, i'm not sure how code the login... It should take in the TPnumber and make sure it matches the password on the line... When I code it this way, it only works for the TPnumber and password on the first line and it will not work for others...What can I do to make it read the input username and password and not just the first line?
I'd recommend outputting a json file instead of a text file and look up data as a dictionary.  However, since you write lines that look like lists, you can evaluate the string as if it were an actual list with ast.literal_eval().GivenA file Database.txtcreated from this refactored function:CodeDemoDetailsThe signup() function was refactored by:lowercase function name according to PEP8extra parentheses removedthe with statement was used to safely open and close filesThis can be used to generate the Database.txt file.The login() function was refactored by:lowercase function and variable namesconverting the password input to a stringusing a with statement to handle the fileiterating each line of the file, ignoring blank lines and newlineslist-like lines are converted to listsrather than search lists, data is more quickly pulled from fixed indicesthe loop short-circuits if an input is successful, otherwise an error is printedThe next concept you might consider is exception handling raising errors instead of printing them and handling user KeyboardInterupt to quit a prompt.
In order to match the input with one or more of the txt file content, you need to loop over it. Moreover, to check if password is in the list you have to cast it into string . So your login code would become:Good Luck!
input() returns a string, so no need for explicit conversion with str().  Better use with statement when dealing with file objects as it closes them automatically.Defining signUp():Calling signUp():Defining logIn():Calling logIn():    Python Tutorial says:It is good practice to use the with keyword when dealing with file objects. The advantage is that the file is properly closed after its suite finishes, even if an exception is raised at some point.
In your code:you are reading all the file, so you have to separate all the lines, an idea is using splitlines() to put them in a list:After that users will be a list of strings.That list you can iterate through it using this:I hope you find this useful.EDIT:Your method can get bypassed if you only input 1 letter contained in the string, have pictures so you know what I mean:With your method I just need 1 letter of the student id and 1 letter of the password to get in (In fact I only need 1 space since the string "user" has spaces in it, to get in), and in a log in that's not good jaja. Use this method instead: Let me know if this works for you.
