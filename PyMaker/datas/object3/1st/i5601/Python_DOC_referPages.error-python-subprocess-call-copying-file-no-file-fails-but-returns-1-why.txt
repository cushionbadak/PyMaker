So I am copying a file from one directory to another. When I run the subprocess.call() method it returns a 1. Except that nothing happens and I get the following message on my terminal.What's going on here? Shouldn't this return a 0 since it failed to make a copy of the file. I made a work around already but I would like to know if anyone knows why this is happening? Any information or links would be appreciated.
Return 0 is success. Not 0 is failure. Return code can be a 32 bit integer from 0 to 4294967295. Look at Exit status based on operating system.Sometimes a negative return code may be set or received as Python 3 docs confirm.Popen.returncodeThe child return code, set by poll() and wait() (and indirectly by communicate()). A None value indicates that the process hasnâ€™t terminated yet.A negative value -N indicates that the child was terminated by signal N (POSIX only).Exit Python with exit(-1) results in 4294967295 on Windows so Python uses a unsigned 32 bit return code.
According to the documentation here https://docs.python.org/2/library/subprocess.html it will return 1 when it fails, also check that there is a warning if you use the attribute shell=True
