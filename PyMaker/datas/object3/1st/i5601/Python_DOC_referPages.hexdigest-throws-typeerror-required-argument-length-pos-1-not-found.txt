I'm working on a simple dictionary attack script where it checks every english lowercase word hashed against the ciphertext, and my first version worked well. It looked like this:as you can see, the function dict_attack only used the md5 hash. In my next version of this script I planned to cycle through each algorithm in the hashlib.algorithms_guaranteed library, and encrypt each word in the dictionary with each algorithm and check against the ciphertext. That code looked like this:However, when I ran my code, it threw this error:Why is this happening, and how can I fix it?
hashlib contains some hash functions that have dynamic length outputs. Specifically, shake_128 and shake_256.
