I am trying to understand TenserFlow image classification. Got following code from GitHub, starts from 298 line in "retrain.py" script.What does "FLAGS.model_dir" mean and where is this directory located?
FLAGS holds parsed command line arguments. This script uses argparse library, but the style is inherited from gflags library, originally developed internally at Google in C++, then open sources and ported to different languages.What FLAGS.model_dir means is easy to see from the parser definitions:So, its location is specified by the user when she runs the script. If nothing it specified, this path is used: '/tmp/imagenet'.
