For some reason this code seems to enter an infinite loop and I have no clue whyI have python version 3.6.2 installed via Anaconda.I've tried running it in the Spyder IDE and in command prompt, both have the same results.If I change the setup to be generator instead of list comprehension everything works fine, the same can be said about running identical code out of timeit.I've even tried restarting my computer because ya know, I have to try turning it off and on again, it works for most things.
It’s not an infinite loop – just a long one. setup only runs once, so when you use a generator expression, it gets consumed after the first run of stmt and nothing further is printed. When you use a list comprehension, each list element is printed every run of stmt, resulting in 100 × 1000000 calls to print. (1 million is the default number of iterations for Timer.timeit().)
