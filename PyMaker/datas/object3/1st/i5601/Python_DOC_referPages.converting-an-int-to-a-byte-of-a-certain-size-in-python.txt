I'm trying to create an array of bits in python that are two binary numbers into a fixed width.For eg.[11,90]   ----> 0000101101011010What I've tried/ Problems I've encountered:bin(11) => 0b1010 (which is not the fixed width I need)String manipulation using format '{0:11b}'.format(8) (this works but I'd like to avoid converting to strings and back if I can. It seems like a lot of overhead to do essentially a shift and add)
You can use struct:If you want the leading 0s:
Guessing what you want to do, since you're not very detailed on your question, you can use bin(x)[2:] removing the first two characters, then zero fill it with str.zfill(length) and then concatenating your two numbers, like so:Will print: 0000101101011010
