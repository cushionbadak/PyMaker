I am trying to solve this problemA palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.Below is the code I have used to find if a number is Palindrome.When i invoke the function check_palindrome() after calculating product, the program gives wrong output while it gives the correct output when called individually.
You are passing the literal string "product", which is not a palindrome, to your palindrome function:Remove the single quotations and convert to a string:to pass the string representing the integer stored in product.As an aside, here is an easy way to test if a string is a palindrome:which compares the reverse of the string s with itself. It's a palindrome if both are equal.
