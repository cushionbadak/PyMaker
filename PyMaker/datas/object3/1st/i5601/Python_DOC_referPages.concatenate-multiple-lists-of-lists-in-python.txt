I have a list of multiple list-of-lists in python:And I would like to merge all the first lists together, the second lists together, and so forth:The furthest I've got is to try to unzip the outer lists:I suppose one could loop through these and then chain each together, but that seems wasteful. What's a pythonic way to fix this?NOTE: There might be more than two sublists in each "row".
A combination of zip() and itertools.chain() would do it:
The reduce function is the perfect fit for this kind of problems:Result:This code reads: For each index i, collect all the ith items of the elements of a together.
