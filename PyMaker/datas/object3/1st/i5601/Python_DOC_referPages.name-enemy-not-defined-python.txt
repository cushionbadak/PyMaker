My code isn't working properly, it says that enemy is not defined when I have defined it:This is the game:All the lines with 'enemy.something' give the error that it is not defined.Error:File "C:/Users/Leo/PycharmProjects/RPG Proj/rpg.py", line 231, in main()File "C:/Users/Leo/PycharmProjects/RPG Proj/rpg.py", line 51, in mainstart()File "C:/Users/Leo/PycharmProjects/RPG Proj/rpg.py", line 65, in startstart1()File "C:/Users/Leo/PycharmProjects/RPG Proj/rpg.py", line 84, in start1wild()File "C:/Users/Leo/PycharmProjects/RPG Proj/rpg.py", line 104, in wildfight()File "C:/Users/Leo/PycharmProjects/RPG Proj/rpg.py", line 118, in fightprint("You have encountered a %s!" % enemy.name)NameError: name 'enemy' is not defined
This line of code generates an integer between 1 and 3Your conditionals, however, test against strings.This means that none of your if or elif statements will ever be entered and therefore enemy will never be defined because a string will never equate to an integer.To fix this, change your if and elif statements to check if enemynum is equal to 1, 2, or 3 as an integere.g.
Error:File "C:/Users/Leo/PycharmProjects/RPG Proj/rpg.py", line 231, inmain()File "C:/Users/Leo/PycharmProjects/RPG Proj/rpg.py", line 51, in mainstart()File "C:/Users/Leo/PycharmProjects/RPG Proj/rpg.py", line 65, in startstart1()File "C:/Users/Leo/PycharmProjects/RPG Proj/rpg.py", line 84, in  start1wild()File "C:/Users/Leo/PycharmProjects/RPG Proj/rpg.py", line 104, in wildfight()File "C:/Users/Leo/PycharmProjects/RPG Proj/rpg.py", line 118, in  fightprint("You have encountered a %s!" % enemy.name)It look like you call main() -> start() -> start1() -> fight() and never actually call prefight(). So it never have a chance to introduce this variable named enemy.
