I want to set up my tkinter program so that it will call a specific function (in this case self.executecommand() when I press the enter key, to eliminate the need for the self.open_button. Is there a way to make my code so that when I press the enter key, it will call the function?This code (part of a larger peice of code) basically executes commands in windows. It is made to run on machines that don't allow users to run cmd.exe. I've looked around on stack overflow, stack exchange and some other websites but I can't find anything that clearly fits into my code.
You can create a binding to the <Key-Return> event:See bind and the keysyms.  Note that unlike the command attribute, bindings are called with an event argument, hence the use of the lambda.subprocess.call expects a sequence as the command argument, so you probably to use something like this:(In general, shell=True is insecure, but it is probably okay in this context.)
