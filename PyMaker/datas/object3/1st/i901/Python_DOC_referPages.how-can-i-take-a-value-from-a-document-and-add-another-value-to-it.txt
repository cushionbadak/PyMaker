In each, there would be a value, let's say it's x. The program would be able to generate a number, and I'd like to be able to update the number in a given document by adding the generated number. Right now, my code would be as follows:This, however, raises the following:How can I take that x and add another number to it, then update the document?

this sort of thing is difficult to do safely, one tends to end up with code that does:all of this fiddling is why people tend to end up hiding this complexity behind a relational database.  Python includes a relatively nice SQLite interface.  if everything was set up, you'd be able to do:and have the SQLite library take care of platform specific fiddly bitsâ€¦
