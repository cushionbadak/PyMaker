I am creating a program in kubernetes python client, and which curls an url inside the pod and expect the output in json, instead the output comes in form of str. Following is my program:The above program returns the following output:As you can clearly see the type of return value is str and hence I am unable to parse it properly using json tools. Could anyone please help me either to get that output in form of dict or converting that str to dict.
json.loads() -> This parses a string object and returns json object
