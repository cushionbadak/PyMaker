I'm fairly new to python and need to stop my code at some point. is there a way I can use a command to outright just stop my code. for example if have a bunch of while loops running instead of making all the conditions false so the program stops I want to just outright force stop it.
try:or use:or:or press Ctrl+C to interrupt the execution
