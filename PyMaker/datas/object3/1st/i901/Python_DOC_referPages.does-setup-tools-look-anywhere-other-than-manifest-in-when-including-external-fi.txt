When i generate a source distribution from my Python package usingI am using a MANIFEST.in file to specify additional files to include.Up until this point, I was including the output of my Sphinx documentation as part of the package. This is probably not standard practise, but these were internally distributed packages around my team. The documentation was not being hosted, so it seemed easy to just bundle it in with the package.Anyway, I would build my Sphinx docs and then addto the MANIFEST.in file. I also had include_package_data=True in the setup.py file. This was giving me an initial solution which suited my requirements.I now have a server where I host the documentation. So I no longer need to bundle it in the package. I deleted the line above from my MANIFEST.in - but the files are still being included and I cannot figure out why...Is there some other location that could be overriding the MANIFEST.in that I don't know about? I have even tried removing and re-adding the manifest file with no effect...setup.py (i've changed name, email, and URL to 'dummy' values to post here)MANIFEST.in
If i remove the package-name.egg-info directory, before re-running python setup.py sdist then any changes I made to the MANIFEST.in file are respected.This seems like a bit of a hack, but it seems to work for me.
