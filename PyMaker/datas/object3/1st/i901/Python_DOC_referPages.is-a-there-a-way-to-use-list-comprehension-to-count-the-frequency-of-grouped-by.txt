I'm trying to group the elements in a list to condense it and keep it in the same order, but only if it meets certain conditions.  Say I have a list, and I condense it using this list comprehension: Output:Desired output:So I only want the frequency of the element if it is a number, but if it is a string, I want every single occurrence listed instead of only once.I understand its because the comprehension is using "groupby(l)" instead of "l" to create the new list, but what alternative do I have?
Using a generator expression with chain.from_iterable:Cleaner, in my opinion, is defining a function for this:
You can use a nested list comprehension to iterate over the grouped items individually if the key is a string:This returns:
Not using list comprehensionOutput [2, 2, 2, 3, '7', '7', '7', 2]
