So I'm trying to define a function which looks like this mathematically: M_n = M_n-1(1+g) –– where n and n-1 are subscripts and g is a constant. I want to do this within a range of 1 to 100. I already have the values for n=1. The code I have till now looks like thisSo, from n=2 onwards, how do I ensure that M_n refers its previous value and does the following operation on it: M_n-1(1+g)?Any help would be much appreciated!
M_(n-1) is just the most recent calculation, the one produced in the previous iteration of the loop. Store that in a variable and refer to it again the next iteration.If you don't need the intermediary M_n values, just keep a single updated result:or you can append to a list (at which point the preceding value is always the last value in the list):or use itertools.accumulate() to accumulate all values:In the latter case m is an iterator yielding results as you iterate.
