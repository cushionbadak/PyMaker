I am using JetBrains Pycharm (Windows OS) for python coding. In my code, I read a csv file using pd.read_csv(dataset). Then do few moderation on some of the table columns & finally want to see the updated table, so at the end give the command --> print (dataset).Now when the modified dataset is printed at the bottom window, all the elements of the dataset are printed in floating point exponential format.e.g., [  0.00000000e+00   0.00000000e+00   1.00000000e+00   1.65349200e+05    1.36897800e+05   4.71784100e+05]This is where I need the help. I need the dataset to be printed in flaoting point decimal format or simple decimal format. How that is possible in the easiest way ? Also, is there any option in Pycharm, to configure the output format (exponential,  decimal etc..) from any setting/configuration window, instead of hard-coding ?
Use {n}. format () For ex:Â '{:n}'.format(1234))# More about better precision can be found here Output:0.00000000000000000.00000000000000001.0000000000000000    165349.2000000000116415  136897.7999999999883585  471784.0999999999767169                                     Or you can use the alternative way:The second question regarding PyCharm. You may want to look into formatting markers . Complete details on  reformatting .Update: Here is a updated code sample with the dataset that was provided by you.output:Regarding the error:TypeError: only size-1 arrays can be converted to Python scalarsThis is because the dataset that you are using is a Python matrix OR a list of a list / two arrays. The first code sample in this post is using one loop which works with one array; however, since you are using a larger dataset containing two arrays on the first loop it will pass the entire array causing the above error to be outputted. To correct this I simply added a second loop to iterate through each value for each array.
