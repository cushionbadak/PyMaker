Natural Text
I'm having trouble trying to leave the punctuation unchanged while encrypting or decrypting a messageAn example of what the output looks like if I try to encrypt a message with punctuation (offset of 8):I suspect this program is changing the punctuation to letters due to the chr(ord(char)) function. Is there any way I can add in the actual punctuation to the encrypted message without changing the code too much? I would really appreciate any help, thank you!
You can get your desired result with just a one liner change by handling all non alpha characters in the first conditional using isalpha()
Same as you do it with a space, you can do it with any character.
