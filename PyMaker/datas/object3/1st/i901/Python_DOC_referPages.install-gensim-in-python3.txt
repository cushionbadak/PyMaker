I have two versions of python: python2, python3. When I install gensim it goes to python2 I install it with the following comandhow can I install it in python3?    Thanks
You can install it in python3 with the following command:
I suggest using a virtualenv with only python3 in it. You can create it using virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3 myenvthen activate it using source command.now you can install using pip install gensim that will install it to the python3 specific to that virtual environment.
