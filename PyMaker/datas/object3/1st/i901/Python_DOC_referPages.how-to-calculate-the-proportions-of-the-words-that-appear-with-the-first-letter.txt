Natural Text
By using Python, I would like to calculate the proportions of the words that appear with the first letter capitalized. For example, here is an example word list,and I would like to produce the result like below:Do you have any ideas on this? It seems easy but is hard to come up with good solutions. To be specific, it's easy to count the numbers of first-letter-capitalized words by using defaultdict.Thank you in advance!
Words sorted: itertools.groupbyAssuming, as in your example, your strings are sorted, you can use groupby with statistics.mean:Words not necessarily sorted: sorted + groupbyYou can, in this case, sort before applying the above logic:This adds complexity to the algorithm if your list isn't sorted.Words not necessarily sorted: collections.defaultdictAn alternative is to construct a dictionary with lists of Boolean values viacollections.defaultdict, then use statistics.mean:
You could do something like this:which results in the desired:
