Natural Text
I have an Excel file that looks like the following:In my Python code, to open the file i have written code as follows:The resulting list looks as follows. How do I get rid of the '\r'? I've tried various methods like replacing "\r" with "", but that messes up the elements of the list that look like 'Y\rKonstantin'.I'm able to get rid of newline characters fine, but it's the '\r' I can't get rid of.
The key thing to notice is that python only reads one big line with all the \r characters embedded within. Based on that, I'm guessing you're using Python 2.x, which didn't enable universal newlines mode by default. Changing your mode to rU should do what you're expecting:For more information, see the open() documentation.
as suggested, the csv module is good for dealing with this sort of data.  I'd do something like:Python has support for magic universal newlines which means it does something sensible with "old-style" Mac line-endings by default.  your can then use the csv module with a custom delimiter to parse the tab delimited file
