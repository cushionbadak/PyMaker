This question already has an answer here:How do I create a variable number of variables?                    16 answers                I'm trying to import a CSV file data and define the first value of each line as a variable to a class object or a dict. I managed to create dictionaries from imported data, but can access them individually. Any enlightenment? Thank you.CSV type:name,gender,age,country,locationJohn,M,53,Brazil,SÃ£o Paulo
I would suggest using csv. Dictreader and either setting the headers yourself or just using your csv headers.  Something like thisNow you have a list of Person objects that have already been initialized and you can do whatever you want with that list after.checkout https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.htmlDictReader and Writer get used fairly often.as your code is now for the person object you need to add a exampleNow you can call And this will print whatever you defined in the str function.
According to Dathan Ault-McCoy, you can do this using the __ dict __ dictionary.
You can set attributes on the current module dynamically. See How do I call setattr() on the current module?The idea being that you use the string from the first column as the attribute name. That being said, I'm not sure why you would need to set a variable to have an unknown name since it would be difficult to access it later without knowing it's name.
