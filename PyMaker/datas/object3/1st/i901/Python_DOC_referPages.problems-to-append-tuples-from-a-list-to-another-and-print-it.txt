ProblemYou are throwing away the tuple x when you create the new list:Solution Beside that - your last list is not going to be printed because the last l_c never get's into the printing part of your code - you have to add that ouside the for-loop over area.Output (for n_vertical = 3 and n_horizontal = 3:Optimizations: You can shorten your code using list comprehensions and list decomposition:Or you can print directly from area:using a generator expression to slice area into n_horizontal pieces.
