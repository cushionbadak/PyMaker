Based on official pandas documentations and help on:the loc allows to access a group of rows and columns by label(s) or a Boolean array.(https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.loc.html)but it look a Boolean array does not work really!
The answer is in the loc docs you linked to:Allowed inputs are:[...]    A boolean array of the same length as the axis being sliced, e.g. [True, False, True].If the mask is not of the same length, it assumes you are searching for a label in the column, and failing to find it, raises a KeyError.Note that df.Apples == 30 & True has the same length as df.Evaluates to Which is Because == has lower precedence than &. See Operator Precedence.
