If you are given a list and you are asked to find the number of three sums that add to a particular number How you could come up with the answer? For example, the combination of : [1,3,6], [1,2,7], [2,3,5], [1,4,5] would result in a return value of 4. I know how to use a hashing based function to come up with the one three sum for the solution using the code below but am not sure how to add all unique three sum solutions. 
Using itertools.combinationsCombinations finds all possible combinations, then I just filtered it down to only the ones that added up to 10
You just need to tweak your solution to count the solutions rather than returning after the first solution is found:Note this is not to say your algorithm is now correct. Moving on, you may want to use a counting set rather than a regular set for s. See collections.Counter.
