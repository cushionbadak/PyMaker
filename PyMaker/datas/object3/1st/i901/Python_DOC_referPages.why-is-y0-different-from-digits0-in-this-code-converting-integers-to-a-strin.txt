Given the code below, can anyone explain to me what's different between y[0] and digits[0]?
digits is a list. The 0th index of a list will return the first item. E.g.y is a string representation of a part of the digits list (that's what [:3] does, it returns a slice of the list, up to but not including the 4th item). Indexing the 0th element of a string will return the first character of the string, or '['.The reason that the indexing works on both the list type and the str type is that they are both sequences. See here and here.
