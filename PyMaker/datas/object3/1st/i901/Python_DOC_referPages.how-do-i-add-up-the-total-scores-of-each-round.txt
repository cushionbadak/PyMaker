I have created a dice game which displays the scores at the end of each round. I would like to know how to separately add up the scores of both players so it displays the total score of 5 rounds.This is the code below:How would I make the scores of each round add together?Thanks
I'd suggest you to re-write your code -- For instance, you can use a for loop instead of a while loop to keep track of rounds. I think use of dict or list is useful. I added two dictionaries for both players, result_p1 and result_p2 that store scores per round. The score can be negative (not sure if intended). Here is the code below:This might be useful if my print statement didn't make sense. Here is an output of the new print statements.Edit: Added if statements before adding score to player dict to check if score is negative. If negative -> add 0 instead.
