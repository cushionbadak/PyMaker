I am new to Python and working on a problem where I have to match a list of indices to a list of value with 2 conditions: If there is a repeated index, then the values should be summedIf there is no index in the list, then value should be 0For example, below are my 2 lists: 'List of Inds' and 'List of Vals'. So at index 0, my value is 5; at index 1, my value is 4; at index 2, my value is 3 (2+1), at index 3, may value 0 (since no value associated with the index) and so on.I have been struggling with it for few days and can't find anything online that can point me in the right direction. Thank you.
output:
The following code works as desired. In computer science it is called "Sparse Matrix" where the data is kept only for said indices, but the "virtual size" of the data structure seems large from the outside.

what you can do is sort the indexes and values in an ascending order, and then sum it up. Here is an example code:In this code, the index values are sorted to be in ascending order and then the value array is rearranged according to the sorted index array. Then, using a simple for loop, you can sum the values of each existing index and calculate the output.
This is a grouping problem. You can use collections.defaultdict to build a dictionary mapping, incrementing values in each iteration. Then use a list comprehension:
