In python, if I have a vector of objects V with local variable (boolean) t, where t is initially set to False. I'd like to do a while loop until all objects have t set to True... how could I do that?i.e. --- here's a pseudocode of what am thinking of..
I think the key to your desired state is all built-in function. As you had not described the class from which the objects were created I used a tiny class to simulate your situation:Note that the number of iterations is not 5 and the while loop continues until all of the elemets of the list fed to it are true. You can check it's documentation here.
