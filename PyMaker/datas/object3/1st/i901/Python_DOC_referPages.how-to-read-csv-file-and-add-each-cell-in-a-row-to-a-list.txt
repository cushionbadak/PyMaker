I have an CSV file which looks like this:Two rows, and every number has its own cell.How do i read the CSV file per row and add each cell of that row to a list?The output should look like this:Also i need the numbers in the list as integer not as a string. 
I would just store each row in a dictionary:Then you can access each row like this:UPDATE:As requested in the comments, if you file has a semicolon ; as a delimiter, you can use the csv library:
Just use map to transform list of string to list of ints and append in the output list
You can use pandas read_csv function for reading CSV file. Afterwards you will have a DataFrame object. Using df.values.tolist() you will get the list of all rows as lists.
Python:  Output:  
If you would want to make later mathematical operations on your data, you might consider using numpy module for that, you can use numpy.loadtxt function (remember that csv files are in fact plain text files).Usage example:test.csv is file I created, it contain 2 rows each with 3 valuesThen you can create numpy array following way:test.csv is name of file, int is information that you wants integers and delimiter=' ' means that values in file are space-separated. You can access values in numpy array by giving index of row and index of elementIf you want to get list of values simply pass data[index_of_row] into list()
