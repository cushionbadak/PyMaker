I am beginning to learn python and am struggling with Syntax.I have a simple CSV file that looks like thisI want to look for the highest and lowest value in all the data in the csv file except in the first value of each row.So effectively the answer here would bebecause the data that is looked at is as follows (it ignored the first value of each row)I would like my code to work for ANY row length.I really have to admit I'm struggling but here's what I've tried. I usually program PHP so this is all new to me. I have been working on this simple task for a day and can't fathom it out. I think I'm getting confused with terminology 'lists' for example.With the test data (the CSV file shown at the very top of this question) I would expect the answer to be
If you're using numpy, you can read your csv file as a numpy.ndarray using numpy.genfromtxt() and then use the array's .max() and .min() methodsThe [:, 1:] part is using numpy's array indexing. It's saying take all the rows (the first [:, part), and for each row take all but the first column (the 1:] part) . This doesn't work with Python's built in lists. 
You're overwriting maxvalue each time through the loop, so you're just getting the max value from the last line, not the whole file. You need to compare with the previous maximum.
You do not need the power of numpy for this problem. A simple CSV reader is good enough:
I think using numpy is unneeded for this task. First of all, this:can be simplified into this:We can use a list comprehension to read in all of the values:values now contains all relevant numbers, so we can just do:
Here's a pandas solution that can give the desired results:
