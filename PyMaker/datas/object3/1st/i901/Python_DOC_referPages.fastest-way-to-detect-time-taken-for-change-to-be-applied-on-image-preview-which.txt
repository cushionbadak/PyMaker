I am editing the image , by changing Brightness , Contrast , Saturation . I wanted to calculate the the time it takes to apply these changes on Preview of image . I mean , when I change Brightness from 0 to 10 (Using the automation script): So Brightness in the original image must increases.  So I need to calculate the time, it takes to change Original image preview to the Changed image Preview . One way I know to do this is : We need to take the screen shot of the original image Preview Make change in brightness and start timerTake screenshot Preview and Continuously Compare with the original image till we find the difference .Stop the timer . So the Time taken will be difference between the start time and Stop time . But here the problem is we will not see the accuracy , as there is sometime between one screenshot to another due to compare of original and Changed Preview image . Can someone help me over here to find the accuracy . Thanks!
I'd do something like this:i.e. use the standard file system stat to look for changes to the file 100 times a secondâ€¦seems to work when I've played
