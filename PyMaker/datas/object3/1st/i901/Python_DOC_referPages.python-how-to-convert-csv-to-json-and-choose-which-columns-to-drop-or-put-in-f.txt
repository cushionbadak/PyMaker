I have example CSV file:Need to create output file in this format:How to achieve this?I started with something like:
Read your rows into a csv.DictReader, then write the zip code separately with a serialized JSON formatted string from json.dumps() of the remaining elements:output.txt:Note: As of Python3.6, DictReader returns rows of collections.OrderedDict, which will maintain order when writing to the file. For lower versions, you will need to handle this manually.
