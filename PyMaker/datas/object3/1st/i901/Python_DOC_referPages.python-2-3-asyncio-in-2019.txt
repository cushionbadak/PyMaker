I have to keep my application compatible with Python 2 and 3 at the same time.I have some code like the following that I want to be able to asynchronously call a function and then wait for all my futures to be resolved.Code:Asyncio async/await seems only compatible with Python 3.What is the best way to be able to run functions async thats compatible for both python 2/3?
For Python 2 there is Twisted or Tornado.But maybe in your use case threads (threading, concurrent.futures) would be the easiest solution.Also keep in mind that Python 2 is going to be not maintained anymore at the end of 2019.
