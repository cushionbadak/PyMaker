Since I've been trying to figure out how to make a loop and I couldn't make it from another threads, I need help. I am totally new to this so editing existing codes is hard for me.I am trying to web scrap data from website. Here's what I've done so far, but I have to insert pages "manually". I want it to automatically scrap prices in zl/m2 from 1 to 20 pages for example:I've tried with this code, but got stuck. I don't know what should I add to get output from 20 pages at once and how to save it to csv file.Thanks in advance for any help.
Python is whitespace sensitive, so the code block of any loops needs to be indented, like so:If you want all of the pages in a single string (so you can use the same approach as with your pages variable above), you can append the strings together in your loop:To create a csv file with your results, you can look into the csv.writer() method in python's built-in csv module, but I usually find it easier to write to a file using print():w+ tells python to create the file if it doesn't exist and overwrite if it does exist. a+ would append to the existing file if it exists
