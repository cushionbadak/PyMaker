I am trying to take a list, and from it choose a number i randomly. Following which, I want to select a second element j. The probability of choosing a j decays as 1/|i-j|. For example, the relative probability of it choosing a j four steps away from my initial i is 1/4, the probability of selecting a j immediately next to my i.So far what I have been trying to do is populate my list, choose my i, first then calculate weights using |i-j| for all the other elements in the list.Is there a function built in python that I can feed these weights into which will choose a j with this probability distribution.  Can I feed my array of weights in to:I suppose I will let p=prob_weights in my code?Running this above with np.random.choice gives me an error. I am not even sure if this is doing what I want it do in the first place. Is there an alternate way to do this?
There is a built in function for this: random.choices, which accepts a weights argument.Given your first selected index n1, you can do something likeBy setting the weight of the first item to zero, you prevent it form bering selected.Numerical operations do tend to be faster when using numpy, so you can use np.random.choice, which accepts a p argument:As minor nitpicks, don't call a variable list, since that shadows a built-in, and import x as x is just import x.
