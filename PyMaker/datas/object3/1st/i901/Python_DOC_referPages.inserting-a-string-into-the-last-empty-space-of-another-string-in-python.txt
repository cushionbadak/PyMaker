Natural Text
I've got two separate strings stored in variable mystring1 and mystring2, I'm looking for a way to take mystring1 and insert it into the last empty space in mystring2Desired Output :Lorem Ipsum (Lorem Dolor Amet English French German Elit)
str.rsplit the second string and str.join the appropriate tokens back together:
You can use python list insert function. so your code will be something like that:
You can this with this one liner:
The rindex() function returns the last index of a substring. Since python strings are immutable you can not simply index and replace. So forming a new string with the use of slices is the way to go.
Finish this process in one line!Output: Lorem Ipsum (Lorem Dolor Amet English French German Elit)
