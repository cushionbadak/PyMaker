I am trying to remove all strings from a list of tuplesI have started to try and find a solution:But I can't seem to get my head around how I would get an output like:The format is always (int, str).
Use a nested tuple comprehension and isinstance:Output:Note that there are trailing commas in the tuples to distinguish them from e.g. (100) which is identical to 100.
Since extracting the first item of each tuple is sufficient, you can unpack and use a list comprehension. For a list of tuples:If you need just a list of integers:For a functional alternative to the latter, you can use operator.itemgetter:
Here's another solution using filter():
Try thisThe output is [100, 80, 20, 40, 40]
We check if a particular value is a string or not using type(value).
