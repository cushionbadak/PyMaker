This question already has an answer here:Search strings in list containing specific letters in random order                    5 answers                I need to find if a string has all characters of a substring. So for a 7 char string i want to know if the chars of a 5 char substings are in the string, without repeating letters (if substring has 2 letters a, then the string needs at max 2 letters a).For exemple : Then String1 and String3 are True, but String2 is False. Because sub string is in 1 and 3 but not in 2 (double a, but it can also be any other letter).I hope i explained myself, any questions i can and will answer.
You can use collections.Counter in the following way:This will ensure every character in the substring is at least as many times in the containing string.
Or use str.count in list comprehension, with all:Output:
