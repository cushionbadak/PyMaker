This question already has an answer here:How to index into nested lists?                    1 answer                I'm unable to determine an easy way to have a list with values assigned to each item in the list, where when an item is called the value will be printed.I've tried to use tuples in a list, such as foo = [('bar', 1), ('baz', 2)], and then calling foo[1], but instead of doing 2, it goes ('baz', 2).Neither seems to work.  The former calling method emits (baz, 2) and the latter produces an error.Is there a different way to do this?  Or is this correct, but I'm doing something wrong?
I think you're looking for this:This will give you second element of the list, and second element of your tuple.Hope this helps!
