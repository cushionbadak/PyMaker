My problem is the following:I get from a google search query the following unicode string: "Playa de Porc%C3%ADa". I need to correctly convert "Playa de Porc%C3%ADa" into "Playa de Porcía" to pass that new string to a function that will do another search.The problem is that the accent "í" is cd ad in unicode, I have tried to use decode() and encode() in several ways but can't get to the point.Regards!Edit: My code is in python2.
That's not a Unicode string. That's a percent-encoded stringfor example %20 is a space symbolhttps://www.url-encode-decode.com/ - online url decoderpython 2 verison python 3 verisoncode for all versionsoutputhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.parse.html
