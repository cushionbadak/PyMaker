I am trying to add data in the existing database but getting error output, There is a minor mistake please help me.Thanks Code ::My result.html file is :The output should be:: "Record successfully added" but I am getting an "error in the insert operation".
My guess is that you have a typo in your code:should beBut your code needs some fixes regarding the connection: con.commit() is called on normal exit of the with block, and con.rollback() is called if the with block is exited because of an exception (see the docs). You don't need those two explicit calls.Furthermore, you placed the con.close() after the return statement, which means it will never be executed. Just swap the lines, or consider opening the connection at the start of the program.
After the except:, put a raise to re-raise the last exception and post here the traceback.Possible problems are:You don't have permission on database.db fileYou didn't send one of the form keys and accessing request.form["some key"] is raising KeyError exception.
