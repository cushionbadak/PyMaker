When list of tuples are used in for loop it works perfectly with two separate variables as below But when converted into lambda with map function got an error as belowIs there any other way to call list of tuple in lambda function?
Built-in map supports multiple iterables:As described in the docs for map:If additional iterable arguments are passed, function must take  that many arguments and is applied to the items from all iterables in  parallel.
For you case, you can also use the tuple after the % for formatting, so:
As already suggested, you can pass multiple iterables to map, but if you want to pass the items and not keys and values individually, you can use zip(*...) to "transpose" the items to two lists and use * again to pass those as two different arguments to map:Or use itertools.starmap:
Other option is this way (str.join(iterable)) to get the list of strings:This version can also print out:
