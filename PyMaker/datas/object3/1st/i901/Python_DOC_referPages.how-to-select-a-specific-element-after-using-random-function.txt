I used random function for a list in my code and i am not able to select a specific element.CodeIf the Output is:How do i type '3' and the output is 'blue' or when i type '2' the output printed is 'green'?(For a number, the corresponding color should be printed after the random function is used)
Put the pairs in a dictionary:
In addition to Barmar's good answer, you can clean up the code a bit and also avoid getting the same number or color twice:random.sample(lst1, 3) will pick 3 unique elements of lst1, at random. Then we also pick 3 unique random elements from the other list. Then we zip those elements together into a list of pairs, and then we put them all into a dictionary.
I'd suggest to use random.shuffle then list.pop in order to avoid duplicated keys and values, to have always three elements in dict(skipped user input, already shown in other answers):
There is no need for two lists - simply use  random.sample() over your colors and enumerate them into a dict:Test:Output:You can access the color by d[1] through to d[3].Doku:enumerate(iterable, startvalue)random.sample()
