I am launching a pyspark script with the command spark-submit redirecting the standard output to file too with tee to have a log.The command is the following:The problem is that only the print inside user defined function UDF got printed only on the Terminal but not to the file tee test.xxx while all the the other prints will both write to terminal and file.To simulate this behaviour I created this minimal complete working example:In this case the string WARNING: not proper string URL: empty or null. Possible line: got printed only on terminal but not to file.How can make output generated inside a pyspark UDF redirected to file too?EDITTo explain better my problem I add the line print("This will be printed to both file and terminal"). This one will be printed to terminal and logged to file while the print inside udf only to terminal.
Edit: sorry misread the already redirectingA solution is to use proper logging instead of printing: lookup python logging: https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.htmlhttps://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging-cookbook.htmlExample to log to console and file:
