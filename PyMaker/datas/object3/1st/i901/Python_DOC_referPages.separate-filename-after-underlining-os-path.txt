Natural Text
In my path /volume1/xx/ are several files with this character A_test1.pdf, B_test2.pdf, ...I want to seperate the test1 part without path and .pdf.Im newbie so I tried first with full namebut I got only the "*.pdf" as a text. What is wrong with the path oder placeholder * ?EditI got 2019-01-18_RG-Telekom[] from orign ReT_march - I want 2019-01-18_RG-Telekom_march (text after underlining)   xx is a folder here is the whole code:
Use glob, os.path don't know how to process masks, but glob.glob works:Output of the glob:Apply os.path.basename to this list and extract basenames, as it shown above.EditIf xx in the path volume1/xx/ is just a folder name, not a mask, you should use following expression:because ./**/ is expression which masks a folder name and it's unnecessary that case.
