Natural Text
The idea is to create all possible combinations of [a,b,c,d][e,f,g,h] where a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h are distinct integers ranging from 1 to n. Order doesn't matter so if I have [a,b,c,d] I don't want [c,b,d,a]. Same applies for [e,f,g,h].I have the code below which works but has the drawback of being a) extremely slow and b) take an insane amount of memory (I'm currently trying n=30 and using 13+ GB of memory.)Is there a more efficient way of achieving what I want?
Going off the top of my head, so there might be some bad syntax in here. Should be enough to give you an idea how you could properly approach the problem on your own, though:
