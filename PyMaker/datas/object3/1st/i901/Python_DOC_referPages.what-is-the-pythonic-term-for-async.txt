I found the keyword async in some Python programs. It was being used just before def while defining a function . I needed to know the grammatical term for async (and for await too) and other such keywords in its leagues. It seems like some "modifier" like inline in C++. So what is the pythonic term for that?
The PEP calls async a "statement qualifier":async keyword is a statement qualifier. A good analogy to it are "static",  "public", "unsafe" keywords from other languages.
