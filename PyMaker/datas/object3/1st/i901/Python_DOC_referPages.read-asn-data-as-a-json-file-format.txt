I am trying to use python and scrap the website https://ipinfo.io/countries/ to get the data in the below format. This is nothing but the ASN Data.The specific information below can be found in(https://ipinfo.io/AS3320)I have written a program that can get all the countries and then map it back to the ASN id  --> https://ipinfo.io/AS3320 However I am having difficulty to parse all the pages data using Beautiful soup.The result is a huge dump of HTML page consisting all the information, however I am not able to filter it as per the needs. #Edit 1:#
there should be 3-level page link in your needs1 https://ipinfo.io/countries/ for all countries, 2 https://ipinfo.io/countries/us for us all ASN, and 3 https://ipinfo.io/AS26611 for detail ASN data.It's seemed that step 3 missed in your codes, and if you get the page resource of detail ASN data page, you can use the regex below as reference ï¼šsee more regex flag, re.Smore about re.searchmore about regex syntaxBesides, I highly recommend requests-html module both for efficiently request the page and parse the html (CSS selector and Xpath selector which are more efficient than regex).hope it useful
