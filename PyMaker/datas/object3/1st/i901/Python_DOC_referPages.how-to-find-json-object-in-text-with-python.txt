Natural Text
I'm trying to parse JSON object from text with python regex. I found this match:but in python I get this error:See the regex match in this regex101 example.
You found a regex that uses syntax that Python standard library re module doesn't support.When you look at the regex101 link, you'll see that the pattern works when using the PRCE library, and the problematic (?R) syntax that throws the error uses a feature called recursion. That feature is only supported by a subset of regex engines.You could install the regex library, an alternative regex engine for Pythont that explicitly does support that syntax:Another option is to just try and decode any section that starts with { using the JSONDecoder.raw_decode() method; see How do I use the 'json' module to read in one JSON object at a time? for an example approach. While the recursive regex can find JSON-like text, the decoder approach would let you extract only valid JSON text.Here is a generator function that does just that:Demo:
Thas is because python re module is pretty weak and do not support subroutines and recursion. Try pypi regex module instead. It will compile your regex.
