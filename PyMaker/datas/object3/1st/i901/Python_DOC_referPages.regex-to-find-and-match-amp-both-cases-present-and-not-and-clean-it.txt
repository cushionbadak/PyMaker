I'm trying to extract title's from web pages using regex, however some of the title's have &amp which is causing my regex not to match. I am completely new to regex. Plus while searching I came across this stackoverflow so though of asking the questions here. (I read through all the similar content and youtube video's on regex but non address my issues, hence I am asking this question here)This is my already written regexMy code:This is not matching even the titles that do not have &ampsample webpages:https://ipinfo.io/AS7922https://ipinfo.io/AS7018Expected Output:Comcast Cable Communications, LLC  United StatesAT&T Services, Inc.
