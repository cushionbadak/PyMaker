I have a sensor that needs to be calibrated. The error depends on the orientation of the sensor and can be estimated and shown to the user. I would like to do this visually using tkinter for python 3.x.The ideal result would be something like this with the black bar live updating depending on the live error:How could I do this best in tkinter? I looked at the Scale and Progressbar widgets but they did not have the needed functionality.I was thinking about showing the colorbar as an image and overlaying the black indicator bar and constantly updating the position of this black bar. Would this be possible?
I shall split up the answer in two parts. The first part solves the issue of live updating the data, by using two threads as suggested by @Martineau. The communication between the threads is done by a simple lock and a global variable.The second part creates the calibration bar widget using the gradient calculation algorithm defined by @Martineau.PART 1:This example code shows a small window with one number. The number is generated in one thread and the GUI is shown by another thread.PART 2: Below the code for a simple calibration bar widget is shown. The bar only contains 5 ticks you can adapt the code to add more if wanted. Pay attention to the needed input formats. To test the widget a random value is generated and shown on the widget every 0.5s.This is how it looks like:To get a live updating calibration bar you should just combine part one and two in your application.
