I have four columns looks like to following:How can I replace the party type for attorneys to reflect the party he/her is working for, within each case?For example, Person D is the attorney for Plaintiff A, so I want to change his party type to Plaintiff Attorney.That is, I want the dataset looks like:I just started learning python and really don't whether there are easy ways to do this...
My approach would be to merge the DataFrame on itself (you need just a subset of the columns: the merge columns and the PartyType), matching the Attorney for-column with the Party Name. Once you've done that, you can just look up the Party type of that column, and add that to the string "Attorney".Hope that helps
I recommend using python's dictionaries and creating a separate dictionary for each row. Then read each column and test for whether the current row is an attorney or non attorney.So as a rough example:You can either throw them in separate lists and test against the attorney dictionary or test them inside the loop. If the values of the key's match, then the string of the keys are your "Party Type" column. This is just one of many ways, experimenting a little will get you a long way.
