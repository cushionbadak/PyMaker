This question already has an answer here:python re.sub group: number after \number                    1 answer                Here is my string I want to match '03/25/93' and replace it with '03/25/1993'. Currently I'm trying thisBut apparently the '19' between '\1' and '\2' causes some errors. Is there a way to modify this method?
In that case you need to use the syntax \g<group>CodeOutputTaken from the docsIn string-type repl arguments, in addition to the character escapes and backreferences described above, \g will use the substring matched by the group named name, as defined by the (?P...) syntax. \g uses the corresponding group number; \g<2> is therefore equivalent to \2, but isnâ€™t ambiguous in a replacement such as \g<2>0. \20 would be interpreted as a reference to group 20, not a reference to group 2 followed by the literal character '0'. The backreference \g<0> substitutes in the entire substring matched by the RETake a look at the official documentation of re.sub for better understanding
