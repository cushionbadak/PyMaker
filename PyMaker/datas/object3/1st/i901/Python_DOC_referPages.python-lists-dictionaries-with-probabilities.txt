Good morning guys :)i am currently making a Trainer for vocabulary.I am having a dictionary, where all the vocabulary and their translations are stored in. Now i have an query which tells  me what vocabulary i should translate.If i now enter the translation correctly the probability of the word to get queried should get less. How can i do that? I wondered, if  this is possible by making another list which should get called up less than the first one and moving the vocabulary into that list, when answering the translation right.Here is my code:
You could do the following. Each time the user gets the translation right, add that word to a separate list. The next time a word is randomly chosen and it's in the new list, allow it to be used with a certain probability, like 50%; otherwise, choose another word. You'll need to put this logic inside of its own loop in case another "correct" word is randomly chosen.
Quick idea.
You can use random.choices which allows for specifying sample weights. Then I'd also store the vocabulary as a list in order to preserve ordering with respect to the weights. How the weights get updated on right or wrong answers is up to you but you could use an inverse scaling for example:
