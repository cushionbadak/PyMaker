I need to mensure time of code part. I'm using time.time() before and after specific code part. But, I checked and sometimes that number is in seconds and other times in minutes. How can I define it?
time.time() always returns seconds:Return the time in seconds since the epoch as a floating point number.Therefore, your time difference will always be in seconds as well.
