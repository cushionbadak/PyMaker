I would like to run tcpdump from python for x amount of minutes specified from the user. At the moment my function looks like this:However this seems to repeatedly launch tcpdump as I get the following output:I am not sure how to solve this, and additionally I am not sure how to kill the process, as p.kill() doesnt seem to work.----------------- EDITED ---------------------I have now tried the following, however I am not sure if my subprocess gets killed correctly or if it will run infinitely at the background:
You have the timing sorted but the problem is that everytime that while loop runs it's going to popen again and spawn a new process. Rather do it like this: The tcpdump function now just opens a process and waits for it to close. The main code uses the Threading.join function with a time out specified. Once the timeout has elasped the child thread is killed and control is returned back to the parent.
