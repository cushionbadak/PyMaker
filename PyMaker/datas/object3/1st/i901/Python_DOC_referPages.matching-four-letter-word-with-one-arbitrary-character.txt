You are given a string str of lowercase letters. You need to count the number of times the word doge appears in the string. Also, the g in doge can be replaced by any letter from a-z so dope is also valid.This question appeared on a website I was looking at. Since the site has no option to discuss the problem, I am asking for help here instead:For Input:Your Output is:
Your logic is actually pretty close. The only problem is that i is an integer, so the comparisons i=="d" and i+1=="o" and i+3=="e" will always be false. You would expect to get a match when i==0, but 0 !="d", ever.The fix is to use i to index into str, as it seems you intended:You will also want to loop in a way that doesn't run past the end of the string:A more robust solution would be to use regular expressions. The following pattern matches the strings you want:You can count occurrences using re.findall:
Reason behind your code not working is you are checking if an integer is equal to string in this line of code: i=="d".This line of code: for i in range (0, len(str)) returns integer number from 0 to length_of_string - 1.What you need to do is check if the string of ith position is equal to your desired stirng. like: str[i] == "d"This would be the correct version of your code in your logic:
You can use a list comprehension:
FindAll matches of the pattern int he list then get the count of the list and you will get the number of doge or dofe or any such
