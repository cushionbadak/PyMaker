I want to check the log printed by dprintf in Cpython such as this one, but there is only one parameter for dprintf here, how to check those logs? Thanks a lot for your help. 
If you've got a release version of Python, the dprintfs are stripped, and there is no logging by these statements. It is not possible to see the output from them.dprintf is a macro that is actually only defined in thread.c. The definition isi.e. if Py_DEBUG is set and thread_debug & 1, then the log is printed using printf, to standard output. For this you would need a debug build of Python. Iff you have a debug build, the value of thread_debug can be controlled with the environment variable PYTHONTHREADDEBUG:i.e. the variable must be present for the variable set to a value of 1, and if set to for example 9, this would enable both dprintf and d2printf.
I think you need to recompile Python to see those. When configuring, give the --with-pydebug option. It should come out on standard out. You may also need to set the environment variable PYTHONTHREADDEBUG to 1, but that shouldn't be nessesary.https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#debug-mode-variables
