Natural Text
I am trying to come up with a code that is able to take in a string and split it into messages with n number of characters. Each message cannot exceed n but can have less than n characters as words should not be split. For example 'This is an example message' and n=10. This code would return 'This is an''example''message'Any suggestions on how I can approach this?x is the number of messages that I think is needed. Can someone explain to me how I can complete my code? 
This is what the textwrap library is for.
