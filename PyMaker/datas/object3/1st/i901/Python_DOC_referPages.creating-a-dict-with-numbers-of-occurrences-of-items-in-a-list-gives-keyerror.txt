I try to put the values in the list to the dictionary, and count how many times they appear in that list, however the second way doesn't work. Does anyone know the reason?
Way 2 does not work because the keys do not exists yet. You can not use += for values on non existent keys - only on keys that contain (f.e.) integers.Collection of alternate ways:O(n**2) - solution:Worst because: list.count() iterates the whole list to count one elements occurences. It touches this list 6 times for every number in it. It counts 2 four times (just to make sure) and reassignes the counted value to the key of over and over.It is a O(n**2) approach. You can "optimize" it by only looping over the set(list1) which reduces it to counting only each unique number (3*6 instead of 6*6) - but the problem has several O(n) solution == one pass over the list.Your solution is O(2*n) - iterating the list twice to create zero-indexes and then count them.O(n) - solutions (that differ in performance):Output's:Doku:itertools.groupbycollections.defaultdictcollections.Countersorted()with Counter and defaultdict being the fastisht methods - you would have to measure to get a "winner".
