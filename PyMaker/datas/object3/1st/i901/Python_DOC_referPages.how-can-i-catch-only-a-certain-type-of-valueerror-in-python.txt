I process data and for some examples the data are problematic. Python raises aValueError: Residuals are not finite in the initial point.Is there a possibility to catch Value errors only with the message "Residuals are not finite in the initial point."?I tried:But it still raised the error all the time. Is there a way to achieve what I imagined?Thanks

You can catch a ValueError Exception like this:
