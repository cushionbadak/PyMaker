I've got a piece of work which requires me to add words to there corresponding list depending on the length of the word. I.e all words of length 1 will go in list 1, length 2 will go in list 2, etc...Below is the code I currently have. As you can see I've created a list with L empty buckets and the idea is to have each length word to go in there corresponding bucket. This is where I am stuck. Without knowing how many buckets there are going to be, I don't know how to add them.I am very new to Python and any help would be much appreciated!!Compute the maximum length L of all words.Create a list of L empty lists (buckets).
You can get the longest word in a list of words with max() and supplying a key-function of len.You can create one more bucket for "empty" words and sort all your words into the buckets using a for loop and indexing into your buckets with len(word):Output:Doku:max(iterable, key=len)len()range()
buckets = [0] * longest # this will make a list of longest sizeThen, make a list within each element and I am using the first element of the list to keep a count of that bucket.for i in range(longest):       buckets[i] = [0]Then you need to add the words to the buckets. for L in words:      buckets[len(L)][0] += 1 # increasing the count of that bucket      buckets[len(L)].append(L) # Adding the word to that bucketHere is an example:To access any of the counts, it is just buckets[number][0] and to access all the words, you loop that count starting with buckets[number][1].
As I had mentioned in comment before, I used dictionary to solve this problem.Here, you do not need to bother about creating empty list using any external function as we do not know the actual length. So you can try like this. You can visit https://rextester.com/ZQKA28350 to run the code online.
