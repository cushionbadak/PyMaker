This question already has an answer here:Asking the user for input until they give a valid response                    17 answers                I'm trying to make a script based story inspired by Black Mirror: Bandersnatch. This is my first time using Python or any other scripting programs so I'm REALLY bad. This is what I wrote:This is where I need help. I need to return to c1 and start over the question. How do I do this? 
Try something like this. It will repeat your question until you input something else instead, in this case, 'window'.Just write logic for other options. when comes to continue it will proceed again from start of the while loop. And...when it comes to break, it will go out from the loop. simple as that
