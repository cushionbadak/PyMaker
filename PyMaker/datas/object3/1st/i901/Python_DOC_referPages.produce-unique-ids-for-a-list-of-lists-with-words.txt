I have list of lists with pairs of words and want to depict words on ids. Ids should be from 0 till the len(set(words)). The list now looks like that:The result should have the same formats, but with ids instead. So for example:I have till now this, but it doesn't give me the right output:Output: It is repeating ids where there are unique words.
You have two errors. First, you have a simple typo, here:You are adding the id for word1 twice, there. Correct the second word1 to look up word2 instead.Next, you are not testing if you have seen a word before, so for 'Kleiber' you first give it the id 4, then overwrite that entry with 6 the next iteration. You need to give unique words numbers, not all words:or you could simply not add a word to vocabulary if you already have that word listed. You don't really need a separate vocabulary list here, by the way. A separate loop doesn't buy you anything, so the following works too:You can simplify your code quite a bit by using a defaultdict object and itertools.count() to supply default values:The count() object gives you the next integer value in a series each time __next__ is called, and defaultdict() will call that each time you try to access a key that doesn't yet exist in the dictionary. Together, they ensure a unique ID for each unique word.
There are two issues:You made a typo by repeating a lookup of word1 in word_to_id.When constructing your word_to_id dictionary you need to consider unique values only.For example, in Python 3.7+ you can take advantage of insertion-ordered dictionaries:An alternative for versions pre-3.7 is to use collections.OrderedDict or the itertools unique_everseen recipe.If there is no ordering requirement, you can just use set(vocabulary).
