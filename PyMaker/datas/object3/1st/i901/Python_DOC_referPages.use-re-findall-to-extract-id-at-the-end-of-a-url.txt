I want sfdc_partnerid to return "a0n82000006VlNaPPP"I keep getting an empty [] result.
Given your url, the correct regex to work with would be:Check it also on https://eval.in/1078060It's about quantifiers:*? is a lazy quantifier, and matches as few characters as possible(.*?) effectively means "match anything between zero and unlimited as few times as possible", which is empty.Adding a ? after that, means "zero or one of the previous match", so that:(.*?)? effectively means "zero or one of nothing"I'm not sure about the remaining sr in your original regex
You could also look at urllib.parse if you're on python3e.g.
