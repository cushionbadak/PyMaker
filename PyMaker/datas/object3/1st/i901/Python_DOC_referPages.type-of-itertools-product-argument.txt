I want to use python itertools.product(). What type of input does it take? I want to input just 1 variable. How should that be structured?Is it possible to only pass 1 argument? ex:
Compare with itertools.chainNote that some_function(*[a, b, c]) is the same as some_function(a, b, c). This is called argument unpacking.
