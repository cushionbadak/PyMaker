I have compressed a file into several chunks using 7zip:HAVE:WANT:How do I unzip and combine these chunks to get a single file using python?
First, get the list of all files.Then iterate over each file and append to a result file.Then extract is using zipfile lib. You could use tempfile to avoid handle with temporary zip file.
First you must extract all the zip files sequentially:Next you can go to the extracted location and read() individual files with open into a string. Concatenate those strings and save to foo.txt.
