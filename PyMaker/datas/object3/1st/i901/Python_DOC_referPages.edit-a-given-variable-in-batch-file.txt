I have a python script that removes duplicate of a file which is given by -i parameter to the script. So like -i input.txt.I want the -o parameter, which is the output filename, be like this: input-file-name-without-extension_dupsremoved.txt. Like -o input_dupsremoved.txt.removeDups.pyIm currently using this batch file to do it but the batch file is not correct.which can be fixed by this answer from Gerhard Barnard:
If you want to change input.txt into input_dupsremoved.txt you can use the following code:For these kind of operations I recommend looking at the official documentation for strings: https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html
If you want to continue using your batch file, then here you go. This method uses delayedexpansionAlso note the issues in your script, for instance the spaces after the = in the set command. if you have whitespace in the set command, they will be in your value as well.
