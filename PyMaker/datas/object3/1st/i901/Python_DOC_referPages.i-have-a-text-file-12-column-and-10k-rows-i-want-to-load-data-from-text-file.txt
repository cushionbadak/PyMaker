Natural Text
I have a text file (12 column and 10K rows). I want to load data from text file and feed to a 2D array. The text file contains data as below-(3,9,16,40,41,44)(15,25,26,41,45,46)(1,6,21,27,39,48) (7,20,26,29,39,42) (17,23,25,29,30,43) I know how to import data from text file. I was trying to code    but get the output like this['(3,9,16,40,41,44) \n', '(15,25,26,41,45,46)\n', '(1,6,21,27,39,48)\n', '(7,20,26,29,39,42)\n', '(17,23,25,29,30,43)\n']How can I eliminate ' and \n from the output and can get the output like below[(3,9,16,40,41,44), (15,25,26,41,45,46), (1,6,21,27,39,48), (7,20,26,29,39,42), (17,23,25,29,30,43)]I tried to useimport numpy as npinput = np.loadtxt("Data.txt", dtype='str')print(input)but the output is quite similar as data is read as a string.any suggestion is highly appreciated.-Thanks
Try this:I believe that is your desired output.The first step is to strip whitespace and parentheses (line.strip(' \n()')). Then, split it into a list on commas (.split(',')), then turn the list of strings into a tuple of ints (tuple(map(int, )).
Here's simple way to do it that uses ast.literal_eval():Printed output:[(3, 9, 16, 40, 41, 44), (15, 25, 26, 41, 45, 46), (1, 6, 21, 27, 39, 48), (7, 20, 26, 29, 39, 42), (17, 23, 25, 29, 30, 43)]
