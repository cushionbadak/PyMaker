I have to convert .las files in one directory to .xlsx files using las2excelbulk function. Currently I can do that in command prompt but I want to do it using Python: is it possible? Here's the link which i referred https://lasio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/exporting.htmlOpen CMD   switch to the folder having las files using " cd   las2excelbulk -r -i The file would be converted.
The argument to lasio.read() can only be a single filename, but you can use the os and fnmatch modules in the Python standard library to step through all .las files recursively.lasio.read(..., ignore_header_errors=True) is the equivalent of las2excelbulk -i.It may also be useful to inspect the code behind the las2excelbulk command line tool for more information.
