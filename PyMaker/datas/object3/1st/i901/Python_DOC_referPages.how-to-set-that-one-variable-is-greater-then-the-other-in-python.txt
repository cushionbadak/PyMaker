I'm trying to make a "rock, paper, scissors" game in Python and i want to set one variable to be greater then the other one.something like: how could i do it..?
Yes as Daniel said, with the override of __cmp__ you can acheive this :The documentation on the way this works is available here : https://docs.python.org/2.6/reference/datamodel.html#object.cmp
This is actually an interesting question, because it raises some useful ideas.If, for example, paper-rock-scissors followed the laws of mathematical inequality it would be a trivial problem. Let's say paper > rock > scissors is mathematically true (i.e. paper > scissors, contrary to the rules of the game):Now we can check:Unfortunately, paper-rock-scissors has a circular logic, and so the usual concept of inequality doesn't work in this case (hence paper < scissors evaluates to False).You could use custom comparables as explained in another answer, but bear in mind that this raises paradoxes like rock > scissors > paper == True when of course rock < paper.
What I would suggest in your case is to create a function that would return the winner. Something likeThat would allow you to see who wins.
You can override the behavior of the > operator by defining a __gt__ method on the object. See the documentation on the Python data model for more information.
For a simple solution that doesn't involve redefining operators:First define the rules of the game:and use a function like this to check the data against the rules:
