Natural Text
The text below is the response from a sandbox account at a credit card processor. How can I read this text into a python 3 object? I think I could replace all of the single quotes with double quotes and then use the json parser, but surely there is a better way that doesn't risk the text having an apostrophe in it.I tried just reading it as a dictionarybut that throws this exception:Ultimately, I want to be able to pull individual values out using specific keys. How can I do that? 
If this is a repr dump of python primitive values, you can use ast.literal_eval(). This is a safer alternative than using eval(), which can execute arbitrary code when run over untrusted input.Ultimately though, it's best to fix it in the code that generates this so it generates proper JSON.
