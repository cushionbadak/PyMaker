If I invoke a process with subprocess.Popen in Python as follows:myproc = subprocess.Popen(...).communicate()what is the correct way to see its status? Not its output to stdout or stderr, but its exit status once it's finished (e.g. 0 for success or another for failure)?
returncode is indeed the answer, but the solution doesn't need to be complicated.More info in the Python subprocess docs.
A process doesn't have a return code until it's finished executing. Therefore, if it hasn't yet finished, you have to decide what you want to do: wait for it, or return some indicator of "I haven't finished yet".If you want to wait, use communicate and then check the returncode attribute.If you want to check whether the return code is set, and return None if not, use Popen.poll().Popen.poll()Check if child process has terminated. Set and return returncode attribute.(if process hasn't terminated, poll() returns None)
You may need to call a wait on your subprocess and then (once is done) check the status in the returncode field of the subprocess instance.I have a little routine that calls stuff, maybe it'll help...You can try it with:
