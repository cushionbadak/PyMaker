I have some accelerometer data being sampled at 10Hz, I receive the unix timestamp at the beginning of the transmission only once, while the rest of the readings are received without any timestamp.What I would like to do here is to add 1540987236 to the first 9 readings in a separate column, increment the unix timestamp by 1 second 1540987237 and add this new timestamp to the next 10 readings and so on for 3000 readings (5 minutes worth of accelerometer data).How can I go about achieving this in pandas? I basically need a series that has exactly 10 timestamps in microseconds spread out evenly between 2 seconds.
I think you need integer division by 10 and add unix timestamp:
Using datetime you can write something like this:df will look like this:
