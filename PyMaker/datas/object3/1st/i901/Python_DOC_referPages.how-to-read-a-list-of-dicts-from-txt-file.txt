If you wish to load the list of dictionaries from a txt file in Python, you can do it using the literal_eval function from the ast module, in order to evaluate the expression of the string in the file:
First of all those kind of files are called json files.You can open and read them as:Square brackets in json file defines an array, while curl brackets an object. The former will be converted to a list in python, the latter to dictionary.So in your case data will be a list of dictionaries.You can get the values and keys with the methods of the dictionary class keys(), values() or to get both items().To be complete a the elements of your json should have the same structure, the fields only should change. For example considering one element:In this way you can iterate more easily through your json
