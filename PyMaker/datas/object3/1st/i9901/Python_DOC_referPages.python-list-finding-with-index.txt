I was wondering how would you find the index of a element in a list if you only had part of it. For example how would you find it if you only had "pyt" and needed the index for python???
Straightforward for loop:(If there is no match then this returns None.) This could be made neater with a list comprehension: see this related question for more details.
As the question is not 100% clear i assume you want to find all items that include the specified string.
You have to work with a solution that work when some element are similar (for example ["foo", "asd", "foobar"] and you have "foo" what would be detected as a correct element?)The given function will return a list of indexes, which were identified as a correct element.This solution isn't the fastest way, but an easy and understandable.
However, this is for the whole word, try this aswell.
