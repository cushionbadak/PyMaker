I am trying to make a simple compression program in Python, but am receiving this errorWhy am I getting this error? This is my full code
You are asking Python to treat the result of the expression open("admin.dll", "r").read() (a string) as a context manager. Context managers are expected to have a __exit__ method, but strings don't have those methods.You'd normally pass in the file object:File objects do have the required context manager methods.Note that you have other errors too; sys.getsizeof produces the memory size of a Python object, not the size of a file. You could use os.stat() for that, or seek to the end of the file and use fileobj.tell() to get a size. To get the size of the compressed result, use len().
I believe you should open the file. Appoint a variable to it. In your case file.Then on the next line you can read the file by calling f.read()
