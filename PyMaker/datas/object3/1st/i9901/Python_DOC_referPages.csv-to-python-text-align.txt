Natural Text
So I have a CSV file which has three columns. I am able to read the CSV file and each row of the table is a list. However, when I try to print them like a table because of the different lengths of the text they are not aligned properly. I believe I have to format them with the % but I am not sure how to make it work.I've got more rows but for obvious reasons I would have shown only the first 3.Into something like this:I do not want to use prettyprint or similiar libraries, as I believe the solution to this problem would be more beneficial to me so that I can understand how things work.
Using ljust()You can use ljust() function (for strings).ljust will pad the string from the right with spaces (or any other char if specified).Example usage:So when you print the values, just pad them using ljustAssume having a - list a of lists that contains your values:Using formatYou may use the string format function for that purpose:The general format of a standard format specifier is:Another way to use the string format:Using slicingWell, it might be considered more elegant (?) or Pythonic (??) to use that method, but I don't personally like it:Using print formattingYou can use the percentage sign when printing, for formatting stuff with C style printf...Nevermind, it's not a good idea. Go look somewhere else!
