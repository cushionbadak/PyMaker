Within n = range(1, n+1) I have to randomly generate a list of n * p unique integers.For instance if n = 10 and p = 0.3 then possible results can be:The following Python code does the job perfectly:However, because it's Python, it can take long (like, more than one minute) for np > 200000.Can you see a more efficient version of the above solution, using NumPy?
Try with this:Link to the documentation of random.sample
making result a set instead of a list will keep you from having to run through every item in the list at each iteration to check if the new item you are about to append already exists. Small improvement, but you should see a difference in performance.
