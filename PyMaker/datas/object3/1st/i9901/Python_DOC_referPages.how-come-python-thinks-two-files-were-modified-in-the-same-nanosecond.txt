I am trying to run the script below, and almost every time I run it it prints out the same number twice. I find it hard to believe that not even one nanosecond passes between the creation of the first file and the second file, since the system calls alone should take at least that long! What am I missing? I'm running on Ubuntu using python version 3.5.1+.Typical output:
You should attempt that for any reasons, that timing is given by your system in its stat call - it is not what Python thinks - it is the only values the system can offer to it.
