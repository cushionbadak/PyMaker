I am trying to write a function that composes any number of lambda functions. I have two simple lambda functions.My attempt at a composing function is this:My thinking was to loop through the variable number of functions, each time making the composed function include a new function inside it.Then I could make a function that is a composition of f and gSo calling c(5) should return f(g(5)), which is 26. But instead, I get I thought introducing an intermediate variable might fix the problem.But the same error is raised.Is there a way to fix this?
First, I think your approach will suffer from late closure binding, as function in lambda will only take the last value of function at the end of the iteration. Secondly, composed will only call itself recursively in the end also due to the first reason; composed - the lambda - calls the last value of composed - itself!One possible fix is to bind composed and function to the lambda at each iteration:But your overall problem looks like a good use case for functools.reduce:
