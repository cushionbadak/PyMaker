I am trying to understand how to use the pdb.post_mortem() method.for this given fileCommand prompt
The post_mortem method wants a traceback object, not a Trace object.  Traceback objects can be acquired from sys.exec_info()[2] inside of an except block, or you can simply call pdb.post_mortem() with no arguments directly (in the except block).But either way, you must catch the exception before you can debug it.
