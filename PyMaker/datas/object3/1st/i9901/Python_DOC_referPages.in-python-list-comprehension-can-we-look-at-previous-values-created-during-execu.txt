I have a dictionary and as I am creating it during list comprehension can I access the previous values created?Example:
Edit: I read i:i + h[i-1] instead of i:1 + h[i-1]. The latter is always equal to i:i except in the first case, when it is 1+NoneThis does what you want in a dictionary comprehension. Requires Python 3.2 or higher:otherwise use this
