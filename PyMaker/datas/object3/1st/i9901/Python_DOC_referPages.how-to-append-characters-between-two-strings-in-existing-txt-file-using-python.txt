Natural Text
I am trying to add "," between a lot of data in .txt file and I also want to delete the second rows.This is example of my txt file'....' here means thousand of data.and I want to print the result in a new .txt fileThis is the results I wanted.I really hope some one here can help me with this problem and I appreciate your help very much!Thanks!
First, iterate over the lines:Now lets see what we can do with each line:Updates after followup:Once you open a file, f in this example, you can treat it as an iterator of lines. That's why for line in f works. You can also manipulate it as you would any other iterator but what you want to do has some side effects and here's why:list in memoryIf you have a list in memory and want to access only some items, it's easy enough to to slice it and iterate over that although there are inefficiencies involved:If you use islice beware that it's even more expensive - islice can consume the entire list until reaching the slice, instead of slicing efficiently.Why doesn't islice work with ff is indeed an iterator of lines, but it only goes forward. This is great - you can process a file with billions of lines like this and not use too much memory - but it also means that once islice consumes lines that's it. You need to find a way to filter the lines you need without "random access", that is without needing to jump arbitrary numbers of steps forwards and backwards in the sequence. You can do this if you add the line indexes to the iteration.Here's a trivial way:This way you process each line just once, never using a lot of memory. By adding the state of the 'index' variable you can make your decision easily.This sounds useful - is this built-into Python?Yes, it's a built-in function called enumerate:
