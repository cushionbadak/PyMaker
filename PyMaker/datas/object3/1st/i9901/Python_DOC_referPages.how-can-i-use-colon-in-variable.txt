This question already has an answer here:Can I store slicers in a variable? (Pandas/Python) [duplicate]                    1 answer                I want to write code like this:but this does not work.Is there any way I can store all parts of the [...:...] syntax in a variable?
You want a slice() object:slice() models the start, stop and stride values you can specify in the  [start:stop:stride] subscription syntax, as an object.From the documentation:Return a slice object representing the set of indices specified by range(start, stop, step). The start and step arguments default to None. Slice objects have read-only data attributes start, stop and step which merely return the argument values (or their default).Under the covers, Python actually translates subscriptions to a slice() object when calling custom __getitem__ methods:A viable alternative would be to store start and stop as separate values:
You can instead create a slice object:Be careful not to use list as name to avoid shadowing the builtin list function.From the docs:slice(start, stop[, step])Return a slice object representing the set of indices specified by  range(start, stop, step)
