Natural Text
I have this code (below) that shows me all emails in my email account. It also shows the whole email, including all the metadata (which I dont want). Is there a way to just print the To, From, Subject and Message only? This is in Python as well.  Thanks.Code:
You can use email.parser.Parser() from standard module to parse mail and get headers 
For anyone else who wants to know, this is the working code:Hope this helps :) Big thanks to @furas!
