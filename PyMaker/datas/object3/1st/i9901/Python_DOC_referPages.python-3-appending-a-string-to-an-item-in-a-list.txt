After trying many different methods for this problem, such as nested for loops (which iterate over the first list as many times as the length of the second iteration), and I've tried .join which I couldn't get to do what I wanted.Here is the problem... I am using two for loops to append the same list. The first for loop:Which gives me:the second for loop:Which gives me:What I actually want is:
The ErrorThe mistake you are making is that, by calling append, you are always adding to the end of friends. But for your links, you don't want to add to the end of friends, you want to change the value of an element already in friends.The SolutionYou need something more like this:The Better SolutionBut this is verbose. There is no need to do two explicit for-loops. You need the power of zip, which will merge your two separate lists into a single list of 2-tuples and do exactly the same as the above.
