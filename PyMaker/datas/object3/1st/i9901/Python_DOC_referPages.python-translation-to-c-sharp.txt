I am trying to convert Python to C#. There is one piece of python code which i am unable to understand. Please advise.//ApplicationName is some string variable.//CardNumbers is a collection of integer numbers.Here is my question:What is AppList here, is it a collection or some kind of Property like in C#?How is AppList.get taking 2 parameters? What will be the output here?
What is AppList here, is it a collection or some kind of Property like  in C#?AppList is dictionary in python.How is AppList.get taking 2 parameters? What will be the output here?The method get() returns a value for the "ApplicationName.upper()". If "ApplicationName.upper()" is not available then returns default value Which is CardNumbers.
