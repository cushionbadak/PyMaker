I want to execute code after the python interpreter has started.We use virtualenv and up to now we had a file called sitecustomize.py which got executed during interpreter start up.The sitecustomize.py was part of our project. We use the Django definition of this term: It is a small python module which only holds config and nearly no code: Django's Definition of "Project" Unfortunately some linux distros (Ubuntu) provide a global sitecustomize, and our per virtualenv sitecustomize does not get loaded.QuestionHow to run Python code on interpreter startup in a virtualenv?This code should be executed even if the interactive interpreter gets started.Goal vs StrategyI don't care if this hook is called "sitecustomize" or different :-)
Use usercustomize.On some linux distros a global sitecustomize exists, on some not. This can lead to confusing behaviour. No linux distro provides a usercustomize. See site... After this, an attempt is made to import a module named usercustomize, which can perform arbitrary user-specific customizations, if ENABLE_USER_SITE is true.
