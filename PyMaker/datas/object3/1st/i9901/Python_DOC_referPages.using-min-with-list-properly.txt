task = count vowels in word, print least frequent vowels that occur. in this case, "potato" would print:how do I make it so that it prints just 'a'? I could use min(leastFreq) but that would only return the value "1". how do I do it so that it prints using the format 'a' = 1 or if there is more than one vowel with the same number of occurences.
You could use min with an additional filter condition, testing whether the element is > 0:But this way, you lose the information what character this count belongs to. Instead of your five different variables, you could create a dictionary, mapping vowels to their respective counts:And then again use min with a generator expression and a specific key function (to sort by the count, not by the vowel itself).If you are interested in the counts of all the letters, you could also use collections.Counter.
To minimally change your code:But you should use collections.Counter insteadleast_frequent will then be a tuple like ('a', 1)EDIT:  If you want all of the most frequent items you can use itertools.groupbyThis looks complicated, but all it's saying is take a list in sorted order and take all the tuples with the same second value and put them in a list.
A combination of Counter and operator might do the trick:
