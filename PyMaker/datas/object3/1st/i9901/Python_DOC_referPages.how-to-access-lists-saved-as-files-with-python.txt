Natural Text
I am doing some natural language processing with Python (2.7.9) and NLTK (3.2.1). The way I am currently doing things, every time I run my program I do part-of-speech tagging on a large corpus.The resulting tagged corpus looks like a larger version of this:Ideally, I would just save this list to a file and then read the file into a variable every time I run my program. Saving the list to a file is very easy:The problem is that when I go to read the file into a variable, the read() function only reads the file as a stringâ€”not as a list.My question is simple: How can I read the file as a list rather than as a string? I imagine this is relatively simple, but I could not find any information about how to do it.(Apologies if this is off-topic or a dupe.)
A string can be transformed into a list using the eval() function. That said, this is not the most efficient and memory-friendly solution to the problem.A better option is to use Python's pickle or cPickle module. "Pickling" refers to the process of saving a Python object (for example, a list or dictionary) as a byte stream which can then be quickly unloaded into variables later, without loss or deformation of its object type. Pickling is also known as "serialization" and "marshalling".Here is an example:
You can cast a string into a set using eval(your_string).
