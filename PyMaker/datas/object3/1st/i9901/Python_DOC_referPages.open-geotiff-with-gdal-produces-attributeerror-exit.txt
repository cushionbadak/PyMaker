I have a raster image and would like to open it with gdal to pull some information about the projection.Opening with the following code works fine:However, the following doesn't work:Instead an attribute error is displayed:I thought the latter is commonly accepted as better style. I'm using Python 3.4.5 :: Continuum Analytics, Inc. (anaconda).
Python relies on "magic methods" for many of its paradigms. The call to len(x), for instance, calls x.__len__(). Equalities like > or >= also use magic methods that are double-underscored. The with X as x paradigm of Python relies on two magic methods: X.__enter__ and X.__exit__. The class returned by gdal.Open is a gdal.Dataset, which does not have these methods. It therefore throws an error when using a with as statement like you provided.The proper way to open and close a gdal.Dataset is:Deleting the Dataset will ensure that changes were written to the file. You can also write those changes by running ds.FlushCache()Doc about Python's with as statementsPython's special methods
