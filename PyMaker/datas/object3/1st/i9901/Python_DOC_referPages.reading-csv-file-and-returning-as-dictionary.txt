I've written a function that currently reads a file correctly but there are a couple of problems. It needs to be returned as a dictionary where the keys are artist names and the values are lists of tuples (not sure about this but that appears to be what its asking)The main problem I'm having is that I need to somehow skip the first line of the file and I'm not sure if I'm returning it as a dictionary. Here is an example of one of the files:So I need to read an input file and convert it into a dictionary that looks like this:The main problem I'm having is skipping the first line that says "Artist","Title", etc. and only returning the lines after the first line. I'm also not sure if my current code is returning this as a dictionary. Here's what I have so farWould just a couple small changes to my code return the correct result or would I need to approach this differently? It does appear that my current code reads the full file but how would I skip the first line and possibly return in dict representation if it isnt already? Thanks for any help
First thing we do is delete the first line of the list. Then we run a function to do exactly as you say, make a dictionary with list of tuples as values. You can keep the function you have and run this operation on the lines variable. Alright run the following code and you should be good
You should try this. I found it very simpleOutput :
The csv module provides helpful tools for processing CSV files. The following should do:The DictReader uses the fields in the first line of the file as field names. It then return an iterable over the rows in the file which are yielded as dicts with the field names as keys.
A better way of doing is :Once this code is executed the with-statement will close the file-object. So no need to do a f.close()
