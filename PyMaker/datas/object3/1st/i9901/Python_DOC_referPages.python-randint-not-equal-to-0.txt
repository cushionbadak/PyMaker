This question already has an answer here:How do you create a random range, but exclude a specific number?                    5 answers                I am trying to use random.randint to randomly generate a single int between a range, e.g. randint(-2,2), however, it could possibly generate 0, which is not expected, so I am wondering is there a way to make it not equal to 0. Or just use a loop until randint(-2,2) not generate 0, and get the output.cheers 
Don't use randint() then; it picks an integer from a continuous range of values, not a discrete set.Use the random.choice() function instead, passing in a list of just those integers you want to pick from:This'll return a random value from that list.
