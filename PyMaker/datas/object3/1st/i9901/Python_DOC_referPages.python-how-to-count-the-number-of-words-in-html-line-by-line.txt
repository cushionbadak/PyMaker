Natural Text
i want to peform simple tokenization to count the number of words in html line by line, except the words between <a> tag and the words between <a> tag will count individuallycan nltk do this? or there any library can do this?for example :this the html code and i want the output will beWordsCount is the number of words in each line except the text between <a> tag. And if there a word appear twice it will be count as two.LinkWordsCount is the number of words in between <a> tag.so how to make it count line by line except the <a> tag, and the words between <a> tag will count individually.Thank You.
Iterate over each line of raw HTML and simply search for links in each line.In the example below, I am using a very naive way for getting the words count - split the line by spaces (this way - is counted as word and BATAM.TRIBUNNEWS.COM counts as a single word).Output:EDITIf you want to read the HTML from a file, use something like this:
I would suggest to try to go with RegEx in python that is reTo count link words use regex that count href= like this oneRegEx also will help you to find words that don't include < > and by spliting them with space you will have array that you can len and have number of words.That would be the path I would take.
