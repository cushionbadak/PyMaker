I'm a collaborator of a certain open-source project on GitHub. The guy, who originally created the project, is busy with new activities and gave me a collaborator access, so that I can merge pull-requests to the repo etc.Now it's time to create a new release at PyPI. Can I do a new release, or only the original author of the package can do that? I found a guide here: https://packaging.python.org/distributing/ and I'm trying to push a release to a test PyPI site via twine, but it won't allows me to push package forms.
See this documentation about how PyPI works.  They have a system for designating "owners" and "maintainers" of packages.  It should be possible for the author to designate you as an "owner" if he wants to pass control of the project to you, or as a "maintainer" if just wants to authorize you to update the project on PyPI.
