I'm looking for something to generate a "constant" audio waveform, which looks like this: A constant waveformI have a set of analog datas: Where the format is time_in_ms:amplitue. I try to output them from a headphone jack. I think that "constant waveform" shown above can be considered as a combination of multiple square waves with a very small frequency having different amplitudes, and last for 20ms.Is that possible? What's out there that I can do this?
I guess you can simply write raw PCM audio frames into a .wav file using the wave module... https://docs.python.org/3/library/wave.html    If your amplitude ranges from 0 to 255 inclusive it's probably easiest to create a wav file with a sampwidth of 1 (byte) and just write the amplitude as bytes into the sample frames.The above creates a small file 'test.wav' that is a mono 8-bit audio waveform of constant amplitude 100. Change the code accordingly to write the amplitude values from your input file, adjust sample rate as required
