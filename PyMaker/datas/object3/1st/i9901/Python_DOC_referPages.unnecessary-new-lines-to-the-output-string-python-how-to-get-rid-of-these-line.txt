In Python 3, you can use the end keyword argument to suppress newlines:By the way, you could simply use:instead of using an intermediate list variable (ie. sout).
You need to strip the line to get rid of the new line. The readline API reads the new line. This new line later ends up being part of the passwd variable.From Python documentation: https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/inputoutput.htmlf.readline() reads a single line from the file; a newline character  (\n) is left at the end of the string, and is only omitted on the last  line of the file if the file doesnâ€™t end in a newline.
