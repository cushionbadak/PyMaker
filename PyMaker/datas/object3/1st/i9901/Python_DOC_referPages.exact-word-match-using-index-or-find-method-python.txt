Natural Text
I have a string "the then there" and I want to search for exact/complete word, for e.g. in this case "the" appears only once. But using index() or find() methods thinks the appears three times as it is partial matching with "then" and "there" too.  I like to use either of these methods, any way I can tweak them to work?
To find the first position of the exact/complete word within a large text, try to apply the following approach using re.search() and match.start() functions:The output:https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.match.start
Firstly convert the string to list of words using str.split() and then search for the word.
