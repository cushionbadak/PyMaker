I need ideas, this is not a homework .......I have the following matrix, how i can obtain the coordinates of duplicates numbers,imagen http://image.prntscr.com/image/24ef1e12db9542f9b171170aaefa5751.pngduplicates [ [ [0,0],[1,0],[2,0],[0,1],[0,2],[1,2],[1,3],[2,2] ], [ [0,3], [0,4] , ........ ]momentary code:ThanksEDIT:expected output:Groups 1, separated 2, separated 3 and only 2duplicates [ [ [0,0],[1,0],[2,0],[0,1],[0,2],[1,2],[1,3],[2,2] ], [ [0,3], [0,4] ], [ [1,1],[2,1] ] , [ [1,4] ], [ [2,3], [2,4] ]
Not extremely efficient, as the test array is used in a logical comparison check multiple times, but most loops are pushed to the C-level.At the same time, it demonstrates a few interesting methods you could explore if you have similar functionality to perform.Output:You could of course append the results to a list, when you are not interested in keeping the label that matched that list of coordinates.
According to an output you provided to your example, I came up with the following solution:memo is a list where index indicate a potential duplicate number and corresponding value is the list of coordinates. Originally memo is initialized with None of length max found by traversing input matrix (O(N^2)). Key observation - If there are more than one pair of coordinates for specific number in memo, then we found a duplicate. 
Here's a non-Numpy solution. It uses itertools.groupby to separate the coordinates into lists that have the that share the same value in n, then it separate those into sublists consisting of neighbours.output
