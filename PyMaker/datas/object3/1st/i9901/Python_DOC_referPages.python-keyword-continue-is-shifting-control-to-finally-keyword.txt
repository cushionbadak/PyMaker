I am actually new to python. While learning it I came across this piece of code.Python official document says when encounter with continue statement, control will shift to the beginning of the loop, but in this case it is shifting to final statement and executing from there onward. Is this a bug in python or what? Can somebody please explain this to me? Thanks.      
This is stated in the documentation for the continue statement:When continue passes control out of a try statement with a finally clause, that finally clause is executed before really starting the next loop cycle.(Emphasis mine)Yes, without the while loop present, you'd have a SyntaxError popping up; since continue is inside the while and finally always gets a chance at finalizing things; it gets executed on the way out.
The finally code is always executed in a try/except block.The continue doesn't skip it (or it would be a bug in python).
The finally clause must be executed no matter what happens, and so it is.This is why it's called finally: it doesn't matter whether what you have tried succeeded or raised an exception, it is always executed.
finally will be executed always in a try/exept no matter what is the exception.I think this material will help you https://docs.python.org/2.5/whatsnew/pep-341.html
