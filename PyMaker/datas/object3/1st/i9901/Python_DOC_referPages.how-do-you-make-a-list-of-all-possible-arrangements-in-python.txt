This question already has an answer here:How to generate all permutations of a list in Python                    31 answers                I am currently working on a simple project on my own, and I stumbled on a problem:I need to have a list of 4 numbers: say I need a full list of rearrangements of the Numbers so:  Any Ideas?Even a theory would be useful, thank you :)
You're looking for itertools.permutations.If you don't need to mutate (edit) the results, you can cast the return straight to a list, yielding tuplesEven faster, if you plan on using the results solely as an iterator, you don't need to cast it at all
