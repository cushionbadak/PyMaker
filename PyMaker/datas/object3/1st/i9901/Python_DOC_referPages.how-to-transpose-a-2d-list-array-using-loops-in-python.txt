say a = [[1, 1, 1, 6], [0, 2, -1, 3], [4, 0, 10, 42]] and I want to transpose it to a = [[1,0,4], [1,2,0], [1,-1,10], [6,3,42]] using loops in python. The current code that I have is:But this gives me the output of:Instead of this:Can anyone help me? I'm still new at this stuff and don't understand why it doesn't work. Thanks so much!
Here is a solution that is based on your code:If you define an inner list for the inner loop, your output is this:
Use zip()zip(*a) unpacks the three sub-lists in a and combines them element by element. Meaning, the first elements of the each of the three sub-lists are combined together, the second elements are combined together and so on. But zip() returns tuples instead of lists like you want in your output. Like this:[list(x) for x in zip(*a)] converts each of the tuples to lists giving the output the way you need it.
If you are looking for a solution without any fancy function. You may achieve it using list comprehension as:However, simplest way is by using zip():
