Natural Text
My question set is shown below:Write a function named initialDict that takes a string, text, as a parameter and computes and returns a dictionary in which each initial letter of a word in text is a key. All keys should be lower cased. The value of each key is a list of all words in text beginning with that letter.Input: text, a stringReturn: a dictionary of initial letter:word list pairsFor example, the following would be correct output.So far I have this and am not sure if I'm on track or not:I've tried one thing but it just ran an error. 
str.lower() and str.split() don't change their inputs directly, since strings are immutable in Python.This looks like an assignment, so a hint rather than a full implementation: to iterate over the words, you'd combine those calls.For the other parts of the question:To get the first letter, look here, especially the part saying "Strings can be indexed..."To make the lists, look here, especially the part saying "You can also add new items..."Hope that helps. The tutorial at docs.python.org/3/tutorial/ is a wonderful resource as well.
