I'm trying to count the frequency of occurrences of a particular symbol in a given string and create a dictionary out of this. For some reason, the function just returns an empty dictionary. I think the problem arises with adding a new value to the dictionary, but not sure how to troubleshoot it/fix it.  
Do this:
The code in the inner loop:is unreachable, because the dictionary is empty initally, and hence you will never add any value to fdict.
you can do it likes this:
Another issue is that the value value is never assigned to anything or used, so even if we were to go through the loop we would never increment a value in the dictionary.
