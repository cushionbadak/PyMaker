Using Openpyxl and python3.5, I tried getting the first row from an excel worksheet using a subscript but I an error. In relation to getting the first row, I've also tried      first_row = worksheet.(row=1)     # and     first_row = worksheet.rows[:1]None worked. Any suggestions or is the feature not available in openpyxl?I've been to the documentation at https://openpyxl.readthedocs.io/en/default/ but I found nothing helpful enough to index and select rows
I finally found the answer in the documentation:This worked for me.
The error TypeError: 'generator' object is not subscriptable. Means that you are trying to access by index a generator, which doesn't have one, because it creates the elements as you iterate through it.You can solve it easily, cast it to a list to get the element you want:or iterate thought the rows:This is because, even if both are iterables, lists and generators can behave quite differently, you can get it better explained here:https://wiki.python.org/moin/Generatorshttps://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#iterator-typeshttps://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#sequence-types-list-tuple-range
