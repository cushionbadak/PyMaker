I need to find pid of proccess started in bash script with another program. I use sshpass to enter the password, sshpass start ssh client and that client open sshtunnel to server.Here is examples:And I start it with subrocess.Popen:The script start just fine, it normally finish and return 0, I can get it PID, but is it possible to get the PID of started sshclient?
By default proc.pid will return the PID of the shell (ie the parent process). What you're looking for is the PID of the child process (sshpass).So set shell=False in subprocess.Popen. Documentation is here.
Just call the sshpass directly from Popen and pass in the shell=False option. Then the direct child will the be the sshpass subprocess. No need for a shell wrapper. 
Using subprocess.Popen I would simply call the shell=false option.
