First time caller here ...For some reason, I am not getting the desired result from my "for" loops. Below is the snippet of code. The loops work perfectly first time through as LOOP 2 does in fact return back to LOOP 1. But second time through LOOP 2 does not execute. I haven't written code in 25 years, but loving Python. Just need to get through some initial trial and error. Thanks in advance to anyone who can advise on this topic.The output looks like this:LOOP 1 99.246.228.140LOOP 2 99.246.228.140LOOP 2 137.104.238.184LOOP 2 137.104.238.184LOOP 2 99.246.228.140LOOP 2 81.182.15.119LOOP 1 137.104.238.184LOOP 1 137.104.238.184LOOP 1 74.110.238.103I intend to test for a match of the string(ip address) each time through the loop. The first loop is fine, then second time through it does not execute loop 2.
The problem is that your readers are attached to streams.  As such, you are only expected to iterate through them once.  The next time you iterate through, it's already at end of file, so it doesn't find anything else (hence "the second loop doesn't execute").You can fix this by seeking the fileobject back to the start each time you finish with it:
