I have the following situation.I have a test that initiates a Class3 object but I want to mock the new  instance of Class1 inside the constructor of Class2. This is what i did so far:I'm guessing because Class1 constructor takes params - its not a simple patch.
You are mocking Class1 correctly, but forgot to take into account it is called to produce an instance. The my_func_1 would be looked up on the call result (on the instance):Mock doesn't care that you produced an instance or that my_func_1 is a bound method, only that you call Class1.You can then make assertions if the class was called with the correct parameters, if you so desire:Demo:I included class_1_mock.mock_calls to show that call().my_func_1() is included; that's the Class1('Real') instance being used to provide the my_func_1() method call.
