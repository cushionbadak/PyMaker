I am trying to create epoch values for a date field using Python. It works great for all the dates after '1970-01-01'. Any date before 1970 doesn't work.Here is the code I am using:Error:Is there any alternative way to create negative epoch value?
From the documentation of the time module:The functions in this module may not handle dates and times before the epoch or far in the future.So that's out.  I would suggest using the datetime module instead, which can handle dates in  years between 1 and 9999. I'm afraid without knowing your use case we can't be of more help.
