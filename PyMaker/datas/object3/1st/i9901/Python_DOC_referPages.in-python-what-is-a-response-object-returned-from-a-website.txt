I'm trying to use the etsy API and I was finally able to get it running from the source.  I gave it my key, and it returned the following when printed out.However I have no idea what to do with it. The github-repo doesn't have much documentation, and the command that is suppose to follow doesn't work. I read the Etsy API and didn't find the mentioned command getFrontFeaturedListings like the github listed.I've had this issue before with an HTTP response object and I was told to use response.content to check out more info on the object. It didn't work for this object so I'm wondering if there was a simple way to test any generic object, or at least see what this object contains? 
When in doubt you can always use the dir built-in method on an arbitrary python object. This will show you methods and fields attached to the object. https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#dirAnyway, sorry to hear about the poor documentation of the library. Last time I used Etsy's API I just created a little class that used requests. It wasn't much work since Etsy lays out all of the URIs + documentation nicely on their developer site. https://www.etsy.com/developers/documentation/reference/favoritelisting
