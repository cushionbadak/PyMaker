I have written a simple Python3 program like below:but while running this like below:but output is not coming until I hit ctrl+C (in windows)
sys.stdin.read() will read until an EOF (end of file) is encountered. That's why "pressing enter" doesn't seem to do anything. You can send an EOF on Windows by typing Ctrl+Z, or on *nix systems with Ctrl+D.(Note that you probably still need to hit Enter before hitting Ctrl+Z. I don't think the terminal treats the EOF correctly if it's not at the start of a line.)If you just want to read input until a newline, use input() instead of sys.stdin.read().
you can read user's input using input() function.Example Code
This happens because sys.stdin.read attempts to read all the data that the standard input can provide, including new lines, spaces, tabs, whatever. It will stop reading only if the interpreter's interrupted or it hits an EndOfFile (Ctrl+D on UNIX-like systems and Ctrl+Z on Windows).The standard function that asks for input is simply input()
