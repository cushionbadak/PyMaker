RESOLVEDWhen an integer containing "0" or "4" is entered, this if-statement only returns the first in the statement. For example, in the code below, if I enter "60", it will execute:print "Nice, you're not greedy - you win!" exit(0)NOTdead("You greedy bastard!")as I expected with how_much >= 50.Have tried a bunch of changes, but can't seem to get to execute as intended.   Anyone know what's going on here? 
You have an order-of-operations issue.  The and operator binds more tightly than the or operator, so when you write:You are actually getting:And hopefully, with those parentheses, it's obvious why entering 60 triggers the "Nice, you're not greedy - you win!" message (because it matches the "0" in choice coindition, and since that condition is true, the entire or statement is true).Add parentheses to get what you want:See this article for details.
You need some brackets in your conditionals to make sure they get evaluated the way you want, e.g:You'll need something similar on the next condition too. 
You should separate your conditions into logical groups. Besides, you have repeated condition "0" in choice or "4" in choice, use an optimized structure as shown below:
That's because the and is executed before the orhttps://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#operator-precedenceSome ()  in the correct places will fix this. It'll be easier to test this too if you split the test in a different function 
Python will do this:choice = '60'how_much = 60if "0" in choice (Will return True) OR "4" in choice AND how_much < 50 (This will return false but since you did that or it will continue with it)You should do it like this instead :The parantheses will make it so only if it will return True it will then compare to see if the variable "how_much" is less then 50.Before , it was checking if "0" is in choice OR if the 4 in choice and how_much is less then 50. The OR makes it so only one of the statements have to be True to continue on the next line of code (The AND makes it so the "4 in choice and how_much < 50" will only return True or False wich will have to be compared to the "0 in choice")Sorry if it doesn't make a lot of sense but I'm sleepyHope you got the idea.
