I'm trying to read a csv file into a list. However, my code doesn't produce what it's supposed to. It produces this:I couldn't code it on here so I had to attach a photo (sorry). Why does it do this? I just want a normal list of lists.
You're printing inside the for loop. data_list is a list of lists, just print it after the for loop finishes :)
