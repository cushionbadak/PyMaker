I'm getting the following error while trying to run my code. Here is a snippet:The code runs for a couple of the iterations (usually at most 3, before crashing with the error mentioned above. I'm not too sure what's happening so any suggestion would be awesome, thanks!
It's probably something later in the code that is reassigning message to a bytes object - perhaps you're reassigning it the data received from the clientSocket?  If so, the data returned the clientSocket is a bytes object and needs to be decoded, similarly to how you're using message.encode() to send text data through the client.There's a pretty good explanation on the usage of bytes objects for IO communication - especially if you're used to the python2.x way of doing things -  here
