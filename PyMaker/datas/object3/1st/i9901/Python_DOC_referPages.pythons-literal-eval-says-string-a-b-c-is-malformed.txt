literal_eval documentation states:Safely evaluate an expression node or a Unicode or Latin-1 encoded string containing a Python literal or container display. The string or node provided may only consist of the following Python literal structures: strings, numbers, tuples, lists, dicts, booleans, and None.I want to parse a unicode string representing a tuple. Why do I get ValueError: malformed string for the following inputs?However, this example does work:
literal_eval only parses literals.  Your string is a tuple of variable names (abc, c, d, e).  Instead, you want either a tuple of strings or a string with commas.  Either one requires two levels of quotes.Your last example is a tuple of ints, which are all literals, so it parses successfully.
