I'm reading tweets from Twitter Streaming API. After connecting to the API, I'm getting a generator. I'm looping through each tweet received but I want to exit from the iterator, say, at 18PM. After receiving each tweet, I'm checking if it's later than the specified timestamp and stopping.The issue is that I'm not receiving tweets frequently enough. So, I could receive one at 17:50 and the next one at 19PM. That's when I'll find out that the time has passed and I need to stop.Is there a way to force the stop at 18PM exactly?Here's a high-level view of my code:
Your problem could be resolved by splitting the functionality of your design into two separated processes: A twitter process that acts as wrapper to Twitter API and A monitor process that is able to terminate the twitter process when the exit time is reached.The following piece of code prototypes the functionality described above using Python's multiprocessing module:Of course you can use p.join(TIMEOUT) instead of using the while True loop presented in my example as pointed here.
Here is an example with threading and python scheduler:
Create a separate thread for the producer and use a Queue to communicate. I also had to use a threading.Event for stopping the producer.
