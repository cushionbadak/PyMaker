Natural Text
I'm trying to run the following:But I get the following error :UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xe2 in position  6987: ordinal not in range(128)From the internet I've found that it should be because the encoding needs to be set to utf-8, but my issue is that it's already in utf-8.Also, it looks like my file is in utf-8, so I'm really confusedAlso, the following code works :Is there a way to solve this ?Thanks !EDIT:When I run the code in my console it works, but not when I run it in Spyder provided by Anaconda (https://www.continuum.io/downloads)Do you know what can go wrong ?
The text file contains some non-ascii characters on a line somewhere. Somehow on your setup the default file encoding is set to ascii instead of utf-8 so do the following and specify the file's encoding explicitly:(Doing this is a good idea anyway even when the default works)
I try to ran this program with one additional line at the top: It fetches the lines and shows the output (with u' prefixed strings; probably a conversion might be required after this). But, it didn't throw any error as you mentioned.
