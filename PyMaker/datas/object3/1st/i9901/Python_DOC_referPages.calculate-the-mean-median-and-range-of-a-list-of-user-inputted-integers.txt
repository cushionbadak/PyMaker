This is my code so far:I need to take the inputted integers, and calculate the mean, median, and range of them. How would I go about doing this? Thanks!P.S Using Python 3.
First, you should store your numbers in a list:Then the statistics module provides mean and median functions.For the mean, you could also use sum(my_numbers) / len(my_numbers), but the statistics.mean function is better-optimized for large data sets and only iterates over the inputs once.For the range, you can use max(my_numbers) - min(my_numbers).
