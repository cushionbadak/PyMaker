I am trying to read a line of numbers in a csv file, then call on them individually to compute with them. Here is my code so far:Within this line of the csv file there are numbers with decimals like 4.65 that I need to use in the calculations. I tried things like:print(5 + x[14]) but it won't work.I assume I need to convert the line into a list of integers or something, please help.Thank you in advance.
According to your example line you want to add delimiter=' ' to the csv.reader()Taking a guess at the structure of your csv, but under the assumption that it contains no headings and you want to keep the decimals:This will fail if you have string values, such as 'A string'
Here is an alternative to @GiantsLoveDeathMetal's solution with map (also it shows a way to provide us a copy/paste-able piece of code containing a sample of your csv file with io.StringIO) :EDITED the StringIO to contain data in columns and with empty rowsIn python 2 (and in some cases in python 3 if your code works with a generator, which is not the case in this example), you don't need to convert the result of map to a list.So line = list(map(float, line)) can be replaced by the much cleaner map(float, line). Which can be considered cleaner and more explicit than a list comprehension (or a generator expression).For instance this will work :If you're interested in the map vs list comprehension debate, here you go for more details.
yes indeed Unatiel.sorry, had to create an answer to my own question, apparently 
I think you can try to read it with pandas. Below is sample code where dataarr will be ndarray of numpy type and you can access it using for loop. Access element like this:I hope this help you to solve your problem.
