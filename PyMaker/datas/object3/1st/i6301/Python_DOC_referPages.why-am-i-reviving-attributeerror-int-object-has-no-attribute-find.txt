Here's my code. It checks a list of email/password combinations from a file to see if it is on a specific server (in my case BT). But I am having trouble with the library names, I am not sure what to use. I checked on python docs but it wasn't clear enough, if someone can tell me as to what is incorrect I would deeply appreciate it.Error received.This will also give me errors for the other incorrect library names
For your problem I think the reason why as to your libraries are not working properly is because you're calling your imported library inconsistently:e.g. sometimes you type 's.xxxxx', sometimes you type 'SMTPlib.xxxxx' for your module attributes, you should import smtplib as 's'. So what does this is it stores the library in a short form named 's', so whenever you call a module or use a function from the library, you don't have to type the full '.smtplib' but instead just type a '.s' extension behind the specific function:Should fix your problems now. remember to call functions from the specific library name in a consistent manner ('s').
