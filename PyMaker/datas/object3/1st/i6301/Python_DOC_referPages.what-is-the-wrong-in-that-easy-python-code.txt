The expected output is how many times the number 4 occurs in the list. The actual output is zero no matter what the input is.
my_list is a list of strings.The string '4' is not equivalent to the integer 4.You need to convert i to an int in your check for equality with 4. You can do this with the function int.The other alternative is to map int over the list of strings.
As some answerers already pointed out, you're trying to compare 4 with '4'. Here are you options:1) Cast i to string. But make sure, that your script doesn't crash if in case user had input non-integer value:2) 4 is hardcoded. You could use just '4' instead of 43) You don't really need a for loop to count symbols:Or even so, but it gives a bit different result for cases like 'a4a 4':
They are all in string so you need to convert them into integers
