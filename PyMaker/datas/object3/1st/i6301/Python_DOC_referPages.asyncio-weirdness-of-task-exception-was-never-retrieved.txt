Lets assume I have a simple code:If I run it, I get error message immediately But, if I change loop.create_task(exc()) to task = loop.create_task(exc()) I'll get the same error message after click ctrl+cWhy does task assignment change the time of output of error?
A Exception in the Task (of underlying asyncio.Future to be precise) can be retrieved with Future.exception(). If it's not retrieved, the exception will be handled at release of the Future object with eventloop's call_exception_handler. So, as @dim pointed, while the Task has reference (assigned to variable in your case) it's not going be freed, therefore del task_future won't be called, loop's handler won't be executed either.
