I am trying to add a logging handler in Python 3 this way:I specified loglevel as INFO. Why does logging.info("my info") output nothing?
because you need to set logger lever as well.output:
Loggers have levels as well as handlers. The default level is warn so your info is ignored.To get your example to work, include logger.setLevel(logging.INFO).
