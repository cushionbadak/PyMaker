I have an input like this: BFFBFBFFFBFBBBFBBBBFF .I want to count 'B's and the answer should be 6.(ignore the duplicate ones)How to do it in python?
Use itertools.groupby :#driver values :EDIT : Also, for more extensive use, its better to use collections.Counter to get count for all the characters.

You should set a counter and a flag variable. Then count only occurences which are not duplicates, and flip the flag. The logic is simple: if current letter is 'B', and you the letter before isn't 'B' (dup = False), then count it + flip the boolean:
We can remove consecutive dups and use collections.Counter to count the B's that are left:And a groupby solution:Or
Another solution by first removing duplicates using RE-library:
You want to count when the letters change from F to B, and another function can do that : split. It removes all Fs, but create empty strings for consecutive Fs, so we must remove them from the count.
