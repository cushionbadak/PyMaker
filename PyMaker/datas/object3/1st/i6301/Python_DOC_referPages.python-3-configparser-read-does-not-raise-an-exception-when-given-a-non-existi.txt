When I attempt to read a non-existing file using configparser.read, I think it ought to raise an exception.  It doesn't.  It returns an empty list instead.  Obviously, I can test for an empty list and raise an exception.  It just seems to me to be more intuitive and safer if the configparser.read raised a FileNotFound exception.Thank you
As the documentation makes clear, you can pass any number of filenames to the read method, and it will silently ignore the ones that cannot be opened.If you want to see an exception on failure to open the file, try the read_file method instead:
You are right, and I am wrong.  My solution of testing the length of the list returned is not a bad solution, and it will work around the outlier case where none of the files exists, but my question suggests that I did not do a good job of reading the documentation.
