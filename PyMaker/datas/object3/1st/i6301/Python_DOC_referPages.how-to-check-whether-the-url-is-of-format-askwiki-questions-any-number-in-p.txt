Natural Text
I am trying to learn web scrapping using BeautifulSoup and Python.I scrapped a list of urls from a website and I want to display the text of all th links that are in format "/askwiki/questions/ like"/askwiki/questions/4" or "/askwiki/questions/123".What should I write in the if statement.I am new to python as well as web scrapping. It may be a really stupid question but I am not getting what to write there.I tried likeif "/askwiki/questions/[0-9]+ " in link.get("href"):if "/askwiki/questions/[0-9]?" in link.get("href"):but it's not working.P.S - There are other links too like 'askwiki/questions/tags' and /askwiki/questions/users'.
Edit: Using regex to identify only those with numbers at the end.
You're on the right track! The missing component is the re module.I think what you want is something like this:Alternatively, you can just drop the number component, if you're only really looking for links with "/askwiki/questions" in:
try something like :
If you want to use regex (ie what you have, [0-9]+), you have to import the re library. Check out this link to the documentation on using re to find patterns!
