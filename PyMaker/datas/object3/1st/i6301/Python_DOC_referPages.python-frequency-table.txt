I want to make frequency table by below table.number       1         2         4         6       Sumfrequency   0.4      0.25    0.15    0.2    1And I wrote the below code.But result is Number  Frequency0   39901   24952   15213   1994Above Table, Number is not 1,2,4,6.How can I make frequency table with number 1,2,4,6(above number list)?
Starting with python 3.6, there is random.choices:random.choices(population, weights=None, *, cum_weights=None, k=1)  Return a k sized list of elements chosen from the population with  replacement. If the population is empty, raises IndexError.If a weights sequence is specified, selections are made according to  the relative weights. Alternatively, if a cum_weights sequence is  given, the selections are made according to the cumulative weights  (perhaps computed using itertools.accumulate()). For example, the  relative weights [10, 5, 30, 5] are equivalent to the cumulative  weights [10, 15, 45, 50]. Internally, the relative weights are  converted to cumulative weights before making selections, so supplying  the cumulative weights saves work.If neither weights nor cum_weights are specified, selections are made  with equal probability. If a weights sequence is supplied, it must be  the same length as the population sequence. It is a TypeError to  specify both weights and cum_weights.The weights or cum_weights can use any numeric type that interoperates  with the float values returned by random() (that includes integers,  floats, and fractions but excludes decimals).
