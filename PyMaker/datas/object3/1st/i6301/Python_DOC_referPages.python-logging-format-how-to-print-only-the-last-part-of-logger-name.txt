I'm using python logging with the following format string:The %(name)s part prints the logger name:Like with other logging facilities (like log4j) I'd like to print only the last part of the logger name for brevity (shown in bold in the example above).This other answer suggests to change the logger name, but doing so would destroy the parent-child logger relationship, which is really useful to configure logging for a group of loggers. How can I have python logging print the last part of a logger name?
You can set a filter to set a LogRecord attribute to the last part of the logger name, and use that in your format string. For example, running this script:produces this:foo Watch out - foo!  bar Watch out - foo.bar!  baz Watch out - foo.bar.baz!
The attributes available for use in logging are listed hereYou probably want your format to be '%(asctime)s %(levelname)s %(module)s - %(message)s'.
