In python dir displays all the names defined in namespace. I checked and it worked fine. But when I used dir(function_name) it didn't display the variables I created inside the function. Why?Here's a code sample:
As to why dir(youfunc) doesn't list local vars, it's quite simply because as documented dir(obj) lists obj's attributes , and local vars are not attributes of the function object. Outside the function itself, you can get a listing of a function's local vars names with yourfunc.func_code.co_varnames (note that arguments are local variables):but you won't obviously be able to access the local vars values from outside the function since those values only exist when the function is being executed.From within the function you can get the local vars using locals():
