I have a dictionaryand I want to define a function that will order them by the size of the set. That is, since "d" has 3 items in the value, "c" has 2 items, and "a" and "r" each have one item, I want a dictionary in that order. SoWhat I have so far isThis gives me a list, but I can't figure out how to have it give me a dictionary. I've looked at a lot of other questions and tried different variations of code and this is as close as I can get.(I'm using Python 3)
you need to use an OrderedDictsee https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.OrderedDictBased on their example 
Dictionaries are, by definition, unordered key-value pairs. Therefore, the code below is correct, as you can only get a list if you want it to be sorted. In other words, dictionaries cannot be sorted, so the task given is impossible.
