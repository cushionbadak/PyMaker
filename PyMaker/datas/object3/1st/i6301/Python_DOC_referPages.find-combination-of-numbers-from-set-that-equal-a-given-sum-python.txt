Edit:I know this question has been asked a million times, but I can't seem to find anything that works for my specific scenario.  For context purposes, I'm running Python 3.6 on a Windows OS.I've tried the following code:
This lineis wrong because you are using patterns of string formatting for things that are not strings. You probably wanted to doand still this is old syntax, you'd prefer the new syntax
Concerning SyntaxError: you used formatting in incorrect way. More on that on PyFormat site, just quick solution:
Your code doesn't work because Should beFurthermore you need to indent the line after your main declarationShould be thisAlso your code does not work completely as subset_sum([3,9,8,4,5,7,10,-9],1) does not return a result even though it should return [10,-9]=1.Furthermore, to improve on your code I'd recommend using memoization to avoid having to calculate the same subset more than once if you are doing this over large sets of numbers.
I believe this code works:It can be extremely slow as the number of possible combinations increases, which you can count mathematically and grows astronomically, so you feel like it is never going to end.N.B. I don't have Python 3.6 so the formatting will remain old-school here.Edit: Another note is that you should never use equality between floats, like in your termination condition with the new input you propose. You can have a look at this answer for inspiration for a if isclose(s, target) condition.
