I essentially need to make a simple calculator, that, when two sides are entered, it produces the third. I'm having a bit of a problem with the sqrt function. This is what I have so farAny help would be much appreciated!Edit - code updated(there are not spaces between sideC and ** and 2, but it was bolding it so I changed it)
I am assuming you are using Python 3.The input() function returns a string, not an integer. You will need to convert it from a string to an integer after you have checked that it isn't a ? input. To do this, use int()Don't use is for comparison, use ==Did you import the sqrt function from the math module?
Have you imported math in order to use sqrt()?
Math in ℝ is in the math module.Correspondingly, math in ℂ is in cmath.

I got it!import mathprint("It's triangle fun time! Enter the numbers you know, and a '0' for the number you don't.")sideA = (int(input("Side A: ")))sideB = (int(input("Side B: ")))sideC = (int(input("Hypotenuse: ")))if sideA is 0:if sideB is 0:if sideC is 0:
