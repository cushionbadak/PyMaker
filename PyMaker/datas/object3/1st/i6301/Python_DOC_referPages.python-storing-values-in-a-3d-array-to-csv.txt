I have the follwoing problem. I have a 3D array like matrix = np.zeros((30,30,100)) where every entry is a coordinate and gets a value. So matrix [0][0][0] is the coordinate x=0,y0,z=0 and has a value of 0. Now i want to store all the values in a csv like this where the first 3 rows are the coordinates and the 4th the corresponding value: Is there a fast way with numpy to do this?
You could use pandas, it can both reshape the array and save it as csv.Otherwise, you can apply to your array and then restore indices using one of the recipes in this question.
I imagine you get the coordinates with the indices:More sophisticated solutions are possible, but this should be the core. Have a look at: csv io in the python docs or nditer if you want a more sophisticated iteration method or use pandas (takes a little time to get the hang out of it).
