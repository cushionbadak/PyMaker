I am coming from an R background and am now trying to learn Python. At the moment, I am looking at how to do some calculations in Python that I use to do in R. For instance, to get the sum in R, I could do something likeor which gives the correct answer 5064.However, the following code in Python gives me 5060.0.What am I doing wrong?Edit: As suggested by Gregor, the R code can be better written as sum(floor(sqrt(x) / 10)).
In python, the range(a,b) generator provides an iterable from a to b-1, as reported in the documentation. To make a sum like that, jou need a range(1, 2016) 
Its because of the range function. Then last value is not included. So it is to be 2016 not 2015
your problem is that range(1,2015) only includes integers from 1 to 2014 included. you should use range(1,2016)But you don't need pandas and numpy to do this : list comprehension is a more pythonic way to handle basic operations if time optimization is not an issue:
