I have two  string arrays each with three columns.I want to compare first two columns of both 2-d arrays(having 3 cols and 4000 rows). if they match then i need those matching values.But my code is not working.Here is a sample.
EDITif array1[:2] == array2[:2]: compares all items from the index 0 to 2(2 is not included), and comes up with the same result as if array1[0] == array2[0] and array1[1] == array2[1]:. Also, it is simpler.(Thanks to Wyatt for comment)If your arrays are 2-dimensional:Output:BEFORE EDIT:If your array is one dimensionel, you don't need to say column, it is just item.  Then your job is easy like you have done above. Just, you have a few syntax errors. Use this code:Output:So, if you have any other problem, let us know.
There are a number of errors in this code snippet which will prevent it from even running without errors.Python lists are declared with commas between elements. For example,a declaration of a list of strings could be:array1 = ["this", "is", "a", "list"]Examples of using lists in Python (3) can be found here.The Python logical 'and' operator is not &. It is and. Seethis question.In Python, as in most languages, variables must be declared beforethey can be referenced. In your code, array3 is never declared. Youcan always declare an empty list like this:array3 = []
As always we need a sample data setHave a look at itIt seems that there are a few candidates... let's see if we can sort out the sub-lists of the first list where the first 2 elements are equal to the corresponding elements of the corresponding sub-list in the second list.A possible solution involves a list comprehension, using zip to pair corresponding sub-lists and filtering according to our criterium: where the comparison is done on two slices of the sub-lists, avoiding the use of the logical operator and.Comparing c with the dump of a and b (see input cell #4)it seems to me that the list comprehension procedure here proposed is correct.
