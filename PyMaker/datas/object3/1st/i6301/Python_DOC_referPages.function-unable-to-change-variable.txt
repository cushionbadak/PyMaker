I am trying to make a full-on guessing game with a shop that you can buy stuff with coins. but I had a function that was supposed to give the user a certain amount of coins depending on how many attempts it took them to guess the number. However, when I have a variable called 'coins' and when a player gets the number, I add coins to 'coins' it doesn't actually add coins. When I print 'coins' it still tells me 0. It's very confusing I know but I just want to fix this. I am using a mac with python 3, and am using two files, one for the main code, and the other for the functions. Do you see where I'm going wrong?Main Code:Functions:
To get it to work, you need only add return coins to the end of the guess_game function and collect the returned value in your main code as coins = guess_game(coins, attempt). However, if you'd like, you can simplify your code a little bit like so:With your main code as:Where the output from a sample run is as follows:
Your function uses coins in it's local scope. In order for the function to change the value of the outter scope (global) coins variable you need to explicity state that.Add global coins inside your function before changing coins value.Or, an alternative way is to return coins value from the function, and call your function coins = guess_game(attempt) Here is some useful resource for this subject
You should return the number of coins from the function and assign it to coins: Defining Functions
