Natural Text
Currently I'm learning Python text sentiment module via this online course and the lecturer failed to explain in enough detail how this piece of code works. I tried searching each piece of code individually to try piece together how he did it but it makes no sense to me.So how does this code work? Why is there a for loop within dictionary braces?What is the logic behind x before the for y in emotion_dict.values() then for x in y at the end?What is the purpose behind emotion_dict=emotion_dict within the parentheses? Wouldn't just emotion_dict do?
1 and 2The line emotions = {x for y in emotion_dict.values() for x in y} uses a set comprehension. It builds a set, not a dictionary (though dictionary comprehensions also exist and look somewhat similar). It is shorthand notation forThe x right after the { in the original set comprehension signifies which value to store in the set. In all, emotions is just a set (with no repeats) of all elements within all containers within the dictionary emotion_dict. Try printing out emotion_dict and emotion and compare.3In the function definition,the emotion_dict=emotion_dict means that the local variable with name emotion_dict gets set to the global variable similarly named emotion_dict, if you do not pass anything as the second argument. This is an example of a default argument.
