This question already has an answer here:Stop shutil.make_archive adding archive to itself                    1 answer                I've been trying to use make_archive from shutil library.Here is the code (with comprehensive comments):Here is an example of directory tree:If I run my script (with code above), the result is:Why is an additional zipfile_name.zip is created? Also, note that the second archive can't be open since it is invalid. I understand if no one has ever faced this issue before, but maybe my parameters are wrong and this is why I'm asking.
I also encountered this problem. Here's a simple trick to solve the issue: use a relative path as the base_name:The archive will be created in the parent directory, not interfering with the directory that is being archived.
