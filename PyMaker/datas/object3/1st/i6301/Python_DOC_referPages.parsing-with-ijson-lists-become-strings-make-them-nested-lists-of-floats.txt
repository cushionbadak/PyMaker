I have large .GEOJSON files that I parse using ijson. One data I load is coordinates listed as for example: "coordinates": [[[47335.8499999996, 6571361.68], [47336.2599999998, 6571360.54], [47336, 6571335.4]]]I'm able to load this data, having changed its type from Decimal.decimal() to float in the ijson object class. I use the following to parse the JOSN file.Everything ends up where it should, but the list of coordinates is string type. I need to be able to work with the individual points and xy-coordinates. I will have for example: df_rivers, where df_rivers["coordinates"] will contain such lists.I have triedSo I am able to access each point and coordinate, however it is quite cumbersome. In addition, point[1] suddenly became out of bounds in the middle of a temp_list. I have many of these lists, which are in reality much longer, and I need to be able to work easily with them.I don't care whether the fix lies in the loading of the data, or if I can apply it afterwards on the whole column as the script will rarely be run once finished. However, I will have 153 files with up to 60000 rows it will have to run through, so efficiency would be nice.I'm using Python 3.6.3
You can use ast.literal_eval to obtain the list object from the string: Here is a demo :Here is the Python documentation : Doc
