From my current script, I want to go to the sibling of parent. For example, my scriptA.py file is inside directoryIn this example, I have tried to represent the folder structure. I want to access the FileB/ FileC from ScriptA. So basically, I will first go to the DirB and then access them as these directories are also created dynamically hence hard-coding these will not work.
You can get the parent directory using os.path
You didn't write any code so I won't give a complete solution.glob.glob could help you:You then need a way to filter those scripts and pick the ones you want.
Take a look at os: https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.htmlFunctions you may find handy:os.getcwd() get current working directoryos.chdir(path) Change your working directory to path givenos.listdir(path=None) get list of contents in current dir, or path given. Good luck.
