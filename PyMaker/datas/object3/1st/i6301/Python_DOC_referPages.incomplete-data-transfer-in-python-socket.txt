I am creating a client server program on which client downloads server's files. it works fine in localhost, but the problem occurs in except localhost connection. I've tried googling but none of the solutions(from previously suggested to the same problem) works.Here is my code:I've tried different solutions but none of them worked!
Sockets have no concept of "messages" as you are using them. If you put 'YES' then 'some_filename' onto the socket, it's chance (helped by doing a local connection) that when you do a recv(4096) that it shows up as just 'YES' and not 'YESsome_f'....You need to either parse the stream into the messages yourself (store data received), or add a layer of something that has messages (like HTTP or ZMQ).If you want to host files, python -m http.server can do that for you.
