I have an output string like this:And I want to just extract one of the numerical values for computation, say iops. I'm processing it like this:But there are slight inconsistencies with some of the strings I'm reading in and my code is getting super complicated and verbose. So instead of manually counting the number of commas vs "=" chars, what's a better way to handle this?
You can use regular expression \s* to handle inconsistent spacing, it matches zero or more whitespaces:Using group name, you can construct pattern string from a list of column names and do it like:In this way, you only need to change names and keep the order correct.
If I were you,I'd use regex(regular expression) as first choice. By this python code, I find the string pattern that starts 'iops=' and continues number expression at least 1 digit.I extract the target string(3504) by using round bracket.you can find more information about regex fromhttps://docs.python.org/3.6/library/re.html#module-reregex is powerful language for complex pattern matching with simple syntax.
