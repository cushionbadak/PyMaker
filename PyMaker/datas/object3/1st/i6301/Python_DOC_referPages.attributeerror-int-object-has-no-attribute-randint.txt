The problem is on giving a new random number for user to guess it. It displays an error: AttributeError: 'int' object has no attribute 'randint'My code is right here:
Please make sure your files name are not random.py since python interprets this as a module.EDITchange your variable named random to something else. Like so,
It is randint, not randit. That's why python is unable to find it. Update:You are doing random = random.randit(1,100)that is you are overriding the imported random with your random variable. Name it something other than a python keyword/module/function name.For example: random_val = random.randint(1, 100)
