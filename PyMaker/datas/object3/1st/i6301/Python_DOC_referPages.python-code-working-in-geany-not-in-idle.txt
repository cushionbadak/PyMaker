I have started writing a code using Geany (working on a Linux). it works fine with Geany and when I try and simulate it on pythontutor.org everything seems to be correct, but IDLE (on a Macbook) won't execute it.this is my code:it should open the file, make a list of the words contained in it (I have one word for each line), choose a number which corresponds to a line and give me the word it has thus chosen at random.this is what I get from IDLE:thanks!!
You did not specifically ask a question, but I presume you want to know why, as well as what to do.  The doc for open says "The default encoding is platform dependent (whatever locale.getpreferredencoding() returns)."  If you have a file with a known non-ascii encoding, the safe, cross-platform thing to do is provide an explicit encoding argument in the open call.Since Python, not IDLE, executes open, I suspect that you should change the title to "Python code working on Linux but not OSX".  To test, run it directly with Python, from a command line, not from IDLE or Geany.
