I am subtracting two dates in python 2.7 and getting wrong result in seconds. Apparently difference between these dates  is more than 24h which is 86400s. But I am getting 44705s, why is that and how to fix it ?
Calling .seconds will only give you the seconds component of the timedelta object, which only takes into account seconds, minutes, and hours (see docs for more detail). If you want the entire timedelta in seconds, call total_seconds.
date1-date2 is datetime.timedelta(1, 44705).  You're only looking at the seconds portion.  Look at the days portion too.
