I need to read the header of a bmp file with python. I tried like this but it obviously returns just a bunch of non intelligible bytes:My idea was to find a module, or something fast, in order to log image info while opening it. I know about this function in matlab that does exactly what i want: imfinfo(). But I can't find a counterpart in python.To be clear, this is what I get with matlab:
You can use the imghdr module (which is in the python stdlib):This will extract the image type from the header, but that is all. There is nothing else in the Python standard library that can get more detailed information - you need a third-party library to do such a specialized task. To get an idea of the complexity of this, take at look at BMP file format. Based on the specification outlined there, it might be feasible to write some pure Python code to extract a few items of information, but it won't be easy to get it right for an arbitrary bitmap image file.UPDATE:Below is a simple script to extract some basic information from a bitmap header using the struct module. See the BMP file format mentioned above for how to interpret the various values, and note that this script will only work with the most common version of the format (i.e. Windows BITMAPINFOHEADER):output:
