Rules in applyRules is going to be asked to users, but it does not work what it should work which is [“character1:substitution”, “character2:substitution”]When user put ['b:c','c:d'], it prints c,c. However, it should print d when char is bThe function takes a single character and a set of rules as a list.And this is what I wrote so farWhat should I add to make it work appropriately?
If you have multiple rules, this becomes cumbersome. As long as your replacements are done on single characters, you can make this easy with str.translate. That, however, doesn't solve the problem of chained replacements, so you'll have to make use of a while loop that runs until there are no more changes.Single Character ReplacementFor replacement involving a single character, the solution simplifies. You could use a dictionary with get:This should be much simpler.
You need to apply each and every rule and also, preserve the new string at the same time since strings are immutable in python. You can use translate of str class. Following code works
