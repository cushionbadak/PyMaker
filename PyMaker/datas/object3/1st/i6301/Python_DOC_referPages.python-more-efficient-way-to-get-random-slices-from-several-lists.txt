Here's a piece of python code I wrote to get random characters from 4 lists and append them to a separate list:Is there a more elegant way to do this?
I'd recommend using random.choice + list.extend:
random.choice(seq)Return a random element from the non-empty sequence seq. If seq is empty, raises IndexError.source
