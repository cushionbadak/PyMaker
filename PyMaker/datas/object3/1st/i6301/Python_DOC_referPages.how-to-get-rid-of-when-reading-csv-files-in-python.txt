I am opening and reading one .csv file at a time from a folder and printing them out as follows:However, when I do print(line) the files are printing as follows:/Users/Sulz/Desktop/MSBA/Applied Data Analytics/Test_File/ownerfile_138.csv['']['2010-01-01 11:28:35', '16', '54', '59', '0000000040400', 'O.Coffee Hot Small', 'I', ' ', ' ', '14', '1', '0', '0.3241', '1.4900', '1.4900', '1.4900', '0.0000', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0.0000', '0.0000', '1', '44', '0', '0.00000000', '1', '0', '0', '0.0000', '0', '0', '', '0', '5', '0', '0', '0', '0', 'NULL', '0', 'NULL', '', '0', '20436', '1', '0', '0', '1'] How can I get rid of [''] before the list of all the data ??EDIT:I now tried reading it with the .csv module like this:  However, it still prints output like this: [] ['2010-01-01 11:28:35', '16', '54', '59', '0000000040400', 'O.Coffee Hot Small', 'I', ' ', ' ', '14', '1', '0', '0.3241', '1.4900', '1.4900', '1.4900', '0.0000', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0.0000', '0.0000', '1', '44', '0', '0.00000000', '1', '0', '0', '0.0000', '0', '0', '', '0', '5', '0', '0', '0', '0', 'NULL', '0', 'NULL', '', '0', '20436', '1', '0', '0', '1']
