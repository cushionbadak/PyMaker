This question already has an answer here:Search and replace a line in a file in Python                    13 answers                How to search and replace text in a file using Python?                    12 answers                I have the text file (input.txt)My goal is replace all the lines between the lines (*ELEMENT, TYPE=S9R5, ELSET=EB1) and (**) with a new lines.and keep the rest of the file unchanged. Any solution using: open('input.txt', 'w') as f1: would erase everything in the file and write the new two lines and this is not the thing I need.
This should do the job:I copied out your file into a file named input.txt and tested the code exactly and it gave the right output (i.e. changed the file in the intended way), so hopefully it works for you too!
