I have a list of boolean arrays constructed using the numpy where function, e.g.:A few notes:the real arrays have something like 10 000 elementsthere are several "true" windows on each arraythe "true" windows might overlap from array to arrayall arrays have the same length LI need to:1) combine all arrays into one single array with length L that will contain all "True" values2) recover for each "True" window the inicial and final indexany ideas?Thanks!EDITThe expected result is:    R = [False,True, True, True, True, False, True, True, True, False]In terms of code:Output:the desired result:
I am not sure what you mean when you say "Combine all arrays into one single array with length L that will contain all "True" values".  However, the the second item, recovering the initial and final indices for all true windows was kinda fun:
Let us first simplify your example to a case where there is an overlap between two sub-arrays.so from what I gathered from the question, the expected output would be:as that is where the "True" window's start and finish is (indexes 1 and 4).To achieve this result, we need to first flatten a in order to gt a 1-dimensional array of the concatenated sub-arrays. This is done with a.flatten(). Which gives:Now, we need to find the indexes where the value flips state (i.e. True --> False or False --> True). To do this with, we can compare the array of a.flatten() without the first element to the array of a.flatten() without the last element. Then use np.where on this boolean array to get the indexes of state change. N.B. the above technique was originally from this answer` by @Kith.So to implement that, we can do the following:which gives us the indexes of state change:which is actually one off as it is where the state changes, so before the start of the first window.We then need to chunk this array into 2s. This is done with np.split():which gives us a list of arrays of length 2 indicating the start and finish of a window:
