This question already has an answer here:What do ellipsis [â€¦] mean in a list?                    6 answers                Example Now I was curious if I could save the two patients, in a list, then i wanted to see a dictionary just to see how it works. I want to see if I could access the data through the list or dictionary, when I assigned them to the list, when I try to print the first position, when I try to search in google I get no results. So I can't find the next step if there is a step, if you can do this? I like to try to figure things out myself but I can't find results... So what does it mean? How would I extract the information if I can? Lastly I of course would not make a program without encryption with medical data, or other sensitive data, just trying this out. 
The ... in the question is an infinitely recursive list. It is not an instance of an Ellipsis object, this can be tested l = []; l.append(l); l == [[...]] will give False.The second is an Ellipsis object in a double list.(Credits @Patrick Haugh in the comments)python Ellipsis:Ellipsis  The same as .... Special value used mostly in conjunction  with extended slicing syntax for user-defined container data types.This stack overflow question explains what it does.Its interpretation is purely up to whatever implements the getitem  function and sees Ellipsis objects there, but its main (and intended)  use is in the numeric python extension, which adds a multidimensional  array type. Since there are more than one dimensions, slicing becomes  more complex than just a start and stop index; it is useful to be able  to slice in multiple dimensions as well. E.g., given a 4x4 array, the  top left area would be defined by the slice [:2,:2]
