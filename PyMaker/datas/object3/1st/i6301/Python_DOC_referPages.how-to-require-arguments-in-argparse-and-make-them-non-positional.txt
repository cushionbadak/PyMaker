Natural Text
I have a Python script where I would like to force all required arguments to be named (non-positional).So the following should work:python myscript --arg1 arg1 --arg2 arg2 python myscript --arg2 arg2 --arg1 arg1But the following should fail:python myscript arg1 arg2 python myscript --madeUpArg arg1 --arg2 arg2From what I can tell, in argparse if you make something required, it becomes a positional argument, so both of the second examples that I want to fail will succeed (even the second case, with the made up argument!). How do I get desired functionality?
No argument you haven't defined will be accepted as long as you don't call parse_known_args explicitly.To make an otherwise optional argument required, use the required keyword argument when defining it.
