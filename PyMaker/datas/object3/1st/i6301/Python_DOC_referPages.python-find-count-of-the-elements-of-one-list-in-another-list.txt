Let's say I have two lists list1 and list2 as:I want to find the count of the elements of list1 which are present in list2.Expected output is 4 because 3 and 4 from list1 are appearing twice in list2. Hence, total count is as 4. 
Use list comprehension and check if element exists Better one from @Jon i.e Output : 4
You can iterate first list and add occurences of a given number to a sum using count method.
You can use collections.Counter here, so a naive and rather ugly implementation first (mine). This doesn't take into account what happens if you've got duplicates in the first list (HT Jon), and a much more elegant version of this would be:
You may use sum(...) to achieve this with the generator expression as:As an alternative, you may also use Python's __contains__'s magic function to check whether element exists in the list and use filter(..) to filter out the elements in the list not satisfying the "in" condition. For example:For more details about __contains__, read: What does __contains__ do, what can call __contains__ function?.
