I am trying to create a dictionary from a list of lists. I have a list of name and marks like: to a dictionary with key as name and value as average marks like:I was trying to get each list and then convert it to dictionary value. But I am getting error.
I'd use an OrderedDict of lists, since it appears you'd like to maintain order.Now that you're done appending data to the dictionary, calculate the mean key-wise. If order is not paramount here, a vanilla {} dictionary would work just as well.
Using list comprehension :Or devide the data into two lists keys and values :Output :
Using standard Python methods:First I get all values belonging to a certain key and then I calculate the mean value. Also note that str is a built-in variable, so I replaced it with myList.
1 . Store the list of numbers by its key using defaultdict2 . Calculate the mean using statistics.mean#driver values :
You could do this using itertools.groupby:
Hope this helps
