So I want to be able to remove and add items in an inventory that I tried creating in my game but I keep receiving an error. This is my code:this is the error that I receive when I run my game:(pick up razor)You walked over and picked up your razor blade.It's been added to your inventory.
Your error is occurring because add_to_inventory has no parameters in the function definition, but you are trying to pass 'razor' as an argument to it. That's what TypeError: add_to_inventory() takes 0 positional arguments but 1 was givenmeans.Also, you are using the list append method, but you are making inventory a dictionary.Here are two options that you could use depending on the functionality desired, one for the dictionary and one for the list.
