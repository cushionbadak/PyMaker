I am creating a Django application, and during development I have created many classes which have a very similar structure, e.g.:I am wondering if there is a way to automatically generate these classes from the list of strings ["One", "Two", ..., <Name>]. I see that there are metaclasses in other SO questions like this, e.g. I could do something likeBut I am not sure what to put into ??? in my case since the variable is part of an object name.
Just put {'queryset': getattr(models, name).objects.all()} and so on.  getattr is important to know about if you're going to be doing any kind of metaprogramming.  Occasionally setattr as well but less often, especially if you're just building classes with type(...).
