How can I make this program more efficient?I wrote a program that generates (given a list 'words') a dictionary that takes a word as a key and words that can be paired with the key as values. Then I look through the words list again and see if they are not equal and they can be pair-able (by checking the tempPossiblePairs dict).I know this code is messay and inefficient, but I would like to hear some tips to make this more efficient.
I think you can boil this down to The *self.pair bit is unpacking the result of pair into the tuple (This is assuming pair returns something with only two elelments), and I think it requires you to have a relatively recent version of Python 3
