I am trying write a list to a csv file.I face several problems.writer = csv.writer(f) AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'writer'I used this link to solve it and it worked, and only printed the second for without writing the first and third for. this is the code writen by @gumboy The idea is to replace list that contains 1 with the list index.

What you are doing with the f = open('H.csv','w') is that it is write to the file but also writing over your data. What you need to do is use f =open('H.csv', 'a+') this appends new string everytime to the file.linkTo sort data useWith this code I was able to write to file what was printed on console.

(Also, rename the csv list, because csv is the name of the module.)The resulting csv file will look like this (the first column contains the costumers and the second the products):
