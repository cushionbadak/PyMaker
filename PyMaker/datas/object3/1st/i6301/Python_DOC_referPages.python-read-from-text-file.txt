Natural Text
I want my simple python program to go to a text file and collect 5 lines to print out.I have got this far but it returns the whole file which I don't want to do yet.Can anyone help?
How aboutread() reads the entire file. readline() reads only a line.The loop has 5 iterations and in each iteration, the next line from the file is appended to text via concatenation.You might also want to do exception handling.
