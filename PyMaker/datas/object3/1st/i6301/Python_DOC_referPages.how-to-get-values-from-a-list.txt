This question already has an answer here:Understanding slice notation                    31 answers                I've seen a few questions about copying parts from Arrays or list, but I still don't understand the logic behind it... It makes no sense for me that I can get each values by calling them by index, but it is not possible to get a part of the list by calling it by index, too...What I am expecting in the last line would be that the command returns the value with index two,three and four !Is there a command that does it the way I thought it would be?
You are missing that x[2:4] gets all values where the index is 2 <= index < 4. Therefore, you get index 2 and 3, but not 4. This is done so that you can always tell the size of a partial list (not just in python but in computing in general) by subtracting the upper bound by the lower bound. 4 - 2 = 2, therefore the list has two items in it.There is an interesting piece of writing by E.W. Dijkstra about this if you care to read it here.
The operation that you are performing :is called the slicing operation. The format of it such that, for a list[x:y] you get the values in index from the range x to y-1. ie, list[x]...list[y-1]Hence, when you do x[2:4] , you will get the values from Hence you have for :A few reading references :How to Slice Lists/Arrays and Tuples in Python UnderstandingPython's slice notation
You can do x[2:5]Because writing x[a:b]starts from index a up to and not including index bSo in your case you needed x[a:b+1]
