Let us Assume, I have a key value pair in python, such as the following.now I want to combine these values with:How can I do the output below in python?
You can use a dictionary comprehension like this (as of Python 2.7+):This assumes that the same keys exist in both a and b.If that's not the case, it's possible to work around that if necessary.
The other answers are based on the assumption that all dictionaries involved have all the same keys. If you aren't sure that this is the case, I recommend using collections.defaultdict:Additionally, this solution works for any number of dictionaries. Simply add all dictionaries you want to merge, to the tuple (a,b).
You can use zip() with dictionary comprehension to achieve that in one-line code like below:Output:
First thing coming to my mind is :This should work even if some keys are missing in one dict. I think this only works on the newer versions of python 3 though.
You can try this:Output:If you need to generate the "test1", "test2" values, etc, you can try this:Output:
Output:
I am assuming here that a and b contain the same keys. Then you can simply use the dict comprehension (Create a dictionary with list comprehension in Python):If you don't know whether b has the same keys, you can also test for that:
