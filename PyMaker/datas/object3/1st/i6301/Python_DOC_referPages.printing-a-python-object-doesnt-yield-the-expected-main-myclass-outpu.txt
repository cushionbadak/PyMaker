When I create a Class like thisprints <__main__.Task object at 0x7fc9be21cd0>.However, I was using a library and wanted to print an object, which yielded the following:how is this being constructed? value doesn't seem to be member variable or anything accessible? I was expecting something like <__main__.foo object at ...
It's generated by the __repr__() method. And like all other normal methods, the instance it's being run on is passed as the first argument.
As I was expecting a more explanatory answer, I found the answer in the Book "Fluent Python"  Basically the author of the library implemented the __repr__The repr special method is called by the repr built-in to get string representation  of the object for inspection. If we did not implement repr, vector instances would  be shown in the console like <Vector object at 0x10e100070>
