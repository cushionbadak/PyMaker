The program im writing is taking a list of strings as the input and is trying to remove the Chapter numbers. I have the function written but it currenly does not work. I have provided my function and a sample of the output! Thank you!Here is the current output with the not working function:Output
Since your strings have a similar patter that you need to remove, with a few variations (chapter number), its better to use python.re. With it, you have lot of flexibility in your pattern matching.So, all you need to do :#driver values :Breaking it down, you pattern looks like : So, whenever this pattern is found, the string is substituted, or if not found, just ignored.
Given a list of chapters, we can drop the chapter and numbers up to the first word in each chapter.GivenCodeOutputDetailsThe list comprehension splits the chapters into lists and the words within the lists.  Equivalently:Finally, itertools.dropwhile iterates each list and removes items until the predicate is not longer true.  In other words, keep dropping items up to the first that is neither "Chapter" nor a digit.The resulting chapters can be rejoined as strings if desired.
