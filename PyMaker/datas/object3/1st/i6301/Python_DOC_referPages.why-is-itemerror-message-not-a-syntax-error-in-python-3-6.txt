I found a bug in my code tonight where I had written:instead of:What I can't figure out is why the original line did not cause a syntax error.  What is going on there?  This is not inside a dict declaration; this is just a regular standalone line of code.
You've accidentally annotated item["error"] with the value "message".  (What that actually means is up to whatever code processes the annotations, which by default is nothing.)  Variable annotations are a new feature in Python 3.6.
