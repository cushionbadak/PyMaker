This is from this source code I am trying to understand. counts = {x: y for x, y in counts.items() if x in self.symbols}I am new to python and am trying to convert this whole application to .NET. Thanks a lot for any help.
Your snippet filters a dictionary by key.in C# this would look like:
dict comprehensionIt's a comprehension that returns a dict. Essentially, it iterates a pair of values through counts.items() and then creates a dict (key -> value mapping) out of it.Let's say counts.items() is [(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6)]. Then, for x, y in counts.items() will iterate with the following:if x in self.symbols filters the comprehension. So if self.symbols were, say, [1, 4, 5], it would only iterate through x = 1, y = 2 and x = 5, y = 6.Then, the final dict is:
This is dictionary comprehension. Some five lines of code can be written in a short form like this
From a high-level perspective, the one-liner you provided updates a dictionary  instance (i.e. counts) and removes the elements that are not in self.symbols, effectively filtering counts.Basically there is a dictionary counts, and what is being done is that each key-value pair (x, y) in counts is checked and a new dictionary instance that only includes the key-value pairs for which the key x exists in self.symbols is created. Finally, that newly created dictionary instance is assigned to counts. The formal name of this technique is dictionary comprehension.The following code, which may seem more familiar to you, is equivalent to what you have given in your question.
