I have searched this site, but only find examples with one list e.g. a=[20,32,28,32]. but I have 5 different rows (is each row a separate list?)Any help would her very much welcomed.

Let's have a data.txt which contains out data like below:data.txtNow we are going to read the data and process those as required. Finally we will write the processed data in a new file called output_data.txt. The program can be solved in the following way:output_data.txt contains:There are many alternatives to solve this. I have showed the most trivial one.
try this. COde need to be changed if number of columns changes
