I have a file at location a/b/c/d/e/f/x.xml . i need to find the absolute path of the the dir d, i.e a parent dir up the hierarchy that matches the dir name d . I can obtain the filename's current dir as os.path.abspath(__file__) . i have see the documentation for pathlib and glob, but am unable to figure out how would i use them.  Can someone helpEDIT:Thanks to all the answers below, I have gotten to a one linerI also need to append the actual dir name to it, i.e, the output should be a/b/c/d . An ugly solution is below (uses os.path.join twice). Can someone fix it (by adding an element to the iterator or to the list in one line :)
You use can use dirname on abspath of __file__ to get the full path of the x.xml:os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))Then you can extract any part of your path. If you want to get the d folder:
You can use pathlib's Path.resolve() and Path.parents:
Use regexp and cut:
Assuming you have a file in your current dir, you can get it absolute path (starting at root) with abspath:Thes the magic word is os.path.split that splits a pathname into the last component and the head (everything in front of it). So to get the absolute path of what comes before d just iterate the components:You can control that findinit('/a/b/c/d/e/f/x.xml') gives as expected /a/b/cAlternatively if you want to use the pathlib module, you can search the parts for a specific component:
I found the one-liner finally:wouldnt hve been possible without others answers though. thanks a lot.
