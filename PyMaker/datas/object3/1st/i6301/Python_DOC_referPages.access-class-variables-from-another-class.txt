I have a simple class A that gets the name from users. Then I want to create a class B that prints out this name. I tried:Then I call these methods:This returns the errorI know that I did not assign a class variable in the class A, and thus the name attribute goes with specific instances, not the entire class. However, the name attribute has to connect with every specific instance because it changes from the case to case. Then how should I get this name in class B? 
Change your class B to this:The print_name method probably should be decorated as a "static method". The property "name" of self is an instance attribute which can not be referred directly from the class itself.
That's correct: name is an instance attribute, not a class attribute.  IN this case, m1 has a name, but class A does not.  You need to access the name of the input parameter, not attempt to print a class attribute.You also need to make B.print_name a class function, since you're not calling it from an instance of B.Output:
Edit: The answers suggesting @staticmethod are ideal if you understand what it does.Output:
In this instance A is the name of the class, and you should not give it as the default argument for calling the print_name method. Have a look at keyword arguments for Python, and you will see that what you have written actually means that you have the default value set to the .name property of the class A, which does not exist unless the class is instantiated (i.e. an object is created of the class).Your B class should read:
