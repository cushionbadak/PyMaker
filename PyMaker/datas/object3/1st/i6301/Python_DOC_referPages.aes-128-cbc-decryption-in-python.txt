I'm trying to implement this code in python (I'm new to python) and it gives me the following error:AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'decode'If we remove .decode ('hex') only to avoid such error:but it gives me the following error:ValueError: IV must be 16 bytes longsince the algorithm would need the .decode ('hex') that I had to removeDoes anyone have any idea how I could do to make this code work?
You are using Python 3, not Python 2. You can't use decode() on strings in Python 3, they are already text, so bytes-to-bytes codecs such as 'hex' can't be applied that way.Use the binascii module instead:andSo to decode from a hex string to bytes, use binascii.unhexlify(), and to encode back to hex, use binascii.hexlify(). Note that you you can't convert data in-place, you do have to store the result back in a variable (or print out the value, etc.).Demo:
