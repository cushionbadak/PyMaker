list1=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]I want to create a list [[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]] from list1.I tried list(list1) but it's showing only [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] instead of [[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]].
Just initialise a new list which has a sub-list that is list1.This is done with:which will give:Or alternatively, when you are defining list1, you can define it already nested inside another list:Note that when you were trying to nest the original list inside another list, using list() will not work.If you read the documentation:The constructor builds a list whose items are the same and in the same order as iterableâ€™s items. iterable may be either a sequence, a container that supports iteration, or an iterator object. If iterable is already a list, a copy is made and returned, similar to iterable[:]. For example, list('abc') returns ['a', 'b', 'c'] and list( (1, 2, 3) ) returns [1, 2, 3]. If no argument is given, the constructor creates a new empty list, [].The key thing mentioned here is that list creates a list from an iterable. As list1 is a list already, it is an iterable. This means that the list() constructor will treat as an iterable and create a new list from the elements inside list1 - creating a copy of it. So that is why it wasn't working as you expected it to.
Have you tried?
You'll have to put it in another list using. When you declare a list, you put them in two square brackets. If you want to make a list of lists, you'll have to use them twice. 
This works for me
