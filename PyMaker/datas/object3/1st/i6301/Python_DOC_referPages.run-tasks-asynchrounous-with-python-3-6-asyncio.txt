I started working on a new Python 3.6 project that communicates with AWS Boto. Since spinning up EC2 instances takes some time, I started working with the asyncio library, I am having some troubles however understanding it.I want to asynchronously spin up 2 EC2 instances. However, if I call run_tests I get the following error:ERROR:asyncio:Task was destroyed but it is pending!This is currently my code: What am I doing wrong?
You're using create_task to schedule jobs on the loop, but nothing waits for them to complete. The one_service_per_vm will return immediately.You can await for many tasks with asyncio.gather
