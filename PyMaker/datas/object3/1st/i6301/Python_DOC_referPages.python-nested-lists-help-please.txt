My data set is a list of lists e.g.Here, the grade lies at index 2 of each sublist. How do I do this?
You can try thisoutputThe built-in function max can take a key-function argument to help it make its decision. It works the same as a sorting key-function as described in the Sorting How To.
This will return a list of all the names that got the highest grade:If info is not an empty list, max_persons[0] will always contains a name of one of those who got the highest grade
