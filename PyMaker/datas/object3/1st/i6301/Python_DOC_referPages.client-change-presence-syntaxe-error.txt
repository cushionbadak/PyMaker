Your Python script use the await expression and this expression was introduced in Python 3.5 .From Whatâ€™s New In Python 3.5:New syntax features:PEP 492, coroutines with async and await syntax.You have to upgrade your Python interpreter to Python 3.5 or newer.
You are most likely using Python 3.4.From here, you have 2 options. Either install Python 3.5 or 3.6 and continue using async/await, or convert your code to use the Python 3.4 syntax
