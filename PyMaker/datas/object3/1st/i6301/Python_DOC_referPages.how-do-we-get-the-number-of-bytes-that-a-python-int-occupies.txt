I am not looking for a constant recording the maximum value representable with an int; I am looking to find out the maximum amount of memory that an int can occupy. Consider the following code:For my particular machine, the output is:Apparently, some ints are 24 bytes long, others are 28, still others use 36. How many bytes are required to hold an int of any size?
How many bytes are required to hold any size int?As many as are required. There's no limit on the size of ints, they are of arbitrary size as their documentation states.*sys.maxsize does not represent the maximum size of int objects. It is the maximum value of a Py_ssize_t which is used (in CPython) for holding values of indexes. For example, just create a larger int than maxsize :So, you get the number of bytes for a given int by using getsizeof on it. *Bound, eventually, by available memory.
