I have a dataframe, and I want the unique strings of a specific column. The strings are in Hebrew.Because I'm using pandas dataframe, I wrote: all_names = history.name.unique() (history is the data frame with a name column).I get strange duplicates with the \u200f character. Like ערן and another one with the  \u200fHow can I remove these characters? (From the original data frame)
You can clear-up your name strings by filtering out all non-letters and non-whitespaces (Unicode-wise) by applying a re.sub-based function to all the values in the name column.For example (assuming Python 3, which handles Unicode properly):The \w includes all Unicode word characters (including numbers) and \s includes all Unicode whitespace characters.By the way, the \u200f (aka the RIGHT-TO-LEFT MARK) that's bothering you is in the Unicode codepoint category "Other, Format":so, you can be sure it'll be removed with the filter above.
