I want to create a random list of names from a from a bigger list of names. The problem is, there is no space between the names that are generated. I cannot understand how to put space. Here's my codeThe result is something like this:SaraAdamDickPopeyeSaraPopeyeLoryHow can I add space between the names? Also, can anyone suggest a shorter way to do this code?
You can add an additional empty empty string at the original concatenation:Or, more precisely, use ' '.join in list comprehension:
To avoid leading or trailing spaces, check if length of final_list is already greater than zero.If you don't want explicit checking, you can make use of strip function to remove leading and trailing spaces after you construct the final_list.
