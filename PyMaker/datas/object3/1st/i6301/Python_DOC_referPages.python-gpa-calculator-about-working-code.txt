this is a GPA calculator code in my textbook. I'd like to ask about a few this I don't understand here.What does current_cumm_gpa, total_credits = cumm_gpa_info mean below? Does it create a new array? I tried simpler but it doesn't work.
From  this line:We can see that cumm_gpa_info is a tuple of two values. Then current_cumm_gpa, total_credits = cumm_gpa_info unpacks the values in the tuple to two variables, the first to current_cumm_gpa and the second to total_credits. It's a simpler way of doing:From the docs:This is called, appropriately enough, sequence unpacking and works for  any sequence on the right-hand side. Sequence unpacking requires that  there are as many variables on the left side of the equals sign as  there are elements in the sequence. Note that multiple assignment is  really just a combination of tuple packing and sequence unpacking.
Tracing your program we see the following :So we see that cumm_gpa_info is a Tuple. Now this is passed to the function.So as we can see, the values were unpacked from the tuple and assigned to current_cumm_gpa & total_credits respectively.It is similar to doing : Note : sorry if its not exactly how it would look on a console. Can't get to my PC, writing it out on my mobile right now. So have put it approximately how it would look.
