I have a xarray.DataArray:I found several answers for lists, but I am not able to do it for an array.Tried
try a1 = a1[1:] because that should work perfectly
Try other brackets (the round ones):Edit: I found the second answer very useful, but it's about list since there are no arrays in Python?Remove object from a list of objects in python
