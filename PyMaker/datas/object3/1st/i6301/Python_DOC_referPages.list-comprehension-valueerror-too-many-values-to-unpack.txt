This works:As well asIf you are getting a 'ValueError: too many values to unpack' exception, process must be producing iterables that have more than two items.Unwind the list comprehension and Handle the exception - print something relevant in the except suite to see what might be going wrong, then work backwards to the source. something like
You need to debug. There must be some items in your list that are not pairs as you expect.One way you can find them would be:This will give you a list of the problem indexes and items in your list.If that gives an error- for example, a TypeError because the value object has no __len__ method- then change it to:
