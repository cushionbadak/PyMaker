I wrote two set of codesSet 1:Set 2:You can see that this is to create a set of numbers, by input, then calculate the sum of the square of each number.The difference between Set 1 and Set 2 is merely a print() lineAssume I inputed: 4 7 2 8 5 for both setsfor Set 1:I get: for Set 2:I get:How could one print() line change the calculation logic?
map returns an iterator. By calling list on it you're consuming it, thus leaving it empty for the following code. If you want to reuse the sequence of numbers several times (e.g., for printing and then summing), you could save the list:
Your question had been well answered in @Mureinik's answer, but just if anyone is interested, you could do this in a one-line sum:You could actually do the whole code in one-line:
