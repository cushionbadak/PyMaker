I am getting a syntax error while trying to index a python dict:Here is the key of the dict.:So what I am assuming is the key of the dict is (<oemof.solph.network.Bus object at 0x7f3e9c6b3ea8>, <oemof.solph.network.Transformer object at 0x7f3e9c52ce08>)Problem is that I get an syntax error, while trying to index the o_model.flows with the key, which is mentioned above.Normally I was expecting to get the value(<oemof.solph.network.Flow object at 0x7f3e9c50d5f8>) of the dict via, but instead I get an syntax error:What I do wrong?Some Extras:
Your key is a tuple of two objects (Bus, Transformer), so in order to index it, I suppose you have to store that tuple somewhere when that dictionary is created in order to access it later or to extract the key. You can use this:Example:Why can't just type (<oemof.solph.network.Bus object at 0x7f3e9c6b3ea8>, <oemof.solph.network.Transformer object at 0x7f3e9c52ce08>) as key?Because that is just the human-readable representation of that objects given that there is no string assigned for printing. Common keys, as strings, are also objects at certain location e.g. (<str object at 0x7f45f4f52c36>), but its bytes are intended to be interpreted as characters when printed.So you don't use what is printed for indexing, you should use the object itself.Example:
