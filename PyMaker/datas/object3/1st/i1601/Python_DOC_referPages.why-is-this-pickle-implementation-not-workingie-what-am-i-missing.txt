In this code i am trying to use pickle to permanently store the values for the new username created when the user creates a new account but come up with logical errors. and the values in the dictionary still stay the same.(I know i am clearly missing something obvious here but I actually don't know what that is)  
You're never opening the pickled file, and so your code reuses the same dictionary input repeatedly.You should just create a script to first create the pickle file, then replace the definition of users that you have with pickle.load method callIf you want a readable file, I'd suggest json module rather than pickle. If you want to more easily query the users, then sqlite3Also not really relevant here, but password hashing would be a good idea to learn for any such project with accounts, rather than storing data in plaintext
