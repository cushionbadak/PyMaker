I am trying to solve this problem of finding the permutation of a given list using the code below. But, the list, final keeps appending the same thing again and again. It should return [[1,2,3],[2,1,3],[2,3,1],[1,3,2],[3,1,2],[3,2,1]] but instead it returns [[1,2,3],[1,2,3], [1,2,3],[1,2,3],[1,2,3],[1,2,3],[1,2,3],[1,2,3],[1,2,3]]. I have been trying to fix this for a while now and would really appreciate your help.
you change your list in-place instead of creating a new list every time. your final list contains references to the same list in the end.a fix for that is to wrirtenote: itertools.permutations would do that job for you.this post might help understand what is going on here.and as mentioned in the comment: you still do not get all the permutations. this might work for you:
