I've also tried #!/Users/johan/anaconda3/bin/python.After searching for hours, now I really don't know how to solve this. How do I specify to run with Python 3? Any help is appreciated. I guess it's probably still a path problem. Please kindly educate me what I don't understand about PATH in general. I do know PATH is where shell looks for the executable. But why are we inserting PYTHONPATH and PYTHONHOME here instead of just adding it to PATH? What are PYTHONPATH and PYTHONHOME for? (I've read PYTHONHOME documentation but I don't understand.) EDIT (hello.py for testing package imports):
In PYTHONPATH there must be the paths of the modules(so the minimum is site-packages) so the solution is:You must also place the path of the python binary that is used:
