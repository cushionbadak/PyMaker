I have a function that sorts a data set based on start and end dates and returns the top value. I was hoping to create a for loop that would allow me to run the function for all five year ranges in one go.I was hoping to loop this function for the following year ranges: 1950-1960, 1960-1970, 1970-1980, 1980-1990, and 1990-2000.I was trying something like this, but I couldn't get it to work. I am also not sure how to properly create my list of date ranges.
You could do something like this:
Since your function has multiple args you can either unpack and use the map method, or use list comprehensions. Alternatively you could the itertools.partial method and use map over that. The easiest in this case is the list comprehension. Here is an example:
Here's one suggestion, using np.vectorize():Note from the documentation, The vectorize function is provided primarily for convenience, not for performance. The implementation is essentially a for loop.
