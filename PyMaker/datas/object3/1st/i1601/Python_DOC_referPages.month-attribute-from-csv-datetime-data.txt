There is no easy answer on the request. You have data format that is not recognizable by datetime libarary for the time of writing this post.You need to create your own utility function, huckish solution:Input format would be mm/dd/yy/ hh:mm:ss:Now, having ugly utility function and parser for the date you have all arsenal to create datetime in Python. You need to think and combine pieces together.For more details take a look on documentation documentation that should answer on some your questions.
