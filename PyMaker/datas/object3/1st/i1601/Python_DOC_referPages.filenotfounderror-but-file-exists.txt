I am creating a Python application that imports many JSON files. The files are in the same folder as the python script's location. Before I moved the entire folder someplace else, the files imported perfectly. Since the script creates a files if none exists, it keeps creating the file in the home directory while ignoring the one in the same folder as it is in. When I specify an absolute path (code below):It spits out a FileNotFound error.Keep in mind that I am perfectly able to access it with the same absolute path when I operate from terminal. Can somebody please explain what I need to do in order for the files to import correctly?Also, I am creating this application for multiple users. While /Users/23markusz/Documents/CincoMinutos-master/verbconjugations.json does work, it will not on another user's system. This file is also in the SAME FOLDER as the script so it should import correctly.UPDATE:While my issue is solved using os.path.expanduser(), I still do not understand why python refuses to open a file that is within the same folder as the python script. It should automatically open the file with just the filename and not the absolute path.
"~" isn't a real directory (and would not qualify as an "absolute path"), and that's why the open doesn't work.In order to expand the tilde to an actual directory (e.g. /Users/23markusz), you can use os.path.expanduser:
