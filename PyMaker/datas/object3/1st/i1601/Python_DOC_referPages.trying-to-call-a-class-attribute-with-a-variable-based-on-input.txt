Natural Text
I am trying to call an object attribute with a variable based on user input. This is for a text game. The idea is the player types in 'hat', for example, and this function checks the player object's self.inventory = [] for Item objects named 'hat', and if such an object exists it will append the Item object to the player object's corresponding attribute, in this case self.helm = [].To do this I am trying to have equipItem be a variable equal to the equipping item's class type which should be the same as one of the player objects' equipment attributes.But of course this throws an error because 'equipItem' in not a player attribute. So my question is how might I achieve the result I am after? Can  I use a variable to call object attributes?I understand this is all probably quite janky and I am not married to this approach by any means, so any suggestions other approaches are welcome as well!Player class and Item class below:
To get an object's attribute by name, use getattr builtin function. For example: getattr(currentPlayer, equipItem).append(i). To assign to an attribute, use setattr.
