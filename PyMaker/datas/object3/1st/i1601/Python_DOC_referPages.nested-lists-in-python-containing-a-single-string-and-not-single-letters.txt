Natural Text
I need to load text from a file which contains several lines, each line contains letters separated by coma, into a 2-dimensional list. When I run this, I get a 2 dimensional list, but the nested lists contain single strings instead of separated values, and I can not iterate over them. how do I solve this?result:I need each letter in the nested lists to be a single string so I can use them.thanks in advance

Using the strip() function will get rid of the new line character as well:
