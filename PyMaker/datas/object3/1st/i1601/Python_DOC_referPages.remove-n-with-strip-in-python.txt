Natural Text
I'm working on a file text, but, as it has spaces at the beginning too, when I try to delete my \n using the strip mode and list comprehension, I get a list with empty elements (" ") and I don't know how to delete them. I have a text and my code is:but I get a list like this: I wanted to know if I can work it out with the strip method, otherwise with another method. 
You can use a generator to read all the lines and strip() the unwanted newlines.From the generator you only use those elements that are "Truthy" - empty strings are considered False. Advantage: you create only one list and get rid of empty strings:Write file:Process file:You could do the similarly:but that would execute strip() twice and would be slightly less efficient.Output:Doku:strip()truth value testingA suggested alternative from Eli Korvigo is:with is essentially the same - replacing the explicit list comp using a generator comp with a map of str.strip on  f (resulting in a generator) and applying a filter to that to feed it into a list.See built in function for the docu of filter,map,bool.I like mine better though ;o)
You are getting those empty string because few of lines were just empty line breaks. Here's the code for weeding out these empty strings.Without lambda and using map:Another solution is:For second solution is source is: https://stackoverflow.com/a/15233379/2988776For performance upgrades refer to @Patrick 's answer
From the data you showed us, it looks like there is a line with just a space in it. With that in mind, you have to decide whether this is something you want or not.In case you want it, then your code should look something like this:In case you don't want lines with just whitespace characters, you can do something like:In this case, we avoid stripping the: "   a word with leading and trailing spaces    " to "a word with leading and trailing spaces", since in some cases it might change the semantics of the line:)
