This question already has an answer here:Why does del (x) with parentheses around the variable name work?                    1 answer                python assert with and without parenthesis                    5 answers                One of my professors used case 2 to delete item from list.As per python documentation case 1 is right and there is also another syntactic way exist from this answer so case 3 also right, but as per my knowledge there is no del method exist in python, how case 2 is valid. I searched whole python documentation but could not find it.  Update:if i write del method myself in my module and use case 2 at same time, how python interpreter differentiates between them or will it through an error, although i never tried until now
All of them are the same, del is a keyword as yield or return, and (list[1]) evaluates to list[1]. So del(list[1]) and del (list[1]) are the same. For the base case, since you dont have the () you need to force the extra space, hence del list[1].EDIT: You cannot redifine del since it is a language keyword.
The parenthehis is not mandatory with keyword (like if or del), but can put some if you want.it's exactly the same thing
