I am trying to calculate some sentence probabilities.I have a dictionary that contains some values for different letters:I then have separate sentences in a list such as:What i am trying to do is some probability calculations so that it searches the sentence in a list and multiplies the values for exampleaabc would be 0.2777*0.2777*0.3333*0.388888How would i search this list for each independent string and do this multiplication?
You can use reduce to reduce your sentence into its final probability (note that if a character does not have a probability, I just use 1 to multiply):
This is a pretty non-fanciful way of doing it:EDIT :If we want to use check if the dictionary has values, we can do the following and use unk instead: 
You could use a double for loop. The outer for would iterate over the sentence list, and the inner for can iterate over each letter in the sentence. Python for loop syntax is for item in iterable_object: <code to run>. Try using this information and see how far you can get. 
You can use list comprehension and a for loop to do this. prob is a dictionary of probabilities and string is the string. in iterates over each character in the string.
