I have a wireless sensor node that transmits wirelessly to a receiver connected to my computer. I use this command to see the data in real timeI am new to Python, but I was able to develop a piece of code as show below to capture the stdout and takes frames from a camera connected to the same computer. That is when a packet (data) is received, at that timestamp, a frame will be captured. It is working fine, except the fact that its running slow. I am running my sensor at a rate of 10 Hz (transmitting every 0.1 sec.) but the code does what is required at a slower rate. I know that is because I am using cv2.imwrite() (I commented out this part and that helped in reducing the delay). But also, as discussed in this post and its said (as I understand) that using shell=True can invoke extra shell process and thus increase the delay.Also, looking at this, Popen() seems to be causing delays as well. A solution is proposed in the second link, but I do not really understand how to modify it to work for me. I appreciate any helpThank you 
Update:I got this advice from a friend and it worked.Calling the cam = cv2.VideoCapture(-1) outside the save_webcam function (as a global variable) reduced the delays a lot. In this case, the camera will be turned on one time and then capturing images will be done each time save_webcam is called...hence, turning on and off the camera was slowing the process. However, I would like to enhance the program more, as it get stuck sometimes. So, anyone understands what is in this post and how my stdout part should be modified, then please comment here. I appreciate this.
