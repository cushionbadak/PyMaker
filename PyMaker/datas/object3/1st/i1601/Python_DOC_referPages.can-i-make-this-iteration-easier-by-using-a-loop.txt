So i'm relatively new to python but i have used loops in previous programs i have made but they were relatively simple. I was wondering if there was a method that involved a loop or some other way to make this iteration more concise.Basically is there a way for me to have a variable called 't' that holds values for t1,t2 and t3 in like a list which is then used in 'eq' and 'der' instead of copying and pasting the same piece of code?I have already tried to look for an answer on here and other places but the solutions i have found so far don't seem to work with what i have got/i'm not python literate enough to understand them.Thanks in advance.
Might be a little easier to read as:
Yes, iteration can help here. Add your values to a list, then t? is the last value in the list so far; replacing your t? references with t[-1] gives:The general principle is one of accumulation, where you produce the running output of a repeated application of a function. So the itertools.accumulate() function could help here too:The above produces an unending series of decay values:You could look into creating a numpy universal function so you can do the same with the numpy.ufunc.accumulate() method.However, I suspect that your formula can be re-cast to not depend on the previous input, but only as a formula of starting amount and t as time, at which point you can use full numpy vectorised calculations.
