I am trying to delete rows in SQLite based on Count and * of days.Instead of writing multiple SQL commands like this:and so on...I am trying to find a way to use for loop where it increments Count and the * daysI tried this:I am getting a IndexError: tuple index out of range under days = row[7].  I looked up the error and changed the number see if it would fix it, still indexerror.Sample data of the result table looks like this: "select * from result;" Columns exported from Splunk: src_ip, 'min(_time)', CountAm I getting the concept for the script correct? Any suggestions on the indexerror? Thank you!
