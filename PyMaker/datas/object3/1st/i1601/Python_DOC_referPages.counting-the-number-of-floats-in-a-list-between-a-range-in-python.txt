I've been stuck on this task for a while. I've managed to generate 1500 coordinates that give me a float between 0 and 2 (x,y), using the code below.However now I need to create a counter that counts the number of floats between 0 and 1 and outputs it to the user. Ive tried using If statements and while loops. I've also had a snoop around the internet and am unable to find anything of use. Does anyone know how to work this out?Kind regards.
You can use a simple conditional sum() over your tuples and sum up 1 if x or/and y are smaller then 1:OutputThis is essentially a generator expression that filters out only those pairs that match the part after if .... from your generated coordinatesI choose the sum(1 ... ) approach because that way you do not have to create a list to take its len()  ... it is more memory friendly if you just need the count of elements then producing all the elements.Alternate way from jpp's comment:this works because a sum over 10 True 's give 10 - each True counting as 1:
This should get you started. It's another list comprehension checking your list of coordinate pairs to see if each x and y is within the interval (0,1).If your only goal is to count all the pairs such that the x,y pairs are in the interval (0,1) then while loop would be more efficient by avoiding creating lists.
