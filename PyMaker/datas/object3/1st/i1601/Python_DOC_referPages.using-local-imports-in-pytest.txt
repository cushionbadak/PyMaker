I have never really fully understood how packages are handled in Python and I'm having a problem with that right now. But googling doesn't seem to help as I find the topic really confusing.I have a project with this structure:I am using Pytest for running unit testing and currently inside the  "test_string_utils.py" file I have the following:But I go to the folder "project_name" and try to run tests with any of this command I get errors:ValueError: attempted relative import beyond top-level packageI know about the -m argument for python, but it seems that  running "pytest -m" has a completely different behavior.How can I solve this? Am I using the wrong folder architecture? I don't think what I'm building should be a pip package (which would simplify imports) 
did you try : from src.utils.string_utils import StringUtilsClass without .. before src?or from string_utils import StringUtilsClass
