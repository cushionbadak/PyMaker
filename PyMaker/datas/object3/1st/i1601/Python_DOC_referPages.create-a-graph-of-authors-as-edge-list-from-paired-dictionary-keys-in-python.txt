I am trying to create an adjacency list in python for coauthorship graph.I have created a dictionary pf authorI have created edge in this way.but I want to do it using for loopI want this loop to iterate through each key.and create edge like this so that an edge can be created between key[a1] and key[a2],.in my for loop it is actually an edge between key[a1] and key[a1].and when it reach to last key[a4] connect it first key[a1]any idea? 
You can use list slicing on the dict.keys() in combination with zip() to get your tuples to put into your graph:Output:with those tuples you can do:You should keep in mind that the order in which keys are presented might vary - if you need to ensure insertion order you need to use:python 3.7 up guarantees insertion order on dicts CPython 3.6 up has insertion order by implementation detail/sideeffector use an OrderedDict to begin with ( or use keys = sorted(d.keys()) )For dict insertion order, read information @  Are dictionaries ordered in Python 3.6+?
