I have a large list of strings. Each string has a number of segments separated by a ";":I want to split each string by the ";" and save the resulting list. I am currently using: Is there a faster way to do this?
If I understand you correctly, you can try itertools.chain and unpacking a list comprehension:I added a [:-1] to drop the last empty element of the split(';').  If however you need that empty element, just remove [:-1].Since chain runs on compiled code it should be much faster than the python interpreter.The run time for 10000 lines are:
Every time you do player_parts = player_parts + parts, you're combining two lists into a new list and assigning that list to player_parts. That's very inefficient. Doing player_parts.extend(parts) would greatly improve performance, since it's adding the contents to the end of the original player_parts list.However, it looks like you may be adding some empty strings to the player_parts list. So let's see if there's a better way.It sounds like you have a file like this:And you want this result:So this should work:If you're comfortable with comprehensions, you can do this:
As far as I know list comprehensions are always a good approach if speed is important.
