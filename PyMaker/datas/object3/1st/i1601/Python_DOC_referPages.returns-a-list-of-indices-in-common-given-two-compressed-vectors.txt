for example, how to return the common index by a function below?here is my code but it seems not working
You can use set intersection on flattened list of values:References:set.intersection().Flattening lists using chain.from_iterable().
You can change your function to:wich then prints:This also handles the case for all keys:Output:returning a list of tuples of (keyname, [list of identical values])You might still want to guard against d1 & d2 being not dictionaries using isinstance(...) and throwing ValueErrors to make it more foolproof.
