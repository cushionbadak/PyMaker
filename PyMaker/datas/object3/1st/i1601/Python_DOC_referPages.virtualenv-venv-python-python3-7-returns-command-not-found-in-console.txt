This question already has an answer here:Virtualenv Command Not Found                    16 answers                I am trying to create a virtual environment by executing this command:virtualenv venv --python=python3.7 but it returns 'command not found' error
Personally, I think virtualenv is deprecated now that venv comes with Python 3.7 (https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).Virtual environments are created like so with venv (according to the docs):I don't think venv is a virtualenv command (https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/userguide/#usage; https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/#creating-virtual-environments), and at least not for what you are trying to do. The command for new virtual environments with virtualenv is virtualenv ENV.
maybe you should install virtualenv first:maybe you should check the virtualenvwrapper, which is based on virtualenv and much easier to manage your virtual environment.
