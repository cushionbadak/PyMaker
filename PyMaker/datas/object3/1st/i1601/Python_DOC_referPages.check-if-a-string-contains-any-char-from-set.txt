Actually, i'm working on a task from SPOJ. How to check if a string contains any char from set, but first char from string where a char from set occur can not be deleted. F.e.Have a string and a set of vowels: I want in result a string This should return True when occurence of any char in set is equal 1. I know that argument for a method .count() must be str, not set.
just use a regular expression as mentioned if you expect it to skip the first match of the set as opposed to just the first letter you will need a different solutionthe easiest is to split it into two stepsfirst split the string on the first match
You can use a for loop as below. The idea is to build a list, and use a flag to mark when you meet a character from vowels.
