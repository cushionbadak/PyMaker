I want to change tags of my all mkv files.I installed MKVToolNix.My code is:I'm getting this output:What is the cause of this error?
The issue is that one of your .mkv files contains a space in its filename. Thus when you split the bashCommand to create a list, you inadvertently split the filename into two pieces.The easiest thing would be to rename the file so that it doesn't contain a space. It may also be safer to build the list manually, rather than relying upon split(), and ensure you wrap the filename in quotes.
