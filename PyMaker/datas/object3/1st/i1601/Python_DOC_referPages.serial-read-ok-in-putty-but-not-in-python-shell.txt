The code I have sends a command to a serial device and returns a string <LF>Mycode<CR> or in Python \nMYCODE\r is the format I send the command in, I can see the incoming data in putty but not in Python? The incoming data also starts with a <LF> and ends with a <CR>. How do I get this data through to Python?My code:
It looks like the issue is with your call to ser.readline(). The pyserial API states that it uses io.IOBase.readline which reads characters up to the newline (\n) character. Since your data begines with \n there are no characters before it, and hence the readline call will read zero bytes from the buffer, and return an empty string.You should either move the \n to the end of each message, or use the read(n) call directly to read n bytes from the connection.
