This program is to count the number of sub-strings in a string.Test case:    string ABCDCDC    pattern CDCThe answer should be 2 but I am getting 0.
At the end of the for j in range(0,len(sub_string)) loop j can be at most len(sub_string)-1 (if you don't break early). So if j==len(sub_string): is always False. You want if j==len(sub_string)-1: or simply else: (meaning you've reached the end of the for loop) instead.Also count = 0 should be initialized at the start, not in the first for loop:
Strings are sequences of 1-character substrings in Python, so you can use the built-in count() method — in other words, you don't have to re-invent the wheel and write your own function to do it.
