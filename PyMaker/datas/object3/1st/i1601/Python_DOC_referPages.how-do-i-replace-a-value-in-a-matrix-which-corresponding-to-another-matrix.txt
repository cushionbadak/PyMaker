For exampleAnd I want to get a matrix c:That's like if the i in a = ww for ww,ee in n for n in b, then replace  with ee else 0I try some if and else command and here is my codeBut it failed. How should I code for this situation?
chain + dict + list comprehensionYour b mapping is a list of lists, you can flatten this into an iterable of tuples via chain.from_iterable. Then feed to dict to create an efficient mapping.Finally, use a list comprehension with dict.get for the desired result. Just remember to convert the values of a from str to int.
This iterates through list a comparing it's value with first value of tuples in b list. This appends the second value of tuple to output list if the first value of tuple matches with the value in a:
You can convert your double-list of mappings into a lookup dictionary and use a list-comp:Output:Related:dict.get(key[, default])Why dict.get(key) instead of dict[key]?
