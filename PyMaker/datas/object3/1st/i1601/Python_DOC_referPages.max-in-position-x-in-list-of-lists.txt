How do I get the max value in position x in a list of lists, and return that along with the data in position 0? A sample of my current list is pasted below. I was considering making another list which contains the elements i want then sorting that one, but I am guessing there is a better to do thisData currently being outputExpected output would be - lets say I wanted the max value across all lists in index 2: EDIT: Trying to pass in data from my first function into the function suggested by slider, and I get NameError: name 'data' is not defined. I've also tried to pass in when get_max is called and that didnt work eitherAlso, if I try the below and then run it, I get the following error "Position arguement follows keyword argument. I tried to then shift the order in which the values are declared when the function is declared but it gets messy, especially when I dont really follow how this function worksprint(get_max(data=squads(),2, lambda x: int(x[2])))
You can also use max with a key:The way get_max works is you specify your 2-d list, the index you want to retrieve and a key function that you want to pass in to max. If the key function is not provided, a default is used (specifically, lambda x: x[i]).The key function is supposed to define which column to consider to determine the maximum of your 2-d list.EditYou're defining data inside the get_max function but you're using it outside the function. Change this to the following:
Sorting would be quite appropriate. Let's say you are interested in the 2nd column:Bear in mind that sorted sorts strings in the lexicographic order. If you want to treat your columns as numbers, convert them to numbers when sorting:
If the data is very large, you may want to isolate your column of interest and do a "lazy" run of max:This  generates no intermediate lists (or lists of lists thereof).As noted by @Austin, max() may not provide the result you wanted since the items are strings, in which case you may want to preorganize the lazy column with int():col_of_interest = ((int(lst[target]), idx) for idx, lst in enumerate(list_of_lists))
