How can I write a function, that would take a dictionary and return me a set that would consist of pairs of keys that have at least one common value?Example:I have the following dictionary:MyFunction(dict) should return me:
A more efficient one-pass solution would be to use a seen dict that keeps track of a list of keys that have "seen" a given value so far:pairs would become:You can then easily transform it to a set of lexicographically sorted tuples if you want:which returns:
Using itertools.combinations:Output is:If you consider ('A', 'C') and ('C', 'A') same, you can replace with just
defaultdict + combinationsFor a brute force solution, you can invert your dictionary of sets, then use a set comprehension:As you can see the items in res are frozenset objects, i.e. they aren't depending on sorting within tuples. frozenset is required instead of set since set is not hashable.
