I'm just a new in python and I need to print the lists which has minimum and maximum items in a list.For example if i have:I need to return a list with a minimum and maximum length of itself. How can I do it simply in python way?I try to iterate over it but all I could receive is the only len of each item in a list Output must be: Thanks in advance
max and min function in python accepts a key argument that will find the max of an iterable based on what defined as a key. so, try this:then you can use total_list.index to find those indexes
OUTPUT:
The usage of min( iterable, key=len) (min/max) is easiest. If you like to go through your list yourself, you can do this like so:Output:Doku:enumerate(iterable[,start_value])
