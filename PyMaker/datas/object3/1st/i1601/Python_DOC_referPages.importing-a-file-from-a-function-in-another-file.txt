I need to call a list that I made in a function that's in another file. I was trying attempting this below, but I am getting the error cannot import name 'names' from 'backend'. Does anyone know how this can be achieved without making a class?Error message:The code form the other file is
According to Python's documentation:In Python, variables that are only referenced inside a function are implicitly global. If a variable is assigned a value anywhere within the function’s body, it’s assumed to be a local unless explicitly declared as global.Thus, the reason why you can't import your names list from another file is because names is inside your get_pokemon_stats function scope and it is not a global variable.You can make names global putting it outside your function and declaring it as global to use inside your function:However, you should consider carefully if you really want to do this. names will only contain actual values once you call your get_pokemon_stats function. Nevertheless, you should avoid just declaring variables globally if you don't really understand how local and global variables work and when we should use them.I recommend that you consider doing the following code instead:
You need to call the get_pokemon_stats function. It returns four values, and the third value is names.
