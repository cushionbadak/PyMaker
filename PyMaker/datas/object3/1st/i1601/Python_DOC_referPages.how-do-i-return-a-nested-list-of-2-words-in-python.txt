Natural Text
For example I have a list of words like so ['word1,word2', 'word2,word3' 'word4,word4' ...]How can I return the list like this [[word1,word2],[word3,word4],[word5,word6]...]
You can use list comprehension with split()
@Zeeshan Akhter's solution is nice, and very efficient. List comprehensions tend to be a bit unreadable, though, and this solution is basically the same thing, spread out for readability.
