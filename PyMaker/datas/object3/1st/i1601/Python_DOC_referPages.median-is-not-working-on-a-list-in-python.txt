The expected output is:But I get instantly on np.median and on the statistics.median the output:What am I doing wrong?
The median [statistics-doc] is defined as [Wikipedia]:The median is the value separating the higher half from the lower half of a data sample (a population or a probability distribution). For a data set, it may be thought of as the "middle" value.So given you sort the values first, then it is the middle element (or the average of the two elements in the middle given there is an even number of elements). It is typically used to obtain a value such that 50% of the elements in the collection have a higher value, and 50% have a lower value.In your case 128 is the smallest element of the collection, so that is not a good candidate for the median.If you want the value in the middle (this is not the median statistically speaking), you can use:or perhaps simpler:we can then call this with:As said however, this is not the median.
You have an even number of elements so your program calculates the mean of the two central values in your list after sorting it. Docs: statistics python 3.
