Natural Text
I have a .txt file like thisI want to read this file line by line and check that whether the line starts with alphabet or digit. If the line starts with digit then add all these digits in that line and print sum. and if the line starts with alphabet then simply print any message.I have tried this codeNameError: name 'total' is not defined
total is undefined - and you do not need it:Create file:Process file:Output:Explanation of sum(map(int,line.rstrip().split())):this takes the whole line, split()'s it at whitespaces into a list ["25", "45", "23", "67"] of strings. map(func, iterable) applies a function to all elements of the iterable and returns a generator of it which is summed up by sum():Readup:you can find most of the function I used at python built in functionsmap()int()sum()the rest are string functions:split()rstrip()
It was some error in your code.First, total is not initialised, you should addAfter, iterate on line will give you :I think you want split the line and get number one by one:
Python interpreter doesn't know how to do this total = total + line[i] because total isn't initialized. Just initialize it like this, for example (or in any place you think it would be right):PS And if you want to sum numbers instead of string concatenation, you should initialize total as total = 0 and add line[i] like this total = total + int(line[i])
Parse the string of number to a list of integers with map and make the addition with numpy:
As always, many ways lead to the desired result.My approach would beusing with is convenient as it closes the file for you, even if an error occursisnumeric() and isaplpha return bools - no need to additionally test them against Truea so called list comprehension (a one-line-for-loop in square brackets) creates a list on the fly and allows processing each value while adding it to the list; the resulting list can esily summed up and printed
