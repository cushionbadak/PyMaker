I have a dictionary -How can I tell if d is a dict of type (int, str)?In C# it'd be something like:
Python dictionaries don't have types. You'd literally have to check every key and value pair. E.g.
Within a single Python dictionary, values may be of arbitrary types. Keys have the additional requirement that they must be hashable, but they may also cover multiple types.To check keys or values in a dictionary are of a specific type, you can iterate them. For example:
if you're using Python 3.7 you can do something like:and get back: typing.Dict[int, str]there's a function typings.get_type_hints that might be useful in the future, but currently only knows about objects of type:function, method, module or classPEP-0526 also says something is to be done about this
