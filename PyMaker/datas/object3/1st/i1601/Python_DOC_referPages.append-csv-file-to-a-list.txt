Natural Text
I have three different data files they are json, pkl and csv.I am trying to combine them together before do data analysis. Currently I am able to combine pkl and json file. But not sure how to do with CSV.Not sure how to append the csv file and I need to sort the unique value after combing them. 
If you literally want the text appended to a list, you don't need the CSV module. This is equivalent to you're appending of a pickled or JSON object. If you want each line separately
