I am using a mongoDB(pymongo) where I have the python source (the logic of the program) stored as a b64 String.After giving a valid key, I fetch the b64 String and decode it.Example: How can I import the fetched source(data) to my existing python file, without locally storing it in a file to use it's functions?Edit:The mongodb is on a server. The Python program fetches the dataset with the given key from the server. => data = print("hello world")the above command is called from main.py. To "work" properly / use certain program features, the data (logic.py) has to be injected into the main.py, so main.py can use it's functions etc.logic.pymain.py
Solutionexec is exactly what I needed.
