Natural Text
In an attempt to tech myself a method for binding in python, I have the following code:How to assign the value of dname to wname using the info from above?I do understand that setText() would typically be used here; however, I am exploring a method for binding and I would like to know how to utilitze the getattr() function for extracting the setter and getter for the widget passed.  Thanks!!!
Not sure if I got the point, but by doing you are retrieving the function and not the text inside it. Therefore by callingyou will set the text. Same for writing:
Similarly to what Alessandro said, you need to get the setter with getattr first, then call it with your text:If you want to build some code that gets both the getters and setters based on a property name, I guess you could do something like this:If, instead, you want something similar to the way getattr and setattr work with Python attributes but for already existing widget properties, I guess you could do something like the following, but it seems a bit of an overkill to me:
