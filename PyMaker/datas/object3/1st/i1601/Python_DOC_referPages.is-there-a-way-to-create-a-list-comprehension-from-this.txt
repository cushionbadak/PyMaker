I just learned how to create list comprehensions and I was looking back through my past projects to see where I can create comprehensions. I was successful with several, but then I got to this part of the code and I was wondering if there was any way to create a list comprehension from this:Maybe I'm just thinking a bit too hard for this but I was wondering if there was any way to create a comprehension using this?I was thinking something like:but this does not work in terms of attributing each value to scores[l].Any help would be greatly appreciated!
If util.Counter() is a dictionary like collections.Counter, you can update it with a dictionary via its update method. So you can use:Then for some label x, you can access the result via scores[x].List comprehension are for lists, dictionary comprehensions for dictionaries. The latter are mentioned in the  docs.
EDIT: I didn't pay attention to scores = utils.Counter(), so I provided an answer which is list comprehension. See @jpp's answer for correct approach.Your approach is right, but there is no assignment within comprehension. You must make one outside of it
