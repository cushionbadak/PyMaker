Natural Text
I am using win32com to parse outlooks msg files on my hard drive.  Everything is working except the sent date.  I have the list of emails in a wxPython list box and when you click on an email I want to populate the date in a text box. When I try to convert the msg.SentOn from time type to string type I get a TypeError.  I believe it is looking for a timestamp and I am not sure how to get there from Pytime.Output:Can someone help with this conversion?
After some searching I found Pytime. This showed the conversion of pytime to an int that is compatible with the time module.
