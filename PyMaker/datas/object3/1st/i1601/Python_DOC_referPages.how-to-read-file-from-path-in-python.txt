Natural Text
If I want to read files named "ABCbook.txt" under directors A/B/C, which means the path A/B/C depends on the files' name and the folders A/B/C are hierarchical. How can I achieve it in Python?
We will use os.path.join to make the file path in a platform-independent way, then open the file using the normal with open... technique.
output (on windows):on linux or mac it will return
