Natural Text
So I am trying to make a small script for myself where I have one or multiply word/s and by that it is supposed to find all matching words in a randomized sentence.etc:The output is supposed to sayand the reason why it doesn't print the first one and last one is that it does not contain I and Be and it and weatherSo my question is basically how to make every + or any other special characters like keyword1 + keyword2 + n (Can be up from 1 to n words) and compare if those word are in the sentenceSo what I tried to code was something likeHowever for now it does only print out the first sentence since I changed the Words to I for now.What I want to do is that words in that contains more than 1 word should be adding with a special character in between etc I+be so whenever there is a I and Be inside a sentence it should print that it found that sentence - Else do not print anything.So my question for you is how can I continue from my point forward with me wish :) ?
You could do something like this:OutputThe function check_all checks if all the words from a group of words (for example 'I+be') are in the sentence. Then if for any group of words are in the sentence you should print the sentence. Note that you must first split on '+' to find if a group matches.UPDATETo match whole words only I suggest you use regex, for example:OutputNote that the second example does not contains "With In be" in the output.FurtherSee the documentation on any and all.Python regular expression match whole word
Using filter, any, all, and splitThe comprehension returns a generator of True of False if one of the keywords are in one of the sentences. all will return True if all elements of the inner container are True. Conversely, any will return True if any elements of the inner container are True.Checking the 'be' doesn't return Sentence2Note that this won't take into account punctuation. I.e. 'Hello' != 'Hello,'
