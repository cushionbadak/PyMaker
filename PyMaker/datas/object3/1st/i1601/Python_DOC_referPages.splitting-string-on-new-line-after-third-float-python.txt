I'm trying to get a single string split into different lines.I have the following single line string:And i'm trying to get this output:I have already written code to work with the info if it's in the above formatI've tried for hours many different things but couldn't succeed. This let me to try to write new code to work with the info as it is right now instead. I show my current code with that intention but it might not be relevant if the desired output is possible. In the code I am trying to split a string on every name and three floats in a row. My current code now, though different from many other tries, isolates every three grades in a single item in a list and isolates the names as single items, but splits the names where they should not. I can't use iter, map and zip again since it's different with every name:I tried splitting on delimeters like spaces or '_'. I tried replacing characters in order to split and tried defining every item based on .isalpha or .isdigit. However i cannot succeed since every name is of different length of words and might or might not contain spaces or dashes. Also the first float is connected with the name trough underscores. My brain is overloadedRight now my goal is getting every person with grades on a new line which would allow me to select the names and grades:
You could use regular expressions, which provide pattern matching.  An regular expression of '[A-Za-z -]+_+[0-9. ]+' should match the name, underscore, scores pattern.  Then, re.findall('[A-Za-z -]+_+[0-9. ]+', string) will return the list of strings.  You can combine this back into a newline seperated string with '\n'.join(list_of_results).Python regular expression documentation: https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html
