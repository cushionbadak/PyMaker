I'm struggling to write list into a CSV file.So first of all i convert list to pandas dataframe and now truing to save it as columns to a file, but data is being displayed from new line.Can you please help me figure out what I've missing in my codeExpected result: Name, Age, City
To save as columns, assign your list as columns:If not specified, the first argument to pd.DataFrame is data, so you must assign to columns explicitly.
If I understand correctly, you'd just have to add a .T to your line to write the transposed dataframe.although if you are using pandas only to write lists as rows to csv files, you'd better have a look at the csv module, because creating intermediary dataframes is pretty pointless.
