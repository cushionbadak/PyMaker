I am trying to extract values between two underscores. For that I have written this code:Output:So extracted values are in this form: ['121']. I want them in this form: 121 , i.e., just the number inside two underscores. What change should I make to my code?
Really, an easy way would be, instead of appending a list to another list, just make that list equivalent:
Just replace the last line of your for loop by :extend will flatten your results, and int(patient_id) will convert the string to int
You need to flatten your results, e.g. like that:
You have a list of findall results (which only ever is 1 result per file it seems) - you can either just convert the strings to integers or also flatten the result:Output:Doku:you can find the doku for map() and int() at Overview of built in functions
