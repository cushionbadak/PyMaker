Suppose I have a base class with unimplemented methods as follows:Now, let's say one of my colleagues uses the Polygon class to create a subclass as follows:(H/Sh)e has forgotten to implement the area() method.How can I force the subclass to implement the parent's area() method?
this could be your parent class:although the problem will be spotted at runtime only, when one of the instances of the child classes tries to call one of these methods.a different version is to use abc.abstractmethod.you will not be able to instantiate a Circle without it having all the methods implemented.this is the python 3 syntax; in python 2 you'd need toalso note that for the binary special functions  __eq__(), __lt__(), __add__(), ... it is better to return NotImplemented instead of raising NotImplementedError.
That's exactly what NotImplementedError are used for :)In your base class
You can raise NotImplementedError exception in base class method.Also you can use @abc.abstractmethod, but then you need to declare metaclass to be abc.ABCMeta, which would make your class abstract. More about abc module
