I am encountering a very strange problem while processing data under Linux 16.04 using python 2.7. I create a .csv file using this function :the file is properly created and looks like that:I then pass it throught this code to draw a graph :But each time I get that error:I don't understand why I get this error because if I simply copy and paste my datas into another file, everything works fine, I can draw my graph flawlessly. I just don't get it because the 2 data files are identicals, no added space or anything.what can cause this error and how can I proceed to be able to used my generated data file directly without the need to copy paste the datas in another file ?thanks in advance,Pixelle
I would recommend rethinking the data format you have. I don't know where the data comes from, but it would be reasonable to store it in a way that does not contain parantheses etc.If you really need to work with this data format, you may still use e.g. pandas and sanitize the format, by removing the characters that aren't useful.Note that the data also does not seem to be in Ohlc format, hence the strange looking graph. But since nothing is known about the data, you need to find out the correct order yourself.
