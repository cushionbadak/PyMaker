From the documentation:Return a copy of the string in which each character has been mapped through the given translation table. The table must be an object that implements indexing via getitem(), typically a mapping or sequence. When indexed by a Unicode ordinal (an integer), the table object can do any of the following: return a Unicode ordinal or a string, to map the character to one or more other characters; return None, to delete the character from the return string; or raise a LookupError exception, to map the character to itself.So you can pass a dictionary from unicode ordinal (which you can find using ord) to the output string to translate the characters
