Initially, I had installed Apache Airflow and python 2.7 is set as default path. Now, I'm trying to change path from 2.7 to 3. Is it possible to do so or do I have re-install the airflow and set the python path? Any pointers would be helpful?Thanks in advance!
There are a few ways to make sure that you are using the version of Python that you would like. Docker is one, take a look at https://github.com/puckel/docker-airflow for a good example.Another is to use virtual environments. I've only used Virtualenv with success. I like Pipenv, but unfortunately I ran into some dependency-trouble using it with Airflow.Anyways, here is an example of what should work with Virtualenv:python --version should list python 3, and running airflow webserver, should run Airflow in python 3.
