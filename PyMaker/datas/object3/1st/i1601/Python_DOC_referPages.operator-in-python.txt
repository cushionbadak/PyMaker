I've been using Python a while and I bumped into this operator "^=" for the first time from this link.Of course, I did some googling, but I can't seem to find this operator. What does it do?
The ^ operator yields the bitwise XOR (exclusive OR) of its arguments, which must be integers.https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#binary-bitwise-operationsAs with all the other _= operators, ^= assigns the result back to the variable: a =^ b is eqivalent to a = a ^ b.As a function it is __ixor__ (or operator.ixor), and may have different behaviour for non-integer types.
The special method that relates to ^= and is called behind the curtains is __ixor__. The special method that relates to ^ is __xor__. They don't have to behave the same.__ixor__ is the Augmented Assignment variant of __xor__, performing inplace operations when possible, and falling back to __xor__ when __ixor__ is not implemented.In principle, the return value of the method is completely up to the implementation of __ixor__, but there are some common use cases.For two sets, a ^= b computes the symmetric difference of the sets a and b (all elements present in exactly one of the two sets) and mutates a.Note that a has been mutated in place, thus a and reference both point to the same set object {2, 3, 4, 5} in memory. Thus ^= behaves differently from ^ in this case, which builds a new set as shown below.Note that a = a^b has built a new set to which the name a has been reassigned and reference still refers to the original set {1, 2, 3}.For builtin immutable types (like integers), a ^= b is indeed equivalent to a = a^b. Since integers have no __ixor__ method, Python falls back to using __xor__.In the case of integers a ^= b performs a bitwise-non-equal operation and the name a is reassigned to the result of that computation.Demo:Explanation:
It is XOR. https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#binary-bitwise-operationsFor example:Output:Because in binary 9 is 101, then 1 is 001.XOR operation mean:
a ^= b equialent to a = a^b^ - is XOR operator
