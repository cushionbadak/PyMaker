I have a following python dictionary:what I am trying to achieve is to get the first string or/and second string of one of the keys of the lines dictionary.so lines.keys() gives me dict_keys([('mid', 'north'), ('south', 'mid'), ('south', 'north')])what I would like to have is something like this:ofc it is not working like this but is there a function or a command which gives me the first string of the tuple ('mid', 'north'), as an output? Keep in mind ('mid', 'north') is the key of the dictionary.
You can convert dict_keys to tuple, since it is iterable:
You need to convert your keys to list, and since dict will be in random order you need to sort it.
