I have a script at the moment which uses asyncio to listen on a TCP port for any incoming connections, if a connection is received then it parses the data and sets a class variable to the data received.This works perfect just to wait for incoming connections - but I cannot figure out how to run a loop concurrent to this waiting for an incoming connection. I am building a server to receive input via TCP, and update things stored within caches in a loop in the main() function. This is what I have at present:However, if I add a loop to encompass loop.run_forever() then it only outputs the print line once and never again (I would expect it to print hundreds of  times running in a loop) - for instance:Will print only once in execution - how can I have a logic loop running concurrent to the asyncio TCP start_server loop?
You could maybe try multithreading.So you would create a thread for the two things you are trying to do.You can look at this https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_multithreading.htmThis is my first answer.
