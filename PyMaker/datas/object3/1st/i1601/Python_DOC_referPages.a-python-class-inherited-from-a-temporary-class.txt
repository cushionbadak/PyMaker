I got stuck when I try to figure out the following codes:here is the code output:Just like what I commented out, Form is base on NewBase, however, there is not a NewBase class in the main module. A class its base class is not accessible, is an error? But interesting, Form can still call the method, which comes from the parent of its parent. 
For the sake of the answer, we don't need the FormMeta class at first.Imagine the definition of Form as follows:the with_metaclass call just returns meta("NewBase", (base,), {}), which in this case is just type("NewBase", (base,), {}), which creates a new class called NewBase, which is derived from base (BaseForm in this case), with no additional methods.You can read about it at the type documentation.The FormMeta metaclass in this case does  nothing. It inherits type (that's why it is a meta class), and then just passes the data it receives on to type, plus some print statements. So it is essentially the same as above.You can read more about metaclasses here.
