I want to dig out the name in xml files in my local folder and have the following scripts:I can fetch the xml file address using re_no=‘zi*?.xml’ search pattern in the glob script, but I cannot if I use re_no=‘zi.*?.xml’. On the other hand, I can find the xml file name in the re.search pattern using re_m=‘zi.*?.xml’, but I cannot with re_m=‘zi*?.xml’. Can you explain the difference?
You should get into the habit of using raw strings if declaring regex patterns:Use and use http://regex101.com (switched to python mode) to get your regex explained (in text by the site) and tested (against testdata you provide): example for thatfootmark:anythings as expressed by . do not cover f.e. newlines unless you specify certain flags - read @ re-doku
