This question already has an answer here:Python regex find all overlapping matches?                    3 answers                So if I create a program in python (3.7) that looks like this:and run it, then I will get:Even though there are two instances of "test" it's only showing me one which I think is because a letter from the first "test" is being used in the second "test". How can I make a program that will give me ["test", "test"] as a result instead?
You will want to use a capturing group with a lookahead (?=(regex_here)):
Regex expressions are greedy. They consume as much of the target string as possible. Once consumed, a character is not examined again, so overlapping patterns are not found. To do this you need to use a feature of python regular expressions called a look ahead assertion. You will look for instances of the character t where it is followed by est. The look ahead does not consume parts of the string. [0,3]More details on this page: https://docs.python.org/3/howto/regex.html
