Using jupyter notebookHowever, i get the following error messageWhat do I do to resolve this problem? When i run conda list in command prompt, it says. 
async may not be used as an argument name in Python 3.7.See: https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.7.html#summary-release-highlightsasync and await are now reserved keywords.This issue is already known: https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy/issues/1017The current recommendation is to manually rename all occurrences of async to async_ in /tweepy/streaming.py until a new release is available.
