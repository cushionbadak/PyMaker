I'm working on a domain fronting project. Basically I'm trying to use the subprocess.call() function to interpret the following command:wget -O - https://fronteddomain.example --header 'Host: targetdomain.example'With the proper domains, I know how to domain front, that is not the problem. Just need some help with writing using the python subprocess.call() function with wget.
I figured it out using curl: call(["curl", "-s", "-H" "Host: targetdomain.example", "-H", "Connection: close", "frontdomain.example"])
