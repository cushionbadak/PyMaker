Hi guys a amateur at python here.I've got the following code below that I have coded. It prints 10 randomly generated coordinates and calculates the distance of each pair using Pythagoras (monte carlo simulation). I've now created a counter named:This counter needs to increment by 1 everytime the distance of a pair of coordinates is between 0 and 1. If the distance is above one the counter will not increment. I've had a go at this using while loops and if statements but I can't get the hang of it. Can someone please help?Kind regards.
That should sort ya out !edit: I removed the 0 <= check since it's a square root it'll always be larger than 0 
You can use a similar approach as in my answer to your last question:You simply sum up all things from your data that are True (== 1) via sum():Output:
I tried your way. If I understood correctly, you want to count the distance between 0 and 1.print(counter)
