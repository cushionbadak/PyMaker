Natural Text
I have a text, and I want to know if all or a percent bigger than 50% is in uppercase.DOFLAMINGO WITH TOUCH SCREEN lorem ipsumI try to use regex(found here a solution):But this finds all caps, i don't know if all or more than 50 percent(this includes all) is uppercase ?I want to number only letters (so no numbers,spaces, new lines etc)
You can use filter and str.isalpha to clean out non-alphabetic chars and str.isupper to count uppercase chars and calculate the ratio:Also see the docs on sum and map which you might find yourself using regularly. Moreover, this uses the fact that bool is a subclass of int and is cast appropriately for the summation which might be too implicit for the taste of some.
Regex seems overkill here. You can use sum with a generator expression:Or functionally via map:Alternatively, via statistics.mean:
Generic solution that works with any boolean function and iterable (see below for version that only looks at str.isalpha()):Output:even better is schwobaseggl's  because it does not need to persist a list but instead uses a generator.Edit: 2nd version that only uses str.isalpha characters and allows multiple boolfuncs:Output:
Using regular expressions, this is one way you can do it  (given that s is the string in question):It finds the lista of both uppercase and lowercase characters and gets the percentage using their lengths.
Here is one way to do it:
Something like the following should work.
Try this, it's short and does the job:
