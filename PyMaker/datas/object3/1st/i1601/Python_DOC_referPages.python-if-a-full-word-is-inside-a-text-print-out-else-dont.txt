Natural Text
I am having issue where I want to compare a word inside a text - meaning if there is a word that contains inside a text it should print out.The issue is that I am having let say I have a word that is "lo" - and my text is = "hello guys, my name is Stackoverflow" - it will print out that whole text there is a lo inside this text which are inside "hello" and "stackoverflow" my question is how can I make whenever I want to search for a word such as "lo" it should take it as a word and not print out if it etc. contains inside a word such as "hello" or "stackoverflow" - Only print out if it has the word "lo"?
Split up the string into words then test for the substring in each of the words.
You could do this but there are like... 400 edge cases that will make this a problem.
use string.find() . It returns the index of the substring you're looking for, and -1 if not found. So you can apply if statement to check whether it is a substring or not.Hope this helped!
The most straightforward way is probably to use a regex. You can play around with regexes here and figure out how to implement them in python here.
