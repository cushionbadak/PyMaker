Natural Text
I'm attempting to make a function that counts the number of sentences in a textfile. In this case, a sentence refers to any string ending with either a '.', '?', or a '!'.I'm new to Python and I'm having trouble figuring out how to do this. I keep getting the error 'UnboundLocalError: local variable 'numberofSentences' referenced before assignment.' Any help would be appreciated!
You need to initialize the variable to something before incrementing it.  You also need to open the file itself,  read it's text and evaluate it - and not count what letters are in the given filename.Output:Doku:reading files
It would work if you actually checked that the fullStop was in the sentence in the first place and you declared numberOfSentences beforehand.The best method to do this I think would be to instead of using find, which returns a number, not a bool, would be to write
