I have over 52k files of csv files that I need to organize and would like to find an efficient way to do this through python or some other avenue. Currently I have these folders, 2013_Q1 2013_Q2 2013_Q3 2013_Q4 2014_Q1 ...and so onWithin the Quarter folder, i have another folder:xxxx20130101_000500_csv xxxx20130101_000500_xml  xxxx20130101_001000_csv xxxx20130101_001000_xmland so on.. within that folder I have the files:xxxx20130101_000500_csv.csv xxxx20130101_000500_xml.xml  xxxx20130101_001000_csv.csv xxxx20130101_001000_xml.xmlrespectively.I want to go through all the quarter folders and extract only the .csv files from each sub-folder and organize them in a folder by their respective dates.So within the 2013_Q1 folder, I would like to have20130101  20130102...and so onAnd within that 20130101 folder would bexxxx20130101_000500_csv.csv xxxx20130101_001000_csv.csv  xxxx20130101_001500_csv.csvRight now I have the python code:I'm fairly new at python and is still learning, so I'm a bit confused.
For Python 3.5 and above:There is a recursive feature in glob that you could use.Here's what you doimport globloop over glob.glob('root/**/*.csv',recursive = True)
