Natural Text
I want to be able to show how many 1s, 2s and so on. For example if there is 6 1, it will print BendingF =  6. My 1,2,3,4,5 are different positions. 1 = BendingF, 2 = BendingM , 3 = Twisting, 4 = Walking, 5 = Squat. I tried but it will give me error:SyntaxError: can't assign to literal
