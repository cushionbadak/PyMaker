Optionally, the literal can be preceded by + or - (with no space  in between) and surrounded by whitespace.So it gives you ValueError because the string '.0' does not represent an integer literal.
Because you can type cast one step at a time. For example you can convert float to int or string to int. Not a floating point string which here is 2steps.
You can do it if you remove the quotes and make it a float like:But strings don't work if inside the string is a float, because they will think it's a number and will break saying '.' is not a numeric value, also the reason the above works is because:And:Works.Note that even a real float in a string can't be converted into an integer:
