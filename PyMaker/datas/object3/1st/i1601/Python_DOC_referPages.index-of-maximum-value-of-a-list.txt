I need to implement a function that returns the index of the maximum value of a list. I wrote that but it doesn't work. Could someone tell me why?
Your code seemed fine to me. I think the only problem is your indentation and that you only check positive values. The way it is indented everything is outside of the function.Also I added Chris_Rands suggestion of starting with a check, whether the list is empty. Here you go:
a better way is to just use max directly:enumerate yields (idx, value) tuples for the list, the key checks for the max based on only the value, and then [0] grabs the idx from the tuple from enumerate
Use max built-in function to find the maximum value and index method to find its index:Test it:Output:
If you aren't allowed to use max and index as suggested by @Ayxan, you should start the loop assuming that the first element is the max, and then updating accordingly.
