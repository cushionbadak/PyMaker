I'm testing some regex.  It looks like this part is getting cut off: ing.*_{FD_YYYYMMDD}.*Am I doing something wrong here?
What you are seeing is a string representation of a match object. It should only be used for debugging, and it is truncated.To see the string captured by a group (green), call re.search(pattern, string).group(1)
