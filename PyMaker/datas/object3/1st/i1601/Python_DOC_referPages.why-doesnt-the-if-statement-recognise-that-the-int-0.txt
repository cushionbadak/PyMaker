I'm creating a text based adventure game, and this is meant to be a small fight. The ints userhits or deputyhits should be set to 0 at some point, but the code is stuck in a loop that goes passed 0.
Currently your while loop will go on forever since you set it to True initially, then never alter the loop value you are using in the while to False. Inside your loop you will have to have some condition check like this:If you set it to False like so, the next iteration of your while will check if loop = True, and since it's now False, the while will not execute again. A break can also be used, but keep in mind that once a break is executed, any remaining code that has not been executed in that iteration of the while will not be executed.
