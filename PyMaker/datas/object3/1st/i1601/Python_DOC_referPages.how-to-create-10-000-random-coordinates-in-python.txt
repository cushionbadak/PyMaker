Hello I've been set a project where I have to generate 10,000 random coordinates (x,y), using the random module in python and then output them all. The coordinates HAVE to be decimal numbers between 0 and 2. I've had a look around on the internet but I can't seem to find anything that is helping me. Can anyone on here help me? Thank you.
Use the random module within a list comprehension to generate a list of random coordinate tuples:This will give you 10,000 tuples (x, y), where x and y are random floating point numbers greater than or equal to 0 and less than 2.
Or use numpy:
