I have defined a python class named Edge as follows:Now I have to create approximately 10^6 to 10^7 instances of Edge using:I took me approximately 2 seconds in Desktop. Is there any faster way to do? 
You can't make it much faster, but I certainly would use __slots__ to save on memory allocations. Also make it possible to pass in the attribute values when creating the instance:With the updated __init__ you can use a list comprehension:Together these can shave off a decent amount of time creating the objects, roughly halve the time needed. Comparison creating 1 million objects; the setup:and the timings:That's nearly 2 times as fast.Increasing the random input list to 10^7 items, and the timing difference holds:
Another option is to skip the Edge class and implement the edges via a table, or adjacency matrix.E.g.This does remove some flexibility though, but should be quite fast both to create and use.
