Natural Text
I have text file called test.txt. From test.txt, I want to grab the lines that start with >lcl then to extract values after locus tag and within close bracket]. I want to do the same thing for values after location. The result I want is shown below. How can I do this in python?desired resulttest.txtI am new in python so I tried to come up with something like this:
I think, the most trival way to solve your issue is by using regex like this example:Output:Another variation using a dict as a result and by splitting lines:Edit: Creating a DataFrame and exporting it into a csv file:It will prints and creates a file called results.csv:
I would like to present two alternative solutions. One that will extract any set of named tags on your line using regular expressions, and another which is a complete travesty but shows a way to do it without regular expressions.Generic Regex SolutionThis function returns a list of dictionaries keyed by the tags you are interested in you would use it like this:You could use the result to get the exact printout you want:This has the advantage that you can use the results as you chose later, and configure which tags you extract.No Regex SolutionThis version is just something I wrote to show that is possible. Please do not emulate it, as the code is a pointless maintenance burden.This function behaves just like the first one but the parsing function is a hot mess by comparison. It's also much less robust, e.g. because it's assumed that all your square brackets are more or less matching.Here is an IDEOne link showing off both methods: https://ideone.com/X2LKqL
