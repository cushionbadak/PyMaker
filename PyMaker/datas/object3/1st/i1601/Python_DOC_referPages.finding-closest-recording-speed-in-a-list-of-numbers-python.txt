I need to know how to loop through a list and find the closest speed to the speed limit. so pretty much Iterate through the list of speeds looking at the difference each time.What I have so far:What I get:What I should get:
You could use min:Output
This is what you should have:The only change is closest = float('inf') initially
If you use the return statement "inside" the if statement, it will return as soon as the condition speed_difference < abs(closest - speed_limit) is true, which will be always satisfied with your code for the list first element.So you need to remove the indentations before the return statement so it waits the end of the loop before returning the result.Another note is that the statement closest = abs(speed_data[0] - speed_limit) is wrong because you're assigning the closest variable with the difference between the the list element and the speed_limit, but by seeing your function code you should rather assign it with the list element: closest = speed_data[0].
