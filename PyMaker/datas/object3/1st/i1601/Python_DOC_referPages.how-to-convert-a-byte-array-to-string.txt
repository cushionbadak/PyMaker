Natural Text
I just finished creating a huffman compression algorithm . I converted my compressed text from a string to a byte array with bytearray(). Im attempting to decompress my huffman algorithm. My only concern though is that i cannot convert my byte array back into a string. Is there any built in function i could use to convert my byte array (with a variable) back into a string? If not is there a better method to convert my compressed string to something else? I attempted to use byte_array.decode() and I get this: UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0x88 in position 0: invalid start byte
You can use .decode('ascii') (leave empty for utf-8).Source : Convert bytes to a string?
