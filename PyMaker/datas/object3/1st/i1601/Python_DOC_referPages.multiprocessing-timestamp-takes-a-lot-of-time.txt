I created a program that spawn processes and run the provided algorithm. When I run the algorithm without multiprocessing it takes 1.7 sec, but when I spawn two processes that run the same algorithm it takes 18 sec.Profiler result for one process without spawning:68050    0.084    0.000    0.084    0.000 {method 'timestamp' of 'datetime.datetime' objects}With spawning two processes for one of spawned processes:34025   15.947    0.000   15.947    0.000 {method 'timestamp' of 'datetime.datetime' objects}Why the date.timestamp takes 15.9 sec? Is this profiler error ?Spawn:Timestamp:Also I wrote the program that do the same:Without spawning it prints Executing in 0.16368794441223145 s.With spawning it prints Executing in 66.31291604042053 s.FLT-TEST contains 91849 linesWithout file readingI get the same results.
