I need to run a Python web server, while still taking inputs from the user, but when someone visits the website, the information logged to the terminal window is on the same line as the input, making it look like this:I've tried setting the thread the the servers on to daemon mode, I've tried logging.getLogger("socketserver").setLevel(logging.CRITICAL), I've tried logger.propagation = False, and logger.disable = TrueThis is my server code:
Subclass SimpleHTTPRequestHandler and override the log_message method to do nothing:
One thing you can try is piping the output into a file, if the file size ever becomes a concern I would try piping it to nul, like:python3 myserver.py 2> nul
I wasn't quite clear if you wanted to remove the logging message on the command line, or redirect logging to file. If you're wanting to redirect to file, you can use os.write to print to file.If you're wanting to turn off the logging messages, and you can't get them off the command line, you could assign that logging to a nullHandler. Something a bit like:Using a nullHandler is a bit of a large solution, as the ideal would be to have logging going to a .log file for reference, not turning it off or skipping for certain messages.
