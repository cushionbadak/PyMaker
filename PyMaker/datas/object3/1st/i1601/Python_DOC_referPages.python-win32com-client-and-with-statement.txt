Good afternoon,I am writing some ETL scripts with Python, and am currently using win32com.client to open and refresh some data connections in Excel. My question is this: should I be using a with statement to open/close "Excel.Application" as suchWhen I have tried this an exception occurs, so I am obviously not using it correctly.Or do I need to explicitly call the close commandThe second example is what I have been using, and it works. I guess I am just wondering what is the more pythonic way to script the above function.(fyi - first time asker, longtime reader)
You get the AttributeError: __enter__ error because xl.workbooks.open is not a context manager, and so it doesn't support the with statement.If you want to use a with statement in your code you can use the closing function from the contextlib module in the standard library, like this:contextlib.closing will automatically call close on the object that is passed to it when the code in the with block has completed execution.
