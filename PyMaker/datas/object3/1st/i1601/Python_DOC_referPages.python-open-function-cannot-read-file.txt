I'm using python 3.6. I am trying to read a lot of (.txt) files in multiple directories. Some files have a comma in the file name, e.g. 'Proposal for Anne, Barry and Carol.txt'.The following code:Gives me an error on reading that file:I do not want to edit the names of the files.How can I properly read the files with comma's in the filenames?Edit:I'm sure the path exists.Other files from the same directory are parsed without issues.Trying to open the file directly from the commandline also gives: The system cannot find the path specified.Also, I seem to be unable to rename the file, if I try to change the name through Windows File Explorer to remove the comma (or change something else), it is reset to the original filename.Could it have something to do with file permissions?Or maybe is the filename too long? The full path from Z:[..] to [..].txt is 270 characters long.
This works fine on Python 3, Windows 10May be the problem in the long path. Try to check questions like this:Long paths in Python on Windows
First, you only work on files, not directories, and second, you can use os.path.join to convert on Windows:Try this:Output:
