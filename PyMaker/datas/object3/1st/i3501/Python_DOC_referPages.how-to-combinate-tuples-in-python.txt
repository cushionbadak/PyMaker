How to combinate following tuples? (1, 2); (5, 6) ; (3, 4)The solution should be:(1, 5, 3); (1, 5, 4); (1, 6, 3); (1, 6, 4); (2, 5, 3); (2, 5, 4); (2, 6, 3); (2, 6, 4)At the starting point I got m = 3 tuples. The number of tuples increases with every iteration and after every iteration a new tuple for recombining will be added. So after the first iteration I get:(1, 2); (5, 6); (3, 4); (9, 10)Then combinate those 4 tuples etc. Is there a possibility to do this dynamically until a stopping condition hits?
yes, its possible
Try with product
You can use recursion, thus only needing several for loops for any input dimension:Output:
