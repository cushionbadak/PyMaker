Natural Text
I have a string in pythonThe program accepts an input string.If the input string matches the wildcard pattern of x, then I perform some operation.The pattern is # (hash) - can substitute for zero or more words.*(star) - can substitute for exactly one word.So, if my input string is "quick.orange.rabbit", then it should match. Can anyone help me how to do this in python??I have tried - Thanks in advance.
Not sure if I'm understanding the Regex idea correctly, but if I'm correct, you want to match the following:(Zero or more words).orange.(Exactly one word)Now I do not know if the words in the hash are seperated by spaces, periods or are just words after each other, but here are the following cases:Hash words separated by spacesHash words seperated by periodsHash words just after each otherIf you don't want to have the (?P<>) syntax, you can also just do the followingWhich will match against your string and tell you if it is a match, but you then can't doTo get the hash words.
