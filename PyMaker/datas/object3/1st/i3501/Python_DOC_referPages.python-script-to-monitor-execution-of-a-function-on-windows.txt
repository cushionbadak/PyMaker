I have a python script that communicates to a device over serial interface. There is a function my_fn() to be exectuted which sends some commands to the serial interface and waits for recieved_fn() to be triggered by device. If recieved_fn() is not triggered within 5 sec then execute my_fn() again.How should I monitor if recieved_fn() is executed or not within a time period of 5 seconds.I am running python 2.7 on windows 10.Thanks
Unfortunately it is hard to provide a generic correct answer without seeing your code and what you are using. What exactly in your code is calling received_fn? Are you using some sort of event loop that allows event registering? If yes, then you should also use that event loop's timing methods to timeout the triggering.A more generic approach would be to use a global variable or attribute to do the monitoring.If you're using threads then maybe an event object is what you want, as they allow waiting with a timeout: https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html#event-objects
