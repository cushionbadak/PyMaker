[duplicate]                    2 answers                I have a variable "inputed_email" that I want to write to a .txt file. However, how would you accomplish this in Flask? Any help is appreciated. Thank you!    
Writing to a file has nothing to do with Flask. You can learn how to read/write to files here. Keep in mind writing a large amount of data is slow, and will slow down the request.
