Given a map of simple integers:How do I print this_map in reverse order? I can print each item with a simple for loop but printing the thing in reverse format requires indexing and this is not possible through standard procedure.A similar post on using enumerate() exists but how do I use it here to add indexes?Note: I'm using Python 3.6

Just use reversed:
Have you tried this:
Just convert the map into a list first
