Natural Text
I need a regex which matches any number followed by a string which consists of digits, spaces, dots and commas followed by "Kč" or "Eur".The problem is that my regex sometimes doesn't find all such strings. For example:returns nothing instead of [(12 932 Kč,12 932,Kč)]Do you know what is wrong with the regex?
Your input string contains a multibyte letter consisting of a base c letter and a diacritic, and the regex contains the precompose letter with Unicode code point \u010D.You may useOrSee the regex (second regex demo) and Python demo.Pattern details\d - a digit(?:[., \d]*\d)? - an optional occurrence of[., \d]* - zero or more digits, spaces, . or ,\d - a digit\s* - 0 or more whitespaces(?:K(?:c\u030C|\u010D)|Eur) - either K followed with either c\u030C or \u010D, or Eur values.When defining the currency regex, use CZK = ['Czk','K(?:č|č)'] or CZK = ['Czk', r'K(?:c\u030C|\u010D)'].
As Wiktor Stribiżew commented, the Kč in your regexp is different from the Kč in your text. You can use the unicodedata module to normalize both:
