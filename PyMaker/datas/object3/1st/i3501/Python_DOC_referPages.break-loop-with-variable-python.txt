I'd like to write my loop in a more compact form. When I have code in this form, everything works fine:But when I try to use the code in this form, my loop does not break:Why does my loop in the second situation not break with nastede[] inside y ? After changes (All Code):
Your condition y=(nastede[1] and nastede[2] and nastede[3]) will bind y to True, and unless X is True also that will not be evaluated as you are expecting.Better use all combined with map:Here you have a minimal exampleEDIT:Since all checks all this code would fail, because you only check from the index 1 to 3, for that use a slice:remember that python slices are not tail inclusive [x,y) 
(nastede[1]==X) and (nastede[2]==X) and (nastede[3]==X)  and (nastede[1] and nastede[2] and nastede[3]) are not same. In the first statement every value needs to be equal to X to get the truthy value. But in  the second code if all the values are truthy even they are not equal to X then the expression will return True.
