I'm coding a discord bot using python and I've run into an issue. I want the bot to print the messages it receives, however, it does this twice. And I'm at a total loss for why it's printing it twice.https://github.com/PGillner/Discord-IPL-Bot/tree/masterAbove is a link to the 3 "modules" that are causing the problem, it's still a work in progress with not that much code, should be fairly easy to navigate. Any help to why it prints it twice is greatly appreciated!Main.pyUser.pyPrint.py
Your User_Who coroutine runs twice, each of which contains Print_MSG.Besides, you are overusing async/await. May I know the reason why you do it for Print_MSG too? It just prints the message.
