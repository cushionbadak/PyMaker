Natural Text
I have a string like this:How do I remove all of the "\r\n", and then turn the string into a list like so:
str.split removes all whitespace; this includes \r and \n:As described in the str.split docs:If sep is not specified or is None, a different splitting  algorithm is applied: runs of consecutive whitespace are regarded as a  single separator, and the result will contain no empty strings at the  start or end if the string has leading or trailing whitespace.
To limit the split to \r\n you can use .splitlines():
Try this:Output:This first replace replaces the \r\n and the second one replaces the single quote from the string as you expected as the output.
