I want to make a for loop for a calculation task, since the data is too large for one calculation and I always get new data I want to split my calculation process. My array a has length nI want to use the x first elements for the calculation (c=b*x) and than the next x elements of the array. so in total n/x times to calculate. At the end I want to concate/append all my c -arrays into one array ctotal. so for an example:
Processing the array in chunks isn't "splitting the calculation process", because they will run sequentially. If you want to run multiple calculations at the same time, you should check out the threading library. Which, even if that isn't the point of your question, sounds like it might help you with 10 million elements(?) to get through and process.If your question is just how to get 20 at a time, there is more than one way to do this. One is to create a generator:Then, you can run for i in chunkify(your_list, 20), and on each loop, i will be the next 20 elements of your list.
