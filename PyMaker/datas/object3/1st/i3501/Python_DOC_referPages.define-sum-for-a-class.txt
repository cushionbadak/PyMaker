Is there something like a __sum__ method, similar to __add__, in order to sum up a list of instances of classes into a new class instance?I need this because in my case sum([a,b,c]) should be different from sum([sum([a,b]), c]). In other words, the sum really depends on an arbitrary number of arguments, and cannot be defined in terms of a binary operation __add__.
Sum is a built_in function in python. add is is special method. every container object such as list have add method. You can see it in the guide. The add method in container object and numeric object work differently.the result will be the concatenation of two list.while the add method in numeric object will do addition operation.You can create custom list with sum method.create new custom list object like this:and call the sumup method to sum all values inside the custom list
