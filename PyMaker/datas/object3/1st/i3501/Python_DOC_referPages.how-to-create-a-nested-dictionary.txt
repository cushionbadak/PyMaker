so I have some problems with my dictionaries in python. For example I have dictionary like below:And I would like to have nested dictionary that looks something like that.is this possible? I was searching for nested dictionaries but nothing works for me. 
You just need to loop through d1 and assign the correct values from d2.Code:Output:The above uses isintance() to check if the value is a list, so you can loop over it and assign the correct values from d2. It also uses dict.get() to ensure None is added if a KeyError was encountered when searching for a key  in d2. One-liner:But this becomes messy and less maintainable.
First, you hate to put brackets around your keys and values.Then I suggest you do a for loopI have ignored your {[plm,kop]} thing. But it wont be difficult to implement it if you understand this first example.
