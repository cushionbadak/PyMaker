can a range have a condition in python? for example, I wanna start at position 0 but I want it to run until my while statement is fulfilled.I want to be able to save different variables being in a while loop.The purpose of my program is to print the sum of the numbers you enter unil you put in 0my codeexpected output:enter an integer number (0 to end): 101+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10 = 55as of right now I'm trying to figure out how to store different variables so i can print them before the total is displayed. but since it is in a loop, the variable just keeps getting overwritten until the end.
If you want to store all the numbers you get as input, the simplest way to do that in Python is to just use a list. Here's that concept given your code, with slight modification:To get any desired formatting of those numbers, just modify that last print statement with a string concatenation similar to the one on the line above it. 
I used a boolean to exit out of the loop
If you want to store all of the values entered and then print them, you may use a list. You code would end like this:For example, user enters 5,2,1,4,5,7,8,0 as inputs from the num input request.Your output will be:Just as a guide, this is how I would do it. Hope it helps:In this case, the last 0 entered to get out of the loop doesn't show up. At least, I wouldn't want it to show up since it doesn't add anything to the sum.Hope you like my answer! Have a good day :)
