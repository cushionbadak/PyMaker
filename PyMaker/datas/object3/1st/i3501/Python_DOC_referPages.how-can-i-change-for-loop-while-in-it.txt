I think this code caching all the lines when loop is started. I deleting some of the lines from the file but it still repeating deleted lines. How can I change loop while in it?
I guess it's Python. Yes, readlines() reads the whole file at once. In order to avoid this you can use:
Maybe you can find the appropriate information in the Python tutorial. It saysIf you want to read all the lines of a file in a list you can also use list(f) or f.readlines().  So yes, all lines are read and stored in memory.Also the manual says:f.readline() reads a single line from the file;   More details can be found in the manual.
