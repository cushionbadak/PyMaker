This question already has an answer here:How do you create different variable names while in a loop?                    7 answers                I have 109 csv files that I want to import using a function or a for-loop. So far I have imported the files manually using the following function:Is there a simpler way to import all the data files without having to type all of them in manually?
Using a dictionary comprehension, you can construct a dictionary to store your data, using numeric keys to identify arrays:Then access, for example, the array in File-name100.csv via d[100].
In its simplest form, use a for loop and a range (assuming that your file names are really numbered 1 through 109). Inside the loop, you could append to a list:Note the %s in the string. That's a placeholder. Together with the % operator this can be used to get a variable into a string. Other features exist in Python to do the same, like list comprehensions:
This should do the work for any number of files as long as all are '.CSV'
