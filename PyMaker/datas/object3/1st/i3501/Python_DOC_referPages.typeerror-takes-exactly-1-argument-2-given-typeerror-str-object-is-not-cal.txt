I am looking to brush up on my python so I am writing a small test class. I am making a boy class, and trying to create an instance of Boy called "shy boy" that will say what kind of boy he is (a shy boy) and "hello"Right now I am getting these errors: Thanks!
Speak needs to be passed self as a parameter, since you plan to call it from an instance of the class.For your second issue, your function is named myName, while the property of the class is named name. If you want to print the associated name provided at initialization, just use print shyBoy.name. If you want to try to use the myName function, use print shyBoy.myName("shy boy"). Note the lack of parens for name, since it is not a function and thus takes no arguments.(However, I'm a little confused as to why are you trying to pass name as an argument to myName if you already have saved it in your __init__?)
You are missing the self arg in your function names:If you don't specify self, Python will default to thinking whatever the first arg you've given it is self. Unless you decorate the method with @staticmethod, self will always be the default first argument, and it is implicitly passed in. Thus, in your method call, you are technically saying boy_inst.method(self, myarg). So if the function is only expecting self and you also give it name, then it will say "You've given me too many arguments." That takes care of the Argument number errorsFor the string error you are seeingboy.name is a class variable, not a function. Thus, saying boy.name('hi') is not setting the class variable, it is attempting to call a class method called name:You set name on instantiation of the classThat will set the instance variables. To change these, you either need a method defined such asOr you can create a new class
