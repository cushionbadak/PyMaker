I understand that enum is a class I can inherit from to make my class iterable over the objects.But what does enum() function do, as shown in this code snippet below?
enum is not a class you can inherit from Enum in the enum module is (see the documentation).The enum() in the code you are describing is a callable object that has previously been put into the list chosenEnums. We can't tell you what it is, or does, without the rest of the code.
Not sure what the topic of the question is.. But to possible answers:enumerate can be used to get the iteration index:On the other hand there is: https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.htmlAnd especially: https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html#enum.EnumIt is well documented..
