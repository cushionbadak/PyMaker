On Linux, is there a debugging tool for a python script that prints the lines of code before executing them, similar to the "set -x" directive in shell scripts ?I know the debugging pdb module, but I am not aware it can do this (the stacktrace is not suitable).I know strace, but it does not do this level of debugging.Example :Execution with the hypothetic debugging tool I'm looking for:
The system trace, which is often used by debuggers for similar purposes, can be used to implement such a feature.  Here is a minimal example that you can tweak to suit your needs:Since Python is not bash and the execution model is different, you might not get the exact same output as seen with set -x in a shell script (for example the line + y = "abc" with literal rvalue will not make sense in a Python context) but you should be able to recreate something similar enough to be useful for your needs, by interacting with the frame object passed to the trace.
