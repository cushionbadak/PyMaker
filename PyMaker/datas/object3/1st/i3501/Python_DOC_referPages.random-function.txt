I want to make a for loop with random strings in it. I want the names not to repeat themselves and the prices can occur twice (we were with 5 people and there were 2 drill-motor and 2 Dc-motors to give away).So, 4 people would get a price, 2 people get the drill-motors and 2 people get the DC-motors. How can I do this? Because when I run, the random.sample repeats itself every time it runs a part of the loop and some names and prices occur too often. Thus, I want the names to occur once and each price twice. This is the code: 
Easiest would be to shuffle and zip appropriate lists:
You can shuffle the names list at the beginning, and just iterate over them once.Also random.choice is the better option than random.sample when only one item is chosen.Here's the code
