I have two lists:                  I want to either append list1 or create a new list that results in:I've tried using index with no luck.                
You can achieve this simply using a list comprehension:
You can use filter() to filter the elements that interest you:Output:filter(function, iterable) operates on any iterable and applies the function on each element and to determine if the element of the iterable should be in the output (function(item) == True) or not (function(item) == False )For python3: filter(...) will return an iterator, so you need to stuff the result into a list(...) to get a list returned.
Create a dictionary from your key, value list list2.The dict looks like this:Get the values for the keys in list1.Also, you might prefer numeric data instead of numbers encoded as strings. In this case, create the dictionary with 
If you convert the list list2 into a dict, it would be easier for you do what you want
This is a solution
