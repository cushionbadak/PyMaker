I have the following code:My method: last_price_dataset runs a few other methods that essentially grab a value from a database and produces some calculations based on it. At the moment this passes, and it's correct. However, that value might change by a few decimal points here and there. Is there a unittest I can use that checks if the TimeSeriesValue is close that number in the dict?AssertAlmostEqual doesn't work with dicts like that. Any suggestions?
You could use TestCase.assertAmostEqual(please read more here - https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestCase.assertAlmostEqual):For instance, if the precision is 0 decimal places then the following test passes:OKFor your test it could be like:
I had the same problem today. So I simply build my own method assertDictAlmostEqual.
