I am trying to sort out how to pass the boolean value False from the command line to the argparser. My origninal code looked like:From the command line, I typed: python myscript.py -data FalseAlso variations with single & double quotes around False. When I examine the contents of the args namespace, args.data is always True.So I changed the argument definition from bool to str, with a string "True" default as shown below:I then added some massaging of the args to get the boolean value I really wanted:This workaround does work. Is there a better way to do this?
You can use the store_false or store_true parameter to add_argument (see the argparse documentation). For example, if you want the default to be True then you could add an argument with action='store_false':Then args.no_data will be False if you run python command.py --no-data and True if you run python command.py without the --no-data argument.

If an argument is meant to be a boolean, you should simply use store_true or store_false, so that the presence of the option itself would result in a True or False value, and the absence of the option would result in a False or True value, respectively.From argparse's documentation:
