Could you give me any explanation, pleaseI have a part of the code using ConfigParserFile that I am reading in in the directory ~/ui/config.cfgafter I am calling function below and I get a new file in the directory where my module presents which is (~/ui/helper/config.cfg)It creates a new file in the directory where I am running my code from, but I need the same file to be re-written. How can I do that? And why I keep getting the same behavior ?
Since you're using the same file name (config.cfg) when reading and writing (and also, not altering the working dir), you are operating on the same file. Since you're writing the ~/ui/helper/config.cfg file (it gets created after running the code), that's the one that you're reading from too.So, you are not opening (for reading) the file that you think you are. From [Python]: read(filenames, encoding=None)If a file named in filenames cannot be opened, that file will be ignored.   ...   If none of the named files exist, the ConfigParser instance will contain an empty dataset.You're reading from a file that doesn't exist, which yields an empty config, and that is the config you're writing in your (desired) file. In order to fix your problem, specify the desired file by its full or relative name. You could have something like:In __init__ :In rewrite_pass_in_config:Read:Write
