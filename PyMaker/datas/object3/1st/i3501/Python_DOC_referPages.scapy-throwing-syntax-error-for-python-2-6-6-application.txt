I had worked on a program in Python2.7 and need to retool it for Python 2.6.6. I made some minor changes but receive this error when trying to compile. Has anyone ran into this before? I couldn't find very much on Google. Any help would be appreciated
Set comprehensions are a new feature from Python 3 that got backported to Python 2.7. So if you try to use one in an earlier version, you get a SyntaxError.The simplest change is to pass a generator expression to the set constructor:(This will work all the way back to 2.4. Before that, there's no builtin set, and no generator expressions, but you'd probably have bigger problems with, e.g., exceptionsâ€¦)
Scapy 2.4.0 is not compatible with Python 2.6. You should downgrade Scapy to 2.3.3, which has Python 2.6 (and 2.5, I think) support.
