I am trying to map 2 numpy arrays as [x, y] similar to what zip does for lists and tuples.I have 2 numpy arrays as follows:I am looking for an output as np.array([[[1, 5], [2, 6], [3, 7], [4, 8]]])I tried this but it maps every value and not with same indices. I can add more if conditions here but is there any other way to do so without adding any more if conditions.
You are looking for np.dstackStack arrays in sequence depth wise (along third axis).
IIUC, one way is to use numpy.vstack() followed by transpose():Or you could pass the output of zip to the array constructor:
The built in zip command is the job for you here.  It'll do exactly what you're asking.https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#zip
