I trying to creat a list new_list from other lists a,b,c,d and been searching for a while now and this is what i have come up withIt prints what i want it to, but my problem is that i canÂ´t get to continue...I need to keep it printing the next and next new_list untill list b,c,d runs out of elements. i have tried nested loop, count in item[0] and extracting every element but this is the closest i have come and could really use some help or directions. 
Here you go my friend!We assume that the length of every list is equal to the total number of the lists (without a)This will work for any number of lists with any lengthSame code with explanations
Use itertools.repeat() for the first list (actually, iteratble), and then zip() all your iterables.
Assuming b,c,d are of the same length, you can zip the elements (extending a to the required length first):
Use zip_longest with fillvalue handling empty values in one list:
The other answers result in lists of tuples. If you want a list of lists, I would suggest doing a list comprehension:
