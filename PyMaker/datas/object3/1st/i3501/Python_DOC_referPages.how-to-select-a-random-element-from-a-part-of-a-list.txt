I have a list called gameI need to select a random element from all the ' ' elements only. It will then change it to X or O and do again.Using simple random.choice() has a chance of never ending. random.choices() returns the element instead of its index so I cannot think of a way to update the weights.
Determine which indices have spaces and use random.choice to choose one
