I use yattag to create HTML, and in my code, I want to loop over database records, and, dynamically, creating HTML tables.For example, if the number of divs in the  is 5 : Update : ok, the html I expect is : The (part of) CSS : And, after, I convert the HTML in PDF with PDFKIT lib.But I don't know how to close a tag and (re)create new one, and go on with the loop...Any idea ?Thanks,F.
So the problem is not really about Yattag, right? Your problem is to take the elements by groups of 5 (or whatever fixed number).For this I'd use the islice method from the itertools module.You have an example of how to use this function to create a take function that takes the first n elements of an iterable:https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools-recipesUsing this take function, you can consume an iterable by groups of n elements. Here's the solution to your particular problem:I used the line method of Yattag, which is a shortcut described here: http://www.yattag.org/#shortcut-for-nodes-that-contain-only-text
