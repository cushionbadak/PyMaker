UPDATE: if I change the name of the select module (in which the import error occurs) to select1, the problem goes away! WHAT the?First off: everything works fine when I try to import my package from the command line, or run pytest in the project directory.But in PyCharm I'm getting the "attempted relative import beyond top-level package" problem when I try to run my tests, and ONLY while in PyCharm. I can't figure out why.I have even deleted and re-cloned the repository and the problem still occurs.Here is the link to the problem branch.And here is the tb:I'm sure there is something simple going on here but I just can't figure it out. NOTE: I'm using Python 3.7 RC 1.The sys.path in pycharm and the command line come out to be the same, except pycharm also includes the pycharm project main package directory (which for some reason appears twice).
I was able to solve this by deleting the .idea directory from the cloned repository and re-opening PyCharm. I still don't know what was wrong, but it is fixed now. Very weird.UPDATE: it has something to do with the following line in the project .iml file in the .idea folder:Removing that xml code solves the issue. But I do not know why, and I don't know how it got there in the first place (I do not recall messing around with any of my settings prior to this error).
