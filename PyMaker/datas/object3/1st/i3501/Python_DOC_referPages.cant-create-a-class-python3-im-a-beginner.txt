I want some help for the following question.I created this class.But I can't create objects  from it.I want to make an increment counter. So input these codes, but they doesn't work in the way I assume. Like this:But, actually the result is:How can I get the expected result?
You might be looking to make a subclass of int—something that acts just like an int, but has some extra behavior.To do this, you use inheritance:Now, when you write c = CountFromBy(), it's a CountFromBy instance, which is also an int instance, so:So far, you haven't added any new behavior, but if you want to do that, you just add methods:But if you want to add an increase() method, there's a big problem: int values are immutable. Since CountFromBy values are int values, they're also immutable. There's no way to write the class this way.You might be looking for a class that uses an int, instead of being one. For that, you don't use inheritance, you just create a member:If you want it to print out its number value, you can give it a str method:And now, you can add that increase method—it just replaces self.number with a new value:Finally, you might be looking for the best of both worlds—something that acts as much as possible like an int without actually being one, using an int for storage. This is just like UserDict and friends from the standard library, so you can look at the source for those classes. As you can see, it's a bit more involved, so you probably don't want to try that yet. Plus, you'd have to decide what it means to act "as much as possible like an int", while at the same time being mutable.
There you go.e.g.You can also initialze count by passing the initial value to the constructor.
this is a simple class you can use
