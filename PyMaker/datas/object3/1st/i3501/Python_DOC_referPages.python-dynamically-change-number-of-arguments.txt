This question already has an answer here:Unpack a list in Python?                    3 answers                Expanding tuples into arguments                    5 answers                I want to calculate a cartesian product from a changing number of sets.The cartesian product can be computed using itertools.product(*args, repeat=1)but the number of sets is actually unknown, it depends on the data. Sometimes it might be 2 groups, sometimes 3 or more. Is there a way to submit *args such that it can dynamically change the number of arguments?
Yes, there is such a way. Use the * argument expansion operator:Reference:https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#calls
