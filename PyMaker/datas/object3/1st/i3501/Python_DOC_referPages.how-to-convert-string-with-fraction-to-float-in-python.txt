I'm prepping some data to insert into MySQL. Unfortunately some of the data is in the form 100½. I need to convert this to a float, but obviously float(100½) fails. Is there a method in Python that can handle this conversion? I'm not opposed to hard coding something, but I may encounter ⅝ or other fractions in the future.
