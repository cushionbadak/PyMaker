I have a dictionary that contains times, set up likeHow can I take the Time and change from whatever zone it's in (UTC+2, UTC, UTC+3, etc) and change to, say, USA Chicago (UTC-5)?I've tried using the solution here but get 1900-01-01 10:00:00-05:00.  The date is fine, I can remove that. I am not sure why the time though seems to be a range? I was expecting 24 hour format output.Output:1900-01-01 10:00:00-05:00Desired output:11:00
The date is fine, I can remove that. Better than converting to a string and then trying to munge that, just keep it as a datetime object until you need a string, and then use the strftime method to format it however you want. For example:Or, if you're using f-strings or str.format, you can even put that directly in the format spec for a datetime object:I am not sure why the time though seems to be a range? Actually, it's not. The default str format for displaying datetime objects is based on ISO 8601.1 For local times that know their time zone's UTC offset at the time in question, it's included as a +02:00 or -05:00 on the end.I was expecting 24 hour format output.That's already the default for the str output. But, more importantly, that's what you always get when you ask strftime for %H. (If you want 12 hour, that's %I.)1. But not with default settings for all of the options, like T as the time separator. If you want that, you have to call the isoformat method.
