why this code isn't working?  trying to get returns on items which value==key
The keys() method returns a view of all of the keys.The values() method returns a view of all of the values.So, x.keys()==x.values() is asking whether all of the keys equal all of the values, which is of course not true.Also, filter wants a function. But you're not passing it a function, you're just passing it the result of x.keys()==x.values(), or False. To turn that into a function, you'd need to use def or lambda to create a new function.The function you want to create is a function that takes an item, and returns true if the key equals the value. Since an item is just a 2-element tuple with the key and value for that item, the function to check that is:Or, if that's a bit too confusing, don't try to write it inline; just def it separately:However, this is pretty clumsy; it's much easier to write it as a comprehension than a filter call:As a general rule, whenever you don't already have a function to pass to filter or map, and would have to create one with def or lambda, a comprehension will usually be more readable, because you can just write the expression directly.And, if you want a list rather than a generator, you can do that with a comprehension just by changing the parens to square brackets:And, if you want just the values, not the key-value pairs:If you find yourself confused by comprehensions, they can always be converted into nested statements, with an append at the bottom. So, that last one is equivalent to:Also, you don't really need a dict here in the first place; you just want to iterate over the index, value pairs. So:
