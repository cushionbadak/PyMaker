i am messing about on python trying out classes but i am getting a name error which i dont know how to fix. it works fine when not in a class but now it is it doesnt work i presume this is a obvious problem , or just the whole thing is wrong, and i now look stupid lol, the other variables are things i havent got round to doing yet so ignore them. (yes the stats are ripped straight from fallout")
your problem is that you have the attribute stats and the method stats you can rename your stats attribute to _stats, and also you need to make an object from User class for example
stats() is a method of your class User. That means stats() exists within the scope of User, but out of the scope it is not defined.Then there's another problem: Your __init__ takes an argument with the same name (stats), and then you set stats as an attribute of self. That means you override your method stats() with whatever you pass to the __init__ call (when you set self.stats = stats). You should rename this attribute, maybe to self._stats = stats.And in your global scope, you have never instantiated your class User. So you could do something like this:This will resolve the error. However I'm not sure if the code will do what you expect it to do. You define a lot of variables within stats(), like strength etc. Maybe you'd want to define them as attributes to self, so self.strength = ....You can then access them in the global scope via user.strength etc.
