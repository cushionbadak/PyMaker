I am trying to create a Python extension that takes arguements.  This is my script:Setup.py:However when I try to compile it I am left with an error:I am quite sure the rest of my code is correct except for taking the arguments at:The extension is created, however when I try to run it, it crashes.How can I take positional arguments?
You need to specify the type of argument in the second parameter. For example: where z indicates a C-style zero delimited string, "zz" indicates you have two of them.  These are called specifers, and there are many of them, here are some of the most common:Also, your "-1" should be -1 in functions.
Did you have looking for disutils ?This library can run C code and maybe help you. You can get more informations about in this page of the official Python's documentation : https://docs.python.org/3/extending/building.html
