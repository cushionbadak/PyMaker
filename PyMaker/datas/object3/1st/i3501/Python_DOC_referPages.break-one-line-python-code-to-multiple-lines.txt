How to break one line code into multiple descriptive line because i am unable to understand this one line code.Is this correct or not any one help me:
Well, generally you can see any opening bracket and the plus operators in the string as a "breaking point". Working with your example:OK so now we need to unpack what's happening in that join:OK so we've got some string formatting and a bunch of list comprehensions:To do the last stage there was a lot of going back and for as things were expanded. Those list comprehensions are quite terse...There are some questions here though:Where did values come from?What's the "{}".format(a) for?etc.Your "expanded" code is not quite equivalent because you don't handle the case where there are no matches / values is empty and you are replacing data each time rather than growing it.
This code is collecting a string representation of a, and then building another string with it.You need to define an external list, to account for the list comprehension expression.Further, to break down how c is being assembled, you can expand the list comprehension:Finally, just combine the three parts:
You might want to read up on list comprehensions. basically it's making a list of things like this:[item for item in iterable_thing] so this one is making a list of strings ("{}".format(a)). I assume a is a hash, but let's pretend it's a number in a range:["{}".format(a) for a in range(5)]will make:>>>['0', '1', '2', '3', '4']Comprehensions can become quite complicated with the addition of if statements, and whoever wrote this code is one of those a in b in i in j kind of people, it seems, so their code is hard to follow. Good variable names are SO important.
