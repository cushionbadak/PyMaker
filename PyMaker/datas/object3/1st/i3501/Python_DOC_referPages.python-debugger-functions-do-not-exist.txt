The pdb module should contain a function called set_trace, however, when I run the code import pdb; pdb.set_trace() I get an error message saying module 'pdb' has no attribute 'set_trace'. Why is this error happening, even though my code is correct?Here the code.py file I am executing to get this error:And here is the complete output of my program:
One of the first things that pdb does after you execute it is import a modulecalled code. However, since you've named your file code.py Python ends upexecuting both files. When your file is executed for the second time, it printsthe "Hello, World!" message again. At this point, Python is still processing thefirst import pdb statement when it encounters the same statement again. In alanguage like C, this would result in infinite recursion, but Pythonautomatically ignores duplicate imports(documentation).Thus, Python ends up executing the next line of your code, pdb.set_trace(),before the initial import pdb statement finished executing, which is whyyou see an error message telling you that pdb.set_trace() does not exist.To fix this, you could just rename your file to something else, but it would bebetter to add a check so that your code doesn't execute when it is imported by adifferent file:
