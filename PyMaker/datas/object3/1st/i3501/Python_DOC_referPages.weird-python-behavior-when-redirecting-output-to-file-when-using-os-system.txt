Natural Text
I got a problem that I think related to the low level of how the redirecting output (operator >) and os.system work  PROBLEMThis is my code. I want to get the 2 last line of bunch of text file. It works fine, but how the output is organized confused me  Standard output when I called python my_script.py (It worked as my expectation. I cut off most of the output since it's redundant):But when I redirected the output to a file (by calling python my_script.py > results), the =============== part is always print at the end of the results:Can anyone explain to me something wrong here? I would love to hear any information!Thanks in advance
You've got two things writing to stdout, both with their own buffers. This is one of the many reasons you usually don't want to use os.system. You can force Python to flush it output after each print just by using the flush=True argument. Or you can even open(sys.stdout.fileno(), 'wb', buffering=0) and then write your own bytes to that to disable buffering.But that may or may not be sufficient, because you still won't have any control over what os.system writes. If you want to make sure its output is either unbuffered, or shares the same buffers as Python, there's no way around that except using subprocess. As the docs for os.system said to do in the first place.So:
