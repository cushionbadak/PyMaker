I am trying to execute the following Python script from Excel usingMacrosTrigger.py contains the following sample codeos.getcwd() returns the location of the Python interpreter. For automation purposes, I would like to be able to return the location of the workbook that is calling the script. i.e. location of the wb.
The absolute path of an xlwings.Book can be obtained via the fullname attribute, so in your case wb.fullname.In the comments you said you were only referring to the foldername. In this case, use Check out the docs for os.path for lots of other useful functions to work with filenames.
