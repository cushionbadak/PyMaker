This question might generate be a very simple answer of, "Yep, that's fine".  I'm trying to come up with a simple way to generate a random number from between (inclusive)1 and 9223372036854775807Should be easy right?  I'm doing this and I think it's working correctly.My concern is that 9223372036854775807 is the upper bound of BIGINT for the SQL datatype.  Does randint have an upper bound like the SQL datatype?  Is there some other pythonic way I should be approaching this?
According to docs.python.org , randint returns a random integer N such that a <= N <= b. Alias for randrange(a, b+1). There's nothing about limits.Also, in Python 3 the plain int type is unbounded.So, I think it should be fine.
