I know of the print_slow function to make a print looks like a human typing. however, how can i make it print out instantly or skip the slow typing to show the print immediately by pressing a key or enter?I have a sample code above, would anyone help me out?
You need to use threading trick to simultaneously print and wait for user input. Have a look at this code (pressing Enter key will tell program to print fast):
