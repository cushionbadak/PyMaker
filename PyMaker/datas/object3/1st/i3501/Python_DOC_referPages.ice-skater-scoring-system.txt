This is a program i have been working on but i have had some problems with. When this program is executed it prints the list of skaters and there information twice but i don't want that but i don't know how to fix itwhen i run the program with some test results this is what it prints:as you can see it prints it twice which I don't want.
You need to recreate list each time through the loop.On the first time through the loop, list and l_list are both empty: you get name and scores, append them to list and append that to l_list. All is good.But then you go through the loop a second time for your next skater. You append their name and scores to list which already has the previous skater's name and scored. Then you append that whole thing to l_list again. Now l_list has two copies of list, and list has both skaters and their scores.Adding list = [] before you call list.append() should resolve the issue.
You are off to a good start but I would like to warn you against using the variable name list. That is the name of a type in Python so instead, you can use lst or list_. In this case, I'd call it skater_list. This question covers all the names not to use for variables.When you're adding names and scores to your lists, you never clear them out so you are adding them multiple times.However, I don't think lists would actually be your most useful data structure here. I think a dict where the key is the name and the values are the scores would work best.At the start, create a dict rather than your lists:When printing the list out, print the dict instead:Remove your code to add the items to the listsInstead, add them to a dictionary. Here I made the key the name of the skater and stored both all the remaining scores and the average score.Note, you still need to clear out the score list:The output here would be something like:
