mypy is really handy and catches a lot of bugs, but when I write "scientific" applications, I often end up doing:number is either a float or int, depending on the user's input. Is there an official way to do that?
Use float only, as int is implied in that type:PEP 484 Type Hints specifically states that:Rather than requiring that users write import numbers and then use numbers.Float etc., this PEP proposes a straightforward shortcut that is almost as effective: when an argument is annotated as having type float, an argument of type int is acceptable; similar, for an argument annotated as having type complex, arguments of type float or int are acceptable.(Bold emphasis mine).Ideally you would still use numbers.Real:as that would accept fractions.Fraction() and decimal.Decimal() objects as well; the number pyramid is broader than just integers and floating point values.However, these are not currently working when using mypy to do your type checking, see Mypy #3186.
