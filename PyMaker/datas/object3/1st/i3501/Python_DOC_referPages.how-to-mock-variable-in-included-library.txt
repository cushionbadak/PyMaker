Folks,I have a problem during including file.py to test_file.py namely:file.py uses Robot library BuiltIn:And when I try to include file.py in my test_file.pyI receive:How can I mock this? This is posible at all?
Sure, the issue is just that you can't mock the BuiltIn class where it is used (in file.py). You have to mock the class where it is declared (in robot.libraries.BuiltIn).Using mocks:Using monkeypatch fixture:Also note that the mocking is done for the scope of a single test only, so you can't import file on top of the test module as the BuiltIn will be unpatched there, raising the context error.
