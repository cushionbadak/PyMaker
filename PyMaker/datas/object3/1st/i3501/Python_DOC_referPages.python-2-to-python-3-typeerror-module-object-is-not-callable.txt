Change the lines to:You can find more information on this module **https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.request.html#urllib.request.Request**https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.request.html#urllib.request.urlopen
@kvmahesh's answer is absolutely correct. I'll just provide an alternate solution which supports both the versions. Use Python's requests library for making the call.For detailed usage of requests: Python Requests Docs
urllib.request is a module. You are calling the module on line 22... To fix do following:1) Import at the top:2) then pass the url to urlopen(url)3) See similar error hereTypeError: 'module' object is not callable
