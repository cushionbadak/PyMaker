I am new in programming...My code is very simple. Let's say my number is '123' then i want to get 'abc' .please check where i am wrongI am getting an error here like this num_2_char = number.replace(search_array, replace_array);  TypeError: expected a character buffer objectPlease help me...
The problem is that str.replace replaces one substring with a replacement substring. That's what the error means: it wants a substring, and you gave it a list of separate characters.You could loop over the replacement pairs, calling replace for each one:Or you could just use str.translate, which actually does do what you want, although it requires a bit of setup:Or, alternatively, and probably more readable:By the way, if it isn't intentional that you specified d twice in a row, it might be clearer (and harder to make that typo!) to specify the letters like this:
You can use a dictionary instead. There's a few steps here:We want to map every number to a character, so we can create a dictionary with the input characters as keys and the output characters as values.You can't iterate a numerical input, so we have to convert it to a string to access each character in turn. In your example the value is already a string ('123') but there's no reason you can't make the function accept both numerical and string inputs.The replacement is done in a list comprehension, which naturally returns a list. So you need to call join() to join all of the characters back together into a single string.One approach is as follows:In this case I've used replace_dict.get(str(item), '_') so that the code doesn't crash if someone gives an input that isn't in the replace_dict; instead they just get back underscores. There's probably better ways to handle that, but it's safer than just trying to access the dictionary as replace_dict[item].
