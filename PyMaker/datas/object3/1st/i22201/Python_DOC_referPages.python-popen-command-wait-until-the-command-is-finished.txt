I have a script where I launch with popen a shell command.The problem is that the script doesn't wait until that popen command is finished and go continues right away.How can I tell to my Python script to wait until the shell command has finished?
Depending on how you want to work your script you have two options. If you want the commands to block and not do anything while it is executing, you can just use subprocess.call.If you want to do things while it is executing or feed things into stdin, you can use communicate after the popen call.As stated in the documentation, wait can deadlock, so communicate is advisable.
You can you use subprocess to achieve this.
What you are looking for is the wait method.
wait() works fine for me. The subprocesses p1, p2 and p3 are executed at the same. Therefore, all processes are done after 3 seconds.   
Let the command you are trying to pass be then you covert it to a statementnow the python will be waiting for the output from the commandline so that it could be assigned to the variable t.
