I have the following code:The code should find the lowest value in my list (-1.2) but instead when i print 'x' it finds the value is still 100.0Where is my code going wrong?
To find the minimum value of a list, you might just as well use min:Or, if you want the result as a string, rather than a float, use a key function:
You aren't comparing integers, you're comparing strings. Strings compare lexicographically -- meaning character by character -- instead of (as you seem to want) by converting the value to a float. Make your list hold numbers (floats or integers, depending on what you want), or convert the strings to floats or integers in your loop, before you compare them.You may also be interested in the min builtin function, which already does what your current loop does (without the converting, that is.)
It looks like you want to convert the list to a list of numbersor if it really is strings you want, that you want to use min's key argument
Python has a built in min function to help you with finding the smallest.However, you need to convert your list items to numbers before you can find the lowest integer( what, isn't that float? )
l is a list of strings. When you put numbers between single quotes like that, you are creating strings, which are just a sequence of characters. To make your code work properly, you would have to do this:If you must use a list of strings, you can try to let Python try to make a number out of each string. This is similar to Justin's answer, except it understands floating-point (decimal) numbers correctly.I hope that this is code that you are writing to learn either Python or programming in general. If this is the case, great. However, if this is production code, consider using Python's built-in functions.
Cast the variable to a float before doing the comparison:The problem is that you are comparing strings to floats, which will not work.


Or no float conversion at all by just specifying floats in the list.or
You have to start somewhere the correct code should be: The code to return the minimum value l = [ '0.0', '1','-1.2']x = l[0]for i in l:    if i < x:        x = iprint xBut again it's good to use directly integers instead of using quotations '' This way! l = [ 0.0, 1,-1.2]x = l[0]for i in l:    if i < x:        x = iprint x
This is the answer, i needed this for my homework, took your code, and i deleted the " " around the numbers, it then worked, i hope this helped 
You have strings in the list and you are comparing them with the number 100.0.
