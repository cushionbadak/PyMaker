I'm trying to put together a really simple module with one .py source file in it, and have already run into a roadblock. I was going to call it scons-config but import scons-config doesn't work in Python. I found this SO question and looked at PEP8 style guide but am kind of bewildered, it doesn't talk about two-word-name conventions.What's the right way to deal with this?module name: SconsConfig? scons_config? sconsconfig? scons.config?name of the single .py file in it: scons-config.py? scons_config.py?edit: I did see "the use of underscores is discouraged" and that left me at a dead end: should I use "sconsconfig" or "scons_config" (I guess the other ones are out)?
If you have to, always use underscores _.Using a dot . would not even work, otherwise would break.But PEP 8 clearly describes it:Package and Module NamesModules should have short, all-lowercase names.  Underscores can be used        in the module name if it improves readability.  Python packages should        also have short, all-lowercase names, although the use of underscores is        discouraged.UPDATE:To directly target your question: I think sconsconfig is fine. It is not too long and quite readable. But honestly, I don't think anyone will blame you if you use underscores and your code will run with either decision. There is always a certain level where you should not care that much anymore.
First, the module name is the same as the name of the single .py file.  In Python-speak, a collection of several .py files is a package.PEP-8 discourages breaking up package names with underscores.  A quick peak at my site-packages directory shows that multiword names are commonly just run together (e.g., setuptools, sqlalchemy)Module names (that is, file names) may be broken up by underscores (and I usually do this, because I hate namesthatruntogethersoyoucanhardlyreadthem).Stick with lower-case only (per PEP-8).  This avoids problems when going from case-sensitive to case-insensitive filesystems and vice versa.
Aside from PEP-8, you can also check out how the native Python modules deal with this issue. If you were to compare the native modules of Python 2 to that of Python 3, you would see that the new tendency with the official devs is to avoid uppercase and underscores. For example, ConfigParser in Python 2 becomes configparser in Python 3.Looking at this, the best course of action would be to avoid uppercase and underscores, and just join the words together, i.e. sconsconfig. 
- is a no go. The symbol is used for minus operator. The same is true in most programming languages. Use _ or otherwise nothing at all.
