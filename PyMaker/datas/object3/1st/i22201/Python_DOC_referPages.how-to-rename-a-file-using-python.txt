Use os.rename:
This will work to rename or move a file.
File may be inside a directory, in that case specify the path:
os.rename(old, new)This is found in the Python docs: http://docs.python.org/library/os.html
As of Python 3.4 one can use the pathlib module to solve this.If you happen to be on an older version, you can use the backported version found hereLet's assume you are not in the root path (just to add a bit of difficulty to it) you want to rename, and have to provide a full path, we can look at this: So, you can take your path and create a Path object out of it:Just to provide some information around this object we have now, we can extract things out of it. For example, if for whatever reason we want to rename the file by modifying the filename from the_file to the_file_1, then we can get the filename part:And still hold the extension in hand as well: We can perform our modification with a simple string manipulation:And now we can perform our rename by calling the rename method on the path object we created and appending the ext to complete the proper rename structure we want:More shortly to showcase its simplicity: 
Use os.rename. But you have to pass full path of both files to the function. If I have a file a.txt on my desktop so I will do and also I have to give full of renamed file too.

You can use os.system to invoke terminal to accomplish the task:
this should do it. python 3+
