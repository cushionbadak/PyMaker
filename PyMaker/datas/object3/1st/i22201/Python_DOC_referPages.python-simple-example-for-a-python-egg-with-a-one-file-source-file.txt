I'm not quite sure how to build a really simple one-file source module. Is there a sample module out there one the web somewhere which can be built as a python .egg?From the setuptools page it looks pretty simple, you just have your setup.py file and then at least one other .py file somewhere, and I can build an .egg file OK, and even install it using easy_install, but I can't seem to import the file from within python. (note: using 2.6.4)here's my sample dir:setup.py:sconsconfig.py:If I run setup.py bdist_egg it then creates an egg file, but if I look in it, there's no .py source file....
You can use the py_modules argument instead of the packages argument to list single file modules.See https://docs.python.org/3/distutils/setupscript.html#listing-individual-modules
For distutils, from https://docs.python.org/3/distutils/introduction.html#a-simple-example :Then you only need a file:And in Ubuntu 14.04:puts it under:without any directories.
