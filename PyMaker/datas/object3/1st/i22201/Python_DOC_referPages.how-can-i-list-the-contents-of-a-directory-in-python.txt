Can’t be hard, but I’m having a mental block.

One way:Another way:Examples found here.The glob.glob method above will not list hidden files.
os.walk can be used if you need recursion:
glob.glob or os.listdir will do it.
The os module handles all that stuff.os.listdir(path)Return a list containing the names of the entries in the directory given by path.   The list is in arbitrary order. It does not include the special entries '.' and   '..' even if they are present in the directory.Availability: Unix, Windows.
In Python 3.4+, you can use the new pathlib package:Path.iterdir() returns an iterator, which can be easily turned into a list:
Since Python 3.5, you can use os.scandir.The difference is that it returns file entries not names. On some OSes like windows, it means that you don't have to os.path.isdir/file to know if it's a file or not, and that saves CPU time because stat is already done when scanning dir in Windows:example to list a directory and print files bigger than max_value bytes:(read an extensive performance-based answer of mine here)
Below code will list directories and the files within the dir. The other one is os.walk
