In Python, I'd like to be able to create a function that behaves both as a class function and an instance method, but with the ability to change behaviors. The use case for this is for a set of serializable objects and types. As an example:I know that given the definition of classmethod() in funcobject.c in the Python source, this looks like it'd be simple with a C module. Is there a way to do this from within python?Thanks!With the hint of descriptors, I was able to do it with the following code:Thank you Alex!
Sure, you just need to define your own descriptor type.  There's an excellent tutorial on Python descriptors here.
