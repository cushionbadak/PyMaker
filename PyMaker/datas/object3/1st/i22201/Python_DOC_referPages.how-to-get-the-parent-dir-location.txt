this code is get the templates/blog1/page.html  in b.py:but i want to get the parent dir location:and  how to get the aParent locationthanksupdated:this is right:or 
You can apply dirname repeatedly to climb higher: dirname(dirname(file)). This can only go as far as the root package, however. If this is a problem, use os.path.abspath: dirname(dirname(abspath(file))).
os.path.abspath doesn't validate anything, so if we're already appending strings to __file__ there's no need to bother with dirname or joining or any of that. Just treat __file__ as a directory and start climbing:That's far less convoluted than os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__),"..")) and about as manageable as dirname(dirname(__file__)). Climbing more than two levels starts to get ridiculous.But, since we know how many levels to climb, we could clean this up with a simple little function:
Use relative path with the pathlib module in Python 3.4+:You can use multiple calls to parent to go further in the path:As an alternative to specifying parent twice, you can use
Should give you the path to a.But if b.py is the file that is currently executed, then you can achieve the same by just doing
os.pardir is a better way for ../ and more readable. This will return the parent path of the given_path
A simple way can be:
May be join two .. folder, to get parent of the parent folder?
Use the following to jump to previous folder:If you need multiple jumps a good and easy solution will be to use a simple decorator in this case.
Here is another relatively simple solution that:does not use dirname() (which does not work as expected on one level arguments like "file.txt" or relative parents like "..")does not use abspath() (avoiding any assumptions about the current working directory) but instead preserves the relative character of pathsit just uses normpath and join:Result:
I think use this is better:
