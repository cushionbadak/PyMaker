Natural Text
I would like to keep the total number of digits (before and after the decimal point) of a float constant in python.For example, if I want to impose a fixed width of 7:1234.567890123would become1234.567but12345.678901234would become12345.67Fixing the number of decimals does not work in this case since it depends on how many digits I have before the decimal point. I also tried the [width] option but it impose a minimum width and I need a maximum.Thanks for your input!
Just by using your example,
The simplest solution is probably to use the exponential format with one less than the number of digits.I ended up writing this solution that can print floats as well as exponentials but it's probably unnecessarily long for most needs.
You can set the precision when using decimalIt sounds like you also want to round down, but could choose other rounding options if you like.  You create a context that includes the precision, rounding logic, and a few other options.  You can apply the context to all future operations with setcontext, a single number using normalize, or with a context manager using localcontext.
