Can I change variables in a subclass object based on user need? If so, how, or is there a different approach?I want a subclass list of variables to grow in size based on a user's demands without having to prewrite the *self.*variables in the init, and allow the user to make a list. How do you handle a list with changing length in the subclass?Desired output is [[getattr(item, x) for x in list1] for item in list2] returns 3 values for first instance and 4 values for second instance. The error I receive when trying getattr(item, x) on an instance of this class is AttributeError: 'MyClass' object has no attribute <key>, where <key> is list1, rather than the value in list1.The work-around I have is to pre-populate the fields, like so: I have to do this each time I want to subtract or add a variable. This won't work. Anyone? 
Same as always:
