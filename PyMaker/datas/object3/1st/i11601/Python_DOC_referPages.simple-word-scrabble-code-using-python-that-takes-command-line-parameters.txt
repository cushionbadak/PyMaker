I am trying to create a simple word scrabble script that finds words score values. The script should reads two parameters from the command line and display the best word value, which returns the word with highest point value. I have created a constructor that reads the file and populate a dictionary of letter/value for use with the remaining methods of the class. For example the command line parameters should look like the following:Here is what I have so far. I know that import argv is helful, but not sure how to get started.
What you need is to use the argparse modulehttps://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.htmlI took your example and added argparse.
You can get the arguments you script was passed on the command line with sys.argv.
