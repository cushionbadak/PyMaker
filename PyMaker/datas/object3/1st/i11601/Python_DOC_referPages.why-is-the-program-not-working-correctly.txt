Natural Text
I'm doing a project for school and one of the tasks is to create a program that will tell the user how long it took them to type in the alphabet correctly. It always says "Try again" no matter if the input is correct or not; I'm not really sure what I did wrong.I'd much appreciate if someone could help me tackle this problem.
Str.capitalize only capitalises the first letter not the whole word. You want str.upper()
