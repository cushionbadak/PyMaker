hoping someone can help me out. I followed a couple of guides about setting up a new machine for python development. (one) (two)I followed pretty much everything but I am really confused about the changes to my .bash_profile When I comment out export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH in .bash_profile and type which python into terminal, I see what I expect.What is happening in bash_profile, how come it doesn't matter if I comment everything out, save it, and run the commands?More importantly, how do I get to my default install of python and make sure it is still there and unaffected? Am I correct in understanding that the above version is the python installed by Homebrew?
.bash_profile is read only when the Bash shell is loaded, so changing this file after the shell has been loaded doesn't affect it. To see the changes after modifying and saving the file, you need to restart the shell or run source ~/.bash_profile.Modifying the PATH environment variable doesn't affect the Python itself, it only modifies where it's searched first to be executed, when you will run python .... E.g., if you have python installed in /a/python and /b/python, then: if your PATH is set to /a/python:/b/python:$PATH and you run python ....py actually the /a/python ....py is executed;if your PATH is set to /b/python:/a/python:$PATH and you run python ....py actually the /b/python ....py is executed.If you didn't modified the PATH (e.g. but executing something like export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH in the shell or adding it to .bash_profile), then executing which python should show the default python path. In the case you described, it shows you the python, that you set it to use by modifying the PATH. To see the default one, comment the  export... string, save the .bash_profile file and either run source ~/.bash_profile or restart the shell, and only then see the which python output.
