I'm writting a small code for encode with arithmetic encoding. I need to set a determinate precision but I must be doing something wrong. This is the code : As I've read in the python documentation getcontext().prec should set the precision I'm willing to work with. After some iterations, d_start and d_with is very small ( ~ e^-20 ) and the variables start and width stay with the same valor from that moment on. If further information is needed please don't hesistate asking for it.Thanks in advanceEdit 1: Proper indentation of the codeEdit 2: I've made a print of d_start after each sum to show what I mean by saying "and the variables start and width stay with the same valor from that moment on. "Here you have the results:
The problem is that getcontext().prec is only used for decimal.Decimal variables... and you define start and width as float.You should force usage of Decimal, for example that way (assuming a from decimal import *)
