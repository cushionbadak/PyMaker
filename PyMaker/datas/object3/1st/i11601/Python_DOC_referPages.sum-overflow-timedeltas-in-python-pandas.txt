While trying to sum across timedeltas in pandas, it seems to work for a slice but not the whole column. 
If VOID-DAYS represents an integer number of days, convert the Timedeltas into integers:If the Timedeltas include seconds or smaller units, then use to convert the value to a float.Pandas Timedeltas (Series and TimedeltaIndexes) store all timedeltas as ints compatible with NumPy's timedelta64[ns] dtype. This dtype uses 8-byte ints to store the timedelta in nanoseconds. The largest number of days representable in this format is Which is why raises a ValueError, butdoes not.
