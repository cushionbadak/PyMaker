I know there must be a way to do this.  But I'm getting the error "TypeError: the first argument must be callable".What could I do differently to make this work?
staticmethod objects are not callable. They're descriptors that keep references to original functions in their __func__ attributes.So the following works:You could also define a helper function in the class namespace, to avoid unnecessary attribute lookups:Though the correct Python 3.4+ solution is to use the partialmethod, which was designed to work with descriptors:
There's probably a smarter way to do it but this seems to work fine.
methods and functions behave differently when "called": functions are called directly by using __call__ while methods (not generally methods, I think only descriptors) are called by __get__. Therefore the functools-module contains another partial for methods: functools.partialmethod:The official documentation contains a very good explanation especially in regard to staticmethod.
