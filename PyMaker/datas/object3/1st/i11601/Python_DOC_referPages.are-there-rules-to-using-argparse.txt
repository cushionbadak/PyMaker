When using argparse, how do I decide if something should be a positional argument, an optional argument, or a subcommand?
A positional argument is typically required.  For example, if your program always needs to be passed a file to read, that file would be a positional argument.An optional argument is, unsurprisingly, optional.  This might be an argument that can have a sane default (ie your program defaults to running on port 8080 but can accept other ports) or it might be a flag to turn on optional behavior (ie a verbose flag).A subparser is typically used when you want to add a whole suite of different commands to a single script.  Perhaps your script can either read or write files, and the read and write operations expect various flags that don't overlap.  In this case, it would make sense to have a subparser for the read operation and a subparser for the write operation to simplify the parsing of those flags.Most simple programs will want to stick with positional and optional arguments: you'll typically know when you actually need to use a subparser.Here's a (very contrived) example program that uses all three:And here's its help text:
