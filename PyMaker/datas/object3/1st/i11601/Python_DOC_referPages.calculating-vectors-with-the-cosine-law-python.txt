This question already has an answer here:Python's trigonmetric function return unexpected values                    6 answers                I was trying to develop a little console aplication for solving additions between vectors using the Cosine Law:# Where s1 and s2 are the sizes of the vectors, respectively.But the, the cos in the equation returned a weird value (the angle was 60, so the cos(angle) should be 1/2, right?).Also, I tried changing the cos with acos after reading other solutions, but it returned ValueError: math domain error.Does anyone know how to solve this?
Python's trigonometric functions use radians, rather than degrees.  Fortunately, the math module includes a function to perform the conversion for you:
Argument of cos() should be expressed in radians.
