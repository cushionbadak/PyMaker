I'm trying to load Mongodb data into pandas dataframe. Can somebody help me to correctly translate the following query part (contains condition) to use it within python:Right now I load everything and then remove the extras by the following command:but with this approach I load a lot of extra data for no reason.Thank you very much!  
You need to use the re module to first compile your regex, then use the $regex operator.
Pandas groupby(), filter(), agg(), apply(), etc. are your friends.See the filtration and transformation (the latter more so) in Group By:split-apply-combine Pandas documentation. Use a regular expression for the filter parameter.
With a big help from joao, Sean and google, I found a solution for my question:import repat = re.compile(r'.\Qcertain_string\E.') db.collection.find({'Url': {'$regex': pat}})
