I have some code which parses through a number of .CVS files, retrieves all the data for several columns and places the data in a data frame (called dfs).  I am now trying to return all of the data fields in dfs that are between two dates only.I am trying to use the command:but get the following error:Could someone let me know what I've done wrong please? Please see below for my code:the head of dfs (from which I want to return data between two dates (say between 2001-01-03 and 2001-01-05) looks like this:
Here date is the name of your index and not a column name:Change:into:
you can do it much simpler if your index is monotonically increasing sequence of dates:showing all rows, but only first two columns:filtering rows, showing first two columns:or in your case:
In Python, '&' is is bitwise "and", and is logical "and".Best to use a list comprehension here.The will go through the dfs list, check for each element the if conditions and return a new list with all the elements that met those conditions.
