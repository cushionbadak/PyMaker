Natural Text
I am reading the contents of a wireshark dump from a text file, line by line.  One of the things I can pick out easily is the protocol used in that specific line of the wireshark output(as shown in the code below).  The problem I'm running into is pulling out the ip addressess from the line.  As you can see in the sample output below, and my code, it was fairly easy to pull out the protocol because it was always capitialized and there was a space on either side of it.  The ip addresses however, aren't as uniform and I'm not quite sure how to pull them out as well.  This is mostly due to the fact that I'm not quite sure how all the parts of the re.match() work.  Can somebody help me out in this, and possibly explain how the re.match() parameters work?Sample Wireshark Output: 604 1820.381625 10.200.59.77 -> 114.113.226.43 TCP 54 ssh > 47820 [FIN, ACK] Seq=1848 Ack=522 Win=16616 Len=0
The first regex group is greedy (.*) and is matching everything, you can make it non-greedy by adding ?, i.e.:The above example is will capture 3 groups containing the remote address 114.113.226.43, protocol TCP and port 54 respectively.Regex101 Demo
Start by look at the regex documentation, for python it is here:https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.htmlThere are also many sites that have good tutorials, samples and interactive testers such as:http://regexr.com/I don't know the output format of wireshark, but I would imagine it is documented somewhere.This should get your ip addresses:
As people have already responded, regex is the way to go. A sample code for the purpose
