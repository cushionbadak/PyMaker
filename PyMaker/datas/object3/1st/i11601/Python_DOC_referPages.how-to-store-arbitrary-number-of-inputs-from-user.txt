Just wondering how I would store the inputs for an average sum of square roots problem.The user can input as many numbers as they until they type 'end'here is what i have for that
You can append these values to a list. Sum and then divide by the length for the average.
The next thing you'd want to learn about is a data structure such a list. You can then add items to the list on the fly with list.append.However, it's noteworthy that where ever you're learning Python from will certainly go over lists at one point or another.
If you mean that you want to store all the x values given, just use a list. l = [] l.append(x).
