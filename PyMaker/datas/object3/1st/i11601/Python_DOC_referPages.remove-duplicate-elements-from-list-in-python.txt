However i'm unable to perform it using set(). List contains IP address and date following is my code and listI get the following error:Thanks in advance.
You can't use list type elements in a set, since list is mutable entity. For the same reason, you can't use list as key of a dictionary. You need to have an immutable type, like tuple.So, you can convert inner elements to tuple before passing to set:Check this section to doc:Though tuples may seem similar to lists, they are often used in  different situations and for different purposes. Tuples are immutable,  and usually contain a heterogeneous sequence of elements that are  accessed via unpacking (see later in this section) or indexing (or  even by attribute in the case of namedtuples). Lists are mutable, and  their elements are usually homogeneous and are accessed by iterating  over the list.
