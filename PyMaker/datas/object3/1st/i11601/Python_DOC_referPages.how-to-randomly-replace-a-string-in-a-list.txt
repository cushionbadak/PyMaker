If I have something like this:And let's say that I want to replace certain number of those strings. How do I randomly select a position within the list to replace it for something else? For example:
Use random.randrangeNon-repeat solution:
Actually, you can use the module random and its function randint, as it follows:For more information, you can check the random module documentation at: https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.htmlEDIT: Now sampling random number using random.sample, rather than using random.randint, which may generate the same number during different iterations.
Simply call replaceit with newL to replace another random character. 
use random.choice
suppose u want to replace it with 'a' :try the following:
i have a Java background, a newbie to python.I will suggest to generate a random number from first to last index of that list, and insert the new string to the newly generated index.Refer to this question to insert a value at a specific position in a list.
This non-repeat solution relies on random.shuffle():
