New to Python but finding it very fun to work with! I'm having some trouble with this script I'm writing though.What the script does: it reads a csv file, loops over all the rows within it and places the information on the second position [1] of each row in a list (a, b, c, d and e). Then it concatenates a string (that is used as a query in another application)Structure of the csv file:The problem:when I use a csv file that has the comma as delimiter it works fine. When I use a csv file with semicolon as delimiter it results in an error: IndexError: list index out of range. it appears as if the rows in the semicolon delimited file are not perceived as consisting of multiple list itemsThe code: I hope someone can point me in the right direction?!thanks in advance!
The csv.reader function accepts a delimiter argument, see the documentation for more.To handle quoted fields, you need to look at values for the quoting argument.In fact, you can also deduce the file attributes using the csv.Sniffer class. This is useful when you don't know the delimiter. Again, directly from the documentation:
