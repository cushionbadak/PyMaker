I had this:Since sometimes msg was already bytes, I wanted to concat msg.encode('utf-8') if it was string or else just msg, so I did this:But it is not working as I expected, since now msg equals msg. (time + log level isn't getting added).Should I do if/else instead?
A conditional expression has a very low precedence; it is executed last only before a lambda. As such the expression, as written, choses between either time + b' - ' + Logger.LEVELS_WORD[msg_loglevel] + b': ' + msg or msg.encode('utf-8')) + b'\n'.Put the conditional expression with the if and else branches in parentheses:Consider using duck-typing (test for hasattr(msg, 'encode')), and breaking up the expression into multiple lines for readability. If you are using Python 3.5 or newer, perhaps you want to use printf-style formatting:
