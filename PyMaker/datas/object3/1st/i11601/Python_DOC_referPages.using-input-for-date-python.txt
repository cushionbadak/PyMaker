I am trying to make a simple code in python 3 that shows you the day when you enter the month year and day. This is the code:The above code works, but I tried to doso I could let users enter their own day, but it gives me the following error:I used the input 2016, 4, 29 if it helps.
You could do:datetime.date() expects 3 integers but input() returns a string. This means that we have to:split the string returned by input() by comma to get three partsconvert each part to an integerfeed these parts to datetime.date()This makes more sense, if you ask me:datetime.strptime() takes a string as input which is convenient because input() happens to return a string. This means that the splitting and casting/converting isn't necessary. You can find all the different date formats supported by strptime() in the datetime docs.
