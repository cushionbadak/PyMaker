Natural Text
I'm having some trouble create a table using values from a text file. My text file looks like this:I would like to generate a table containing arrays where: the last column (amountpaid) value is less than the third column's (final total), and if the fifth column's (status) equals 'A'. Outstanding total is found when subtracting final total and amount paid. My code to generate a table is:My desired output isHowever, when I run the code, the output is the table repeated over and over, and negative values are in the outstanding amount column. I'm using python 3.4.3.
well you read the file again in the loop so it repeats for every line you have in the table. try doing this:(note this time there is only 1 for loop on the file lines)**side note: you might want to check out the csv module:https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html
The table is repeating over and over again because you read the file at the top of your script and then for every line in the file you reopen the file again.Here is one approach using namedtuple:References:namedtuplestring formattingargument unpacking
