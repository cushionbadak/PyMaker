Natural Text
I have just started to learn python.I want to write a program in NLTK that breaks a text into unigrams, bigrams. For example if the input text is: "I am feeling sad and disappointed due to errors"Function should generate text like:I am-->am feeling-->feeling sad-->sad and-->and disappointed-->disppointed due-->due to-->to errorsI have written code to input text into the program. Here's the function I'm trying:The error I'm getting is... As the ngram function returns a generator, I tried using len(list(bigrams)) but it returns 0 value, so I'm getting the same error. I have referred to other questions on stackexchange but I am still not getting round how to resolve this. I am stuck at this error. Any workaround, suggestion?.
Constructing strings by concatenating values separated by a separator is best done by str.join:Note that there'll be no trailing "-->", so add that, if it's necessary. This way you don't even have to think about the length of the iterable you're using. In general in python that is almost always the case. If you want to iterate through an iterable, use for x in iterable:. If you do need the indexes, use enumerate:
bigrams is a generator function and bigrams.next() is what gives you the tuple of your tokens.You can do len() on bigrams.next() but not on the generator function. Following is more sophisticated code to do what you are trying to achieve.
