I have this JSONi want to have the URLS, i tried :and andbut I always have this error:
How about:which doesn't give any errors when I run it.
You don't need read(), just dump it (if you don't have it in string representation) and then load it.The result is a list of dicts:
here is no need to 'loads' or 'dumps'. you are have already proper list-dict data.for 'url's just use
