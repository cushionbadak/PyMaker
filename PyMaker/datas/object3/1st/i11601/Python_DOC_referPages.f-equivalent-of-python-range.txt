I've started learning F#, and one thing I've run into is I don't know any way to express the equivalent of the range function in Python. I know [1..12] is the equivalent of range(1,13). But what I want to be able to do is range(3, 20, 2) (I know Haskell has [3,5..19]). How can I express this?

While the F# sequence expression seq { 3 .. 2 .. 20 } is comparable in functionality if you have ever converted Python to F# you will find that the  Python 2 range method returns a Python list which is mutable.   Python 3 range method returns a Python range type which represents an immutable sequence of numbers.   F# sequence expression returns an IEnumerable<T> which is immutable.The better way to interpret a Python range with regards to F# is to look at how it is often used. As the Python 2 documentation statesIt is most often used in for loops. and the Python 3 documentation statesis commonly used for looping a specific number of times in for loops.and the Python 2 for and the Python 3 forThe closest F# is for in:
