Following Eli's and glehmann's guides; (in Windows)installed LLVM-3.8.0-win32 from hereinstalled libclang-py3 package (version 0.3)added C:\Program Files (x86)\LLVM\bin\libclang.dll to my Path environment variablesWhen I try to execute the code below (taken from the guides I mention above)I get the following error:Also tried,downloaded cfe-3.8.0.src.tar from here and copied the clang.cindex module inside my script's directoryinstalled LLVM-3.8.0-win64 and updated the Path environment variable as well as the clang.cindex.Config.set_library_path statement (after reading this question)copied the libclang.dll from the installation dir to my Python DLLs dirused clang.cindex.Config.set_library_path('C:\Program Files (x86)\LLVM\bin') and clang.cindex.Config.set_library_file('C:\Program Files (x86)\LLVM\bin\libclang.dll') and clang.cindex.Config.set_library_file('C:\Program Files (x86)\LLVM\bin')with no success.
I am afraid the main culprit in your code is the backward slash. You need to change the clang.cindex.Config.set_library_path('C:\Program Files (x86)\LLVM\bin\libclang.dll') to clang.cindex.Config.set_library_file('C:/Program Files (x86)/LLVM/bin/libclang.dll').Alternatively, and I believe it is better programming practice, you could use the os.sep to handle both Windows and Linux path separator cases.Also, there is another issue in your code; namely, you need to change the ref_node = clang.cindex.Cursor_ref(node) to ref_node = node.get_definition() in order to avoid getting an AttributeError since Cursor_ref is no longer an attribute of the clang.cindex module.After fixing the above, running with the parameters simple_demo_src.cpp Person you should be getting no errors and seeing this output:which is exactly what Eli mentions on his page.
