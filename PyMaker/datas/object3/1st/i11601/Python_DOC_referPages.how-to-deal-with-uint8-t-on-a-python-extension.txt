I would like to pass as argument of a function in my C module an array of uint8_t's. I couldn't find a method to directly parse this array, so I'm parsing it to a PyObject_t and then iterating as a PyTuple_t object. This way, I need to cast each element PyObject_t of this tuple to uint8_t. How can I do that, once that there is no PyInt_FromUINT8_t function or anything like it?
You can usually just get away with B using unsigned char. According to Parsing Arguments you should just be able to do:If not directly using arguments (e.g. you are dealing with a PyObject, simply use one of the PyInt_*, PyLong_* or PyNumber_* functions (https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/number.html?highlight=pynumber#c.PyNumber_AsSsize_t).Converting from a uin8_t to a PyObject is simple as well, you can use PyInt_FromLong or PyLong_FromLong
