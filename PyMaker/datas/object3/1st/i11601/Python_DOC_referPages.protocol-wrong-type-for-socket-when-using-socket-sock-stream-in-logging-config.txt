Natural Text
I use SysLogHandler in my logging configuration file.As rsyslog is running on my linux box, I want to use socket.SOCK_STREAM as socktype keyword argument of the SysLogHandler instance. The documentation says indeed:To open a TCP socket (for use with the newer syslog daemons such as  rsyslog), specify a value of socket.SOCK_STREAM.But when I add the handler, like this:I get this error:Though it seems like rsyslog is listening to /dev/log: lsof | grep rsyslog shows:
Looks like it's not possible to use socket.SOCK_STREAM for a unix socket.I think I have read the doc too fast, as:for use with the newer syslog daemons such as rsyslogdoes not mean rsyslog is configured to use TCP sockets (only that it could be).
