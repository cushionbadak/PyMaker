How can I prevent a Python shell/commandline/terminal window from beeing closed, if the user clicks the close button of the Window? I've tried to catch SystemExit exceptions and overriding sys.exit(), no success.I know, I can do this with a GUI toolkit/framework like PyQt, but importing that (and including it in the final binary of my program) would be no option while it's too big.
It is not possible to do this in the general case.The terminal window is (generally speaking) a separate process from Python itself (YMMV with IPython and other such things, but this is true if you're running regular Python inside a regular terminal).  When the terminal window decides to go away, it is not possible (under most reasonable operating systems and window managers) to prevent it from doing so, because it's a totally different program which just happens to be displaying your input and output.You can, however, keep your program running after the terminal closes.  The terminal will still go away, but the program will keep running in the background.  On Unix systems, this is generally done by catching or ignoring the SIGHUP signal using signal.Depending on your operating system and choice of terminal emulator, it may or may not be possible to configure the terminal to not close.  Some terminal emulators under Linux will, by default, warn the user that there is a process running under the terminal when the user tries to close it.  This is highly platform-dependent and can't be configured (portably or perhaps at all) from within Python.
