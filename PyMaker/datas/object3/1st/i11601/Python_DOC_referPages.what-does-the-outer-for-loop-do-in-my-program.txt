Can somebody please tell me what is the functionality of the outer for loop in the program below:
The for loop will step backward (-1) starting at 6 (len(Mylist)-1) and stopping at 1, the last value before stop (0). See range documentation range(start, stop, step) 
in the for i in range(len(Mylist)-1,0,-1): line, there are three arguments to the range function. len(Mylist)-1 tells us the upper value for our range. the 0 tells us the lower value for our range. the -1 is the size of the increments, meaning that instead of increasing by 1 each time we enter the loop, we are going to subtract one. So we will start at the second to the last value in the loop. The len(Mylist)-1. We will subtract 1, The -1 part, each time we go through the for loop until we end up at 0And for reference the documentation states.range(stop) range(start, stop[, step])This is a versatile function to  create lists containing arithmetic progressions. It is most often used  in for loops. The arguments must be plain integers. If the step  argument is omitted, it defaults to 1. If the start argument is  omitted, it defaults to 0. The full form returns a list of plain  integers [start, start + step, start + 2 * step, ...]. If step is  positive, the last element is the largest start + i * step less than  stop; if step is negative, the last element is the smallest start + i > * step greater than stop. step must not be zero (or else ValueError is raised).
