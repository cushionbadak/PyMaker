How would I go about printing only 10 items per row on python. For example, with this line of code: I am getting the result to print horizontally, not vertically with "end=' ', but I need to get it to print up to 10 characters per line, to get a result that will look something like this: Any help would be greatly appreciated!
You could chunk the items:The chunk function splits an iterable into groups of a given size (in this case 10). The pitems = (...) line filters for the items you want the index of. We then take the filtered items, split them into groups of 10 using chunk and print each group.
You can break it up into 10-item sublists and then print those.
Just use %
This is actually documented in the Python zip docs. In your case, since you want the trailing bits, you'll want to use itertools.zip_longest:
You can have a counter set at 10 to start with and decrease it by 1 every time you print.  When you have printed 10 your counter would be zero.  At that time print a new line and reset the counter to 10.
