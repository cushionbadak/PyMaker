Natural Text
I have a 512x512 map in a text file (which contains only '@', 'T', 'W' and '.'  characters) and I want to display it with Python, in the shell or another window. The map is a WC3 map I downloaded from here.I'm testing and implementing search algorithms (A* right now), and testing on some big maps. The thing is, I want to be able to see the map after every try of my implementation, to check whether the program is working properly or not.Printing it as I would do it normally with any .txt file doesn't work for me because I don't get to see the entire map in the shell.I need some way to print it zoomed out (a lot). I tried with Zelle's graphics.py but couldn't do it.And well, a less optimal solution could be achieved without Python. Maybe there's a program or a way to open a .txt file and zoom out a lot (Notepad can't), but in this way I would need to close the file, run my program, open the file, etc, again and again. [TEMPORARY SOLUTION]As Rad Lexus suggested, I created a map.html document and it's working relatively fine better than any text editor I've tried for my purposes. Still can't see the whole map at minimum zoom with Chrome. I'll be doing this in the meantime, but would be nice to print the file in a smaller window anyway.  [PREFERRED SOLUTION]I'll use PIL, even though it will not print the original map, but an semi-equivalent colored one, changing each of my four characters into a RGB triplet.
use the Python Imaging Library:https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Python_Imaging_Library/Editing_Pixels
Try the open command along with readline
