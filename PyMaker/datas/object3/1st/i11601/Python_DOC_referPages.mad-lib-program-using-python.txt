Natural Text
Automate the Boring Stuff with Python has a project in chapter 8:Create a Mad Libs program that reads in text files and lets the user add their own text anywhere the word ADJECTIVE, NOUN, ADVERB, or VERB appears in the text file.It needs to create the new text file and print the results to the screen.My solution causes a blank new file to be created and shows nothing in terminal. I am using Python 3.5.1 on OS X.
Take a look at this code:Some things that will help you understand this exmaple:documentation for input()documentation for replace()documentation for find()Also try adding print(line) under your for loop to understand your program better. As others have said, debugging skills are one of the most important things you'll learn as you develop your programming.
