I am trying to install flake8 package using pip3 and it seems that it refuses to install because is already installed in one local location. How can I force it to install globally (system level)?Please note that I would prefer a generic solution (that should work on Debian, OS X maybe even Windows), one that should be used on any platform so I don't want to specify the destination myself.For some weird reason it behaves like I already specified --user which in my case I didn't.The only way I was able to install a package globally was to first remove it and install it again after this. Somehow it seems that pip (8.1.1) refuses to install a package globally if it exists locally.Disclaimer: No virtual environments were used or harmed during the experiments.
Why don't you try sudo with the H flag? This should do the trick.
Maybe --force-reinstall would work, otherwise --ignore-installed should do the trick.
Are you using virtualenv? If yes, deactivate the virtualenv. If you are not using, it is already installed widely (system level). Try to upgrade package.
