I need to bind command button-click to a function in python. I have already bound the flag function to right click, but this only work when right-clicking with a mouse. As I write the majority of my code on a laptop, this is horribly inconvenient. Here is what I currently have:I'd like to use self.bind if possible, and simply bind command click to self.flag. Is it possible to do this?    
You can just use:This can be done in addition to <Button-2> and you may want to also bind <Control-Button-1> for compatibility.I would normally link to http://infohost.nmt.edu/tcc/help/pubs/tkinter/event-modifiers.html but it seems to be down at the moment, basically there are a few modifiers that can be used in combination with Button or Key:So you could for example bind <Control-Shift-Double-Button-1> if your program needed to be that elaborate.
