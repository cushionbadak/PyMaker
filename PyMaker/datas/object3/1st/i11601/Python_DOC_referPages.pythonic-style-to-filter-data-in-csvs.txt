I have a folder of 1000's of csv files on specific datasets. For each dataset, I have three types of data. The naming convention is as follows:(assuming name of dataset is 'aaa')'aaa_values.csv''aaa_info.csv''aaaps.csv'Each dataset has a title of varying length e.g., 'aaa', 'ab3fz', 'gjt89', etc. Note the third type of data has no underscore separating the type - it is 'ps.csv'I would like to filter this to obtain the universe of datasets. I have managed to do this with the following Python code, but it is clunky and not very 'Pythonic'.Does anyone have suggestions for a more elegant way of doing this?
The first step to a more pythonic code is using more descriptive names than x, y, i, j, c, and p. This looks a bit better:Now:
Use a set to remove duplicates, and use find() to check for and locate the '_' in the filename:
Regular expressions and set comprehensions are very Pythonic, so to extend on Mike Muller's example:Regex explanation copied from https://regex101.com/r/sR5cQ8:
Here is another way of doing it using pandas:Consider your input folder contains files like this:CODEFollowing will be the output produced
