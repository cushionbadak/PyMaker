You are missing the parsing stepargs = argparse.Namespace() just creates an new empty Namespace object.argparse is the module.  parser is the ArgumentParser object.  Namespace is a class defined in that module.  parse_args creates a Namespace, fills it with values that that it parses from sys.argv, and returns it as args.Defining the parser by itself does not do any parsing.The very first example in the docs is:Some claim this is too advanced for beginners, but the key pieces are there.argparse.Namespace isn't mentioned until section https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html#the-namespace-object
