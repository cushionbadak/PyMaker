Tried to open the same image. im1 opens with no problem, but im2 shows IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '*F1*.tiff'. Also tried and neither works.
PIL.Image.open has no glob matching. The documentation advisesYou can use either a string (representing the filename) or a file object as the file argumentNotably not including glob matching.Python uses the glob module to do glob matching.
