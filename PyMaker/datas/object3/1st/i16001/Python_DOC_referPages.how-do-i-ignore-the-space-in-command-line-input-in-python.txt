Natural Text
So i need to append to a file in python. This is a random command line inputExample 1:How do i make it so it "This is a sentence" would be appended to file1 not just "This"Example 2:How do i make it so it "A sentence" would be appended to file2 not just "A"This is what i have so far. And any random sentence could be appended to the files
Pass the second command line arguments as a single argument in the shell:Alternatively, join the arguments after the filename using str.join:But the alternative solution will not preserve exact count of spaces / tabs.
