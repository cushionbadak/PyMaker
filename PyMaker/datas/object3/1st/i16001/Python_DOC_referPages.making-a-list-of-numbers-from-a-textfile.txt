Natural Text
I'm trying to make a program which bubblesorts a list of numbers from a text file. The file has one integer per line. I tried opening the file like so:but if I do this, the line breaks \n are included in the list and my bubblesort orders the number by the first digit only (i.e. 6 is after 19).  Here's an example of what happens when I run my program.  I first print out the unsorted list, then print the sorted list.
You need to convert the elements of data into ints, as files are read in as strings. Before you do the conversion, it's probably also wise to remove the \n characters, which you can do with str.strip.Using a list comprehension:I added the with context manager. It's usually good practice to use it when opening files, as it ensures that the file is afterwards. Also note that readlines isn't actually needed - iterating over a file provides each line as a string by default.Actually, strip isn't even needed, as int automatically seems to strip whitespace. I might keep it just in case though.
You want a list of integers:Of course, it'd be even better to do it one integer at a time instead of reading the whole file and then converting it to integers:
I'd recommend stripping the newline character and int converting.  You can do this in one succinct line with a list comprehension, but a for loop would also suffice if the list comprehension syntax is confusing.
if you expect that not all rows can be converted to integers, write helper generator:and then use:
