I am working through Learn Python the Hard Way and am browsing through some code on Git Hub before moving on. I am just curious what the .N does on the line with "tm.N = 1000" and how it relates to the end of the code.
N is a global in the testing.py module, that is used all around the module to test arrays and other things. Its default value is 30. E.g.In the code you're posting it have poor usage, because makeTimeDataFrame can be feed with a nper parameter that end up being substituted by N if nper is not provided. This is the correct usage, that would not confuse you:
The previous line, import pandas.util.testing as tm, imports the module pandas.util.testing and, for convenience, gives it the name tm.  Thus, tm afterwards refers to this module, and so tm.N refers to the object named "N" (whatever that is) in the module.
Source: https://github.com/pydata/pandas/blob/master/pandas/util/testing.pyN is a variable in the pandas.util.testing library (imported as tm). It's used in a few of the functions defined in that library, including the makeTimeSeries function called in the getTimeSeriesData which is in turn called in the makeTimeDataFrame function that you call with df = tm.makeTimeDataFrame()
You can get information about pandas.util.testing.N from the docstring and the type() function:
In pandas in the module pandas.util.testing the N property means TimeSeries See this reference in the section:
It makes a timeseries of length 1000. 
.N provides the number of elements in array type. For example, if you use a colormap,plt.get_cmap('Pastel1').N will return 9 because it consists of 9 colors whereas plt.get_cmap('nipy_spectral').N will return 256
