How to check to which module a function belongs?Like,Would return math and so on, if at all. 
Functions have a __module__ attribute:You can use the inspect.getmodule() function to get the actual module object for a given object:inspect.getmodule() works for more than just functions and classes; it'll go through some length to find a module for a given object, based on the metadata on that object.
