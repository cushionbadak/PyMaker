Can someone explain what this regular expression means? I am looking at someone else's python code, and I just find myself curious as to what the expression is doing. I am also not certain what the 2nd % sign means.
So it does this:First it generates all of the permutations of the input (unique orders):For each of these, it converts each item to a string and joins them with .*Then it joins all of those with |and finally uses '(%s)' % result to wrap the result in brackets:The pattern '1.*2.*3' matches all sequences like 111111222333333.The patern A|B|C|D matches one of A, B, C or D.So the resulting regex matches any permutation, with each item repeated any number of times (including 0).The outer brackets make this a capturing group.
Just try it with a test string. Let's try 'abc'So it creates a regex search string, with each character of the permeated passed in string delimited by '.*' and each of the permutations delimeted by '|'.If any of the steps within that line of code confuse you, look at the documentation for each componentitertools.permutationsstr.joinregex formatting
