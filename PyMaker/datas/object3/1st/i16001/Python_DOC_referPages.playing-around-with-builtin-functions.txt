So I was playing around with dir() function. I ran a simple dir(builtins) function which gave me a list of defined names. What was unexpected is when I ran this just to fool around:This gave a me a entirely different list of names. Can someone explain what is going on? :) thanks!
dir returns names of attributes of the given object.'\nbuiltins' is a string literal. So you get attribute names of the string object.
