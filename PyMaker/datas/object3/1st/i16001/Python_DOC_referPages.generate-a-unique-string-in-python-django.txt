What I want is to generate a string(key) of size 5 for my users on my website. More like a BBM PIN.The key will contain numbers and uppercase English letters:AU1B7Y56AXM0K7AHow can I also be at rest about the uniqueness of the strings even if I generate them in millions?In the most pythonic way possible, how can I do this?
My favourite is If you using django you can set the unique constrain on this field in order to make sure it is unique. https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/models/fields/#django.db.models.Field.unique 
Am not sure about any short cryptic ways, but it can be implemented using a simple straight forward function assuming that you save all the generated strings in a set:
this will generate some short code, but they can be duplicated. so check if they are unique in your database before saving.or using django unique constrain, and handle exceptions. 
From 3.6 You can use secrets module to generate nice random strings.https://docs.python.org/3/library/secrets.html#module-secrets
