Often I use string.strip in conjunction with map to strip white-spaces in a list of string. string is a deprecated module. Pylint and Google Style Guide advise not to use it. What is the best way to string strip a list of string? 
split is a method of strings now. map is easily replaced with list or generator comprehensions.
strip is also a method of the str and unicode builtin types. So, rather than digging string.strip out of a module, just pass the unbound method to map: map(str.strip, s)
