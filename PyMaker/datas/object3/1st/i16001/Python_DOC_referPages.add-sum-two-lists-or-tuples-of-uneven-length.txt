In Python, is there a good way to add/sum (or otherwise combine) two lists of uneven length?e.g. given some lists:produce list c:where each element is the sum of a and b, taking a missing element as zero?
Yes, you can use itertools.zip_longest():
Here's what I landed up using:where n or 0 is used to coalesce None to zero, and map(None, a, b) is used as a null-expanding version of zip.Problems? Better answers?
