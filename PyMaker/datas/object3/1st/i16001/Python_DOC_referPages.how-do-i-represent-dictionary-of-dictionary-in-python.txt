I need a data structure to store the following data (I am using a dictionary to represent it): How do I represent such data in Python? Currently I have this data in lists:representing the value for each key. For example, the first list in A contains value for Item1 with respective Item2, Item3, Item4 (which again need to be a key(nested)). Same way the second list representing the value for Item2 with respect to Item3, Item4, Item5.I am new to Python, so I'm not sure where I'm going wrong.
What you're showing there is a set of 1-item dictionaries - which can't exist in Python, because the elements of sets must be hashable, and dictionaries aren't. However, a dictionary of dictionaries is perfectly straightforward to create:Notice that the individual items in the outer dictionary aren't enclosed in braces.
