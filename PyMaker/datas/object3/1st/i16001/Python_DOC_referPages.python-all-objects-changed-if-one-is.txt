I'm having a peculiar problem with values inside an object being set to whatever I set that variable to in later new instances. Let me try to explain first with an example of the kind of results I'm getting given doc.python.org's example on how to use class objects.for me gives an output ofWith the help of some debug lines, I've found that this phenomenon occurs when coming out of for loop. So here is my actual code and it's results:At # Check point 1 I have a debug print test that writes the contents of tempTray's 2 values, and the contain the correct information at this point, but if I check the same thing again at # Check point 2, now they become set to whatever is in the last tray loaded by the xml file (and I've tried looking at all 4 trays, not just self.AllTrays[0], they all have the same values) I've also ruled out that my xml file is saved with changes current.Any solutions or workarounds? I've come across this before but without consistency (a card game where the card data loaded from a file correctly but each player was being set to the name "Player 2" and their score values both went up and down if I changed either one of their scores)
It'd be good to see the actual code for your Dog class's definition. Chances are you have made Name a class variable as opposed to an instance variable (the Python documentation actually uses a Dog class to show the difference).The Python documentation actually has a great short and sweet explanation of Class and Instance Variables; so, I suggest you read it and ask more questions if need be.
