I have Visual Studio 2012 installed and am trying to build my C Python module which has a setup.py. I am the author of the module, found here: https://github.com/patrickkidd/pyrtmidi. Is this possible with Python 3.4? I've been out of the Python world for several years.Thanks!
You need to compile extensions with the same version of MSVC that CPython itself is using. Which version of VS you're using is irrelevant if you can make it work with the corresponding version of toolchain.Building C and C++ Extensions on Windows docs chapter has step-by-step instructions regarding the specifics.
Thank you Ivan for the tips.Here is a pretty good run-through of this question: Compiling Python modules on Windows x64This should be the correct compiler for Python-3.4.1 which uses VS 2010 toolchain (note SDK version 7.1 in the "Details" tab): http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8279
