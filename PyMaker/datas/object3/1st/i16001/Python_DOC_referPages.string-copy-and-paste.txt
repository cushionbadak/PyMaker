Natural Text
I have a string like this 1:sometext:othertext and I have to copy the part after the second colon and paste it at the end of it, 1:sometext:othertext othertext can someone help me?
Try like this  
You can use string built in split function to do this.

This will produce output as required'1:sometext:othertext'  -->  othertext'1:sometext:othertext:abc:jkl'  -->  othertext abc jkl
