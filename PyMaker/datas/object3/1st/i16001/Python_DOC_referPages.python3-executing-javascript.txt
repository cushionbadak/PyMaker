I need to execute a Javascript function from Python 3 (pass a few variables into it's environment and collect the result). I found pyv8 and python-spidermonkey, but neither supports Python 3.Is there a library for that job?
What you can always do:Install Node.Js binaries on the server-sideWrite a script as standalone .js filePass input as command-line arguments, pipes (stdin) or filesExecute the script using subprocessCollect the result from a named pipe or file output.js scripts can be executed in similar fashion as .sh and .py scripts.
