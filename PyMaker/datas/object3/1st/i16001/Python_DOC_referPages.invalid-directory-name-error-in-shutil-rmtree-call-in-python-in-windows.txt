My objective: In the current working directory, if a folder called temp exists then delete it and create a new one, else simply create the folder temp.Then copy a user entered filename from the current working directory to the newly created temp folder.Problem: I'm getting WindowsError at line 8(shutil.rmtree(temp_path)) stating The directory name is invalid
You can avoid a lot of potential issues by using os.path.join() to create your paths.  What the function does is automatically insert the OS's path delimiter between the args.  Since the delimeter is \ on Windows, you can make your life much easier by using it instead of manual string concatenation.  
Problem with backslash escaping. Try doing and the same for temp_xml_path before passing it to copyfile.
temp_path is with only one \, but it is better to use os.path.join
