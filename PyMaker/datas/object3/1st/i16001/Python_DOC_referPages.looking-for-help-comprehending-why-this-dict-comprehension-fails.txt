I'm looking for some help comprehending why this won't work. It seems like python won't create keys in an existing dict in a dictionary comprehension, but that sounds like a bad joke.. more likely, I'm just missing something.So here I am. Stuck with this:Which would work (as opposed to firing a KeyError: 0, if it were written like:In fact, so well would the previous snippet work, that it makes the first one work. Amazing!So I thought I'd get smart and do something (in a fresh session) like:Expecting it to work, because perhaps it just wouldn't work with an existing dict (which is kinda what I'm going for here)?Alas, no dice.Now, I should mention that I know that if I do this:I can get that dict to happen, but I would like to add the keys into an existing dict, you know? .. Actually, do you know? Can you help me comprehend this?Thanks
