I am not able to understand what the re.sub() function does in Python. I have read the documentation and other StackOverflow posts, but none of them clearly explains the re.sub() function. Can someone help me understand? For example:I know that this function removes non-letter characters from a word. For example But why does this function use '' after the r tag?And why is the + symbol not used within the square brackets after the r tag?
r: a raw string.'': the replacement+: one or more of the preceeding[\W_]+: one or more of \W or _See https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.sub where all this is explained.
