Natural Text
I'm having a little trouble writing data to text files with python. Basically, what I want to do is read information in a text file, update the read text, and write the updated information back to the same text file. Reading and updating the text is easy enough, however, I run into difficulties when I try to write the updated text back to the text file.The text file is very basic and consists of three lines. Here it is:I used the code below to try and update it but got this error: 'file' object has no attribute 'writeline'Here is the code that I used:
Although there is a readline there is no analog writeline.You can either use a write and append a '\n' to terminate a lineOr put all the variables in a list and use writelines.NoteI am using the with open statementSo you don't have to manage the open and close yourself
