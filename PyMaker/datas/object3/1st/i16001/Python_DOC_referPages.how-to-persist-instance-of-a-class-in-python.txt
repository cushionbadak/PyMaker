Is there a way to persist instances of a class in memory or file system in Python? Can I do this with shelve?The following line is part of this tutorial which takes a long time to execute, and I need to cache it for next program executions. Type of clf:
Yes, you can use shelve to persist instances of a class. shelve gives you a dictionary interface, making the process relatively transparent.Underneath, shelve uses the pickle library; if the shelve API doesn't fit your needs, you can go straight to that module.scikit-learn explicitly support pickle, see Model persistence:After training a scikit-learn model, it is desirable to have a way to persist the model for future use without having to retrain. The following section gives you an example of how to persist a model with pickle.
