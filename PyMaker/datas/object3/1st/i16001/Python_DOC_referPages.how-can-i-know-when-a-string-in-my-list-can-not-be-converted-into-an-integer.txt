Such that if there is a string that can not be converted into an integer it would produce an error messageExample: 
You know when something can't be converted to an integer because it will throw a ValueError.Notice that with this code block, only your '1' and '2' are converted to integers. 'a' is obviously a character. '4/2' is a string made up of numbers. It is not evaluated as a mathematical expression. Doing something like this would take much more complicated logic.The try/except logic is simple - Convert the item to an integer. If fails by throwing a ValueException, this can't become an integer. Finally, a couple of the other answers have try/except blocks. However, they are not catching specific exception types. This is bad practice. Catch specific exceptions. 

There's a function of string called "isdigit"
If all you need is an error message when parsing the list, you could try:This isn't really the best approach and probably not the most secure if you are worried about that but might help do what you want.
