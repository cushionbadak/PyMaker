Recently we found a couple of bugs in our code based because a developer forgot to add a comma in the middle of a list of strings and python just concatenated the strings. look below:The intended list was:["abc", "def"]Developer wrote:["abc" "def"]and we got: ["abcdef"]now I am concerned over similar mistakes in other part of the code, is this functionality a core part of python? is it possible to disable it?
Yes, this is a core part of python:Multiple adjacent string literals (delimited by whitespace), possibly  using different quoting conventions, are allowed, and their meaning is  the same as their concatenation. Thus, "hello" 'world' is equivalent  to "helloworld".I don't think there is a way to disable it, short of hacking Python itself.However, you could use the script below to tokenize your code and warn you when it finds multiple adjacent strings:yields
