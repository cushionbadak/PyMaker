What I have to do in this function is to create a local table and wrap the function with a lookup into the table and store of the result if it needs to be computed. This should work with any function as long as it is only called with hashable arguments. Make sure you support any number of positional and keyword arguments. (we cant use global table)This will be used like:Can someone show me some hints>?
Implementing those two functions is left as an exercise for the reader. Note that the second one will have to be a local function within memoize, unless you give it some other way to access local_table.Also note that some of the literal translation of your question is unnecessary.
