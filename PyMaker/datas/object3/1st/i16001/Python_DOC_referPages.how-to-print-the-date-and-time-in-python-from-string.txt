Should be quick, but I can't for the life of me figure this one out.I'm given the following strings:201408110000201408120001201408130002Which I loaded as a date(?) time object via the following:Where datestring is the string.From there, how do I output the following:11-Aug-1412-Aug-1413-Aug-14I tried str(dt) but all it gave me was this weird thing:time.struct_time(tm_year=2014, tm_mon=8, tm_mday=11, tm_hour=12,  tm_min=1, tm_sec=5, tm_wday=0, tm_yday=223, tm_isdst=-1)What am I doing wrong? Anything I add so far to dt gives me attribute does not exist or something.
Using strftime
When you use time module it return a time struct type. Using datetime returns a datetime type.

If you're doing a lot of parsing of variety of input time formats, consider also installing and using the dateutil package.  The parser module will eat a variety of time formats without specification, such as this concise "one-liner":This uses parser to eat the datestring into a datetime, which is then reformatted using datetime.strftime(), not to be confused with time.strftime(), used in a different answer.See more at https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-dateutil or the python-dateutil tag.
