Natural Text
So I have a problem set for class where I am given a csv file of text abbreviations for words and I'm asked to prompt the user for multiple abbreviations and its supposed to return the full text if the abbreviation is found, if not then it will return the original abbreviation.I'm currently stuck on getting the user input list into the dictionary properly. 
might do what you are asking for
The csv library has a DictReader object you can use to automate the process. https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.DictReader
Try adding the values of the keys in dictionary to a list if they are present
You can call print CreateDictionary(i) to get what you are designing for.
