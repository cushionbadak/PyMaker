I have a simple windows executable that asks for user input and I'm trying to make a python script to automate the input. What I've done:Now, normally when the program runs, it outputs to the command prompt "give me input:" then expects input from the user.If I use Popen with the stdin=PIPE option, nothing is written to the command prompt at all - it just sits there blank.Then, when I use communicate, "Test Input" ends up on the python console, and not to the process.Is it possible to automate something like this? Or am I missing something fundamental here..
You can give input to communicate function.like 
"Test Input" ends up on the python consoleYou see the output because input(prompt) function prints it. If you want to pass Test Input literally to the subprocess then drop input() call:It is not guaranteed that myprgm.exe accepts utf-8 input on Windows (it might accept input encoded using Windows console OEM encoding such as cp437 or Windows ANSI encoding such as cp1252 instead) and therefore bytes(unicode_string, 'utf-8') input may be wrong. It should be ok to pass a bytestring with bytes in ascii range (created using b'' bytes literal)).
