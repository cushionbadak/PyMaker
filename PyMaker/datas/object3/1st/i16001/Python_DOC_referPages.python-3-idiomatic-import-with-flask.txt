Flask suggests the following file layout: runflaskapp.py contains: flaskapp/init.py contains: Running this with 'python3 runflaskapp.py' works fine. However it seems to me that a more Python3onic way of doing this would be to rename 'runflaskapp.py' as 'flaskapp/main.py' and then run the whole thing as 'python3 -m flaskapp'. Unfortunately this doesn't work: Does anyone know why and how to fix it? 
The -m flag does this:Search sys.path for the named module and execute its contents as the __main__ module… When a package name is supplied instead of a normal module, the interpreter will execute <pkg>.__main__ as the main module.In other words, flaskapp is not imported as flaskapp, but as __main__, just like a script would be, and then its __main__ module gets executed.This means from flaskapp import app will not work, because there is nothing named flaskapp.But the relative import from . import app will. So, as long as there are no absolute imports anywhere in flaskapp except in your new __main__.py file, that one-liner should do it.
