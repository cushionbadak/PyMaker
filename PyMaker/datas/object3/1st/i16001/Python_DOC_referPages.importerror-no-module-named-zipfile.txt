I am running python on windows in sublime text. When i wanted to work with the zipfile module I get this error ImportError: No module named 'ZipFile'. I tried changing the name to zipfile from Zipfile with no success. I looked at my pythonpath variable it does show the location of the lib folder where zipfile.py is located. I am unsure of what is going wrong. Any help or clue with what is going on is appreciated.Even running in python ide gives me the same error
The name of the module is zipfile. Also you need to use io.BytesIO. (There's no StringIO module in Python 3.x; I guesses you use Python 3 .x because of urllib.request)
