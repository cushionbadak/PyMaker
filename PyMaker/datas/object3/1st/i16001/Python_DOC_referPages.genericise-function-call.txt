I am using a Python schedule library and setting up schedules for various days of the week.I would like to replace the above two calls with one:where blah can be monday,tuesday,wednesday,etc.
I'd think any decent scheduling library would have a nice way to do this dynamically, maybe something like:But if it doesn't, you can always dynamically access an attribute with getattr:This is generally a bad ideaâ€¦ but if you have to work around someone else's library that doesn't make it easy to do it in a better way, that's a perfect example of why "generally" doesn't mean "always".Either way, you can then, e.g., loop over the days you want:It is, of course, critical to chant 'monday tuesday wednesday thursday' in the voice of the Robotic Ghost of Christmas Past from the Future while typing this. Thousands of years ago, before the dawn of Python as we knew it, there was Guido.
