I have a dictionary of keys that have different integer values, e.g. I want to be able to return a list of keys whose combined values equal a certain number, e.g.I'm not sure how to approach the problem, or whether I should be thinking about it iteratively or recursively.  I'm at a bit of a loss on this one.At the moment I am working in Python 2.7, but wouldn't mind seeing solutions in Python 3 as well.To be honest, even suggestions would be appreciated at this stage.
As long as the number of items isn't too large, you can brute-force this:You can use it to iterate over all matches:or add a break after the print() line to make your program stop at the first match.
