First I am meant to construct a list including the prime number 2. Then I am supposed to loop through the numbers 3 to about 10000, check whether each number is divisible by each element in the list, for all elements equal to or less than the square root of n. If not, then add that number to the list.So far I have:I am unsure how to get the looping through primes to stop when an element <= sqrt(n) is reached. Can anyone help? Thank you.
use takewhile from itertools:
To exit a loop you can use the break keyword eg:Would give you:I hope this answers your question.
Is that what you're looking for?
