Say I have the following folder structure:I want to seperate the views and urls to make the code easier to handle. Up until this point I have just been bundling the views into one file and urls into another, both in the "mysite" folder, but I feel this is the wrong thing to do. I started by trying to point the url "/contact" to the urls.py file in the contact folder, then that url would point to the view (called "contact") in the /contact/views.py file./mysite/urls.py/contact/urls.py/contact/views.pyThis is giving me the errorImportError at /contact  No module named contact
Your include should be pointing at a urls.py file, not a view.Plus, you must not terminate the regex (with a $) in your main urlconf, otherwise there won't be anything to match against.
You will need an __init__.py file in each of those subfolders in order for the import to work. It doesn't need anything in it; it just needs to be present.Package documentation
Pointing /contact to the urls.py file in the contact folder was working fine after @Daniel Roseman's help. I then ended up matching "/contact/contact" because the second urls.py file only needed to match its root:/mysite/urls.py/contact/urls.py
