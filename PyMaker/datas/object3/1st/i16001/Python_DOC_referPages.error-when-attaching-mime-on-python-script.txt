The purpose of this script is to listen on serial port and send an email with a ip camera picture which is retrieved when its triggered.  Here is what I have so far with error.`     import time     import serial     from email.MIMEMultipart import MIMEMultipart     from email.MIMEText import MIMEText     from email.MIMEImage import MIMEImage     import smtplib     import datetime     import urllibERROR:===Traceback (most recent call last):  File "motion3.py", line 58, in <module>    send_email()  File "motion3.py", line 32, in send_email    msg = MIMEMultipart() + header + '\n' + TEXT + ' \n\n'TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'instance' and 'str'
In future, please make sure that the code you post is indented properly!You're not using the MIMEMultipart class properly. Please see the email: Examples in the Python docs; the 3rd example shows the proper usage of MIMEMultipart.The error message is saying that you are trying to add together a new class instance MIMEMultipart() and a string header, and you can't do that!There may be logic errors in your code, but I haven't looked very closely at it - it's just too painful trying to read badly-indented Python. :(
