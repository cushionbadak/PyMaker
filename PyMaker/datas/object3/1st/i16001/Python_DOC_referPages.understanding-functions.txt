So I've been practicing with functions but it just occurred to me now: When you type in float(3.14), you are simply calling the float function that has already been defined by the almighty built in Python. It works similarly to user defined functions like this one:I mean float is also a data type so its probably not exactly the same, but is my logic sound?
float is a type. At the same time, it is callable like a function:In python, types, classes, objects with __call__ methods beside functions, methods are callable.
You are correct that you're calling a float() function, yes.On a different note:The power function that you've defined probably doesn't behave like you want it to.  You're shadowing your x parameter in the function with your x variable in the for loop.No matter what you input, you're getting the same result because your x is instantly overwritten.
