I have a Enum.I'm trying to call it in another script.It's a No Go... Here's my error:I don't understand what else I must add.School me on the understanding.Edit:I think im on to the understanding....
Note, Enum's can be instantiated, but you actually instantiate an Enum object to create a single instance of an Enum Member. In order to do so, you need to pass the index of the member within the Enum.Refer Programmatic access to enumeration members and their attributesMoreover, it is odd, the way you are trying to use the Enum. Enumerators, are there, to enumerate a set of unique names bound to a constant value.Based on your usage, I apprehend, you actually never intended to instantiate AuthMixin, but rather want an alias for the enum, and as a particular example and use case for your exampe would be somewhat like this
I think the enum class has a "_ init _(param)" function with param.
