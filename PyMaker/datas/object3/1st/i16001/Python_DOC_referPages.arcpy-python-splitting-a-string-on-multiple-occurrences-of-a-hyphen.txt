Natural Text
I've got a text field in an attribute table that looks like this:I've created a new text field where I want to calculate the above strings and remove the first "-" and everything to the left. My new field should look like this:I thought the below code would calculate everything to the right of the first "-", but I'm only getting the string right after the first hyphen.My results are:How do I either strip the all characters before and including the first "-" or calculate all fields after the first "-"Thanks in advance!
The split function takes a second argument, that is the number of splits to perform. Pass in a value of 1, then you'll get a list back where [0] is the first item and [1] is everything else to the right.
