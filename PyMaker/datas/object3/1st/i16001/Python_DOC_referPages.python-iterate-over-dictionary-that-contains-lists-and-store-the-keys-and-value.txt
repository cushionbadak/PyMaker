This is what I'm starting with but it can't handle the list.I'm trying to yield this string. 
Iterating a dictionary yields keys only. If you want key, value pairs to be yielded, use items() method (iteritems in Python 2.x).Use urllib.parse.urlencode (urllib.urlencode in Python 2.x):You can use manual string opeator, but it require extra care for special characters that should be %xx-encoded.
you need to use items() to access the key and value in dictionary :
