Natural Text
I saw it from Python Cookbook:It says it's some kind of clever recursive algorithm.
It's a conditional expression:A is yielded if PREDICATE is true, otherwise B is yielded.
sum(tail) is part of the expression as well.The structure of this expression is:and it equivalent to:
In other words it can be written as:
It could be rewritten as following:1(head) + sum(tail) - as the new items1 + 10(head) + sum(tail)1 + 10 + 7(head) + sum(tail)1 + 10 + 7 + 4(head) + sum(tail)1 + 10 + 7 + 4 + 5(head) + sum(tail)1 + 10 + 7 + 4 + 5 + 9(head) - there are no tails anymore
