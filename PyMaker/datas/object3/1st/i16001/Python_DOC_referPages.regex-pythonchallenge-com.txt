Natural Text
I need to filter a text like UUUlUUU (i mean Uppercase letter*3 + lowercase letter + Uppercase letter*3). How can i implement that regex?I know that python alows this:i tried like this:for finding a single character. (i can add as many \w as i need)The Question is: is there a way to make a Case Sensitive regex for getting that i what?p.s. I rather articles for reading instead the single solution. 
The pattern you want isNote that you can use {} to specify repetition.ExampleAs far as "articles for reading", the documentation is always a good start.
(https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html) has all you need then. Hint: [A-Z]{3} would match exactly 3 uppercase letters
