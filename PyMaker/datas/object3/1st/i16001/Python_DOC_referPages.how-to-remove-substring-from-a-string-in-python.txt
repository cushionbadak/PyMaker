How can I remove the all lowercase letters before and after "Johnson" in these strings? Expected results are as below:
You can partition the string, check it had the separator, than translate out lowercase letters, eg:
str.partition() is your friend here:Example use:
There are a couple of ways you could tackle this.  Here's the simplest one I could think of.  The idea is to tackle it in three parts.  First off, you need to know the middle string.  In your case 'Johnson.'  Then you can remove the lowercase letters from the part before and the part after.
Not exactly very simple or streamlined, but you could do this sort of thing (based partially on Zero Piraeus') (edited to reflect errors)
Other methods using the partition module don't seem to take into account your trigger word being repeated.  This example will work in the case you have 'aBcJohnsonDeFJohnsonHiJkL' in the event that, that particular case is of concern to you.
