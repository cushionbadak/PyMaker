For example, this line apparently causes this error to occur, but as far as I am aware of it is possible for double assignment in Python 3.I haven't the foggiest clue as to what is causing the error.
input returns a string. Unpacking will work only if the string has 2 characters:Otherwise, it will raise an ValueError:But that is not what you want. Use str.split to split the string.  Splitting by ,:Splitting by whitespace:
In Python 3, input always returns a string.  Trying to assign a string to a list of variables will cause Python to match each element (i.e., character) of the string to a variable, and if the number of variables and the number of characters don't match, you'll get an error just like the one you're seeing.  You need to parse the string returned by input in order to convert it to a list of two numbers and then assign those numbers to first, second.
