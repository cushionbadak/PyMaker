I need to define a function to go through a string and replace all replacement fields, without knowing how many there will be. I do know that the replacement fields will be named a specific way. For example, If i know that all fields will be named 'name' & 'position':I need one function that would process both of these the same way, with output like:I feel like this should be simple, but my mind can't seem to get past the multiples and the unknown quantity.
Then: or you can just use .format(), which is recommended
str.format()    I got too in my head about this.
