This question already has an answer here:Chaining multiple greater than/less than operators                    6 answers                Python comparison operators chaining/grouping left to right?                    1 answer                zero is greater than or equal to zero evaluates to false                    1 answer                In C programming, the following code block return FalseBut in Python, the following block return True.Edit: Found a solution from link, it explain very well in python perspective. And in C programming perspective this answer explain my question very well.
They behave differently because that's how the languages are implemented.With C, a > b > c is evaluated left to right. There is no concept of "operator chaining" (I'll get to this shortly), so the expression is evaluated as (a > b) > c which is 1 > c which is false (in C, logical expressions either return 1 or 0).In python, OTOH, a > b > c evaluates to a > b and b > c (as specified in the documentation on comparisons), which turns out to be True in this case.
