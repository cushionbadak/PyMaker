I am calling several python libraries in Matlab and am now having trouble using the latest version of pandas (ver 0.23.x) https://pandas.pydata.org/ . Conversely, pandas 0.22.x works fine.Note that the problem doesn't exist in python.To reproduce:Has anyone experienced this?I noticed that pandas has moved the CategoricalAccessor (which 'cat' refers to) from pandas.core.series.CategoricalAccessor to pandas.core.arrays.categorical.CategoricalAccessor. Maybe this is related?Any help on this would be appreciated.
I can reproduce this on R2018b with python 3.6.6 and pandas 0.23.4, on Win10 x64.What you suggest is very likely related, since pandas' cat likely interferes with MATLAB's cat which is used for concatenation.I would advise you to create a new virtual environment, with the correct version of pandas, and have MATLAB use that (via the pyversion command). After all, this is exactly what virtual environments are for. See also this documentation article.
