This is a XML file in which I would like to get the boundary box coordinate using python. You can see that there is a BBox attribute which contains (x1,y1,x2,y2) in hexical string.I parse the boundary box information using python but the problem is how can I convert this 16 digit hexa value to human readable integer value which we are familiar to see as an object boundary coordinate value.I used int('hex str', 16) but it gives a big integer value which is obviously not like as a coordinate value of 800x1200 size image. In this case, the BBox first value was '4074145c00000005' and I got after convert  4644359501095370757. Please give me a solution how to convert this boundary box coordinate into human understandable integer value.
Finally I got the solution to convert this 16 digit hexical string to human understandable decimal/integer value. This value representation use IEEE 784 standard conversion which explained in enter link description here. This 16 digit hexa value used to represent float point conversion for more accurate coordinate position.The function struct.unpack(format, buffer) use to convert which has two parameter. First parameter is for format !d which d means  Double in C or float in python and ! sign use to indicate Byte Order.There are 5 Byte Orders @, =, <, >, ! use to represent which format I need to convert.
