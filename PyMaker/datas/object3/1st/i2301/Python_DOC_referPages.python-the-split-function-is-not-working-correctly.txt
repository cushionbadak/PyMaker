Lets say you have a file which looks like-so onNow when I do readlines the cursor pointing to the file object will be on the first line..and If I do file.readlines.split(' ') will return a list of words in the first line...readline.split('\n') will return the first line itself.Since each line is already split in newlines it will return the same line

the readlines() function returns a list, so you don't need to split it into lines again.if you needed to split it further you could have done something like
