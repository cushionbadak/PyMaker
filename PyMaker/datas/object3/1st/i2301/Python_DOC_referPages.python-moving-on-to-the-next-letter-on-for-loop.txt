How can I move on to the next letter in a for loop before 1st iteration finishes?
Currently, you're trying to add 1 to the string s, which will throw a TypeError. Even if s was an int, incrementing it in this fashion would not move to the next iteration of the loop in Python (or any language I know).You can use the keyword continue to move to the next iteration of a loop immediately.

If so increment counter_bob.An example refactor of your code with this in mind:Which prints:
