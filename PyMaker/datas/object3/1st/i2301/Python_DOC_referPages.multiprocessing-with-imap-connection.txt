I want to do a Python Script who get all emails in a BoxMail using IMAPClient and Multiprocessing, and I would like to know what is the best way to do that.Because I don't really know what to uses, and how to think it.If someone has an idea, let me know !
Follow these steps -1) Try imapclient example in this documentation - https://imapclient.readthedocs.io/en/2.1.0/2) In order to parallelize fetching message, you need to partition your e-mails so that each thread fetches different e-mail. One of the criteria could be date field.3) Write a method using example code in documentation and parameterize search criteria (server.search).4) Call above method in the multiprocessing code. Example for multiprocessing can be found at - https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html5) You can also check "SEARCH commands" section in the RFC http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc3501.html to select your partitioning criteria if date is not suitable.
