Natural Text
Today I have started to learn Python. The first things I learned were values, expressions and (arithmetic) operators. So far, everything makes sense, except one thing that I don not get:Whileevaluates to 4 (which makes sense),results in a SyntaxError (which also makes sense). But what – from my point of view – does not make sense is the following line of code:This results in 4 as well, and I wonder why. If I can compare this to JavaScript (which I use on a day-to-day basis), this results in an error in JavaScript.So, two questions:Why does this not result in a syntax error?How does this expression get evaluated? What happens to the additional + signs?
Python has an unary + operator - +2 will evaluate to 2. So, that expression is actually evaluated as:Which, of course, is 4.
