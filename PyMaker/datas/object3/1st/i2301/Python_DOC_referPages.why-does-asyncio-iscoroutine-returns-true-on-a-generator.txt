Natural Text
Please consider the following function:The asyncio.iscoroutine() method will return True for the method test(). Another thing to notice is that inspect.iscoroutine() will return False. Any reason why asyncio thinks it's a coroutine ? In any case, it seems that one of them got it wrong. 
This looks like a docs error in the new Python 3.7 asyncio docs. At the time of the question and this answer, the new docs saidReturn True if obj is a coroutine object.This method is different from inspect.iscoroutine() because it returns  True for generator-based coroutines decorated with @coroutine.while the old docs saidReturn True if obj is a coroutine object, which may be based on a  generator or an async def coroutine.The old docs are correct; asyncio.iscoroutine considers any generator object to be a coroutine, not just ones created by @coroutine-decorated generator functions.Following the questioner's issue report, the docs have been updated to remove "decorated with @coroutine" from the asyncio.iscoroutine docs. I would post an archive.org link showing the old text, but archive.org doesn't have that version archived. You can still see the old text in the github revision history or in the commit I just linked, though.
