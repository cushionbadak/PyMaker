Not sure if that's achievable. I want to fire an HTTP POST request from a script, but not wait for a response. Instead I want to return immediately.I tries something along these lines:The script returns immediately without errors, but the HTTP request never arrives at the destination. Can I fire the POST request, but not wait for response from the server, just terminate the moment the request is sent?
I have answered a rather similar question.ensure_future schedules coro execution, but does not wait for its completion and run_until_complete does not wait for the completion of all futures.This should fix it:
Using asyncio you can write a simple decorator as @background. Now you can write whatever inside foo() and the control-flow will not wait for its completion.  Produces
