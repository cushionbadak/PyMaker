I have been trying to figure out for a while how to check if there are .pkl files in a given directory. I checked the website and I could find ways to find if there are files in the directory and list them, but I just want to check if they are there. In my directory are a total of 7 .pkl files, as soon as I create one, the others are created so to check if the seven of them exist, it will be enough to check if one exists. Therefore, I would like to check if there is any .pkl file.This is working if I do:os.path.exists('folder1/folder2/filename.pkl')But I had to write one of my file names. I would like to do so without searching for a specific file. I also tried os.path.exists('folder1/folder2/*.pkl'), but it is not working neither as I don't have any file named *.pkl.
You can use the python module glob (https://docs.python.org/3/library/glob.html)Specifically, glob.glob('folder1/folder2/*.pkl') will return a list of all .pkl files in folder2.
You can use :Note : This can be used if you want to search entire directory with sub directories alsoIn case you want to search only one directory , you can run the "for" on os.listdir(path)
