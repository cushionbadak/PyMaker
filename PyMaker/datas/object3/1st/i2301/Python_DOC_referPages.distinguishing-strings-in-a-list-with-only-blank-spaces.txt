Natural Text
I am trying to create an if statement that can distinguish between two strings in a list, where the only difference is the amount of blank space before them. For some reason, I can't get any of these to work.This does not distinguish between(8 blank spaces) and(4 blank spaces). Adding a length check like so produces an error:These other two checks also result in an undistinguished result and the same error respectively.The error is:IndexError: list index out of rangeHere is an example of the text file -> list that I am working from: https://pastebin.com/Vr87UXHFThanks,AlfieEdit: Full Project - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hcs1zkAu5xBWJYhZ97UXUcEkPdo-yQ4m/view?usp=sharing
You need Python's re for exact matches of spaces with regex.Output :
One way to easy fix this is to strip spaces on the left of input string:You can also use .strip() or .rstrip(), see https://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html#string.lstrip
