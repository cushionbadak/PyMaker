I'm trying to get the fruit() function to sort using key=sortby() and then print to screen - either within fruit() or within it's own function.It works fine when there is no fruit() function, but I'm having difficulties working out the right syntax to pass par as a parameter to be used in fruit()
There are several issues with your code:You need to return a value from your fruit functionYou need to give the fruit function a different name from the listYou need to actually call the fruit function at some pointAvoid using str as a variable name, as this is a built-in function in Python.The sortby function works fine, however.
