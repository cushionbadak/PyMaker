I'm new to Python, sorry for the level of this question.This is my output (prices from a website). I'm wondering how to convert them into a list of ints479 000355 000269 000499 000289 000The desired result will like this [479 000,355 000,... ]. Also, I want to be able to perform basic with the values.I found this thread How to convert a for loop output into a list (python), but it didn't help me.
~/python/stack$ python3.7 sum.py  [479000, 350000]Change your last line to append to lista instead of print. Now we have lista = ['479 000', ...] but we want ints to perform operations on.So we can then enumerate our list, from there we can split() and join() to get to here lista = ['479000', ...] then we can just use int(item) and put them back into lista as ints For fun we could do some map and just go from:
It looks like your string is meant to be a series of 6-digit numbers but both the individual number-parts, for lack of a better term, are split by spaces and the numbers themselves are split by newlines. The solution, therefore, is to remove the space in between number-parts, converting the result to an integer, like this:Putting this in a list-comprehension, we have:UPDATESince you've posted your code, I can give you a better answer.
