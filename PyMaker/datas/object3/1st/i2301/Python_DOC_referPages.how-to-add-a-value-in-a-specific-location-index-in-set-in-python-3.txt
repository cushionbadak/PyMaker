Sets are unordered collections. What you want is impossible. Consider these alternatives:list, ordered but permits duplicates.dict.keys in Python 3.6+, where dictionaries are insertion ordered.OrderedDict.keys in Python versions prior to 3.6.Create a custom class, e.g. this recipe.Use a 3rd party library, e.g. ordered-set.See also: Does Python have an ordered set?
