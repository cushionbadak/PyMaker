Natural Text
New to Python here and was doing a sample exercise to list the contents of a directory and found something I cannot explain with my current level of knowledge.Looking at step 1,3 and 2,4 we see the results are identical however the results are not the same between 1,2 and 3,4.5 and 6 are identical but don't expand into the child folder, and I believe that is just an issue with the glob text.But then 7 throws and error and 8 gives the correct results !How can we explain the above results ?Platform: Windows 10Python Version: 3.6.5The code is shown belowFollowing is the MainMenu class
1 vs 2If we expand that second one, we getThis is not a valid path, so it fails. Use the slash operator to join paths instead of manipulating string directly.7.You're searching from "/". This means that it's using an absolute path instead of a relative path. As the error message says, this is not supported.("/" is the root directory on Linux systems.)
