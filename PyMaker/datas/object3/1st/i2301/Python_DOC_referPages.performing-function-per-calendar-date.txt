I'm currently working on a nutrition planner which will allow users to plan meals per calendar day. As a demo, I've loaded in data from a JSON file including the meal name and calories, allowed users to pick which meal they'd like, etc. I want them to be able to do this for each day and organise it in a calendar. Here is my code for the meal planner, which works how I'd like it to:How could I allow the user to choose a date and then for this function be performed?This way, for example, a lunchName and dinnerName can be assigned to each day.
