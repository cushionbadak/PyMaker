My program keep showing me error that z and d are missing in the object section,,i donno how to correct it i keep trying but more n more errors keeps showing up. 
Don't forget to pass in z and d in the constructor, eg:Also, in the display function, you try to set self.x to self.z and self.y to self.d. self.z and self.d don't exist (self means it should be a class attribute, which it isn't), you should instead use the function's input parameters:
First fix this, you are updating with display using two new variables that its taking in, so we just cast those variables not self.z / self.dCreate your instance with values that it needs __ini__(self, z, d)  needs a z and d value If p1.display is updating the values to 5,6 then why update them again with setX/setY pretty much you are making z=5, d=6 then z=9 d=4And then you just repeat these small errors for p2
