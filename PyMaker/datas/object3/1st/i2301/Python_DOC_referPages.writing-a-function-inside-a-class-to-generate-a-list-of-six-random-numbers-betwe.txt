I want to generate a list of random numbers where the range and the length of the list can be varied later without modifying the function.So i thought of creating a function and the code i tried using python 3x is as follows:I know i have made a mistake somewhere and dont know what it is. Please help me out to sort this. 
You are essentially re-building (a worse version of) random.choices(...) with your function. Better use choices:It does not make much sense to put it into a class - no instance-members are used - you could define it as classmethod if you really need a "renamed" random.choices()Output:Doku: random.choices(population, weights=None, *, cum_weights=None, k=1)See: What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod?
you just add " return all_t " as last statement of your All_traffic function definition.It would work .
