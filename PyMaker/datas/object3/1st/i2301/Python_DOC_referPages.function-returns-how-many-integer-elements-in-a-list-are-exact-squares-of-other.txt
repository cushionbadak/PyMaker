This question already has an answer here:What does x in range(â€¦) == y mean in Python 3? [duplicate]                    1 answer                Task: Write a Python function that returns how many integer elements in a list are exact squares of other elements in the same list. Assume that the list does not contain negative numbers and that there are no duplicates.This function takes in a list and returns the count. For example, if x is [3,4,0,2,1,9,25] then sum returns 4 because 3*3=9 , 0*0=0 , 1*1=1 , 2*2=4.Here is my code:When I run count(x) the output is 0 not 4, I think the logic is correct.
The operator is is a comparison operator, thus when you do i*i in x is True, Python interprets it as i*i in x and x is True. In that case x is True is always false.Note that you do not explicitly need to compare the value to True, since in returns a boolean.Although, thes above is O(n2) due to list lookup. You could use a set for constant time lookup and use the fact that True == 1 and False == 0 to use sum and get an efficient O(n) algorithm.
int(True) returns 1 and int(False) returns 0 so why not just use one-line of sum:Demo:Output:Or faster:Demo:Output:Summary about why your code doesn't work:The issue with your code is that you don't need is True at the end of the code otherwise that could also be a solution
When you do:it actually chains the conditional operators so that it is equivalent to:which is not what you're looking for.You can instead use parentheses to explicitly do:and your code would work.But then you don't really need to compare a Boolean expression to a Boolean value. You can simply instead do:
Peoblem fixed ! Thanks all for your feedback !!!!!!!
You can just do a list comprehension instead of using a creating a function
