Had to change the indenting to show it as codeWhen it runs, I hit enter to start the game and it adds and subtracts correctly but when I select continue, it plays as if I never lost or gained any money. It is 1AM and idk if my brain died but I can't think of anything to fix it
You reinitialize the variable cash with 20 before every game. To fix the game, just move that code out of the loop.The initialization of  win and loss can also be moved out of the loop since they do not change. Same for the from random import randint statement, it is considered a good practice to put all import statements at the top of the file.
I would reorder your code to make the control-flow more clear.For comparison "if a in several elemets" you should use set()s - they are very efficient when looking up if something is in them (and for other set-operations).For printing look up the str.format() or python 3.6+ string interpolation: PEP-498You only ever use the sum of 2 random numbers, you can get them in one go using random.choices(iterable, k=2)Output:Beside print formatting the outputs use a ternary (do x if this else y) operator.
