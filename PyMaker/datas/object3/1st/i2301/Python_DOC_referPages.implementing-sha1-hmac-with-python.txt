I am implementing SHA1-HMAC generation for python (v 3.7) to be able to create HMAC code.I have used an online generator to create SHA1-HMAC with the following data:string: '123' Secret Key: 'secret'Digest algorithm: SHA1I am getting this result:However when I try to do this same with Python I am getting different results which are wrong.This code gives result:What could be wrong with this code?
You should not use Base64 here. The site you link to gives you the hex values of the digest bytes. Use the HMAC.hexdigest() method to get the same value in hex in Python:put differently, your code outputs the correct value, but as Base64-encoded data:and the value you generated online contains the exact same bytes as the hex digest, so we can generate the same base64 output for that:
