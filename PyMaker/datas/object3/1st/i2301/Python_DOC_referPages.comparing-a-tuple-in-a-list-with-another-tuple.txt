I have a list of tuples. I want to pick each and every tuple in the list and compare it with another tuple which is defined by me. The code that i used is as follows;but it says that list indices must be an integer or slice. If i want to take each tuple in the list and compare them against another, how should i code it?please help me!
You don't need for loop IF you have only one tuple to check . Just directly check using ifIf you have many tuples to checkThe problem in your code was that when you do list1[item], you are trying to do list1[(3, 4)] which is not the correct way to index a list and hence you get the IndexError
try this:
you could just test if the tuple ((4, 5) in the example below) is in the list:there is no need for an explicit loop.if you have multiple tuples to check against, i suggest you use sets:this checks if both tuples appear at least once in your original list.
you can achieve it the following way..
