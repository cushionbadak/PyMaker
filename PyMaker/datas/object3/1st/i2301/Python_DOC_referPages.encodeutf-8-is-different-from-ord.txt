I tested the following unicode:encode snowmanHowever, when I checked it with ord()It's different with b'\xe2\x98\x83'How could I understand it?
ord returns a Unicode codepoint ---a somewhat arbitrary number that identifies the given character.encodereturns a sequence of bytes that represents the given string in some encoding...if the string can be represented in that encoding.The encoding and the codepoint are only related in the sense that they both identify the same character.An excellent introduction to the difference between bytes and characters is Ned Batchelder's"Pragmatic Unicode, or, How Do I Stop the Pain?"(36 minute video from PyCon US 2012).He covers both Python 2 and 3, and the drastically different approaches they take to solving this problem.
