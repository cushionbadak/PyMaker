Is it possible to delete all folders inside a folder without using a specific path?, Here i am moving the contents of the file then after that i want to delete if it is a dir
Yes it is, Use shutil's rmtree method.You can also use os.rmdir but that won't work if there is any content in it.If you want to check if that specific path is a directory then you can use os.path.isdir then run rmtree if that returns TRUEAnd incase you want to keep the root folder intact then you could walk that directory and calling rmtree on each item.
As suggested by @Vineeth Sai earlier, If you want to delete all sub directories in a directory, just loop through each file with os.listdir() and if the file is a directory, apply shutil.rmtree():The above also uses os.isdir() to check if a file is a directory. 
If Vineeth's answer is not suitable for your case, you could you subprocess module to run os specific commands like belowThe above command is linux specific, you could use windows counterpart of the same command above.Note - Here shell=True will expand * into files/folders.  Also, note Vineeth's answer is os independent, and above will be os specific. Be cautious.   P.S. - You can also run powershell commands using subprocess module.
