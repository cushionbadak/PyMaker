I am working to slice an HTML address to get the unique part and use it as my filename.Here is the challenge:http://www.someurl.com/folder-1/somestring/01.pdf http://www.someurl.com/folders1531as12/anotherstring/183.pdf http://www.someurl.com/folder-dsa990s/nostring/46798.pdf I am trying to set the filename as:Since there is no way of knowing how many characters after the last slash and between the last two slashes, I am not able to hard-define splits such as [-5:-10].To be able to solve this challenge, my pseudo-code to get the filename is as follows:Find the index of the last string [int_last_slash_index]Find the index of the one previous string [int_prev_slash_index]Step 1: count no of slashes in stringStep 2: subtract one from the count (count_slash-1)Step 3: find the (count_slash-1)th index position  Set slicing positions:Position 1: last slash position = len(url) - int_last_slash_indexPosition_2: previous slash position = len(url) - int_prev_slash_index  Slice the URL string with [-int_prev_slash_position:-int_last_slash_position]  In Python:If there is such a way, I want to solve it with string operators, rather than diving into regexes, code tricks because I cannot handle them now. I am OK to learn further methods, libraries though.As you would guess, I am new in Python and just trying to get a hold of strings. Thank you.PS: Just the opposite was posted before but for Java, no responses: 1
Use split:
You could use split using '/' as the separator, from the documentation:Return a list of the words in the string, using sep as the delimiter  string.Code:OutputOnce the url is splitted you can get the last two elements of the list and combine them using the format function.
try this:this would also work in case of more complicated urlsex: http://www.someurl.com/folder-1/somestring/01.pdf?x=1
After days of scratching my bald head, I am illuminated with rsplit method.Instead of all the algorithm above, this did everything:Apologies for taking everybody's time and efforts. And thanks very much for the comments.
