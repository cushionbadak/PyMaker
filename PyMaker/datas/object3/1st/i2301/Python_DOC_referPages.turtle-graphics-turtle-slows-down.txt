I set the turtle to fastest and when I ran the first loop alone it was fine but as I added more it became comparably to when it was just executing first loop alone. I don't know if this is just because of the complexity of the drawing but it takes a decently long amount of time to complete the shape. Is there anthing I can do to fix this?
My analysis is that your filling, i.e. turtle.begin_fill() and turtle.end_fill(), is slowing down the code 3X to no real effect.  One of these images is with fill, one is without:If you can't appreciate the difference (even at full size) then the fill is probably just a waste of time.  If you just want the final image, and don't care about watching it being drawn, then for more performance, I suggest something like:
