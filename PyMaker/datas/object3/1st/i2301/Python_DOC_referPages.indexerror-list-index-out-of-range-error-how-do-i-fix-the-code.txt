I am getting error at :window_width = int( sys.argv[5] )IndexError: list index out of rangeWhen I am trying to run the code using spyder the coding is showing an error list out of range error, should I change the dimensions which are specified or use any other function? It's one of the codes that I am using for protein secondary structure prediction, this is in particular is used to create the database . The IndexError is one of the more basic and common exceptions found in Python, as it is raised whenever attempting to access an index that is outside the bounds of a list, is it because I am trying to access something outside the bound of the list. How do I fix the above?
sys.argv is defined as a list in Python, which contains the command-line arguments passed to the script when you are going to execute any program.You can check the passed argument while executing the list simply by printing length of sys.argv at start of the program.Include below line at start of program:as from command line if I am executing below program in command line asthen length of the sys.argv will be 1 and value of sys.argv[0] will be demo.py.After checking this can modify the sys.argv index value as per your need.Hope this will solve your problem.P.S. in your program this line is written wrong:correct it as
