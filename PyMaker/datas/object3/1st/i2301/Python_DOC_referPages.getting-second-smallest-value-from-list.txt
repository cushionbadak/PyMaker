what I 'm trying to do here is first find the smallest number from the list. And remove that smallest value and find again the smallest number from the list. But the remove function doesn't work
This finds second smallest of each sublists in the list:You just needed to sort sublist in ascending order and select second value out. There is no need of removing value from list.
To find the min values of each sub-list, you can do:
Personally, I'd use the builtin sorted function:And without the built-ins, replace the sorted() call with:
Use min(iterable) and a list comprehension to get the overall minimal value. Then use min on the same list comp with a twist: only allow values in the second list comp that are bigger then your minimal min-value:Output:
You can convert the given data-structure, to a single list and then sort the list.  The first two elements give you the answer you want.  Here's what you can do:
Expanded loops:
