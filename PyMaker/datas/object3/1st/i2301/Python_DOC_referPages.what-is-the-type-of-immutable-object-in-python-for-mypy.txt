I always use mypy in my Python programs.What is the type (from typing) for immutable objects, the ones that could be used for a dictionary key?To put back into context, I want to write a class inherited from dictionary and I have the following codeType hints in that case are pretty useless, isn't it?Thanks
The keys of a dict are hashable (see the first sentence of the docs on dict), and the hashable type is typing.Hashable, an alias for collections.abc.Hashable.
typing.Hashable refers to any type that can serve as a valid key in a dict or value in a set. It doesn't require true immutability (any object can define __hash__), but in general, hashable things should be things that are "treated as immutable", since it will break things should they be mutated after insertion into a set or after being inserted as a dict key.
