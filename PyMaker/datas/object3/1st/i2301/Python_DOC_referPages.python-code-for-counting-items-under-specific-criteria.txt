I have the following data:Please help with Python 3 code to count all the items under each of the Switches (Switch1, 2, 3).  I do have the list of the Switches in a separate file if that makes it easier.
Assuming that your file content is stored in variable s, you can use re.split with a dict comprehension over an iterator to obtain the counts in a dict indexed by switch names:With your sample input, this outputs:
Iterate over the file. Each line will either be a new switch or something to count:Alternatively, you could use collections.defaultdict instead of get to ensure that the dictionary is populated properly for each new key:
I would reach each line, and every time I come across a line that includes the string "Switch", I count the following line and all subsequent lines until I reach another line that includes "Switch", to which then you reset your item counter and repeat.
