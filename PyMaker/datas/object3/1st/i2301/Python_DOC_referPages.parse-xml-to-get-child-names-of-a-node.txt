Im new to Python/XML. I want to parse an XML for getting data under a parent node.My XML has a set of "Entity" nodes with different names. Under each "Entity", there is set of "Properties" as shown below. I need to get all Properties of a particular Entity. For instance, if its the Entity "Quit", I need to get the corresponding "Property" names separated with commas as a string; like, {QuitId, QuitReason, Status, QuitTime} using a Python script. I need only the "Name" attribute of Properties.I could get the Property "Name"s of all Entities with below script. but, Im not sure how can I get only the Properties for a particular Entity; like "Quit"
I could get the names a s required. Thanks for your pointers.
