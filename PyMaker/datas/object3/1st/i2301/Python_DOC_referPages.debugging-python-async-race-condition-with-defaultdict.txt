...out_dict[k] still contains elements that have been processed. - It isn't clear what the intent is from your example so a solution won't be possible. On the surface it looks like a logic problem.  Leaving the async aside:The code  always makes a k:v item in in_dict firstSo if k in in_dict and in_dict[k] will always be True and the elif suite will never be executed. Next callThe if statement
