I am creating a new nested directory (data_dir = 'parent\child') in python:If the parent directory 'parent' did not exists (yet, 'cause I might be setting later in the code), then the code caught that as a Windows Error 3 and moved on.However now what could also happen is Windows Error 206 which is when the filename or extension is too long. For which I would need to take a separate action.Is there a way to distinguish between Windows Error 3 and 206 (and others) so as to raise distinct Exceptions?
You could use WindowsError.winerror (inherited from OSError: [Python 3]: winerror) to differentiate between underlying errors. Something like:Of course, WindowsError 3
