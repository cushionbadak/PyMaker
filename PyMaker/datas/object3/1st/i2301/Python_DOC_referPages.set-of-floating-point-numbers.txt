So I want to create a set of floating point numbers where two numbers are considered equal given a certain tolerance. For example, if I have a setif I add the element 1.00001 with a tolerance of 1e-4, the resulting set should be and not 
We can use a round function to check tolerance of 1e-4
It seems to me you should just be able to check each item already in the set and, if the absolute difference between that item and the one you're trying to add is smaller than the threshold, just don't add it.Something like this should do the trick:Because the first addition is too close to 1 and the second is not, this will result in the following output:
import math and use ceilor if you want an intger like "threshold" just use
