Here's my cube root calculator:It returns following error on entering -1 as input:It prints expected answers for all negative integers expect -1 and I am unable to find reason for this behavior. It should print -1 as output and I don't see any reason for defining guesswhen it's being "defined" by range()function.Do you see what I am missing?
When you put -1 into the function, the for loop never runs. abs(-1+1) is 0, so it never runs, therefore guess is never initialized. You may have ment to do abs(-1) +1
If cube == -1, then abs(cube + 1) == 0, and range(abs(cube + 1)) is empty. So, no iteration happens (because there's nothing to iterate over), and the name guess is never created.Also, range is not a function, it's a class.
You have to indent properly. guess is only defined in the scope of the for loop, it is the index of the for loop.I indented those lines below and ran the script, I don't get the error that you got, but I also get 8 is not a perfect cube. when running the program and I get no output if I input -1 (or any negative number).My best guess as to what you're trying to do is below. There are probably more elegant ways to write the program, and I know break statements are frowned upon for making the logic hard to follow.
