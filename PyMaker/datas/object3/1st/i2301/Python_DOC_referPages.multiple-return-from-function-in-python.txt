I want to assign var1 to v1, and var2 to v2. Is it ok for me to unpacked tuple var1,var2 into list v1,v2. So far, I haven't found anyone unpack the multiple return value into list
Semantically, there is no difference between unpacking into a list or a tuple. All of these are equivalent:(See also the assignment statement grammar.)However, unpacking into a list is a relatively unknown feature, so it might be confusing for people who read your code. It's also needlessly verbose. That's why I would strongly recommend using the well-known unpacking syntax without any parentheses or brackets:
Not extremely familiar with python, but I don't think you can return multiple values like that. I would return a dictionary (lookup object) like so:See if this helps you.
