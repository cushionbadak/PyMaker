I am trying to order a user input, set of cards (Not deck) from lowest to highest A-K. I am not very experienced with python, and don't know much of the terminology and functions. I am trying to keep the code simple and basic.Here is what I have:How do I change 1,11,12,13 back to A,K,Q,J before printing?
use dict Creating the new list based on the input if it is a digit (like 1,2) then we do not need to refer to the dict else if it is like('A','K'etc.) we need the mapping from the dict defined above and then sort the new dict formTo convert back to 'A.J,k' Create a new dict with keys as 1 as values as 'A' etcReplace the values. Do an iteration similar to one we did earlier if the value is 1 or 11 then lookup in d_new dict for the corresponding mapping
