It doesn't happen when use executor_threads instead of executor_processes. But anyway I need executor_processes, so it is just a fact.Logs in Windows:Logs in Ubuntu:Question:How to fix/avoid/hack producing multiple windows on Windows system.And why it happens?
When creating an exe for Windows using cx_Freeze and using some form of multi-processing (eg. multiprocessing or concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor you need to bootstrap your exe for multi-processing as the very first thing you do. You do this simply by calling multiprocessing.freeze_support() as the very first thing inside the if __name__ == "__main__": block.
