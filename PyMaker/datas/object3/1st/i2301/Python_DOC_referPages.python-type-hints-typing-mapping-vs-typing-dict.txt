I'm working on a python3 project where we use the typing module type hints throughout.It seems that we use typing.Dict and typing.Mapping pretty much interchangeably.Is there a reason to prefer one over the other?
Managed to answer this myself.typing.Dict should be used to indicate a literal dict type with support for element type hinting i.e. Dict[bytes, str]typing.Mapping is an object which defines the __getitem__,__len__,__iter__ magic methodstyping.MutableMapping is an object which defines same as Mapping but with __setitem__,__delitem__ magic methods as well.typing.Mapping et al. are based on the abc types in this table
