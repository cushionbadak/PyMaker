Take a look:I don't understand how the above code can work. You should always specify the complete path right? Like this: Another question: sqlalchemy is telling me that the path is sqlalchemy.expression.select but how about the "sql" part.Take a look:How come Python ignores the sql part here: sqlalchemy.expression.select and when I try to use his own path it doesn't work.Please advise 
That's because in the sqlalchemy's __init__.py, it imports select from .sql. How does it import from .sql when it is under expression? If you also look at sqlalchemy.sql's __init__.py, it imports from select from .expression already. Therefore, there is no need to provide full path from sqlalchemy.sql.expression when trying to import select. You could just from sqlalchemy import select.As mentioned, because sqlalchemy already imports from select in it's __init__.py, the sql part is ignored.
