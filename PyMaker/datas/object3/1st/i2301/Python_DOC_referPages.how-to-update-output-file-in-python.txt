It appears that your question is from your homework. I will just show some steps of the process and where you might want to go to find more information.You can use Python's with statement to open files. It is possible to use nested with statements or a comma for opening multiple files.With your file open, you need to read each of its lines. This can be done with a for statement. Reading each line of a file return the line with a newline character at the end. You can use rstrip to remove the \n at the end of the string then you can use split and a whitespace to "tokenize" your input. The following code is an example of the result obtained using this combination of functions.You can use the same logic to read and parse the data from the other files. You should open the output file in write mode in order to write your changes. Also, you might want to read about how to convert a string to an int value.
