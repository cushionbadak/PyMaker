I need to sort a list based on the order of the elements in another list which is shorter ie, doesn't have all the elements compared to the list I'm sorting. I run into this error when using the sort(key=short_list):Is there another way to sort the long_list to result in a list that maintains the order of short_list followed by the order of the elements in the long_list?
You can use in to detect if the element is in the short_list and a ternary to return a tuple based on that.:Since Python sorts are stable, the order will only change based on a change of the elements themselves. To make that change, we can use a tuple with either a (index_of_the_element, element) of (len(short_list), element) to effect that change. If you want the elements to not change order if the element is not in short list, just return an empty tuple:
Something like this should work:Sorting is guaranteed to be stable, so using len(short_list) ensures that the unknown values sort last.
I would search in the short list first and in the long list if necessary:Edit: as florian-weimer pointed out, this solution does not always work. Joining the two solutions:
