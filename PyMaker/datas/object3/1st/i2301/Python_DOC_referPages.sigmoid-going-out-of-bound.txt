print(sigmoid([(1,3), (4,30)]))why is this returning [ 0.73105858  0.95257413  0.98201379  1.        ]as the function is bound from 0 to 1for example [q= 1/1+np.exp(-30)][1] returns 1.0000000000000935why is this happening and how to correct it? for example image of a weird looking output
Your sigmoid implementation looks fine.The reason print(1 / 1 + np.exp(-30)) returns 1.0000000000000935 is due to operator precedence.P.S. numpy supports broadcasting. Your function can be simplified into:Use ravel function to flatten the multi-dimensional array, if it's what you want.
oh BODMAS rule.returns 0.9999999999999065which is less than 1It is rounded off to 1 in the console
