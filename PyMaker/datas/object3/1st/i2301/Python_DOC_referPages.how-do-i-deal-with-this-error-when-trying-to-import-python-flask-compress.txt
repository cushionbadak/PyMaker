This question already has an answer here:Python flask.ext.mysql is deprecated?                    2 answers                I want to serve compressed files from my flask application, and I looked around and found this solution. This is what is says on the docs, but when I try and actually implement this I get an error.And consequently I cannot import Compress.Does anyone know how to fix this issue and possibly an alternative way to compress the files on my web app.I have imported the modules into Pycharm correctly as my IDE shows that they have been installed. Its just when I try and do the above in my application that I get this error. Thanks for your time.
Taken from the README of flask-compress.In many cases, one cannot expect a Flask instance to be ready at import time, and a common pattern is to return a Flask instance from within a function only after other configuration details have been taken care of.

I use zipfile to compress files. From the Introduction:The ZIP file format is a common archive and compression standard. This module provides tools to create, read, write, append, and list a ZIP file. Any advanced use of this module will require an understanding of the format, as defined in PKZIP Application Note.and with ZipFile.write(filename) you can write files to a ZipFile object representing the archive.
