I am writing a method to implement a bank account. It's very simple, I want the output to be the name and account type of the user. However, I am having trouble using Enum in my main class.OutputThe owner of this account is Max and his account type is: AccountType.SAVINGSSo this is the desired output, but this only works when I hard-code the account type in the __str__ method (AccountType(1)). To clarify, I mean this line:Is there a way to do this such that if I enter 1 into the BankAccount parameter for accountType , it returnsThe owner of this account is Max and his account type is: AccountType.SAVINGS
This is just a guess because I'm still unsure about exactly what you're asking.Output:This way you don't have to hardcode anything or create the self.d attribute since it's no longer needed.
You can apply the same thing you do to the hard-coded 1 in __str__ to accountType in __init__:Even though you can now get rid of self.d and use self.accountType, I would recommend not using the integer value in the initialization to begin with:This is much clearer than using a magic number. The update to __init__ will accept both the enums and their values.
