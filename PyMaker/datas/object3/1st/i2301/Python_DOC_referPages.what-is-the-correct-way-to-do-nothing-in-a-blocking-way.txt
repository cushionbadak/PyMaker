There are cases where I need, at the end of my program, to do nothing and not exit the program. This is typically the case where I have never-ending threads (which I control or not).There are several solutions I use:Pro: simple one-liner Con: 1000000 seconds is 11 days, one must estimate how long the script will run, and eventually fail in the estimatePro: seems cleanCon: only for cases where I control the threadsPro: I do not know because ...Con: uselessly CPU intensiveIs there a Pythonically correct way to "do nothing in a blocking way"?
A good way would be to wait for an input. This would be simple as well as give control to you as to when you want to continue or exit the program.
Keep it simple:This fixes the problem that sleep() could be interrupted, as well as handling the possibility that the program runs for many weeks.It's portable, obvious, and environmentally friendly!
