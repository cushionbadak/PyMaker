My question is when I for loop a file and using the index find to get the column.  e.g.Now, this prints the output here:The spaces are the cells that are empty. So this column is index[1]. I want just print out 57. I would like to note, I am not using module csv for a good reason. Also, no modules are used other than the os module.The reason I want to do this is I want to get 57 and times it by another number in another CSV file (yes I have 2 files I'm working with).Any other suggestion would be great.Thanks.EDIT:Ok sorry for the misconceptions. I'm new to python and am trying to explain the best I can.So the output above is the scores of 8 students. The blank spaces are those that did not take the course. The definition I am trying to do is normalise these scores by the highest mark in that course. In another csv file the highest score in the course is 95. Therefore what I want to do is loop through all these outputs above and divide it by 95 to get the normalised score. For example (57/95 = 0.6, 0/95 = None) etc..I hope this explains a bit more? If not let me know.
You can try this, it will only read first row in csv file:
Not too sure what you're trying to do, but if you just want to get 57 like you said, you can just do something like:
