I have a question about a part of a bubble sort function that I dont understand. The assignment is to add detailed comments to all the parts of code explaining what it is doing. The lines of code that I'm uncertain about are number 2 and 3 (the ones marked with a '#?' at the end). Can anyone give a good explanation of what these lines are doing? Any help much appreciated. 
Per the range function documentation:len(alist) - 1 is the length of the list (8) minus one (7).  It represents some "starting" number.0 represents the "stopping" number.-1 represents the "step" number. These come together in range(len(alist) - 1, 0, -1) to say "count from 7 to 0, backwards - one negative step at a time".When range() is only passed one argument (a number), it counts from 0 to that number.  The documentation gives this example:So the code counts from 7 down to 0 - and every time it performs a single count, it immediately counts from 0 to that number.
