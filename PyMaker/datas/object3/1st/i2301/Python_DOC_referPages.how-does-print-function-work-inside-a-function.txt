This is an error message.I expected this code will print out 17 13 but an error came out. First print(a) would print 17 because a=13 is not yet executed, and second print(a) would print local a which is 13 because variables are accessed from local to global.what is wrong in my explanation? It seems I have some misunderstanding.. thanks
Since your function defines a as a local variable, it is considered a local variable everywhere in the function.  Your first print statement then references the variable before it's initially assigned.Global variables can be confusing (and reasoning about what functions make changes to what globals is extra complicated) and best practice (in most languages) is to simply not use them.  A better formulation of your sample might be
You have to use global keyword before accessing the variable inside the function. For more reference see this link
