I am looking for some help with creating a code for the following in pythonI have made an attempt at an answer but I am not quite sure how to finish it. Here is what I have so farSo I have defined my function that I am trying to calculate, I believe I did that correctly with I have said what x needs to be withBut how do I add the code to find the smallest value of p which has no correct significant digit at x = 10**-p when using standard double precision?Do I need to somehow use Looking for some help with this execution, thanks!Edit: new codegives the results:
With the loopI get the values for the expression and a theoretically equivalent expressionbut I have no idea how to interpret the task to give a valid answer. Could be p=5 or could be p=8.
