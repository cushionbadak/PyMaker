I am trying to remove an item from a list. Usually pretty obvious but the problem is that those items are objects and I want to remove them by one of their attributes. Is there a more graceful way to do this than what I have below?
You can also use the built-in method filter(function, iterable).filter() applies a function to each element of an iterable - if the function evaluates to True, this element is in the resulting generator. If the function evaluates to False the element is skipped.The result of filter(..) is a generator, so you need to put it into a list (or use the generator result if you just need it once).Demo:Output:    
Here's a super simple way:That is, simply make a new list with the items you want.  You can assign it back to myList if needed.
