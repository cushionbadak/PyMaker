I am studying the python range function according to the formula of the documentation (https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#range), but it does not work for certain ranges, for positive steps if it works for me, but for negative steps no.python doc says:For a negative step, the contents of the range are still determined by the formula:r[i] = start + step*i,but the constraints are:i >= 0 and r[i] > stopso,I'm tryng to use the formula to calculate range (4, -2, -2)So, if you note, doesn't work for the first step, because the condition is False this range should result = 4,2,0What I'm  doing bad?
Let's look at finding the first step for range (4, -2, -2)Range function's documentation: range(start, stop[, step]) -> list of integersSo you have start = 4, stop=-2, and step=-2.In the formula r[i] = start + step*i, i is always counting from 0. So the first element, r[0] = 4 + (-2) * 0 = 4.The constraints hold. i >= 0 because i is 0, and r[i] == 4, which is greater than stop (-2).
