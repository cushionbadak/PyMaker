I have an Authorization header in a string like this:I don't want to tokenize using the space character because I want to require the string "Bearer" to be at the start of the stringWhat is the pythonic way to return just the token from the string?  Is there a regex matching function like PHP preg_match()?  Would this be the pythonic way to do it?
I think the most Pythonic way of doing this would be to use the built-in startswith method of str and string slicing:I personally however would prefer str.partition to tokenize the header into a 3-tuple:
Let say your authorization string is then u can extract token like this
Is the string always in this format?
