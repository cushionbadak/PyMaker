This question already has an answer here:Python split for lists                    5 answers                I have a list similar to the following one:I want to break(split) and store the information of the list based on '\n'. It means I want to create following strings from the above list:I know how to do that using a simple for loop and playing around indices but I wonder if someone could assist me with doing the mentioned task in a more professional way. Because playing around the indices makes my code a bit complex and unreadable.
You can get a list of the desired strings, using itertools.groupby with an appropriate key function to chunk the list and str.join to turn the chunks into strings:Note that groupby returns a lazy iterator producing equally lazy groups. So this does not build any unnecessary intermediate in-memory lists.
You can do something like this! using re
One possible solution would be to concatenate the given list into a string using join() and then use split on the string to split in to list. Following is the code:You will get a list of strings separated by "\n"
You can use split(),but i get an unexpected result so i use regex(?!,) : use to match string began without , -> match but not contain in result([^\n]+) : match str until \n(?=,) : match str which end with , -> match but not contain in result
I propose solution like this:
