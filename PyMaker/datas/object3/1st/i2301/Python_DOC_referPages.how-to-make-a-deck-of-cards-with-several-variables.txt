SO, im gonna make a abnormal deck of cards. Each card will have a color (red, green, blue), a degree(1,2,3), a symbol(triangle, square, circle) and a number.(1,2,3) I have a class that looks like this. I also have these lists with all the variables and a deck of cards where i want the cards. Now, what i wanna do is create a full deck with every possible card. Preferably they would be in a random order but its not nessecary. I know that if it was just a number and color i could easily do it this way.But, i cant figure out how to make it when im also gonna use symbol and degree as well. I tried to just build on more if statements to loop it all but that didnt work. I also doesnt want the same card to appear twice, and i dont want a card that doesnt follow the class rules, they must be strutured as [color,degree,symbol,number]Does anyone have a idea where to go with this?
Do you want all combinations of colors, degrees, symbols and numbers?If so, use nested for loops:Or use itertools.product (Which can also be lazy)
Full deck with every possible card combination:For randomizing the card order in the deck, take a look at this: Shuffling a list of objects
use product from itertools
