First of all here is my directory structure: Inside __init__.py I have the following: Inside hello.py I try to import everything from models folder: This gives me the error: What am I doing wrong? 
You will have to specify what class you would like to import into the attribute __all__ of your __init__.py file. See below the example:
If you want to have the class Car directly accessible in hello.py after you do from models import *, in the __init__.py file, put from models.car import Car.__all__, on the other hand, typically lists names of modules, like what you have above. You could change hello.py to be as follows and your current __init__.py that consists of __all__ = ["car"] will work:
From the python docs:if a packageâ€™s __init__.py code defines a list named __all__, it is taken to be the list of module names that should be imported when from package import * is encountered.This means that your hello.py has just imported the car module into it's namespace, not the Car class. Therefore this would work.
You missed one step there.Try:Or try:
__all__ just controls what will be exported by using * in current scope.In your case, Car is not in your __init__.py's scope. So it is meaningless.To solve this problem, you need to import Car into __init__.py's scope, that's all.I understand that you think just by using __all__, you can directly access the class in car.py, but that's not true. __all__ does nothing else but control exports in current scope.
