(For those who saw this question the last time I asked it, I sincerely apologize, I used the term "module" when I meant "function", but thank you for your very helpful advice nontheless! I'll make sure to keep it in mind when I begin to add other files into the equation.)I'm trying to make a text based adventure game using python, and as a result it requires a lot of variables, and as backtracking is a must, I need to use global variables for the essential ones. I have run into speed bumps when trying to get these to be read by other functions. This is the line of code used to define the universal variables, and their starting valueAnd for example, when I try to display one of the global variables, it shows up as the variable being undefined, as shown here:Can someone help me out with this?Is there an easier way to do this?All help is appreciated!(yes, I make sure to run the reset function before the newgame function)A much simpler version if this, at least according to me is:
You could store those things into a class used as storage-container. If you declare them classvariables and any accessors as @classmethods you do not need an instance. Output:You might want to seperate some things out - f.e. an extra class for the weapon/damage/defense related stuff ...More reading: What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod?https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#class-and-instance-variables
Instead of global variables have you considered storing all the stats in a class/struct? Create an instance of the class at the start of the game, with its default values being specified in the constructor.G = StartClass()Alternatively, declaring G globally and passing it into gamestart(G) and/or re-instantiating in the reset() function might be options.
Here is a simple example of what I think you are trying to accomplish. If you are using global variables, then you need to be sure you are not inadvertently creating local variables with the same names in your functions (when you mean to be modifying the global variable).You should look at using classes which I think would help you with some of the semantic confusion here.
