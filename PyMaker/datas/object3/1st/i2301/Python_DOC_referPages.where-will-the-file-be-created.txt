In which directory will the file be created? And is it possible to see it there or is it invisible?
From this link...The list is:the directory named by the TMPDIR environment variablethe directory named by the TEMP environment variablethe directory named by the TMP environment variablea platform-specific location:on Windows, the directories C:\TEMP, C:\TMP, \TEMP, and \TMP, in that order.on all other platforms, the directories /tmp, /var/tmp, and /usr/tmp, in that order.as a last resort, the current working directory.A sample from mac os :When you go to the directory via finder the file should be there. As for Windows it might be hidden which I believe you can unlock.
You only created a string, nothing more.The tempfile.gettempdir() function returns a string:Return the name of the directory used for temporary filesIt's just a name. Print it if you need to know the location on your system but don't want to step through the rules outlined in the documentation; there are 3 environment variables and another 3 standard locations to test to see where the current user has permission to create files.Next, os.path.join() takes strings and outputs a string. Nothing is created on disk to build these strings. It'll depend on whether or not you actually do something with that string (like calling os.makedirs() or open()) on what will be created.If you use a plain open() call on that string then a regular file is created in the tempfile.gettempdir() location that is visible to other processes.If you need to create a temporary file securely, so in a manner that an attacker can't access the file or influence where it is created, use the tempfile.TemporaryFile() constructor or the tempfile.mkstemp() function; on UNIX systems that'll result in a file that is not listed in the directory any more (the file exists but can't be opened by other processes). It will be created in the tempfile.gettempdir() location however, so it'll use up disk space on the relevant disk partition that that directory lives on.
There is currently no file being created. Check out the tempfile documentation to find more information about functions of the module such as the .gettempdir():Python searches a standard list of directories to find one which the  calling user can create files in. The list is:The directory named by the TMPDIR environment variable.The directory named by the TEMP environment variable.The directory named by the TMP environment variable.A platform-specific location:     On Windows, the directories C:\TEMP, C:\TMP, \TEMP, and \TMP, in that order.     On all other platforms, the directories /tmp, /var/tmp, and /usr/tmp, in that order.As a last resort, the current working directory.
