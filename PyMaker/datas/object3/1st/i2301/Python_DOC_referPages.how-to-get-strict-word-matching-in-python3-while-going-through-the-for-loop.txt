I have Below snippet, where i'm searching for word koint but it prints all the associated words to this like koint , koint_local and koint_limited.Is there a strict way to find strings / words in this type of requirements apart from regex.The above snippet returns below while i'm looking for only koint:Raw data in myID:IN the above data even if koint s missing and koint_limited is there it say Success.Requited: Print Success if it finds koint in line.Just to clarify as i mention at the start of my Post apart from regex:Though regex works:
Regex that matches string with a full-word kointRegular Expression SyntaxIt looks like groups command would fit your needs better.
I have compiled the working codes, so it may be useful to someone looking over SO.Now there are two solutions with and without regex.1) Solution without regex2) Solution based on regex
