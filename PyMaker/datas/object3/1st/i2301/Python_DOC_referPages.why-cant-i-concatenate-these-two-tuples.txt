I am trying to concatenate two tuples using the overloaded + operator in Python 3.6. I don't have an issue if I include the parenthesis like the first example, but if I leave off the parenthesis as in the second example, I get an error. The message I get is "bad operand type for unary +: 'tuple'". Can anyone explain what is happening?newtup = (3,) + (2,4)newtup = 3, + (2,4)
Unary operator + expects valid a operand (int, float etc) on the right side. In your code 3, + (2, 4), you are providing a tuple (2, 4) as an operand to + which is not a valid operand and so is the error.In your code: newtup = (3,) + (2, 4)These are 2 separate tuples (3,) and (2,4), so it works.newtup = 3, + (2, 4)Here its a single tuple with 2 elements 3 and +(2, 4) which fails due to above mentioned reason.
It's a precedence issue. 3, + (2, 4) is parsed as a tuple with elements 3 and +(2, 4), not as adding 3, and (2, 4). You need the parentheses.
It's trying to parse the second line as(3, + (2,4))Then, it's seeing that you used the unary +, as in a = +5, with a tuple. This isn't allowed, and thus you get an error. Commas are given very wide precedence (ie they consume as many characters as possible, closer to a + than a *). The reason behind this is that (biglongexpression1, biglongexpression2) should never mix the two biglongexpressions. Everything else is more important and should be evaluated before a comma, and thus +(2,4) is evaluated before the comma - because it's a biglongexpression.
As you're doing:It basically simplifies to two parts 3, and +(2,4), the second is invalid so you can try new-unpacking in python 3:If on python2 just use second example.
Simple; On the first line you are creating a new tuple made of 2 tuples. On the second line you are adding an int to  a tuple. Check this out.
