I have just imported some columns into two lists in python. I am trying to add both lists together into a dictionary and have unique objects with totaled values. For example, 'Apple' and 'Apple' will return 'Apple': 14.0' since both are combined together. How do I produce the desired output? Do I have to add anything to my for loop?Output: Desired output:
You can use collections.defaultdict() to have your values automatically added when the same key is encountered, something like:This will, however, produce a result with floats, i.e.:If you need string results, you can either post-process the result:Or you can handle the whole thing without collections.defaultdict():
just use the default dict
