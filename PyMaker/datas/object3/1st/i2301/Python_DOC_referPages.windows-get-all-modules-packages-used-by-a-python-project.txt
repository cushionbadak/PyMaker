I have an application and now I would like to know what packages/modules are necessary if someone else wants to install it. How can I get all the python modules/packages that are needed for a specific project? Important Note: This question was already answered for Linux. They suggested pipreqs, which seems like a great solution, however it does not to support Windows.My Python version is 3.6.4. I am working on windows 10.
Have you verified that pipreqs does not work? I use Windows 10 (build 17134.285), Python 3.7.0, and pipreqs 0.4.9; and I have successfully generated requirements files using pipreqs. 
Could you use: pip freeze This would output all the installed packages for your given project: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_freeze/
