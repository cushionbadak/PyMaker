My data set starts at xmin = 0 (s) and ends at xmax = 300 (s).Below is the moving average calculated with counting the minimum peaks.But I actually want a window that counts the minimum peaks for x(0-60) and then x(60-120), x(120-180), x(180-240) and x(240-300). So it will be the heart rate per minute. I tried something like:Im new to Python and I would be very happy to learn how to do this :) Thank you
