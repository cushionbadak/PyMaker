I've recently started to program in python and I'm having some trouble understanding how inet_nota and inet_aton work in Python. Coming from php/mysql I've always stored ip addresses in the database as long variables. Also the inet_ntoa method in mysql receives a long variable as parameter and returns the dotted format of an IP, so I assumed the Python version works in a similar manner. However, it seems Python's inet_ntoa needs a 32-bit packed binary format. So, having the IP address stored as 167772160 value, how can I convert it to a 32-bit packed binary value (like \x7f\x00\x00\x01) which is needed by inet_ntoa method? Thanks a lot
In Python 3.3+ (or with this backport for 2.6 and 2.7), you can simply use ipaddress:Alternatively, you can manually pack the valueYou might also be interested in inet_pton.

As a late addition to this thread: if you're using Python 3.3 or above, look at the ipaddress module: it's much more functional than the socket equivalents.
