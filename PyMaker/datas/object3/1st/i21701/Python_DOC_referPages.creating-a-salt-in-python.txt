How would I create a random, 16-character base-62 salt in python? I need it for a protocol and I'm not sure where to start. Thanks.
This should work.
You shouldn't use UUIDs, they are unique, not random: Is using a CreateUUID() function as salt a good idea?Your salts should use a cryptographically secure random numbers, in python 2.4+, os.urandom is the source of these (if you have a good timing source).you could also use a generator from bcrypt or other awesome crypto/hashing library that is well known and vetted by the people much more expert than I am.
These days there is an official mksalt method in the crypt module.It does not give you a simple 16 char long string but adds $digit$ in front required by most hashing functions anyway. If you are hashing passwords this is probably much safer to use.Generates outputs like the following:
old question, new solution with secretswill produce a 16-character random string
in base64:this will be 12 chars

I kind of like:That will be very, very random.
