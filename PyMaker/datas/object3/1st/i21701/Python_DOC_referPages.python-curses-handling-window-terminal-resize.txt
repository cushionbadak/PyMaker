This is two questions really:how do I resize a curses window, andhow do I deal with a terminal resize in curses?Is it possible to know when a window has changed size?I really can't find any good doc, not even covered on http://docs.python.org/library/curses.html
Terminal resize event will result in the curses.KEY_RESIZE key code. Therefore you can handle terminal resize as part of a standard main loop in a curses program, waiting for input with getch.
I got my python program to re-size the terminal by doing a couple of things.As I'm writing my program I can see the usefulness of putting my screen into it's own class with all of these functions defined so all I have to do is call Screen.resize() and it would take care of the rest.
It isn't right.  It's an ncurses-only extension.  The question asked about curses.  To do this in a standards-conforming way you need to trap SIGWINCH yourself and arrange for the screen to be redrawn.
