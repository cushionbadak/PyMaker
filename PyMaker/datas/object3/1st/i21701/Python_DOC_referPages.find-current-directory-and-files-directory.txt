This question already has an answer here:How to properly determine current script directory?                    13 answers                How to know/change current directory in Python shell?                    6 answers                In Python, what commands can I use to find:the current directory (where I was in the terminal when I ran the Python script), andwhere the file I am executing is?
To get the full path to the directory a Python file is contained in, write this in that file:(Note that the incantation above won't work if you've already used os.chdir() to change your current working directory, since the value of the __file__ constant is relative to the current working directory and is not changed by an os.chdir() call.)To get the current working directory use Documentation references for the modules, constants and functions used above:The os and os.path modules.The __file__ constantos.path.realpath(path) (returns "the canonical path of the specified filename, eliminating any symbolic links encountered in the path")os.path.dirname(path) (returns "the directory name of pathname path")os.getcwd() (returns "a string representing the current working directory")os.chdir(path) ("change the current working directory to path")
Current Working Directory:  os.getcwd()And the __file__ attribute  can help you find out where the file you are executing is located.  This SO post explains everything:  How do I get the path of the current executed file in Python?

pathlib module, introduced in Python 3.4 (PEP 428 — The pathlib module — object-oriented filesystem paths), makes path-related experience much much better.In order to get current working directory use Path.cwd():To get an absolute path to your script file, use Path.resolve() method:And to get path of a directory where your script is located, access .parent (it is recommended to call .resolve() before .parent):Remember that __file__ is not reliable in some situations: How do I get the path of the current executed file in Python?.Please note, that Path.cwd(), Path.resolve() and other Path methods return path objects (PosixPath in my case), not strings. In Python 3.4 and 3.5 that caused some pain, because open built-in function could only work with string or bytes objects, and did not support Path objects, so you had to convert Path objects to strings or use Path.open() method, but the latter option required you to change old code:As you can see open(p) does not work with Python 3.5.PEP 519 — Adding a file system path protocol, implemented in Python 3.6, adds support of PathLike objects to open function, so now you can pass Path objects to open function directly:
If you are trying to find the current directory of the file you are currently in:OS agnostic way:
If you're using Python 3.4, there is the brand new higher-level pathlib module which allows you to conveniently call pathlib.Path.cwd() to get a Path object representing your current working directory, along with many other new features.More info on this new API can be found here.
A bit late to the party, but I think the most succinct way to find just the name of your current execution context would be 
Answer to #1:If you want the current directory, do this:If you want just any folder name and you have the path to that folder, do this:Answer to #2:
To get the current directory full path:os.path.realpath('.')
If you're searching for the location of the currently executed script, you can use sys.argv[0] to get the full path.
Pathlib can be used this way to get the directory containing current script :
In order to see current working directory type following script:
For question 1 use os.getcwd() # get working dir and os.chdir(r'D:\Steam\steamapps\common') # set working dirI recommend using sys.argv[0] for question 2 because sys.argv is immutable and therefore always returns the current file (module object path) and not affected by os.chdir(). Also you can do like this:but that snippet and sys.argv[0] will not work or will work wierd when compiled by PyInstaller because magic properties are not set in __main__ level and sys.argv[0] is the way your exe was called (means that it becomes affected by the working dir).
To Get your working directory in python. You can Use following code:
