having problems with this error in python:Inside this while loop:I think it relates to this:I'm not sure why prevNode doesn't like the nothing being assigned to it, please help.
Your constructor sets self.prevNode to None, and later you try to access node.prevNode.label, which is like trying to access None.label.  None doesn't have any attributes, so trying to access any will give you an AttributeError.
As per the other answers (and the error message) you are accessing None.label. If it is expected that node might be None, then you will need to check for it before appending it.
Exception AttributeError happens when attribute of the object is not available. An attribute reference is a primary followed by a period and a name.So basically you need to double check your object and the attribute name.For example to return a list of valid attributes for that object, use dir():
