Just learning about with statements especially from this articlequestion is, can I pass an argument to __enter__?I have code like this:I'd like to pass filename and param_dict as parameters to __enter__. Is that possible?
No.  You can't.  You pass arguments to __init__().
Yes, you can get the effect by adding a little more code.
Wouldn't you just pass the values to __init__ via the class constructor?
You can use the contextmanager decorator to pass arguments:https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html#contextlib.contextmanagerIMHO, I find confusing that using contextmanager you can provide arguments, but you cannot provide them to __enter__
