Natural Text
I'm using Python to open a text document:I want to substitute the value of a string variable TotalAmount into the text document. Can someone please let me know how to do this?
If you use a context manager, the file is closed automatically for youIf you're using Python2.6 or higher, it's preferred to use str.format()For python2.7 and higher you can use {} instead of {0}In Python3, there is an optional file parameter to the print functionPython3.6 introduced f-strings for another alternative
In case you want to pass multiple arguments you can use a tupleMore: Print multiple arguments in python
If you are using numpy, printing a single (or multiply) strings to a file can be done with just one line:
If you are using Python3.then you can use Print Function :For python2this is the example of Python Print String To Text File
With using pathlib module, indentation isn't needed.As of python 3.6, f-strings is available.
I think the easier way to do that is via appending the text you want to set to the file using open('file_name','a')here is an example for that "a" refer to append mood , it will append the text you want to write to the end of the text in the your file
