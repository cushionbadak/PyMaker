Can you call functions from user input? Something like this:So if you fill in an existing function it will execute it.
What you are doing is bad bad bad :P However, it's perfectly possible.locals() returns a dictionary of all the objects currently avalible, and their names. So when we say a in locals().keys() we are saying, "Is there any object called ". If there is, we then get it by doing locals()['a'] and then test if it is a function using callable. If that is True aswell, then we call the function. If it is not, we simply print "Function not found".
Yes you can, though this is generally a bad idea and a big security risk. 
I would probably encapsulate this kind of behavior in a class:As others have said, this is a security risk, but the more control you have over the input, the less of a risk it is; putting it in a class that includes careful input vetting helps.
