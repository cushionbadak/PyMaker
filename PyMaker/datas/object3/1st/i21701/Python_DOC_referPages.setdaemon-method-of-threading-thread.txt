I am a newbie in python programming, what I understand is that a process can be a daemon, but a thread in a daemon mode, I couldn't understand the usecase of this, I would request the python gurus to help me in understanding this. 
Here is some basic code using threading:When you run it, you get Now comment out the line:Run it again, and you'll see that the script prints the same result, but hangs.The main thread ends (note that got here was printed), but the second thread never finishes. In contrast, when t.daemon is set to True, the thread t is terminated when the main thread ends.Note that "daemon threads" has little to do with daemon processes.
Module Queue has been renamed queue starting with Python3 to better reflect the fact that there are several queue classes (lifo, fifo, priority) in the module.so please make the changes while using this example   
I've adapted @unutbu's answer for python 3. Make sure that you run this script from the command line and not some interactive environment like jupyter notebook.So when you comment out the daemon line, you'll notice that the program does not finish, you'll have to interrupt it manually.Setting the threads to daemon threads makes sure that they are killed once they have finished.Note: you could achieve the same thing here without daemon threads, if you would replace the infinite while loop with another condition:
