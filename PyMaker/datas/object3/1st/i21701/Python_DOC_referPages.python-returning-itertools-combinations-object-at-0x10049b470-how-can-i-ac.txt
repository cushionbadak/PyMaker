I have this simple piece of code that returns what's in the title.  Why doesn't the array simply print?  This is not just an itertools issue I've also noticed it for other code where it'll just return the object location.Here is the code.  I'm running 2.7.1, an enthought distribution (pylab) - using it for class.
It doesn't print a simple list because the returned object is not a list. Apply the list function on it if you really need a list.itertools.combinations returns an iterator. An iterator is something that you can apply for on. Usually, elements of an iterator is computed as soon as you fetch it, so there is no penalty of copying  all the content to memory, unlike a list. 
Try this:Or shorter:Basically, all of the itertools module functions return this type of object. The idea is that, rather than computing a list of answers up front, they return an iterable object that 'knows' how to compute the answers, but doesn't do so unless `asked.' This way, there is no significant up front cost for computing elements. See also this very good introduction to generators.
