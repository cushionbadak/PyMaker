I'm a python newbie, I want to parse all the extended attributes of a file and perform some operation if it matches a particular pattern.For Ex.  I have to search for attributes of the pattern user.thing* like user.thing1 user.thing2 etc. and I have to perform some operations based on the matching.In C I can do a listxattr and if the a particular key has the pattern I wish for I can do a getxattr on the same.How to accomplish the same in python.
You use the xattr package.
This question is really old, but just to update, python 3 has os.listxattr()
