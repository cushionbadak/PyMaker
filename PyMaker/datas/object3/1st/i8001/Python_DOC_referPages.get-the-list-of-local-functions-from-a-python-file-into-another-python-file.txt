I have a requirement where I need to parse the functions defined in a python file from another python file.e.g. I have a python file with following contents:Another file is:    b.pyHow can I get the functions from a.py into b.py so that I can compare the same with the 'interested_func' data and can do specific task based on the match.Please note that I have 100s of files with different functions defined inside them, so I do not want to import the file.Please help, thanks in advance!
You should probably use the importlib module:You can read more about importlib over in the Python docs.If that doesn't work for you, then you'll probably want to look at some static code analysis tools such as pylint that might give you a clue into how to do this sort of thing. Another place to look would be to check out PyDev's source code and see how it does code analysis.
