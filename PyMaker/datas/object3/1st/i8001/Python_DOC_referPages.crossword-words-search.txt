This question already has an answer here:Replace special characters with ASCII equivalent                    5 answers                I have a task for a school test.We have to create a program in python 3.The program has to search in a file, like a dictionary with all kinds of words for the right matches.If the search word would be:B?X??The rustles could be:BOXERBOXENBOXTE....But it is not just one word, in a separate file the search words are stored, now I have to open both files and print out the correct answers.For one word it works like this:In addition to adding the other text i have to convert the german letter ä in to ae, ö in oe and ü in oe, as well as ß into ss. That is the part were I am stuck...I am new to this, but I have searched the board and couldn't find anything.
Using Python's replace method on strings, you could loop through your known list of characters and swap them out.
