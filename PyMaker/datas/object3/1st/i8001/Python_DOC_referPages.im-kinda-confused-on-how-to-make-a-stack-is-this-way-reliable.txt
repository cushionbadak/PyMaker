This is usually how I make one, but I see other types of examples here, and can't tell if I'm doing it right. Any explenations?
This is from the official docs:https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html5.1.1. Using Lists as StacksThe list methods make it very easy to use a list as a stack, where the last element added is the first element retrieved (“last-in, first-out”). To add an item to the top of the stack, use append(). To retrieve an item from the top of the stack, use pop() without an explicit index. For example:
You don't "make a stack" this way.In your example, you use a list instance as a stack, simply by limiting the number of allowed methods. It's a bit like putting a blindfold on your eyes and pretending you're blind.stack[i] and stack.insert(i, x) shouldn't be used, for example. But type(stack) still returns <class 'list'>:So this way isn't really reliable, because there's nothing to prevent you from calling a list instance method on your stack:If you want to restrict the number of methods available to your stack object, you could write a Stack wrapper around list:
