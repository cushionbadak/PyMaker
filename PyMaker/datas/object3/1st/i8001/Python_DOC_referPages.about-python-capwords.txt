Why is it not equal to this? â†“How can I do it?
The documentation for string.capwords() says:Split the argument into words using str.split(), capitalize each word using str.capitalize(), and join the capitalized words using str.join(). If the optional second argument sep is absent or None, runs of whitespace characters are replaced by a single space and leading and trailing whitespace are removed, otherwise sep is used to split and join the words.If we do this step by step:So you can see the double quotes are treated as being the part of the words, and so the following "t"s are not capitalised.The str.title() method of strings is what you should use:
It doesn't work because it is naive and is confused by the leading " which makes it think that "This does not begin with a letter.Use the built-in string method .title() instead.This probably is the reason why capwords() remains in the string module but was never made a string method.
