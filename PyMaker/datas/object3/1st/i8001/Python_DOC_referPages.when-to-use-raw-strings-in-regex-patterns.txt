From the documentation on regular expression I understand that it's recommended to use "raw" strings for patterns to make sure backslashes are not handled in any special way:Regular expressions use the backslash character ('\') to indicate  special forms or to allow special characters to be used without  invoking their special meaning. This collides with Python’s usage of  the same character for the same purpose in string literals; for  example, to match a literal backslash, one might have to write '\\\\'  as the pattern string, because the regular expression must be \\, and  each backslash must be expressed as \\ inside a regular Python string  literal.The solution is to use Python’s raw string notation for regular  expression patterns; backslashes are not handled in any special way in  a string literal prefixed with 'r'.I wonder what other cases (apart from the literal backslash) may require using raw strings?
One another example is sequences like \1, \2 which are octal escapes in Python strings, but reference captured groups in regular expressions.
