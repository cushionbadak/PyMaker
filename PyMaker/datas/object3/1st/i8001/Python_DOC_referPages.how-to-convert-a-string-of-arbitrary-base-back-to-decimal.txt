I'm trying to convert a decimal number to an arbitrary base and back to decimal. I found this code below from another question:When I convert a decimal to hex:it works, but when I try to convert that result back to decimal (base 10):... it gives me the error: It can't convert a string back to a number for some reason.  I don't understand why.  How would I convert a number of an arbitrary base back to decimal?
Your int2base function only accepts an integer as input, so you need to convert your string to an integer. So, you can simply use the built-in function int(string, base) to do this:Which works fine.
If base-n is up to 36, you can use the built-in int(str,base).
Your basic problem is the signature: your function works only on x as an integer.  Instead, you need either a second function that works on strings, or a type check at the top of this routine to detect the input type.The basic problem is that you've assumed that you can get the digit's value within the radix (base) with a simple reference; this works for an integer, but not a string.  "9" doesn't yield a numeric value of 9; "B" doesn't give you 11.Instead, you need to feed the character to the index function and take the return value:will give you the character's position in the alphabet, which is the digital value you want for your computations.Can you take it from there?
You'll need one function for converting from int to base (returning a string that represents a number in that base -- here up to base 36):and another function for converting back from base to int:
