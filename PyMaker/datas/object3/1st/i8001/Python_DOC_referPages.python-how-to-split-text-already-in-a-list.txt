Natural Text
so stdin returns a sting of text into a list, and multiple lines of text are all list elements.How do you split them all into single words?wanted output:
You can use simple list comprehension, like:This generates:
You could just do:So you turn the list into a string then split it by a space bar.Then you can remove the /n's by doing:Or if you want to do it in one line:Just saying this may not work in python 2
Besides the list comprehension answer above that i vouch for, you could also do it in a for loop:eventually your newlist will contain all split words that were in all elements in mylistBut the python list comprehension looks much nicer and you can do awesome things with it.
