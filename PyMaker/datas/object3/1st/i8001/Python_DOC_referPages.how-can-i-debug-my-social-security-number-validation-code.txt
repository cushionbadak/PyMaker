I am trying to validate a SSN, that should be in format: xxxCd1d2m1m2y1y2. "xxx" are consecutively assigned digits, "C" is the checksum digit, "dd" donates the day, "mm" the month and "yy" the year of birth.The number should have exactly 10 digits (not more or less). Of course c should be according to the formula and date format should be right. Here is what I've got so far:Example of valid number: 5446180993
date == datetime.strptime(date,'%d%m%y') will never work.  datetime.strptime returns a datetime.datetime instance and date is a six character string.If you are trying to validate that the last six characters are a valid date, you should parse the portions of the date as integers and pass them to datetime.date instead.  It will raise a ValueError if the values are non-sensical.
