I am a newbie to python. Trying to learn how to access Lists inside a Tuple inside a List. My List is:I would like to know the best way to access each tuple and its list in a more efficient way. I tried using:But i get the following error:Help would be much appreciated.
You need to remove the i in the first for loop:
short version  [y for x in holidays if isinstance(x, tuple) for y in x if isinstance(y, list)]You can't do a for .. in  LOOP on an integer, that's why the program cras
Well, your holidays  list is not uniform: the first entry is an integer (0), the others are tuples.Here is a possible loop:We use unpaking to extract the month and the days.See Tuples and Sequences in the Python tutorial.
Change your first element 0 to (0), Also, remove 'i' from your for loop, as told by Stavros, it will work.tuples in enumerate(holidays):    list in tuples:        print list
