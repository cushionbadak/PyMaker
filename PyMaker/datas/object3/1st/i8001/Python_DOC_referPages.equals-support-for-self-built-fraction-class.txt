As code showed above, how can I print As example:They are all work for calculation every time. And when I try to print fraction(1,3) == fraction(2,6), it come out as False. How can I let it calculate as True?How can I do it without using import fraction.
Try this:As pointed out in the comments, there is no need to implement the __ne__.EDIT: As requested in the comments to this answer, here is a method for simplifying fractions.The simplification of fraction implies dividing both numbers by the greatest common divisor. As posted in here the code is rather simpleI hope it helps.
The data model specifies __eq__ as method that implements == checks.A very simple implementation of __eq__ would be:It would work for Fraction(1, 2) == Fraction(1, 2) but it wouldn't work for Fraction(1, 2) == Fraction(2, 4). You would need modify the contents of the __eq__ method so it allows even to compare multiples.
In python to get custom behavior for the == operator you must provide an implementation for the method __eq__. If you don't override it the default behavior is to check if the objects are really the same object, which in this case they are not.
