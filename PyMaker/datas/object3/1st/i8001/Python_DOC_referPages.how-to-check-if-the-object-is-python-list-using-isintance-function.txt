In line 17, the json_dumps() function is called to transform [u'checkout\\.google\\.com', u'wallet\\.google\\.com'] into ["checkout\\.google\\.com", "wallet\\.google\\.com"]then in line 20 the isinstance function checks for a list. if the object is a list, it will return true otherwise false, but it returns falseâ€”it should be true,isn't?.In line 23, the data1 variable contains an indentical value of data variable and isintance function is also called to check for list object, which returns true.Why this happens is there a way proper way to check if the object is a list, and why data and data1 are not equal even if they seem like identical?
The result of calling json.dumps() is a JSON formatted string, so after executing the line:data is a string. That's why the isinstance(data, list) returns False.
