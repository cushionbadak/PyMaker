I'm doing a for loop in python, but I don't know how to print the last value accumulated within each branch of the if statement... i.e. (not for each iteration of the loop):The first branch increments a to 0 and 1, so I want to print "1". The second branch has also increments a twice, to 9 and 18, so I want to print "18".Current OutputExpected output

As said by @gilgameshbk just indent the print a statement. Python unlike other languages like c or Java is sensitive to indentation. Your code should look like this -The problem was that your print statement was out of the if blocks.Note that you should have used or to make the code more compact.
Now that you have clarified your intent somewhat, it looks like you are trying to increment for every element in certain ranges, then print the last element for that range.For the trivial example that you show, doIn a more general sense, it you can use the fact that you really have multiple ranges here and that range objects are indexable.In your example, you have two ranges:You can loop over them, do the incrementing and print on the last element of each range:In fact, you don't really need the inner loop at all since range objects can be passed directly to sum:
if you want to print the total sum only, I suggest you use list comprehensions like this:output:if you want to use if-statements instead, you can use a boolean to check if the low value is printed or not like:output:
You could use two print statements, like this:
