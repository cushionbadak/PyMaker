I'm trying to follow the documented process for installing Python on Windows without associated UI.Using c:\path\to\exe /quiet InstallAllUsers=0 PrependPath=1 is not working.When you run the UI install, you can deselect the option for all users which does not require admin rights to install. On my computer, the above works, on others computers, it does not.The all users check box is defaulted to checked (or 1) when I first double click on the .exe; so using the InstallAllUsers=0 in the command line should disable or set to 0 right?
I dont use windows really often but it seems that the default option for InstallAllUsers is 0https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.htmlhave you tried without this flag ?
