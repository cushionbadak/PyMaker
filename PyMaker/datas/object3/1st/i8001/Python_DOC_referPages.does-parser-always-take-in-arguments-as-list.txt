Your issue is with the way you are creating the command line argument path.From the documentation,nargs - The number of command-line arguments that should be consumed.and nargs='+' implies one or more space separated arguments, which would be casted into a list by argparse.Now, if you are expecting a string, you can just do:Note that nargs is extremely useful when you want to restrict the choice types, etc.For example:This way, you can provide a bunch of options which would be available as a list for consumption. Or even:If you want a single option as a string.You can read more on argparse options here in the documentation
