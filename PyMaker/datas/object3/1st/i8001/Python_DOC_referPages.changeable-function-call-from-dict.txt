Natural Text
I'm relatively new with a decent amount of experience and I'm trying to make a text based adventure, I'm making a fighting system and wish to have enemy's that have different abilities. Instead of recreating the fight for a different enemy every time, I'm trying to use interchangeable dictionaries for each enemy. My goal is to create a function call that varies depending on what enemy is in the fight without getting into objects. I have an example below and would like to know if there is a way to do something similar.
In python functions are first class objects. You can just use them as values in your dictionary.However be careful as there is no forward referencing in python. So make sure you define your functions before you assign them to a dictionary.
You can do it:It really doesn't mean you should do it this way, though.Use Object-Oriented programming. If you only want to use dicts and functions, you probably should write Javascript instead.
I can't help myself but to make a little program explaining how it should be done in an Object Orientated Language:You should look up some guides how OOP-Languages work, because when making a game it will be really helpfull if you do it that wayhttp://www.python-course.eu/object_oriented_programming.php
