Natural Text
How would I use Python's split() on a text file using ASCII decimal 29 Group Separator for separator?I have text files that Notepad++ displays GS icons between chunks of text which I believe are Group Separators.
zwer's comment worked. Thank you."You can easily define your ASCII char from your code: .split(chr(29))" zwer
