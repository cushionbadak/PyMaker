I'm trying to generate a JSON string using .format(). I tried the following:which raisesWhy is this error occurring ? Why is 'id' getting interpreted as a key and not as part of a string ? 
{} has special meaning in str.format (place holder and variable name), if you need literal {} with format, you can use {{ and }}:
You can use % formatting style.
Because it's trying to parse to outer {} that are part of the json formatting as something that should be formatted by formatBut you should try the json module
