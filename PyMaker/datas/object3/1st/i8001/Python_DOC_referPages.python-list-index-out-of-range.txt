I have been stuck with this question on finding out the second largest number in a list to be read from the console with:n = size of the list(number of elements) AND arr = The list itselfOne of the constraints is -100<=A[i]<=100 which I am unable to integrate within my code as I am getting a LIST INDEX OUT OF RANGE ERROR. For instance, this code fails for the custom input: 3-10 0 10 but passes for 310 0 10 Error:Traceback (most recent call last):File "solution.py", line 12, in   if sortedlist[i]    IndexError: list index out of range
if sortedlist[i] < sortedlist[i+1]:The problem lies here. In your example n = 3 so i can only be 0, 1 or 2. But in your code, i+1 goes 1, 2 and 3 in the above line, which is out of the array bounds.You can print i and see that i goes till 2 which is n-1 and so i+1 will be out of bounds. That is one easy way you could debug.You have to ensure a condition where you do not compare with the next element for the last element.
you can just use sortedlist[-2] to get the second largest number.In case of repeated numbers you have to use set method call over original/sorted list.sortedlist = sorted(list(set(arr)))
try below snippet             number_of_inputs = 4  # this is user defined        i = 0        collections = list()        while True:            user_input = input("Enter your numbers \n")            if 100 >= user_input >= -100:                i += 1                collections.append(user_input)                if i == number_of_inputs:                    print "second largest number is \t ",sorted(collections)[-2]                    break            else:                print"this Entry not allowed !!!"
