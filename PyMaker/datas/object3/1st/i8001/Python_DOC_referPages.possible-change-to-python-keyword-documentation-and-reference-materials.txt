How to get keyword lists was asked and answered years ago, but this relates to how keywords are documented and updated in Python.  In many languages, there is a help page containing each keyword with a hyperlink to help on that keyword.  I could have sworn Python had this too, but now I cannot find it.  Does it exist? and if so, can someone provide the hyperlink?This URL helps you generate the list from the keyword library:https://docs.python.org/3/library/keyword.html#keyword.kwlistBut you then still have to look up each keyword one by one to find the help documentation.  From within iPython and other Python environments, this is not hard.  Just use help() on any keyword after generating the list.  But I am curious if there is a help page anywhere as described.  Does it still exist?On a related note: True, False, None behave like keywords in both Python 2 and Python 3 but testing shows they are only Keywords in Python 3.  exec and print converted from Python 2 keywords to builtin functions in Python 3 and Python 3 added the nonlocal keyword.
On the Python organization documentation site, the closest I think you will now come to what you are looking for is this URL.  Keywords are listed but not hyperlinked:https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#keywordshttps://docs.python.org/2/reference/lexical_analysis.html#keywordsPerhaps the supposition in comments about the keywords library in combination with help() is correct.  Commands to know in this context:Regarding help documentation, others have taken up the mantle and you can find a page for Python 3 (that also gives a demo of the keywords library).  This webpage hyperlinks the keywords to help content about them:https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/keyword-list
The help() function isn't limited to IPython. It's available in IDLE and the command-line interpreter.True, False and None became reserved words in Python 3. butSo the difference is not an oversight.
