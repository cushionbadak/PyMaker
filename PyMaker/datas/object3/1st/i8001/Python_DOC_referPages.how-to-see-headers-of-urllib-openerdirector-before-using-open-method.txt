I'm getting "urllib.error.HTTPError: HTTP Error 401: Unauthorized" after trying this code:I'm sure that the user/password is correct. I've tested it with Google's postman app setting a Basic Auth header and i receive the correct response.My question is how can a see the headers that are being used by the "opener" so i can check if they are being generated correctly or not.
