I am assuming that Attribute reference is kind of similar to static class in Java. For example: I have declared a classThen this line works fine: But getting the error while accessing the 'area' methodCould someone explain how actually attribute reference in python works? And clarify my assuming is correct or not as well? 
You can use static mehtods in python, but not that way. Think about semantics also, not only rough syntax.Square is a describer for every possible square. Would it make any sense to say square.size = 3? Probably not, because then we limit the subject to 3-unit sized squares, not every square.Same goes for area. You do not want the area of a "square". You want the area of a specific square - or as called in python, the instance. Therefore, your program will make a lot more by assigning an instance of a Square to a variable, and using that variable to calculate the area:
To access area method ,you need to create Square object as it is instance method.For more information on classes,instance methods,class methods refer https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html
