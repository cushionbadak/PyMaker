This is my code for class Fraction:To make the class more useful, how can I simplify the fraction?For example: I want to change 30/15 into 5/3? It looks like:(30/2)/(18/2) ---> 15/9 -----> (15/3)/(9/3) -----> 5/3And I not use import fraction.
You want to find the greatest common divisor of the numerator and the denominator and divide both by that. The gcd function is in Python's standard library, but you might want to implement it yourself. One famous (and easy to implement) algorithm to find it is called Euclid's algorithm.You can implement Euclid's algorithm by subtracting your two numbers to get a third number (the difference), then discarding the biggest number of the three and repeating this subtraction/discard process until one of your numbers is zero.By the way, 30/15 reduced is 2/1.To take your example (30/15)30 - 15 = 15Now you have 3 numbers (30, 15, 15). Discard the largest and repeat.15 - 15 = 0Now you have 3 smaller numbers (15, 15, 0).15 - 0 = 15Because that didn't change the set of numbers, you can conclude that 15 is your greatest common divisor. (and if you divide both 30 and 15 by 15, you get 2 and one, which is your reduced fraction's numerator and denominator.
