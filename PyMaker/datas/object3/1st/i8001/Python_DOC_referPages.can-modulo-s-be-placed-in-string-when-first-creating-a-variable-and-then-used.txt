I'm quite new to python, so forgive me if this is a silly question. I know how to use the modulo in strings in this fashionHowever, through my searching I haven't found an answer to whether or not it's possible to hardcode modulos into a string, then take advantage of it later.Example:Will that format work? Is it good practice to use this method? I feel it could be beneficial in a lot of situations.
This does work. You can also use the format function, which works well. For example:
% is an operator like any other; when its left-hand operand is a string, it attempts to replace various placeholders with values from its right-hand operand. It doesn't matter if the left-hand operand is a string literal or a more complex expression, as long as it evaluates to a string.
As the other answers have noted, you can definitely perform the string-modulo operation multiple times on the same string. However, if you are using Python 3.6 (and if you can, you definitely SHOULD!), I suggest that you use fstrings rather than the string-modulo or .format. They are faster, easier to read, and very convenient:A formatted string literal or f-string is a string literal that is prefixed with 'f' or 'F'. These strings may contain replacement fields, which are expressions delimited by curly braces {}. While other string literals always have a constant value, formatted strings are really expressions evaluated at run time.So the f-string is also portable, just like the other formatting options. E.g.:You can add this at the top of any module using the f-string as a helpful alert for other users (or future-you):
