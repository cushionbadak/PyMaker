I cannot catch index from random.shuffle method.An error happensMy code is I think level_nums is list type,so this error happen.But I cannot come up with the way to catch index from random.shuffle method in this case.I wanna name "learning_sample/%d_%d_%d.wav"  this file by using noise_nums_index's number and level_nums's number randomly.In this case, how can I do to name this part?How can I write this?Should I use for statement for random.shuffle(level_nums)?
To select a random element in level_nums you should use: random.choice(level_nums)In your code:Note that since noise_nums is not define in the code you provide I was no able to check the full code. There might be some other errors.
you can use random.randrange method from standard python library.for example:or random.choice method:
level_nums is a list and you are pointing it at a %d format string.If you are just looking for a random int, and because you are already using numpy have you considered using np.random.choice()? That would remove the need to even use the shuffle method.Or just the random int function and get rid of level_nums completely
