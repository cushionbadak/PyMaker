Basically, you input the names and they are saved to the list. Say I input "a, b, c, d and e. After printing the list it comes out with "a, a, a, a, and a"Then, when it asks if the student has paid or not, it doesn't matter what value you input, the name won't be moved to the designated list.
Your populating loop is:You first assign the value received through raw_input to name.Then, for count from 0 to 4, you check if name is equal to the input, and then, append it to name_list.Instead of checking the equality by writing name == raw_input(...), what you want is to assign the input value into name.Therefore, you mustn't use ==, but =.Your loop should be:Now here is a more Pythonic way:
you can try:Note: raw_input() is not there in python 3.x. Instead use: input() (documentation).
