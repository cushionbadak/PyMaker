Say, you had a list of integers, e.g.Is there an efficient datastructure that would allow queries likeso that or    x = everything < 50givingetc?
Assuming these integers are already sorted it's not a data structure that you want, but an algorithm: that is, binary search. In Python this is provided by the bisect module.So, for example, to find all the members that are less than 50:
There is the range function (or xrange in python 2):If there's an infinite number on one side, use the operators and add float(y).is_integer() to match only integers:
