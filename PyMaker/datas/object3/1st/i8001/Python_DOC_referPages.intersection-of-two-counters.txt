Natural Text
I'm trying to find the shared elements (and the shared number of occurrences) between two lists. For example, the intersection of these two lists:should return Counter({1: 2, 3: 1, 5: 1, 7: 1}) or something similar, e.g. {1: 2, 3: 1, 5: 1, 7: 1} or [1, 1, 3, 5, 7] (order of the list doesn't matter). I already have an approach that works:But perhaps there is an easier (or faster) way?
Use & for intersection:From docs:Intersection(&) and union(|) return the minimum and maximum of corresponding counts.
Instead ofuseas & means the intersection of the Counter objects.
