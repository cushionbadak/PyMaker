Im trying to iterate through a string and return the string length that has been declared in the function.It will receive two parameters, x and chars. The function will return a string that is comprised of the values in chars from index 0 up to the index x-1.The return I want to receive isThis is the code I have so far but I feel like Im not getting very far. Can anyone guide me through this problem?
Whats wrong with list slicing?Whats going on here is we are treating the string as a list of characters, and we are telling python to give us the first x elements of the list (first x characters of string). Keep in mind, list slicing follows the syntax list[start:end] (in our case, start is implied to be 0). This means that, since lists start at 0, list slicing really returns a list of all elements with index from 0 (inclusive) to x (non inclusive).For a better, more detailed explanation, see this great answer by Greg Hewgill on how list slices work.
On an extra note, you can do lambda function.returnsbobsyfor reference:Python3 DocsPython course Doc
Python has some pretty powerful built in functionality. One of them (slicing) does exactly what you're asking for.
You can directly split you string using :new_string = string[:n] with n being the length you want.
