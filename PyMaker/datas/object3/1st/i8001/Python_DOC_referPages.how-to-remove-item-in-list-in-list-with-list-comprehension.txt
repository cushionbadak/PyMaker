I have a large list like this:I'm trying to remove all numbers within the lists of this list. So I made a list of numbers as strings from 1 to 100:How can I iterate through lists in mylist and remove the numbers in numbs? Can I use list comprehension in this case?
mylist = [[item for item in sublist if item not in numbs] for sublist in mylist] should do the trick.However, this isn't quite what you've asked. Nothing was actually removed from mylist, we've just built an entirely new list and reassigned it to mylist. Same logical result, though.
If number is always in the end in sublist
If numbers are always at the end and only once, you can remove the last item like:If there is more (of if they are not ordered), you have to loop thru each elements, in that case you can use:I would also recommend to generate the list of interger as follow :I hope it helps :)
Instead of enumerating all the integers you want to filter out you can use the isdigit to test each string to see if it really is only numbers:
If you have the following list:Using list comprehension to remove element in numbsThis is a more general way to remove digit elements in a list
