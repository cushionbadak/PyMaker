Python3's urllib.parse.parse_qs oddly returns a dictionary of string, list<string> for query strings:The function's documentation says that:The dictionary keys are the unique query variable names and the values are lists of values for each name.Can I take advantage of this "lists of values" capability somehow?Neither Wikipedia, nor Stack Overflow, nor the IETF specification mention anything about "multiple" or "lists" of values for fields, and I can't find any such syntax:No separator character seems to ever result in a key with a value containing more than one string. Is it possible?
You will get a list longer than 1 element if there is a repeated query key:
