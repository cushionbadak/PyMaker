I have a path which is something like this.I want to strip off everything and store only the number (i.e. 123) to variable. Can someone help with this. And the number which I want to store stays at the same place in the path every time. I mean the number always comes after /schemas/"number"Thanks much 
pathlib objects are designed for easy access to the component parts of paths:
EDIT In the comments it is stated that it can be numbers and charactersMethod 1 Using splitMethod 2 Using regexSelect anything between the second and the third (if exists) slashThe pattern is as follows:^/ the string begins with slashschemas/ next comes the word schemas with a slash in the end(.[^/]+) contains one or more characters excluding slash (parenthesis used for grouping).* ends with any character
