I have write this algorithm but i am not sure that this is correct or not please help me to solve this problem, i am beginner in python programming language.plt.show()Is this algorithm is correct if yes thenhow to improve this algorithm in linear?
There is actually an algorithm to find the Kth smallest/largest element in an unsorted list in a linear time.In order to do it in an O(n*log(n)) complexity, all you have to do is sort the list, and then retrieve the nth element. something like :If you don't want the 1st element to be in position 0, just change n to n-1.
