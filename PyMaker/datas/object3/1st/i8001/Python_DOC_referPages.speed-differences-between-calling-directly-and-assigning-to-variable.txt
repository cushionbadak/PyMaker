Situation: Consider the following two snippets of Python codes:-Code 1:Code 2:Question: Will there any differences in terms of performance or speed if I do not declare the file path as a variable (assuming that I will only use it once -- if using more than once declaring the variable makes much more sense)
In addition to using timeit for simple benchmarking you can pytest-benchmark, which makes it super-simple to create a comparison, simply:Note: ~/tmp contains 350 files/folders, YMMV. RunningGives you nice data and a histogram:As you can see, the difference is not significant considering the high variance.Now if you are still curious, you can use dis to show the bytecode that is being executed by CPython. This is a functionality of the CPython interpreter, which is the most common way to run python code:So the first code does indeed produce more bytecode instructions.Anyhow, you should consider profiling - make sure you look at parts of the code that are really relevant and avoid optimizing blindly.
