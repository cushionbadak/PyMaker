I am trying to change the cursor in my tkinter program to show the program is working but the cursor only changes to the working cursor until after the work is done, this is as compressed as I can make the code warning: to demonstrate working it will count to 99,999,999 when you press go to page oneEdit: I would like to thank Switch between two frames in tkinter for this app layout example
I suspect that all events need to be proceeded to change a cursor's look, because cursor depends on operating system and there're some events to handle (I assume that), since update_idletask has no effect - your cursor really change look only when code flow reaches a mainloop. Since you can treat an update as mainloop(1) (very crude comparison) - it's a good option if you know what you doing, because noone wants an endless loop in code.Little snippet to represent idea:To overcome this problem you can use:update method (note warnings)after method for scheduled work (opportunity to reach a mainloop for a code flow)threading for "threaded" work (another opportunity, but GUI is responsive, you can handle other events and even simulate unresponsiveness, in other hand threading adds complexity, so use it if you really need it).Note: There's no difference in behaviour between universal and native cursors on Windows platform.
This code was tested in windows 10 and Python 3. I found the cursor would not change until control was returned to mainloop. The code here outlines how to consistently display the busy cursor during a long running task. Further, this code demonstrates how to retrieve the data from the long running task (like results from a database query).
