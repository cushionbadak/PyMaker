Well, I want to run a python3 program which was cloned from github, but i meet some question about import.The structure of it is that:The __ init __.py in tests is that:The __ init __.py in service is that:But When I python3 __init__.py in test, It tells me that:What is the mistake?
You have no visibility of the service from within test.3 solutions:1 - Add service to your PYTHONPATH variable2 - Execute code from the root directory (i.e. cd test/;cd ../)3 - Symbolic link to service from test, i.e. ln -s service ../service/
