This question already has an answer here:Does Python support short-circuiting?                    3 answers                I have a question about a logical expression of the following sort:Now I want to know, how the logical expression is processed. Are the two simple expressions calculated first and then combined via and? Or is a==b calculated, and in case it is False, test(c)==b neglected?Thanks.
The a==b will be calculated first, and if it's true then the second expression will be evaluated. This is known as 'short-circuiting', see the docs.
