I attempt to create a virtual environment (and store my Python scripts) at directory /Users/MyName/Desktop/TestFolder. Specifically, I'd like to use numpy 1.8.0 in the virtual environment.My default project interpreter in PyCharm is ~/anaconda/bin/python. How do I do this in PyCharm?
Use virtualenv to create isolated envinronment:python3 -m venv ~/VirtualPython~/VirtualPython/bin/pip3 install numpy # and whatever You want to have as dependenciesMake PyCharm be using that virtualenv: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/2017.1/creating-virtual-environment.htmlUse ~/VirtualPython/bin/python3 as interpreterMore about virtualenv: https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.htmlFeel no fear using Your new venv. Really, there is always a fear like "should I do some magick before virtualenv scripts is really virtual"? Answer is "No". When You run ~/VirtualPython/bin/python3 my_script.py it's always will be executed by virtualenv
