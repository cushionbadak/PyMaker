I'm trying to import a package from a different project, but it's not recognising the project that I'm trying to import from. I've looked at various answers to this question (including python: import another project module named same with a local module).My project structure looks like this:In bar.py I'm trying to do:I can't work out why it's not recognising Project1 when I try to do an import?
You should create two packages, Project1 and Project2 (note the setup.py)andthen install themAnd then you can simply doThe obvious advantage: Package2 depends on Package1 but doesn't need to know where it was installed. Managing all the import paths is done by pip and the environment you're in (hopefully a virtualenv).
2 Solutions:1- Use the PYTHONPATH environoment variable. See this answer for more details2 - Create a setup.py for your projects so you can install them, thus import them>https://docs.python.org/3/distutils/setupscript.htmlNote: Messing with the sys.path from within app is not a recommanded solution as it is not really robust not crossplatform. 
Based on the advice Maresh gave me, I did the following (I'm using Windows, which is why I couldn't follow his answer exactly):In PyCharm: File > Settings > Project: Project1 > Project Structure.  - Add Content Root (add the location for Project2).  - Apply and OKThen in bar.py I was able to import files from Project2
