Set-upI have a list containing tuples, each which contains a tuple.Part of the list, ProblemI want to convert l to a dictionary such that,How would I go about?Triedd = {k:v for k,v in l} brings me close, but this would create,
you could use  setdefault:if the key is not in the dictionary already, it will be added, containing an empty list. the list is then extended with the elements in the corresponding tuples.or you could use a defaultdict:

As the keys in your original list can occur several times, it is best to loop through your list. You can go through your list element wise and right away split the outer tuple into key-element pairs like so:the try-except block makes sure that the different keys really exist within mydict and if they don't, creates them accordingly.
I think this is okFirst it allocates a dictionary of empty lists. Then is iterates over the elements of l casting tuples to lists and merging them with respect to the keys k.
