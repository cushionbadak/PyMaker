Neither me, not the computer can quickly figure out how taskName is used.If you have things that belong together and are often passed around, maybe you should try namedtuple instead? It saves you some boilerplate code, does immutability by default, and you can pass it around as one object instead of multiple ones.Usage would be something like:
The following uses the built-in setattr:You might want to add validation as to whether all the kwargs you want are there.
