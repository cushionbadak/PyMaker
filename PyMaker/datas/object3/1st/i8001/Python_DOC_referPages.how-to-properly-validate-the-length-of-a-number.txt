I would like to be able to check weather the user has inputed a 8-digit number, not for example, a 7 digit number, and tell them that the number they inputted is too long or not long enough.For reference here is the input:
I guess you can use len() function.Something like if len(cardnumber) != 8:  print("Please, input 8 digit number.").
You can use the usual len:Python 3:Python 2:Generally, you can get the number of digits of an integer by using len(str(number))
In case you want to loop until the user has entered the correct number:
If your are using Python 2, use raw_input instead of input, which will always return a string:In Python 2, raw_input will return the entered value as string, while input will evaluate the entered value as code, et is equivalent to eval(raw_input(prompt)).You can check that with the following code:With Python 3, however, the old raw_input was renamed to input, and the old input does not exists, although you can still achieve the same with eval(input()).Once you have the string representation of the card number, you can use len to get the number of characters.However, I would rather use Regex to validate the input instead of just checking the length, as you may have letters or other symbols as well. You can wrap the whole thing in a loop to keep asking until a valid value is entered. Assuming you are using Python 3, it will look like this:
