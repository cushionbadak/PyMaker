everyone... i am using python 3 on ubuntu OS. there is a pecission limit for  algebraics operations? for example i am using an expression that sums the products of several factors. ExampleObviously the entire expression uses each element within the list called "a".where  i don't know if i am loosing precission, my expected response (based in a theory) is 3667707174836348186431483911144 and the obtained is 3667707189516889659417305507748, as you notice the diference is very small (in contrast with the size of the numbers in the intermediate operations) and for this reason i think i am loosing precission in the compute task.i can't give so much information.. my apologize.so the question is... is possible to lose precission in pure python; if i use different large numbers, affected by basics operations (addition,substract,product,etc.)?  
If you're operating entirely with integers, then no, you won't lose precision.If your algebraic operations are only on rational numbers and you avoid taking roots of numbers, you can use the fractions module and also avoid losing precision.Otherwise, you'll lose precision unless you structure your operations to fall into one of the above two cases.
