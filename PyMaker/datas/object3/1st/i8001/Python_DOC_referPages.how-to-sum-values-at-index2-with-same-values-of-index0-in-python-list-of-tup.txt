How to sum values at index[2] with same values of index[0] in python list of tuple?at index 0 is , how to sum of values at index[2] (101, 477, 99) of 1 and (4531, 321) of 5 have similar ids 
I assume you want to aggregate the values at index 2 according to the id at index 0. You can use a dictionary to sum up your data:Now aggregated is {1: 910, 2: 8765, 3: 323, 5: 4852}.Or - if you don't want this annoying get method - you can use the power of defaultdict:Now aggregated is defaultdict(<class 'int'>, {1: 910, 2: 8765, 3: 323, 5: 4852}).
