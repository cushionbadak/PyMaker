I have the following codeand it works. But the problem it downloads file into current directory first. Is it possible to read file and decode it as image directly in RAM?
Greg Merritt's answer below is better method.I'd like to suggest using Python's NamedTemporaryFile in tempfile module. It creates temporary files that will be deleted as file is closed (Thanks to @NoamG)
I would suggest using io module to read the file directly in to memory, without having to use a temporary file at all.For example:You could also use io.BytesIO if your data is binary.
Streaming the image is possible by specifying the file format in imread().
