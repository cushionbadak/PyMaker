I have an Arduino, that give me the below values.I can read this strings matrix in Python, but I need to convert this values to floats matrix.
In order to convert your string to the list of float numbers, you may use a list comprehension expression with str.split() and type-cast each value to float as:OR, you may use map() to get the same result as:Note: map() returns generator object in Python 3.x. In order to convert it to list, you have to explicitly type-cast the value to list using list(map(..., ...))
