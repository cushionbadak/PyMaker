Working on a real-time python project, for specific reasons I need to manage and monitor the lifetime of some objects. In my code I do have some function generator that generates objects each specific period of time that I call time_of_creation and each has a service_time. I am using threads to create those objects. I want to know how I can remove an object given its time_of_creation and its service_time. Do I need to monitor those objects using a thread also ? Is it right to do this : Assuming that I already have a function named remove that takes as an object obj and a key
I believe you could. Just keep in mind:Synchronize access to the objects between threads using threading.Lock or similar, so you don't try to remove the object while some other thread is using it.Rather than comparing for equality, check if the elapsed time is greater or equal than the service time, in case you miss the exact time (even if your thread doesn't sleep a bit inside the loop body (which it should imo), it can miss the exact time due to scheduling or the lookup / delete operations taking up time). Better late than never.
