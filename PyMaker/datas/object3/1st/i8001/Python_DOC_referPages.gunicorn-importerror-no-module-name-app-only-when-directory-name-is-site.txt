Trying to get gunicorn runing with a hello world app.This is my project directory structureI am running this in a docker container but when I go into the container in interactive mode the same behaviour occurs.When the directory is named site and  I run the command gunicorn -b 0.0.0.0:8000 --access-logfile - "site.app:create_app()" I get an error ImportError: No module name app.  However if I name the directory foo, snakeeyes or blah I do not recieve an error and the app runs as expected.  Is there a reason for this?  Can directories not be named site?  Are there any other restreicted direcory names in python?
site is part of the standard library in python. I assume, but am not positive, that you are experiencing a conflict.site is not a reserved word in python . You can check out this SO post if you're interested in the standard keywords: Is the list of Python reserved words and builtins available in a library?I think you might be able to test whether this is a conflict by suppressing the automatic import of the library as directed by the documentation:
