Natural Text
I would like to redirect the print statements of my output to a text file. I have imported the sys and tried below.It works partially for me. I am able to print few of the lines, but not completely. Please find the below output of my log file where it has only printed fewer lines but not the complete logs.For some reason, it hasn't printed completely. (Please see the last line of the log file where it printed only till "alia".)Log File:crew _id="133245" id="176543" empno="8761890" sex="M"  birthday="19681217" name="MICHEAL" forenames="LUCAS" maincat="C"  preferredname="ESWAR" initials="LL" joindate="20010910 00:00"  comjoindate="20010910 00:00"  _void="title,logname,si,bcity,bstate,bcountry,alias,comenddate" {'X-SYD-BB-AUSLLH': [26JUN2017 00:00-21AUG2017 00:00]}crew _id="214141" id="132451" empno="145432" sex="M"  birthday="19630904" name="ESWARF" forenames="FJDJSK" maincat="C"  preferredname="ESWADF" initials="WL" joindate="20010910 00:00"  comjoindate="20010910 00:00"  _void="title,logname,si,bcity,bstate,bcountry,alia~~     Please check and advise.   
Instead of using sys.stdout you can write like:Or if you want to write all kinds of print value in log file then :output_file = open(log_file, 'w')sys.stdout = output_filethat's it.
