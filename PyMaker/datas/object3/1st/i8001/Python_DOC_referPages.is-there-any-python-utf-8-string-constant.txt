Natural Text
I would like to use "utf-8" string constant because it is always confusing for me to choose between "UTF-8", "UTF8", "utf8", "utf-8", "utf-8", "utf_8"All code samples in python documentation have syntax like:Can somebody tell me why is like this, maybe some best practice, zends ... ?I would like to use code suggestion in IDE to achieve something like:Is there any standard constant out of the box in python core?
You could use:which gives 'utf-8'.
