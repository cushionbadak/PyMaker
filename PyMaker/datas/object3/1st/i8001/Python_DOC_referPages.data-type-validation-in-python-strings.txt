I am currently writing some python code that asks for a users name. I need the program to validate whether the user's input is a string or not. If it is a string, The loop will break and the programme will continue. If the input is not a string (like a float, integer etc), It will loop around and ask the user to input a valid string. I understand that you can use the following code when you are checking for an integer;I was thinking that I could use something like this to check for a string;But as far as I understand, the str() just converts the user's input to a string, regardless of the data that was entered.Please help!thanks
Based on the comments, it looks like you want to check if the input consists of alphabetic characters only. You can use .isalpha() method:
