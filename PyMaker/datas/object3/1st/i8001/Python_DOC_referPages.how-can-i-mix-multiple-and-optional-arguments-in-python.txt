I want to write function with default and multiple arguments. Now I have somethink like this:and later I try to call:but results looks bad:- pepperoniPizza has 30 cmPizza has pepperoni cm- cheese- cucumber- chilliPizza has 50 cmWhat should I do, if I want print '10' instead pepperoni in third line?
Well, since you're using Python 3, the easiest is to have size be a keyword-only argument:Notice how the size=10 must follow the *toppings.Now, to specify the size you need to name it explicitly:Another alternative would be to check the type of size and if it is an instance of say numbers.Number, then assume it is the size, otherwise it is a topping, and should be added to the beginning of the toppings tuple... and the size should be reset to default. Or you could always specify the size. However I'd prefer the keyword-only arguments as this is exactly the kind of problem they were meant to solve.
