Natural Text
I am trying to read a txt file that is a mix of string and floatlike this:The only thing I want is the numbers after /* n */ that I can finally get a matrix consisting 1 and 0. There are 32 rows in total (example file only shows 8 rows) and there are useless lines in between them.I tried some pretty dumb way of doing this:I planned to cut off '/* n */' within each element later and change each the elements to be a 1d array of [0,1,0,1,0,0,0,...] and append all of them to be a 2d array.There are two problems so far:I didn't successfully cut all of the useless element by that pattern, the line like /*RC2   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9  0 1 2 3 4 */ remainsAfter cutting gen from lines, the order of remaining elements is totally changed, initially the first element is the one with /0/ but not it's /25/. But i really need the order to be persistent.I kinda solved problem 2 by changing the list to array, and then remove It seems working but I am not quite sure if I'm doing the correct thing.
Your regular expression is not correct. You need to escape '*' and instead of [0-31] you need [0-9]+, i.e. one or more digits. For example,
produces a 2D array of each line as int arrays, from there you just need to convert each to a numpy array. Sorry if I interpreted the question incorrectly.
You are looking for lines that open with '/* '. When you find one split it on '*/' and retain the right-hand piece in the 'result` array minus the blanks.
