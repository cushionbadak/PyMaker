new to teaching python to yr10's. This appears to work when telling the end user if their year is a leap year or not. But can someone please confirm if this code is working or the best way to do this. I realise there are probably different methods...Johnny:)
Here are three alternative ways to check for a leap year in python, with the 2nd method being an improved version of your own attempt:1) Using calendar:2) Similar to your own attempt but taking out the redundant steps and converting it into a method:3) Check if the year provided has a a 29th of February using datetime:N.B. Try to teach your students to use snake_case in python code rather than camelCase.
