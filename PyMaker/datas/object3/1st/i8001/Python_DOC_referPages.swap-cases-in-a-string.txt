I'm trying to solve this challenge in hackerrank, which asks to convert all lowercase letters to uppercase letters and vice versa.I attempt it with the following code: However the string returned is the same as it gets passed into the function. Where is the mistake?
The built-in str.swapcase already does this.
As said in comments and othe answers, strings are immutable.Try following:
As @Julien stated in comment upper and lower methods return a copy, and do not change the object itself. See this docs.EDIT @aryamccarthy reminded me of already existing feature for this kind of task in python: swapcase() method. See more here. Note this also returns a copy of the string.
