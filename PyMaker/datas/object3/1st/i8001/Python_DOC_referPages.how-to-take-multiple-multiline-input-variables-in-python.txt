Is it possible to take multiple newline inputs into multiple variables & declare them as int all at once?To explain further what I am trying to accomplish, I know this is how we take space separated input using map:Is there an equivalent for a newline? Something like:a, b = map(int, input().split("\n"))Rephrasing: I am trying to take multiple integer inputs, from multiple lines at once.
As others have said it; I don't think you can do it with input().But you can do it like this: Remeber that you can finish your entry by pressing Ctrl+D, then you have a list of numbers, you can print them like this (just to check if it works):Edit:for example, you can use an entry like this (one number in each line):And the result will be: numbers = [1, 543, 9583, 0, 3]Or you can use an entry like this:And the result will be: numbers = [1, 53, 3, 4, 3, 54, 2]
You really cannot, input and raw_input stop reading and return when a new line is entered; there's no way to get around that from what I know. From inputs documentation:The function then reads a line from input, converts it to a string (stripping a trailing newline), and returns that.A viable solution might be calling input in a loop and joining on '\n' afterwards.
From what I understand from your question,you want to read the input until EOF character is reached and extract the numbers from it:It stop once ctrl+d is sent or the EOF characted on the entry is reached.For example, this entry:Will be read as: [1, 43, 43, 434, 56, 455, 34, 434]
