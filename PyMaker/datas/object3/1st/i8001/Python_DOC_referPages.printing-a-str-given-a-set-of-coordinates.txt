I am working on a problem where I would like to print either "X:s" or "–" given certain conditions – like a coordinate system. Given two list:andLet's say a given element is in coordinatesand in my_list then an X would be printed at the index of that element's value; "–" would be printed in places where no such match existed.Given coordinates and my_listthe following would happen:>>> ––X–X–XXThis what I have come up with so farWhat is the best way to achieve this?
I would suggest just going over the entire length of the string you need to print (len(my_list)), and on each index check whether you need to print an X or a -.Something like that:
Try this,And don't do my_list = [n for n in range(11)] , range(11) it's self give a list of elements, no need of list comprehension. 
you can directly use a genetator an .join it to a string:
