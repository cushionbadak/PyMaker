I have been working on some makefiles which call some python scripts to perform various tasks. Up to now, I had always been makeing on a machine with Ubuntu 16.04 (64 bits) installed. Today, I have tried building on my old 32 bits machine with Lubuntu 16.04 using the same makefile and it fails when calling the Python script.At first, I thought that my Python version was not new enough, but I also have Python 3.5 installed and I changed the line to python3 in the makefile and it still fails:To test, I have tried to repeat the error directly in the Python shell:and it still fails. Does anyone know whats going on?Regards
