The end goal is to send myself an email if my public ip address changes, as I don't have dynamic dns and have to manually enter the ip addresses myself for my web server. I've done all I possibly can to try and get bash utilities to do the job for me, but CenturyLink is unfortunately out to block me no matter how I configure my outbound mail. So I've turned to graphical python/selenium web page automation, which will sign into my gmail account for me, click the 'compose' button, then enter in the To:, Subject:, and text segments and hit send. Everything is working except for one small part - the To: field. The html/css is different for this than all the others and no matter how I try to select the field usingorI just can't seem to fill out the field. Bash will give me an error like or    textarea#:lo.vO is not a valid selectorWhen I did an inspect element, the element looked like this:My code so far is this: (note: which does not include getting ip info yet, just gmail login / manipulation)
I think there seems to be a dynamic variation with the element ids in different browser. For me when I tried to compose the mail to fetch the XPATH I noted the XPATH was //*[@id=":oa"] but while the script launched it was //*[@id=":my"]. To accommodate this I have used element querying using XPATH //textarea[1] as the Recipients section is always the first textarea. This proves to work well consistently across different browser sessions.Code SnippetResult
Have you tried to use the Gmail API? It's easier faster and more efficient than using Selenium.Here's the quickstart: https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/quickstart/python(I'm writing an answer because I don't have the reputation to just comment)
You can also use Python's built-in email package:https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.examples.html
