I'd like to run some Python code in debugger mode in PyCharm. My code includes an API function call, and for some reason, that single function call takes forever in debugger mode. I really do not care about debugging that specific function, and having debugger skip over that function (only run it in regular mode) is fine. However, I'd like to be able run the rest of my code in debug mode.Is this doable in PyCharm or is there any Python workaround?
Potentially you could use sys.gettrace and sys.settrace to remove the debugger while your API call runs, though it's not recommended, and PyCharm will complain at you if you do:PYDEV DEBUGGER WARNING:  sys.settrace() should not be used when the debugger is being used.  This may cause the debugger to stop working correctly.  If this is needed, please check:http://pydev.blogspot.com/2007/06/why-cant-pydev-debugger-work-with.html  to see how to restore the debug tracing back correctly.In your case, you'd do something like this:I would strongly recommend keeping the code you run while the debugger is disabled as short as possible.
You can right-click on a breakpoint and set condition
