I am attempting to replace a string within a pandas dataframe, with a string pulled from a dictionary which contains multiple sets of parentheses. When running the script, I get an error for match groups, and the string is not replaced. I'm fairly confident that this error is caused by the parentheses.To resolve, I have been attempting to use regular expression pattern matching using the str.contains() method. I have reviewed other solutions provided on stackoverflow, but haven't been successful in resolving my error. Here is some script I am using for testing purposes. It's important that the parentheses are maintained in the strings (i.e. I don't to have to remove them):Can someone please provide guidance on using pattern matching so that the strings are properly replaced? Thanks!
Dont use variable dict, because python code keyword.Solution is extract first integer in key of dictionary:
Have you tried methods that doesnâ€™t involve looping? Something in this direction:
Thank you for the quick responses. My code was a little more complicated than I posted, and I was actually matching characters rather than numbers. I modified jerzael's response for this and the script functions correctly. Here is my test script I used:For the beginners like me, the regular expression how to documentation is a must (https://docs.python.org/3/howto/regex.html#regex-howto)Cheers
