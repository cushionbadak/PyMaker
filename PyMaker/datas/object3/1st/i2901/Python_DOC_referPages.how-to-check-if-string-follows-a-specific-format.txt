Imagine the following:and so on.Obviously, I cannot write out a condition for every number out there...How can I write some parameters that checks if the input for "username" contains 'user', then followed with an integer converted into a string?Thanks, and sorry if the question is vague, I am new to Python.
Hint:You can use string methods, there are plenty of them , and apply slicing.
