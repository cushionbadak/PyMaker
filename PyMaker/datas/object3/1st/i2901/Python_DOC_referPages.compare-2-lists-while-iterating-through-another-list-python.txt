I have a list source which represents nodes in a network graph. I iterate through the nodes in source to obtain a sub-list of neighbouring nodes. At the same time, all neighbouring nodes are compared against another list watch_list. I want to create a separate list adjacent that specifies whether the node in source has a neighbour in watch_list. See the code below: Running this code returns the following list:The problem is that the code is iterating through the all the neighbours and appending 'Y' or 'N' with each iteration. How can I control the flow to append 'Y' or 'N' only once, indicating that a node in source either has a neighbour on the watch_list ('Y'), or doesn't ('N'). It seems like a simple flow-control question, but I can't seem to get it right. Any advice appreciated!    
You can use any() and check if any neighbour is in your watch_list:Result:
This code produces a 'Y' or 'N' for each j:If you just want to know if there is any j for which there is a neighbour, use any:Or, I would rather do simply this:
