Id should be an integer, not a string. By default, ArgumentParser objects read command-line arguments in as  simple strings. However, quite often the command-line string should  instead be interpreted as another type, like a float or int. The type  keyword argument of add_argument() allows any necessary type-checking  and type conversions to be performed.https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html#type
