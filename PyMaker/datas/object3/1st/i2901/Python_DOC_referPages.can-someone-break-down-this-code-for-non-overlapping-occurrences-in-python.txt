Suppose count doesn't exist.What's confusing me exactly is this partAnd more specifically I don't get how this adds to the count?Could someone explain this to me, especially the part in the brackets.
Python has a feature called slicing which allow you to extract a substring from a string by specifying the start and end indicies (where the start is included and the end is excluded).The syntax for this is:where all are optional.So some examples from the documentation (linked above):and to give one with the step included:So, to explain your code, a for-loop is used to iterate over the start indexes of the slice. Of course, these indexes range from 0 (the default to the range() function) to the length of the whole string.In your case, since the length of string is 16, the variable i will take the values: 0, 1, 2 ... 14, 15.Then, you take the slice from the string that starts at the index i and ends at the index i + sub_len. Since sub_len is the length of the substring, this will take slices from string that are the same size (length) as the substring.For example, the first ones are:Now, the equivalence comparator (==) is used to check whether this substring is equal to the desired substring - if it is, the count variable is incremented.
