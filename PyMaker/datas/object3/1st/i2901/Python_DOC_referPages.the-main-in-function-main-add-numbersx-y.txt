Suppose such a function:When I use it without parenthesesWhat's __main__ for here?It does not lie in add_numberss standard or meta attributes:
You are seeing an IPython feature.  It uses a pretty-printer which prepends the module name to the function's qualified name.  If you disable the pretty-printer, you will get the usual function repr:The function's module is __main__ because you've defined it interactively.  If you had imported it from some other module, you would see the module name there instead.
From the documentation:'__main__' is the name of the scope in which top-level code  executes. A moduleâ€™s __name__ is set equal to '__main__' when read  from standard input, a script, or from an interactive prompt.Since you are running Python from standard input, the module name is set to '__name__', and all the variables and functions defined are in the scope of this module.
