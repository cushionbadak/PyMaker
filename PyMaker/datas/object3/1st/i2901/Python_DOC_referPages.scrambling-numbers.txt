I am trying to program an algorithm that scrambles and "unscrambles" integer numbers.I need two functions forward and backwardbackward(number): return a "random" number between 0 and 9, the same input number always returns the same outputforward(number): return the input to backward that returns numberI managed to solve the problem like this:Is there a way to do this without using the mapping list?Can i calculate the return value of the functions forward and backward?The "randomness" of the numbers does not need to be perfect.
I think your current solution is better than coming up with a function each time. It is a good solution. Here is a generic solution for a generic key. You'd make your version using the Cipher.random_range method I've stuck on.
