I have one string as below:I need to get the dictionary from the string as below:I tried with the following:But it is storing values as all string:Is there any way or regex to store the values as same data type as it has in string?
If you are 100% sure that the data is "safe", you could eval it as the parameters to dict:If you are not sure, better don't use eval, though.Alternatively, you could use your regex and use ast.literal_eval to evaluate the value:(Note: I did not check your regex in detail.) You could also try to apply ast.literal_eval to the entire expression, instead of the less safe eval, but this would require some preprocessing, e.g. replacing = with : and adding quotes to the keys, that might not work well with e.g. string values containing those symbols.
regex cannot do that, but you can! You can write a function like the following that takes the values regex writes out and converts them to the appropriate type.To add this to your code, simply do:Example:Note that the order in which the try-blocks are written is very important since float('1') does not raise any Errors but the correct type is int!
