I am getting the CSV file updated on daily basis. Need to process and create new file based on the criteria - If New data then should be tagged as New against the row and if its an update to the existing data then should be tagged as Update. How to write a Python code to process and output in CSV file as follows based on the date.Day1 input dataDay2 input DataOutput Data
I'm feeling nice, so I'll give you some code. Try to learn from it.To work with CSV files, we'll need the csv module:First off, let's teach the computer how to open and parse a CSV file:csv.DictReader reads the first line of the csv file and uses it as the "names" of the columns. It then creates a dictionary for each subsequent row, where the keys are the column names.That's all well and good, but we just want the last version with each key:Instead of just creating a list containing everything, this creates a dictionary where the keys are the row's id. This way, rows found later in the file will overwrite rows found earlier in the file.Now that we've taught the computer how to extract the data from the files, let's get it:Iterating through a dictionary gives you its keys, which are the ids defined in the data set. For consistency, key in dictionary says whether key is one of the keys in the dictionary. So we can do this:I'll put csv.DictWriter here and let you sort out the rest on your own.
