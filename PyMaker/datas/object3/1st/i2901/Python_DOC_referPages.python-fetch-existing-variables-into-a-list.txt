This question already has an answer here:How can you dynamically create variables via a while loop? [duplicate]                    8 answers                I've used locals() function and created some variables. Now I need to fetch all the variables created into a list, how should I do?example:Now, I have variables, v0 ~ v99, each of which is an independent data frame.I need to fetch all the variables into a variable_listSo I can use for loop on all the variables:
Level up the abstraction.  Writing to locals() is not reliable, and is advised against in the documentation.You should change the code where it creates sequential local variables named v0, v1, ... v99 so that appends into one list named v in the first place.  Now, your "variable_list" is just v itself and the values in the list are accessible v[0], v[1], ... v[99].
