Tried to do something like below:But it's not correct plz help.
Your regexp is mostly correct but some characters are excessively escaped in the character class (for example, | doesn't have to be escaped when used inside the class).You need to use search method instead of match. There's a subtle difference between search and match: https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.matchAlso, it is better to start learning with Python 3 â€” version 2 is obsolete.
