I have the following code which I wrote for a course which runs fine:The next part of the assignment is to turn this function into a class. I know this not practical but it is what is being asked. I have very limited knowledge about classes but I came up with the following code:The output always reads TypeError: 'ReverseIter' object is not iterable. I hav eno idea why this is coming up. Any explanations or suggestions would be helpful. The output of the print statements above by the way should be True, True,  3, 2, 1, Stop Iteration respectively.
An object is an iterator if it has a __next__ method, which is called to get the next item (and should raise StopIteration when it runs out), and __iter__ which returns an iterator (usually just self)
you must implement the __next__ method, as code below.
