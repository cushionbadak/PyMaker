Is there a way to write an If (or equivalent) statement that can have many arguments, and if any of those satisfy the logic, use that variable?For instanceSo say only z has length 1, could I write above idea/formula in a way that takes the first True answer and use that?So something like Does that make any sense?  The variables' lengths could change any time, so I'd like to be able to say "If any of the conditions are met, use the variable that met the condition"...?In the above, I don't know beforehand that zwill be the only one to meet the criteria, so my Then statement can't be z = "new value" or whatever I want to do with it.Edit: Sorry, per comments I know checking for len on integers isn't okay. This is solely for illustration purposes and it was the first thing I thought of to "test".  Sorry if the len bit is confusing.  I'm mainly just trying to see if I can use If statements (or related ones) where I don't know which of my many variables will meet a condition.  (I'm still new regarding python, so my sincere apologies for my lack of semantics or proper terms).  I'd like to avoid elif if at all possible just because it can get stringy. (But if that's the most pythonic way, then so be it!)
While @pault 's answer addresses your question, I think it isn't super readable.If you have a couple of variables only, pythons mantra dictate a straightforward, explicit way:Otherwise, if you have a list, a for loop is readable and efficient:
You could use next here to pick the first item out of a list of options that meets your criteria:The second argument to next() is the default value if no values meet your criteria. 
What you describe has a general implementation called first_true in the itertools recipes.Example
A small list comprehension would suffice:
