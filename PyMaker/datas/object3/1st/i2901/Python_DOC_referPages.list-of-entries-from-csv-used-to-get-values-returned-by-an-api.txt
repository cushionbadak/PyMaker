I am trying to use a for loop to take a series of entries from a csv file, which contains price_id's, for which I want to download the corresponding values using an API. I imported the price_ids to a list but when I set the pnode_id parameter from the list entry, it seems to include the ['2751292'] and not just 2751292, which causes an error with the API. The output I want isbut what I get is Any help would be much appreciated. Thanks!
The Python csv reader returns a list of values for each line, even if there is only one value. To get the first value you should do 'pnode_id': line[0]. Though if this is a csv file, why is there only one item per line? Your code should really iterate over each value in each line:If it isn't really a csv file, but rather just values separated by new lines, you don't need the csv library at all.Read the documentation here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.reader
