Not to be mistaken with the similar post of the same name. My code is quite simple. I am running this class in a main.py file and it is supposed to start running a timed thread, but I keep getting this error:Here's my code.
threading.Timer takes arguments (interval, function, args=None, kwargs=None) so you're passing the arg self.f_stop to self.stream_changes which takes one argument self (which is automatically passed) but you're passing self.f_stop in addition.
