Natural Text
So I want to be able to get this info that I initiate from my local server to this remote appliance and instead of getting the results to my local screen. I want to write it to a local file. I can see examples in paramiko, but I am having issues installing it for python3 as this is what I prefer to use. so I am trying using subprocess. now the unique thing is this remote appliance has limited commands it accepts, it is more like I literally have to run a 'show' command on the appliance. so there is nothing to SCP..hence the reason I did not use SCP.This will write it to my screen, but that does not do me much good :(Is this possible?
Assuming your appliance will actually write its output to stdout, its output will actually be returned in prog.communicate(), as long as you asked for stdout in Popen().You can then save the returned stdout to a file using the standard file IO functions.In other words, here's how it would work:Note that the above assumes stdout is in text mode. If it is in binary mode, you may have to do some str/bytes conversion, or open the file in a different mode.
