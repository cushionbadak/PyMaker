Natural Text
I came across something like this in python and not sure how to understand this code:
x = y = z is equivalent to x = z; y = z (yes, in that order), except that z is evaluated only once.Or, in terms of Python “compiled” code:
somedict['some_key'] = some_val = form.some_field.datathis is the same thing as:order normally doesn't matter because only the one on the right can be something un-assignable like a method call, lambda call, keyword, etc...some places I have seen this used in practice is something like:new, assigned, complete = all_modes = "new assigned complete".split()
For some semantic contexts, an assignment statement embodies a value, which is the value assigned to the variable on the left of the equals sign.  In this metaphor, you can regard this asThe value of z is assigned to y; this is also the value of the assignment.  That is returned as the value of the expression in parentheses, which is then assigned to x.In practice, the compiler simply leaves the value in a register and does a second "store" operation.
