I usually call this sift, but partition is fine too.Another, itertools-less implementation might beEDIT: for a slightly more complex implementation that is about 30% faster (on my Python installation anyway):
You can use the following function:Source: itertools
I did not find anything in standard library performing what you want. I suggest you this user-defined implementation, which is not optimized at all but very simple and easy to read:  
Full code following @jonrsharpe suggestion.Alternative numpy version which might be faster for big arrays
You can create your own function:Output:
