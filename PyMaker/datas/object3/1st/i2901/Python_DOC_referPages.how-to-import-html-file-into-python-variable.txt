I'm trying to send an html email using python, MIMEMultipart, and smtp. The html is quite long, so I put all of the html in an html file. Now I want to import the html file into my python file (in the same folder) and set all of the html as a string in a python variable called html_string.html:How do I import all of the html into my python file and set it equal to a variable:python:
You can open the file, read all its contents, and set it equal to a variable:
Just open the file as in any I/O.
But it's funny how you rush to use all those complicated libraries but don't know basic I/O operations in the language. Maybe consider going over a beginners tutorial again ?More info: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#reading-and-writing-files
