Natural Text
I am trying to create a series of types using type(name, bases, attributes) without explicitly assigning those types to variables, and then make them available for import from other classes.What I have so far is something like thisIn src/a/__init__.py I haveThen I would like to import the type defined above in src/b/b_module.py likebut this of course gives an ImportError: cannot import nameAClassNew`.I realize I can putin src/a/__init__.py and everything will work, but I'd like to do this for any classes defined in src/a/a_module.py without defining them explicitly.Is there a way to get this (or something similar) to work?
I got this working by just updating globals() in src/a/__init__.py.This adds the type with the correct name to the classes of this module and makes it available for import from other modules.
