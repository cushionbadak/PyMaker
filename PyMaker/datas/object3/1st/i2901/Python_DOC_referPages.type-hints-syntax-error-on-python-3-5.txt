This question already has an answer here:Python 3.5 typed NamedTuple syntax produces SyntaxError                    1 answer                I've got a code base that I recently sprinkled liberally with type hints. It is python 3.5+ exclusively and the python 3.5 changelog claims type hinting is supported. Unfortunately all the hints raise syntax errors, likewise with simple hints in the interpreter:Any ideas?
That's an example of a variable annotation, which wasn't introduced until Python 3.6. A variable annotation, defined by PEP-526, is distinct from a function annotation. Type hints are just one possible use for either type of annotation.
