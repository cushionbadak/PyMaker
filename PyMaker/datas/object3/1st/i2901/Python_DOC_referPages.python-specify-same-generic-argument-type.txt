I am starting to learn Python from Java. I would like to write Python code similar to this line in Java:Here is what I have tried so far:How I should specify that the BinaryNodes passed to __init__ should have the same type parameter as the nodeData? Thanks for your help.
Python uses Duck-Typing.You don't need to specify type. It will resolve at running time. Indeed, in Python you handle objects as they come. Therefore, if you handle your BinaryNodes as being of the same type of nodata and in some cases it isn't, then an error will occur and you should handle it if it is possible. 
Okay, I think I figured out how to handle this:I think this is the best way to do it, since the exceptions are handled at runtime.
