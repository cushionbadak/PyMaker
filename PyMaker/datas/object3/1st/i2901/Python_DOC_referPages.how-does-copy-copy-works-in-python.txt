I have tried this below scenario in shell.why is a and cp not the same when copy supposedly creates a reference?while this another scenario works as expected.what is the logic behind the difference?
From the docs:A shallow copy constructs a new compound object and then (to the  extent possible) inserts references into it to the objects found in  the original.So after copying cp points to a new list object, but cp[2] is still a reference to the list a[2]. You can verify this using the id() function:Compare to deepcopy():
