I am trying to write a simple program which will turn lights on and off based on the time of day, in Python 3. I keep on getting a syntax error when try and use except KeyboardInterrupt: in a while loop. This is the error:except KeyboardInterrupt:      ^SyntaxError: invalid syntaxAs I have doubled checked the syntax with online documentation I am at a loss as to what I am doing wrong and I guess I am missing some piece of understanding here. here is the full code for reference:Many thanks in advanced!    
You cannot use the except statement outside of a try:....except... code block.https://docs.python.org/3.7/tutorial/errors.html#handling-exceptionsso you would rephrase your code as,which I haven't tried but essentially,Wraps the if statement with a try clause, andany KeyboardInterrupt would be captured by the except statement.
