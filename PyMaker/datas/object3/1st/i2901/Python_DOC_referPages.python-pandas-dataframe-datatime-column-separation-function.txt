You can loop by list of attributes and create new columns by getattr:
The attributes you have listed are derived from the integer array underlying a datetime series. So, while there may be Pandas-specific methods to extract multiple attributes, this may be no more efficient than using a list or dictionary mapping. Below is a solution using pd.concat.SetupSolutionResult
