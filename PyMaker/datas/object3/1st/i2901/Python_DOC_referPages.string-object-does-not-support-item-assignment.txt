As a starting programmer I am currently working on a hangman project, in which the given letters must return every time. Therefore I would like to work with a list that returns with the by the player given letters. However, this gives me the following issue:This is for the following part of my code:With answer form being:I have checked various answers on Stack Overflow already, but unfortunately I cannot relate these well to my personal code. I felt the solution in this link came close, but unfortunately it has been without results. How should I improve my code to get rid of the error, while being able to stay within the loop to add all the guessed letters to word_blank[i]?
Your def answer_form(answer): returns a joined list - making it a string. You can not modify strings, they are immutable (see f.e. Immutable vs Mutable types). You can however recreate them, f.e. by slicing or using them as list of characters. See Change one character in a string? for that.You can simplify your hangman if you use sets. It is easier to print '_' for any character that was not guessed yet, then manipulating strings (and you avoid manipulating lists as well ;o):The win-condition is: the set of the word you look for is a subset of all guessed characters.Output:The "AI" is really bad for short words though:
