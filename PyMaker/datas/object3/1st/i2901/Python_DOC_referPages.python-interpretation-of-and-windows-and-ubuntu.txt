I have depeloped a flask application that displays information on charts. Windows 10Python 3.6.6conda 4.5.4I have then deployed the application on:Ubuntu Server 18.04conda 4.5.4python 3.6.6 I then try to execute the application but for some reason I get errors on ubuntu that I did not get on windows. One of these errors is regarding the access to files. I access that file and it is there, the user has permission to access it. Then I decide to modify the python code that refers to that document:I have found that if I modify the code from \ to / then it works perfectly. If you notice, I have only modify \ for / to make it work. Why is the reason for this? There are some other problems as similar to this one that I can't understand why they happen.
The reason is that Windows and *nix use different characters for paths to files. In Windows, it is \, and in *nix it is /.To make your code cross-platform compatible, you should consider using os.path.join(). For example:This will give you "queries/prices.sql" on *nix, and "queries\prices.sql" on Windows.
