I want to see the contents inside the beautifulsoup.py just like in parse.pyI installed bs4, but no beautifulsoup.py file? I'm expecting to see a "beautifulsoup.py" in "bs4" folder, since importing it is: from bs4 import BeautifulSoup.Importing parse is: from urllib import parse which I see a parse.py here. how about beautiful soup?
bs4.BeautifulSoup is not a submodule, it's a class. You can find its definition in bs4/__init__.py.You can see that it's a class like this:â€¦ and you can see what file it came from using functions from the inspect module, like:The syntax from X import Y can do two different things:If Y is a class, function, or other name in X, it imports that value from module X into your globals as Y.If Y is a submodule under package X, it imports that submodule into your globals as module Y.For full details, see The import system in the docs:The from form uses a slightly more complex process:find the module specified in the from clause, loading and initializing it if necessary;for each of the identifiers specified in the import clauses:    check if the imported module has an attribute by that nameif not, attempt to import a submodule with that name and then check the imported module again for that attributeif the attribute is not found, ImportError is raised.otherwise, a reference to that value is stored in the local namespace, using the name in the as clause if it is present, otherwise using the attribute name
