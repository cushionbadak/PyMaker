I was trying to implement the value iteration algorithm.I have a gridAn actionlistAnd a reward functionI wrote a function T, which returns tuple of 3 tuples.This function is called in the value iteration function:The problem is, the first two iteration of the for loop went well with outputBut then the code stopped with the error
Have a look at the tuple in ** **, maybe that's the reason
As @EdwardMinnix mentioned, you should use map and never go for such if/else construction. Or if there is any pattern with those values please take a look at Stragety Pattern.This will help you a bit:
