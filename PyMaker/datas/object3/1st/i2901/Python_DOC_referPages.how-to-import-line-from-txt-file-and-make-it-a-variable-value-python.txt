Natural Text
I have a test.txt file that has right now 2 linesI'm trying to import that to my function so that it will display the text with an input and then actually do the Boolean calculationand then do it again for each line.  It's working for the input on line 6 but line 7 doesn't work which I know why, I just don't know how to do what I'm trying to do...
f-strings can only evaluate expressions that are literally in your source code, inside the f-string.If you want to evaluate a string containing the representation of an expression as if it were source code, you need to use eval.There are a whole host of reasons why eval is almost always a bad idea (tl;dr: anyone who can change the input you pass to eval can get you to run any code they want). But if that's really what you want to do, that's the way to do it:If you want to do something safer, the only thing you can do is parse and interpret the code as something safer than "any Python expression". That's not as hard as it sounds (especially since, if your language is an exact subset of Python, you can just use the ast module to do the parsing, and you only have to write the interpreter part), but it's not exactly a one-liner.
It's seems like you are looking for eval.Try this:Output:
