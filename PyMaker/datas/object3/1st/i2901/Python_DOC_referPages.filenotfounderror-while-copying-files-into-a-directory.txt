Natural Text
I've a text file "Flickr_8k.testImages.txt" that contains filenames of 1000 files separated by new line. These files are inside the directory 'Flickr8k_Dataset' which contains 8000+ files. All I want to do is, copy the files that are listed in the text file into a separate directory 'dstn' which is located in same path where this script is.On executing this script it shows following error:This is my script.
From the error message, you don't have the correct path to the file.
