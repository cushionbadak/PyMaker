I want to use a decorator which is a function in a class that is in different python module.Creating an instance of the class globally and using the decorator like '@global_obj.my_decor' would work.But I somehow feel it doesn't look clean. Is there any other way to do it?
If you simply want to avoid a global object (I probably would want to), you can always just avoid the syntactic sugar and create and object and decorate your function by hand:To me, this suggests that you might be better off without the class to begin with. But without more details, I can only guess.
