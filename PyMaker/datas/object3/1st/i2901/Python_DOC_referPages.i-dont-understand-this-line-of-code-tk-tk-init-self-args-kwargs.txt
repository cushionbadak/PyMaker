Natural Text
I see this line a lot these days: tk.Tk.__init__(self,*args,**kwargs) and don't understand its purpose. My problem is not the *args and **kwargs).For example in these lines of code here:I know that the class SampleApp is going to inherit from Tk.I have another question: the init method in the class Tk is prefered to not be accessed like that, true or not.
A constructor of the inherited class might take positional and keyword attributes. The inherating class passes those when calling the super constructor.Edit: The constructor of tk.Tk takes some named arguments.
