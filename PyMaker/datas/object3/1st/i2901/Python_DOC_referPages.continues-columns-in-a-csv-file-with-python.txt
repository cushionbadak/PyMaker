I have a Problem with continues writing my datas in a csv-file. I want a program that detects, if there is a csv-file for my measurements-data. If not it would be generated. When the csv-file is new generated the datas are written in the csv-file on the column after the header with the variable cycle = 0.If the csv-file exists, the datas should be written continuously after the last line of the csv.
