I would like to know, how can I extract some data from a specific range in a big data file? Is there a way to read the content beginning and ending with "buzzwords".I would like to read line per line between *NODE and **Before *NODE and after ** there are thousand of lines...I know it should look something similar like:Any idea? I am totally new to python. Thanks for help!I hope u know what i mean.
You pretty much did it - the only thing missing is that once you find the beginning, you search for the sequence end and until that happens append every line you're iterating over to your list. i.e.:Now data will contain either a list of lines between NODE* and **, or None if the sequence was not found.
Try this:The output is a list containing the following as strings:(I used print('\n'.join(a)))130211452637.607300247261755.011929824413045206.0394346892517130211462637.605122603986755.21115693303926206.05686503802065130211472634.22698641915454.98263035830583205.9520084547658130211482634.22480877587955.181857466932044205.96943880353476
We can iterate over lines until there is no any left or we've reached end of block likewill give usAlternatively we can write helper predicates likeand then use brilliance of itertools module likethis will give us the same value for a.
