Currently doing a task that has given to me which is partly related to machine learning. The task is to parse a string input from the user into a date, given that I could have 2 parameter for the function: date_from and date_to; something like the given example below. Any classes/functions that could help or an idea on how to do it would be a big help to me.Currently I'm using Flask for the development and testing.
Several modules which could help:The calendar module (pre-installed) --> Link for more informationThe datetime module (also pre-installed) --> Link for more informationThe dateutil module (not pre-installed). However, installing it is easy using pip (pip install dateutil) --> Link for more informationThere's tons of functions and methods in the modules above which allow you to work with dates (and times).As for the actual parsing of the strings, it's likely you'll have to check for words like 'to' and 'of' manually. However, for months (like 'July' and 'December'), you could use a list to store them and then calculate the difference in months using the indices.
