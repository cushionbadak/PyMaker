Here is a rough code which prints out the docstring of each attribute to an object one after the other. I need to decorate a function which is inside a class, so that it is legible for me to distinguish between different attribute docstrings. If you have suggestions to the actual code as well to make it pythonic, please do comment as well so that it improves my thinking
You should definitely be using getattr lookup instead of eval.  It also doesn't make much sense to have inner functions if you're not passing them around.If the problem is that you can't see the docstrings of decorated functions, make sure that your wrapping decorators are using functools.wraps
