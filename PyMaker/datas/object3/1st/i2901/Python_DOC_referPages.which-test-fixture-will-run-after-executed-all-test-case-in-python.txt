I am writing the test case in python. I need to delete the folders after completed the all the test cases, which test fixture can be used to run after completing every thing. So that I could perform clean up operationThanks in advance
you should keep the cleanup codes inside tearDownClass(). Even if exception occurs in any of the test method or in the setupClass(), tearDownClass() will work.https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestCase.tearDownClass
After all the tests have run the final tearDownClass and tearDownModule are run.
