I'm new to programming and still trying to identify the logic here.I am working with the python-gnupg module. There is a function "list_keys() which returns, I think, a list of dictionaries.I loop through and enumerate the list:Now I want to accept numerical input and have translate to it's associated key/uid:Do I need to have the loop generate a list for each enumerated result? I am uncertain which are the right questions to ask nor do I fully grasp the logic here.The goal is input a number, translate that number to the user-id, and check if that user-id exists in the dictionary.Guidance is greatly appreciated. What questions should I be asking?
Since you've tagged Python 3.6, I would not recommend relying on the dictionary order being the same between calls. You can map your numbering to the GPG keys as another dictionary, and since dict has a constructor from an iterable of pairs, this is very easy:I think the main idea here is to first create the mapping "user choice -> GPG key", and only then present it to the user. In your code, you do not save the results from enumerate anywhere, which obviously makes it difficult to use it later on.
I modified the code so it makes sense to me (if I have correctly understood the question):choise is any possible integer the user gives. The first thing to do is to verify that choice could well be an index for the list all_keys The second line, inside the if, takes the corresponding dictionary all_keys[choice]={'type': 'pub', 'trust': '-', 'length' ...} and in this dictionary takes the value for the key keyid. Then choice will be for example the id 1234
