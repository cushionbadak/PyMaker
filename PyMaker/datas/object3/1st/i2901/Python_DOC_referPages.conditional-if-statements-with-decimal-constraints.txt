Say I have a condition that if a number ends with.00 add 2 to it and if a number ends with.99 add 3 to it. So if I had 5.00 and 5.99, I want to write a nested if statement that would allow me to add the right value to the original number based on its ending.How to do that in R (or python)?
Due to floating point precision, you will need to round your numbers to two decimals as values such as 5.99 cannot be represented exactly. This means a value such as 5.9921875 will have to fulfill your criterion as finishing with 0.99.If you are fine with that, using Python's Format Specification Mini-Language  will round implicitly and allow to extract the required decimals.
In python.You can round the number to 2 decimal places, subtract it's integer component, then round the result to check if it is close to 0.00 or 0.99. Simply checking if the result before rounding is 0.00 or 0.99 is unreliable because of floating point numbers. 
In R we can doIf we are looking for last two numeric elementsdata
It seems there are other values in your list/vector you need to deal with. I will give a vectorized format:in R:In Python:  vectorized format with numpy module
