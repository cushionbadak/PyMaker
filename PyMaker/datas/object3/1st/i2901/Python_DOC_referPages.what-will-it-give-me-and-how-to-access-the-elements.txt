Please look at this piece of code :In other words, tempis a list of arrays (my downsamplefunction, as its name may suggest, return an array) and then the temp will be agregated so it would be a list of lists of arrays !My questions are : How to deal with that (indexing, ...) and is there simplest way to proceed, by generating list of arrays in a loop but how to keep it in a data structure ?Thanks
Regarding indexing, you'd just refer to elements like sig_array[0], sig_array[1][2] or sig_array[3][0][2] etc. Regarding any better data structures, it really just depends on your use case. As @smagnan says in the comments, are you using it for easily accessing data? Matrix processing? If so, have a look at numpy ndarrays. You say that you need it for big data on time series analysis. In that case, using the pandas module will be quite helpful (more info).Also, as @Bazingaa says, you can make your code less verbose by using list comprehensions (more info):With list comprehensions, it's best to start from the outside, and from the end. The for _ in range(2) will run twice (I've replaced your i with _ as I couldn't see you using it anywhere. If you need it, replace _ with a relevant variable name). In each iteration, it'll append the inner list comprehension to the sig_array. Inside the inner listcomp, the result of the downsample() function will be appended to the temporary list for each iteration of the for loop,This will have exactly the same output as your code, but is clearly way shorter :)
