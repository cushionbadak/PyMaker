I have this problem with trying to figure how to change this code to something useable for me. I have created this combination below that gives me ADABTC, ADAETH, ADAUSDT, BCCBTC,...... and so on.I'm trying to have each one of these feed into a reference field to pull this information.I'm trying to get this to feed into as an independent into feeding for some data calls."Variable" = client.get_orderbook_ticker(symbol = alt_base) where I need this to basically end up with multiple version to be pulled from the source.Didn't know if I could try something likeIt doesn't have to list these out, but the variables would need to have those meanings.So I could parse data from these feeds to get the info I need.Figured something like this, but that doesn't work. I'm new to coding, but can't see some of the things that I need or what they are called to look them up.

Or, use a dict comprehension:
