Hello my dear educated programmers,I am trying to execute a command in the cmd prompt using Python. My research showed, that the subprocess module should give me what I need.However, when using even the most basic test cases, Python always shows the error "[WinError 2] The system cannot find the file specified". I have checked, that subprocess.py is where it's supposed to be and there's no problems importing. There are loads of other questions on StackOverflow, but all of the which I read were about a specific file actually missing or some problems with setting correct paths, etc..In my case though, I get this error even when testing things like:Any hints or tips what I could do wrong? I tried opening the cmd prompt as an admin, no luck still.Thanks in advance!
I just tried the following in Windows 10 command prompt Works fine. What OS/Python version are you using?
