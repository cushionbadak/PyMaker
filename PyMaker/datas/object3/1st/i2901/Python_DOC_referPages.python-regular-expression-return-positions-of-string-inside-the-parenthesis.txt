Natural Text
Using regular expression I'm trying to get the positions of string inside the parenthesis.For example I want to get the position of "Home Depot" ;However, returns (0, 55) not (45, 55)Since, there could be multiple "home depot" in sent, I am not able to use re.search('Home Depot', sent).span() which might not return the exact position of Home Depot I am looking for.
If you want to get the position of the text in parentheses, you need to specify that you're matching the first group as an argument to span():See the python documentation on match objects and span.
Use a positive lookbehind:Output:
Your regex is correct. But you are asking for the position for the whole match and not for the submatch. To get the position of the first submatch, use span(1)
