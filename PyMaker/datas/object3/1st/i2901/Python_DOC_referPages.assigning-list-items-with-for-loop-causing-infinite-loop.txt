I have a file with all zip codes in the US with their latitude and longitude. The file is in the format ZIP,LAT, LONG\n. I plan on saving these to a database, so I have looped through the file word by word and set a counter variable. If the counter == 1 it should assign the value to zip_codes[] if counter == 2 assign the value to latitude[] and if counter == 3 assign the value to longitude[], but when I run the following code to test if it properly added the zip code values it becomes an infinite loop and I have to force quit IDLE (file can be viewed at here)anyone know whats going on here?
You need a little less loop:
Files of comma separated values should be processed with the csv module
