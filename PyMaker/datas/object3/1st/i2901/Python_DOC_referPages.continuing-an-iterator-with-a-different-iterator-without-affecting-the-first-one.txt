This question already has an answer here:How to clone a Python generator object?                    5 answers                I am creating an iterator using the iter function and iterating several steps using the iterator.I then want to continue iterating from the same place with a different iterator without affecting the original iterator object.example:consider the iterator object org_iter:iterating over it:using iter again gives the same instance of the iterator instead of a different one from the same location:EDIT because of comment: using itertools.tee doesn't work either:the same functionality could be achieved by using different variables to hold the index numbers and +=1ing them. or with the enumerate function and nested for loops.but i am specifically asking about using an iterator object directly.
One way I can think of without using any external modules would be by doing:
