I am getting a .json response and asserting it against database values, however I keep getting an error during assertion in my tests. What's the best approach? My error:
Couple of ways really assuming a = decimal.Decimal("11.762581090909090909090909090") and b = decimal.Decimal("11.76")Round values to a given precision: assert round(a, 2) == round(b, 2).If this is used in unittest unit-tests you could use the assertAlmostEqual method Use the math.isclose function if you're using Python 3.5 or later.
