Natural Text
I was going through the CPython source code I found the following piece of code from the standard library(ast.py).I tried the following in my python interpreterBut this is same as the following right?Can any one help me to understand what does the expression return + or return - do in python and when we should use this?
plus and minus in this context are unary operators. That is, they accept a single operand. This is in comparison to the binary operator * (for example) that operates on two operands. Evidently +1 is just 1. So the unary operator + in your return statement is redundant. 
return + operand is equivalent to return operand (if operand is a number). The only purpose I see is to insist on the fact that we do not want the opposite of operand.
Both + and - can be used as unary or binary operators. In your case they are used as unary operators. return + operand is the same as return operand. We are used to see them in the form of return +operand or return -operand.
I haven't studied the code, so I don't know for sure, but Python allows overriding unary operator behavior:__pos__(self) Implements behavior for unary positive (e.g. +some_object)__neg__(self) Implements behavior for negation (e.g. -some_object)So operand in your case could be an object of a class which overrides those magic methods.This means that return + operand is NOT equivalent to return operand.
