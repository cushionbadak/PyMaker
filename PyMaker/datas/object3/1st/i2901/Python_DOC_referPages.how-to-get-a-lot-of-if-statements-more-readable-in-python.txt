I recently practiced python and I was finding myself get involved with a lot of if statements for a simple rock paper scissors game it looks like this: and my question is how i get my code more efficient and more friendly to write and read
Your if statements can be replaced by dictionaries. For example, mapping an integer to a specific Choices attribute can be done with a dictionary like this:Now you can useandFrom an encapsulation point of view, it should really be the responsibility of the Choices object to handle this mapping. If you were to use an actual enum.Enum object (requires Python 3 or the installation of the enum34 backport package) then you could just use:but depending on how you defined Choices, you could give it a __call__ method that basically uses the above mapping to give you the same result.Next, you could use a dictionary to determine winners:then determine the winner:That mapping could also be part of your Choices enumeration objects however; give those a wins_against attribute:If you were to use the enum library, the code could become:
You should use if/elif/else statements - it will only compare the conditionals until a true value occurs.And you may want to put an error message if the user inputs some other value
