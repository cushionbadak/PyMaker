In the above code example the code still executes the write in file command, even though its after a quit.The same behavious occures when I use exit.I am using Spyder 3.6Also the kernel restarts each time I use exit or quit.Any help?
You can use SystemExit:sys.exit() also raises this error but this doesn't require importing sys.
(Spyder maintainer here) Your question contains this comment:Also the kernel restarts each time I use exit or quit.That's the behavior of the IPython kernel we use as a backend to execute users code. Those commands kill the kernel and that forces a kernel restart to maintain its associated console active. I'm afraid there's nothing you can do about it.Note: The same happens in the Jupyter notebook.
One way is to use sys.exit() in lieu of quit()However, as noted by @AranFey in the comments, your code will throw an error if it attempts to execute the last pars where the variable read is not defined.
