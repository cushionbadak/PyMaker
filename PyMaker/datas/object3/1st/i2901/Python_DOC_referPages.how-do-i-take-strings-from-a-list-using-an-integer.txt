How do I take strings from a list using an integer?I tried this but it just gives an error:On the line where I'm trying to set int2 to be the part of the list that is 1, since int1 is 1, if int1 was 2, I would want 2. The code is how I set it up on my computer and it doesn't work. It just says this:
Python uses indices that start at zero. The indices for your list run from 0 trough to 3, not 1 through to 4. Your code assumes that the latter is true and sets listLength to 5, so when int = 4 then int1 < listlength is true, but list[4] fails because that index doesn't exist.Start int1 at 0 and use listlength = len(list) instead, to run from 0 through to 3.Note that Python has much better tools to loop over a list. Use the for statement to just loop directly over the values:That's much simpler and less likely to go wrong.Note that it's not a good idea to use the name list as a variable, because that masks the built-in list type. You'd be better of with different names:or, if you must use while:
