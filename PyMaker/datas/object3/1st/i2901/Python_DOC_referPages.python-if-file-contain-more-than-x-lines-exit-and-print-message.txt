I'm trying to create error handler in python, python will check the file and if the file contains more than 95000 lines, it will stop and print an error message.Is it an easy way to make this?This is solution I found:And then something like, if i > 95000 print 'Error'
try this simple approach:
Your approach was a good one:This avoids wasting lots of time reading every single line of a multi-terabyte file before signaling an error.If you don't need a completely accurate result and your files have predictable contents, then read the head of the file, the first 100 lines or so, add up their length, and compute avg_line_length = total_head_length / 100. Armed with that and with file_length = os.path.getsize(fspec), you'd be able to very quickly compute estimated_num_lines = int(file_length / avg_line_length) and compare to that.
Assuming there are no blank lines in the file, you can use the linecache library, which provides the content of a line directly. Try this one:More details at https://docs.python.org/3/library/linecache.html
