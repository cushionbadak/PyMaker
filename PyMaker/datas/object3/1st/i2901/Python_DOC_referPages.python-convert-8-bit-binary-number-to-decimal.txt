Or pop up an invalid input error in situations where it doesn't fit the requirements. The code above seemed interesting so I tested it and I genuinely don't understand which part of the code converts the binary to decimal. Any tips for the assignment as well as explanations would be appreciated.
The part that converts the binary is int. From the documentation:if base is given, then x must be a string, bytes, or bytearray instance representing an integer literal in radix base.This means that int accepts a string representing an integer, that you tell it the base of. E.g. here we give it "11", and tell it this is in base 2, so it returns the integer 3 in decimal.Note that when supplying the base argument, you have to give a string:And you can't use digits that are invalid in the given base:
