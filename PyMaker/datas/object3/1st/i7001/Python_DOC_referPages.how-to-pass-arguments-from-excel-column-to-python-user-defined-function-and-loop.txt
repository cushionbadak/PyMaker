You can export the data in your spreadsheet as a CSV, and use python builtin csv module (https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html) to go through it line by line. The following code adapted from the example in the doc should work, but I did not run it.It reads the csv line by line, casts the values to floats, and calls your function
