The following statements:Lead to this error:But work fine with a plain dict rather than OrderedDict. I know in this case I don't need the __init__, but this problem is preventing from using the multiprocessing module with a more complex subclass of OrderedDict where other arguments are stored as attributes and I can't avoid having it. (I used python 3.4.6).
OrderedDict overwrites __reduce__ and you need to override it if you overwrite the __init__ or __new__ method and/or want to store additional attributes.In your case you made the argument for __init__ mandatory (it isn't mandatory for dict or OrderedDict) so you need to override __reduce__:This can now be pickled without problems:However if you want attributes that aren't set in your __init__ this won't work correctly yet:To make that work you need to change the above mentioned __reduce__ function as well to return a third argument. For example you could simply return the __dict__:With this the above example will work correctly.A lot of the design depends on how you want your subclass to behave. In some cases it would be better to pass the items via the second argument (the one that is passed to __init__). As to how you set your attributes: Sometimes it's enough to use self.__dict__ but in other cases it would be safer/better to use __setstate__. You should definitely read the documentation of the pickle module and check which approach is best for you.
