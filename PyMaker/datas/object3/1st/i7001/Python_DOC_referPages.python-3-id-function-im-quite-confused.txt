This question already has an answer here:Why is the id of a Python class not unique when called quickly?                    6 answers                I have a question about the id() function:Can I say that: when an object is created whether you use the id function or not it will in the background "create" an id number, this reference's the location of this object. If you don't call the object to a name this id will get cleared away because of the garbage collector? 
id() is guaranteed to be unique and constant for the object during its lifetime, and will not be affected by "garbage collection".Check out the answer to this for more insight:What does id( ) function used for?
