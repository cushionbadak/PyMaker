This question already has an answer here:Converting HTML list to nested Python list                    2 answers                I have a problem in my python code.Now the result is:but I want the result is:I want to match the group (<li.*?</li>) 0 or unlimited times.How can I do?Thanks!

use star operator:outputs:CautionMatching 0 or more will match empty string, I'm not sure thats what you need.Suggestionif you are using re.findall you dont need to match all li elements in one results as all resulting matches will return from findall.first capture the <ul>...</ul> block using re.search().then separate each <li></li> element using re.findall() on the resulting ul textSuggestion Twouse lxml or bs4 to parse html objects, its simpler than writing your own regexes to find html elements.
Can you try to use the regexp below instead.This will work as you expect.
Take a look at the documentation for re.findall():Your RE has only one match in your string since there is only one '<ul id="talkList"' to match with. Since you have (one) group in your RE, re.findall() returns that group instead.If you use just '<li.*?</li>' as your RE then re.findall() will find three matches and return all three:Output:
Instead of UseWill solve your problem
