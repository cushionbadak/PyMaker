The above code finds x values for y=50 successfully. But when I try to do the same for the fitted exponential function, I can't understand how to do that.if I add *popt then I getI assume that I need to add x value, but it's the value I'm trying to find... Anyway, adding some value instead of x, leads to another error:
I guess you need to pass f_exp function with optimized parameters to fsolve (i.e. with a, b and c args set to values obtained from curve_fit). In order to do so you can use functools.partial function:What we did here is basically made a new function optimized_f_exp by partially fixing a, b and c args of your original function to be popt (what's exactly why it called partial).
