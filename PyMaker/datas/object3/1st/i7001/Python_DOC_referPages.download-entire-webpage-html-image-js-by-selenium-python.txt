I have to download source code of a website like www.humkinar.pk in simple HTML form. Content on site is dynamically generated. I have tried driver.page_source function of selenium but it does not download page completely such as image and javascript files are left. How can I download complete page. Is there any better and easy solution in python available?
Using SeleniumI know your question is about selenium, but from my experience I am telling you that selenium is recommended for testing and NOT for scraping. It is very SLOW. Even with multiple instances of headless browsers (chrome for your situation), the result is delaying too much.RecommendationPython 2, 3This trio will help you a lot and save you a bunch of time.DryscrapeBeautifulSoupThreadPoolExecutorDo not use the parser of dryscrape, it is very SLOW and buggy. For  this situation, one can use BeautifulSoup with the lxml parser. Use dryscrape to scrape Javascript generated content, plain HTML and images.If you are scraping a lot of links simultaneously, i highly recommend  using something like ThreadPoolExecutorEdit #1dryscrape + BeautifulSoup usage (Python 3+)
It's not allowed to download a website without Permission. If you would know that, you would also know there is hidden Code on hosting Server, where you as Visitior has no access to it.
I Hope below code will work to download the complete content of the page.
