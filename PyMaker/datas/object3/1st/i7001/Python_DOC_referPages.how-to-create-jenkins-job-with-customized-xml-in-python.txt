I am trying to create a Jenkins job using Jenkins module in python. I am able to successfully connect with jenkins and perfrom get job_count as well as create_job() method.In create_job() method i can perfrom this operation only with  "jenkins.EMPTY_CONFIG_XML" parameter. How do i pass my own xml config file? below is my code, I have config saved on local, how to pass it by replacing EMPTY_CONFIG_XML. I tried few things, didn't work. Couldn't find it online. My below code is working. It's creating TestJob with EMPTY_CONFIG_XML. can someone please help how to pass customized XML file? Thank you for help!
Looking through the documentation for create_job, the config_xml parameter should be passed as a string representation of the xml. I used a xml.etree.ElementTree to parse the XML file and  convert it into a string:I found this thread very helpful in understanding how to parse XML files, it also has a nice explanation about differences between Python2/3.
