I have a Django project where I am working on an email client. I've decided to use python's IMAPClient instead of standard library's imaplib for getting access to the messages. Currently, I don't make use of python's email package to encode/decode responses received from IMAPClient, and I have a feeling that I manually implement things that should be handled by email.Example code for downloading attachment:So the question is, how should I rewrite this code to make use of email. Specifically, what should I do with the response from IMAPClient to pass it to email's message_from_bytes() function?
If you wish to parse an email using the email package's message_from_bytes() function then you need to give it the entire, raw email body. To get this, fetch using the RFC822 selector like this:If you're pulling individual message parts/attachments from the IMAP server, then the server is effectively doing the parsing work for you and you don't need to use the email package's parser.
