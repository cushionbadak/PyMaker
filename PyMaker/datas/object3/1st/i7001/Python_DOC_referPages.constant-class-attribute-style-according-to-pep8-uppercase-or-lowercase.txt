I really like to follow the standard coding style, but can't find an answer on this.Should I write constants in class attributes all_lower_case or ALL_UPPER_CASE?PEP8 just says that constants should be ALL_UPPER_CASE at the module level. What about classes?
PEP8 makes it clear that constants should be upper-case:ConstantsConstants are usually defined on a module level and written in all capital letters with underscores separating words. Examples include MAX_OVERFLOW and TOTAL.Note that it just says that these are usually defined on a module level. But if your values should be treated as constants then make them uppercase - even if they are defined on a class level.
Why not extract those outside of the class in the module like this:Then you could use it like:Also according to the following Python documentation it's ALL_CAPS, even inside Class. This also makes sense to me.More info and examples.
