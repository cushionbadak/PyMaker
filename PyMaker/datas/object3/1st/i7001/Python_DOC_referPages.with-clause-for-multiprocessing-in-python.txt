https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing.pool.PoolNew in version 3.3: Pool objects now support the context management protocol â€“ see Context Manager Types. enter() returns the pool object, and exit() calls terminate().You can see an example at the bottom of the Pool section.
Although its more than what the OP asked, if you want something that will work for both Python 2 and Python 3, you can use:After that, you can use multiprocessing the regular Python 3 way, regardless of which version of Python you are using. For example:will work in Python 2 or Python 3.
