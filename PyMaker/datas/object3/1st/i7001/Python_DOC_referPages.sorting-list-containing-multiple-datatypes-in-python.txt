use sorted(your_list, key=str) for simple cases when you can sort by the string representation of the itemoutput: [54, 84, 'Tak', 'jil', 'son']
sorted takes three arguments: an iterable, a key and reverse i.e sorted(iterable, [key=None], [reverse=False]). The key argument allows you define a function which can be called to compare the values of items in the iterable. Some examples are given below:Using lambdas or by defining functions of your own, the sorted function is very versatile. NB: Use can also use the key argument in list.sort()
