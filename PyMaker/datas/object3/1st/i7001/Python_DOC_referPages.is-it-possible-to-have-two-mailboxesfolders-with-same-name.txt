I am working on a product where I have to interact with email servers (like zimbra, dovecot etc) through IMAP to fetch emails etc.I am using Python's imaplib library. I connect to email server account with credentials and then select a mailbox (folder) through its name. Now I am wondering whether is it possible to have two mailboxes with same name in an account? If yes then how to go about it ?
Question: I am probably unclear on this.Using select(mailbox=... you are dealing with Real Folders.Therefore no duplicate possible.IMAP4.select(mailbox=’INBOX’, readonly=False) Select a mailbox.    Returned data is the count of messages in mailbox (EXISTS response).    The default mailbox is 'INBOX'.    If the readonly flag is set, modifications to the mailbox are not allowed.
