I have a small C# function that I want to use in Python. However Im not sure how to use hashlib to accomplish the same result. The function receives a string an returns the base64 encoding of the sha1 hash of the string:I tried this on python but im not getting the same results:Whats the best way to accomplish the same thing in Python?
The difference in the output stems from the encoding you are using:in your C# code, UnicodeEncoding encodes the input string (word) as UTF-16 little endian; andin your Python code, you're not even handling Unicode strings (they must be encoded as some bytes)So, just encode the word as UTF-16 little endian before hashing:Also, your Python function can be somewhat shortened.
