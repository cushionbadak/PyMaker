This question already has an answer here:Why it's not possible to use regex to parse HTML/XML: a formal explanation in layman's terms                    9 answers                please, advice how to get xml attribute value with regexp python style. Here is the example, the extract has to be full match(long story)the most I achieved is (?<=code=\")(.*?)(?=\">), but that ignores method part at allthanks
Well, either you learn the basics of regex syntax and use re, or you have a look at the Python's xml.etree.ElementTree module to parse the xml directly.If you want to go with a regex, you can test language-specific expressions interactively with online tools, regex101 for example.Maybe <(?P<method>\w*?) (?P<code>\w*?)=\"(?P<value>.*)\"> will do the job.But once again, as mentioned, extracting data from XML using regex is fragile and very limited.EDIT: Clearer explanation for 3EDIT2: Add regex suggestion
