I've been given a summer assignment to create a chat room on python using sockets, using a main socket as the server that connects to all the other "client" sockets, each time a client sends a message to the server, the server sends it to everyone else but the client that sent it. The catch is that I need to make it so you can write messages and receive them at the same time, which is something I have no idea how to do so I took my friend's advice and tried to do it using multi-threading.This is what I have right now, it's supposed to get more complicated but this is the very basic part:clientserverThe issue is when I try to run it, the first message works fine, but after the second message the server just sends a lot of blank messages and stops sending the messages I send it. I'd really appreciate help in the matter.
Thanks for the help guys, in the end I asked a friend of mine and he told me to use threading instead of select on the server and it worked great! I'll post the code later if anyone's interested.
