What I am trying to achieve is I want to allow user to input only any website from google.com and goo.gl only. To do this, my sample code in python console is like this:The returned result false is correct because url does meets criteria containing goo.gl. I went on testing with few more options url like https://google.gl/LoZXyE, the find() function return true because it does not meet criteria containing words 'google.com' or 'goo.gl'. My problem is that if I assign variable url the value like below which I expected it to return true from find() function above because it does not contain word 'goo.gl' at all, yet it return false.What is wrong happening? How can I validate url like the case above result like expected?Thanks.
That linedoes indeed contain 'goo.gl', but you do not want it because it is immediately followed by AB in the url, which changes the top-level domain.One way around that is to not search for goo.gl but for //goo.gl/. That works in the examples you gave, and prevents both following and preceding characters that change the top-level domain. That makes the lineRemember that the line above works only in the interactive console. To use it in a program put it in an if line or an expression, such asoror (more like your interactive line)
