I have a folder in my computer with many .txt files:How can I turn the name of the files (without the .txt part) into a list like this:
You could use pathlib1. It has a dedicated stem property which returns the filename without suffix:1pathlib is part of the standard library in Python 3.4+ - but you can use third-party (backport-)packages, available on PyPI and conda, like pathlib and pathlib2 if you have an older Python version.
I wrote this but I much prefer MSeifert's answer. I checked and pathlib seems available in Python 2.7 as well.You can try something like thisIt uses a list comprehension, which you can read about here.In glob() you can add in the path to your directory of choice. os.path.split(x)[-1] gets the file name without the path infoos.path.splitext(...)[0] is used to split the filename.extension into a tuple `(filename, extension), of which the first element is chosen to get just the filename.
