Natural Text
I want to filer some tokens from a list by the following conditions.1) token length greater than 52) the frequency of appearance (in the original text) more than 100I used the following code But can't seem to get it. I believe the error came from 'c.item[2]' but don't quite understand the mechanics behind the 'Counter()' command.It will be really appreciated if someone could enlighten me on this.Thank you.
Did someone say filter?Also, you access the counter count using c[...]. Also, you might want to be wary of case issues (the same word present in different case).If you want speed, use a list comprehension instead:If you are looking to obtain words satisfying your condition without unwanted duplicates, work on a set instead of a set:Beware, order is lost. If you want order without duplicates, use an OrderedDict (python < 3.6 or dict (python >= 3.6). If a dict doesn't do it, you can look at the OrderedSet recipe and implement something to the same effect:
