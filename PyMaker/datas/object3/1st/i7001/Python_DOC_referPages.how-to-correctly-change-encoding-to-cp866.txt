Natural Text
I'm trying to print UTF-8 and cp866 process output.My code:  after this I get that:I understand that I need to change encoding to cp866, but I don't understand how to implement it =(Update: And this code didn't help:
os.popen 's read method returns str, the the output from the process is automatically decoded. subprocess.Popen is similar to os.popen and can be customized ; it returns raw bytes instead of str text: Internally, os.popen uses the subprocess module, you might need to slightly change the command argument. Check Popen 's documentation.
