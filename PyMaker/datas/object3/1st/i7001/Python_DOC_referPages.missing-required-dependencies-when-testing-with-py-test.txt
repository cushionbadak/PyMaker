I have a python file which contains classes and functions and a construct. I want to test a class which is defined in this file with py.test. For my first "hello world"-test, my test-file only imports the file to be tested.Running py.test in PyCharm results however inMy file to be tested has the import statementsMy conda environment.yml isWhat is the issue here?
I am not quite sure what helped, but I reinstalled/updated numpy and pandas with conda install .... I was still left with an error about having wrong file names. After trying out a lot of stuff I found out that - even though I was using pytest, not the library unittest - I could not name the folder in which all my test files are "unittest". Renaming it to "unittests" solved that. Now everything works.
