If i run this command on its own:I receive my desired output of:All the hosts on my network with an open ssh port.However, when i try to run the same command within a Python subprocess, it seems to skip the awk. Python below:You'll notice the commented 'command', as i've tried as 'command' and 'command1'. Both return output of:It outputs as though there is no pipe awk (nmap -PN -p 22 --open -oG - 10.15.86.0/24) rather than (nmap -PN -p 22 --open -oG - 10.15.86.0/24 | awk '$NF~/ssh/{print$2}' > sshopen.txt).Why is it not applying the awk within the script?Thanks
TryorThis is from python's official subprocess doc.There are some security considerations with shell=True though.Unlike some other popen functions, this implementation will never implicitly call a system shell. This means that all characters, including shell metacharacters, can safely be passed to child processes. If the shell is invoked explicitly, via shell=True, it is the applicationâ€™s responsibility to ensure that all whitespace and metacharacters are quoted appropriately to avoid shell injection vulnerabilities.https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#replacing-shell-pipelinehttps://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#security-considerations
