I am trying to understand how the primes iterator works, the code was taken from a lecture. I searched for count() but found only methods for lists, objects, I just do not understand how the line self._candidates = count(1) works and what it means.where is the object we are trying to count 1 in? and the further use of it self._candidates.next() is also very confusing.I mainly code in java albeit know basic python.here is the code: 
Probably this is itertools.count, and a lineis missing from the listing.Generators in Python are comparable to Iterators in Java. The call count(1) returns a generator that counts upwards from 1:Note that counter.next() is Python 2 only. For compatibility with both Python 2 and 3, use next(counter) instead.
