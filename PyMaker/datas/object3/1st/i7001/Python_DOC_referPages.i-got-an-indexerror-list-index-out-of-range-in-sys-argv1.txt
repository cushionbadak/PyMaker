It looks like the program is expecting 2 float command line arguments.``So you shuld probably launch it with something like To go more into detail, your code is reading command line arguments and it's expecting there to be 2 of them, that can also be parsed into float values.Normally, the first command line argument is the script file itself, so sys.argv is always at least one element long.That being said, you can either do as suggested above, and pass 2 floats as arguments, when launching the script, or just edit the script and hardcode 2 values instead of the ones read from the command line, like so
