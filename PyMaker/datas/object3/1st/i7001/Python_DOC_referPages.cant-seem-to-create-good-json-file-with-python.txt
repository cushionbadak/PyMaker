So basically in have a loop. Everytime the code from the loop gets executed, this happens:So basically im creating alot of arrays, followed by 2 values inside each array.After that I just do this:The problem is the output im getting is the following:"[{\"cat\": [\"female\", \"fish\"]}, {\"pig\": [\"male\", \"carrots\"]}, {\"dog\": [\"male\", \"dogfood"]}]"Now I think this is wrong because: It starts with double quotes, wich indicates everything is a string and not json. After that in each object there's an escape sequence instead of quotes. How can I solve all of this?
Stop dumping twice. You're generating JSON, and then encoding the resultant string as JSON.
