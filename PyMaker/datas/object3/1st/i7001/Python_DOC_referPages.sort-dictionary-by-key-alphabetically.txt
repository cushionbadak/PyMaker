This question already has an answer here:How can I sort a dictionary by key?                    25 answers                I'm having trouble sorting my dictionary alphabetically by its keys.Here's my code:What I get:{'Yellow/Fuschia':['Large', 'Extra Large'],                 'Black':['Small', 'Medium', 'Large']}What I wanna get:{'Black':['Small', 'Medium', 'Large'], 'Yellow/Fuschia':['Large', 'Extra Large']}Thanks!
Dictionaries in python versions < 3.6 are unordered, sorting and reinserting is meaningless.As a fix, either Switch to python3.6 (keep in mind the caveats), orUse an OrderedDictFor the second option, replace realColor = {} with a collections.OrderedDict:Here's an example of how an OrderedDict remembers the order of insertion:The __repr__ might be different, but the latter is still a dictionary and can be used accordingly.
