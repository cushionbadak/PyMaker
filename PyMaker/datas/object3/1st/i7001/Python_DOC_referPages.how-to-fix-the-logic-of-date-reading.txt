I currently have a statement that says:The problem with using date created is the fact that it relies on the time someone created the file. Here I have 2 optionsAccept a range of datesFigure how to get 'date accessed' which would result in the day it was saved.How can I change my logic to either accept a week range of dates, or (preferably) how can I get the date of access?I found this link: Python get last reading time of a fileHaving trouble figuring out how to implement it in my code. Thank you very much! 
You can access the last accessed time by os.path.getatime().From Python docs:os.path.getatime(path)   Return the time of last access of path. The return value is a number giving the number of seconds since the epoch (see the time module). Raise OSError if the file does not exist or is inaccessible.Sample UsageOutput
