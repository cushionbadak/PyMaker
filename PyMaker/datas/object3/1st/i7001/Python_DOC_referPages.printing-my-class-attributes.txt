Natural Text
these are 2 parts of my misbehaving text based adventure code that I'm trying to learn how to do with a youtube tutorial. I believe that most of my problems arise because the tutorial I'm pretty sure is using python2.something and I'm using 3.  My problem is I'm trying to list the "Player" class attributes on the start screen, which I have successfully done with Playername, but I'm having trouble getting the numbers listed as self.attack and self.health etc to print.  I downloaded python for the first time about 5 days ago, so bear with a noob if you can, please.  Let me know what I can change, and thank you in advance!
A few things immediately:def _init_ needs to be def __init__ (note the double underscores).self.health = self.health doesn't make sense - whatever is on the right side of an = needs to exist before you can assign some other variable to it, and self.health doesn't exist until that line.The variable PlayerIG was never assigned to anything, so none of the code in start1 will work (unless it was done somewhere else, that you haven't included in the question).A working version of what you have in your question would be something likeThere are many improvements you could make from there, like defining a __str__ function for Player or using keyword arguments in your __init__ method.
