This question already has an answer here:Why does `a == b or c or d` always evaluate to True? [duplicate]                    1 answer                My Python code isn't working. It outputs "HI!" regardless of the input.Ive tried using multiple ifs instead of Elifs but it still doesn't work
The issue is that you need to have the check after each part of the if statement.Right now after it checks for "Hi" reads true because 'hi' is a true valueChange all of your stements to something likeThat way it actually checks
