I am learning security challenge. One of this challenge ask me to retrieve data which has been destroyed and is kept in memory until garbage collector fires.I have tried a lot of things. I want to know if it is possible to dump process memory from python console.Also, the challenge gives us a python console, but there is a stopwatch instead of ">>>". How can they do something like that ?I just have an ssh access which launch python console.Thanks
