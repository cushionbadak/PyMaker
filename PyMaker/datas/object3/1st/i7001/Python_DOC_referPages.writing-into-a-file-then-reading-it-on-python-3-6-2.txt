Natural Text
When running the following python script (test.txt is an empty file), it prints an empty string.However, when reopening the file, it can read it just fine:This prints out 'ffff' as needed.Why is this happening? Is 'target' still recognized as having no content, even though I updated it in line 2, and I have to reassign test.txt to it?
A file has a read/write position. Writing to the file puts that position at the end of the written text; reading starts from the same position.Put that position back to the start with the seek method:Demo:The numbers are the return values of target.write() and target.seek(); they are the number of characters written, and the new position.
No need to close and re-open it. You just need to seek back to the file's starting point before reading it:
Try flushing, then seeking the beginning of the file:
you have to close() the file before reading it. You cannot read and write to a file at the same time. this causes inconsistency.
