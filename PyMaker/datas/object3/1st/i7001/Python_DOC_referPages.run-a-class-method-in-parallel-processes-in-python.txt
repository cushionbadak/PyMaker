I am trying and failing to run a huge loop in parallel. The loop is exactly one method of a specific class, and inside the loop I call its another method. It does work, but for some reason there is only one process in the list and the output (see code) is always 'Worker 0'. Either the processes are not created or they are not running in parallel. The structure is the following:main.pymy_class.pyI have read some things about child processes requiring main module to be importable, but I have no idea how to do it in my case.
Question: ...  but still only one core is in use. So the question is, can I use multiple cores with Process objectsThis does not depend on the Python interpreter which Process is using which CPU.Relevant: on-what-cpu-cores-are-my-python-processes-running Extend your def _method(... with the following, to see what actually happens:  Note: getpidcore(pid) is Distribution dependend, could FAIL!Output:  Tested with Python: 3.4.2 on Linux
