I've been trying to merge/parse this list with multiple lists inside into one list only.The list i want to parse/merge has this format :I came up with this code after some googling :But it only prints me the ID'sThe disered output is :The condition for each line is obviously the 'id' that is always the first position on each list.
You can try this:Final Output:
You need to group your values per unique id, you can't just flatten things. You either have to use a dictionary to group lists by id, or, provided the lists for each unique id are consecutive, use itertools.groupby().Using a dictionary:or a Python 2 version:I sorted the output list by id; dictionaries have no inherent order. Note that I removed the wrapping singleton list objects; these are taking up memory you don't need to use and they complicate matters algorithmically.You could use a collections.OrderedDict() object for list_one if you need to have these lists in order of first appearance.As stated, if the id lists are already consecutive, you can use itertools.groupby() to do the grouping in one step:Demo:If you feel you must have those singleton lists in your output, feel free to add them back in.
The above answer provide good solutions, here is another way to do it, but I agree with @ Martijn Pietersâ™¦ and his solution in terms of clear readingEdited based on there being other values,
I have this solution but it work only if the ids are string or int and must be in the head of each list:result:
