I'm trying to configure my Python logging module using logging.config.dictConfig()However, my JSON file appears to be corrupt even though it works as a Python dict with false changed to False, so I don't think it's a syntax error.My code says:My logging_config.json file is:When I run that simple program, I get an error: json.decoder.JSONDecodeError: Expecting property name enclosed in double quotes: line 8 column 3 (char 156)What could be causing the JSON decoder to fail?Thanks in advance for any help.
You have multiple extraneous commas which will break the JSON deserialization.Here's your original JSON with every extraneous comma pointed out:Removing those, this is now a valid JSON document:
This happens because your JSON is invalid. this one JSON is valid.I removed extra commas from your JSON.You can use any JSON validator to fix it.
As others already answered, there are some excess commas in your JSON.You could feed your JSON to https://jsonlint.com/ ; it tends to give more useful help messages.
