This question already has an answer here:Python wildcard search in string                    6 answers                How can I do this:To use * as a wildcard char like in Linux?
You are going to want to look at the re module. This will let you do a regular expression and accomplish the same thing as the * does in the linux command line.
If you just want to match Unix filename pattern matching, you can use the dedicated module fnmatch:If you want to do advanced pattern matching, use regular expressions.
You could use a regular expression from the re module for general purpose pattern matching.However, if you are working with HTML and trying to match tags and such I would recommend looking into LXML and using its parse function and cssselect to get what you want.This doc describes the different CSS Selectors
