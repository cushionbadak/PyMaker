Suppose if I have a class as shown below,I want to create a dict out of all the @properties. I have tried with __dict__ and vars but still the @property is not showing up. How can I include @property too.I want to include age_group and country with the returned values as the keys and values.
Use a dict comprehension that iterates over the objects attributes:If you really just want the @property attributes, which is unclear in your question, you can filter for them like so:
You can get the names you want by calling dir on your instance. However, the list returned by dir also has a bunch of names you don't want (the names of the methods inherited from object), so we need to filter those out.outputHere's a cleaner way to do this. We loop over the vars() of the class object, specifically looking for items that are property instances. Then we use itertools.chain to combine those names with the names from calling vars() on the instance of the class.outputThis way is superior to the previous technique, since that code will also include bound methods whose names don't start with __, like do_stuff, in its output.
