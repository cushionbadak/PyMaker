I am trying to fit exponential function from my data. I am not very experienced with fitting mathematical functions to my data yet. Below is my code right now.  The error message that I get is the following. I don't think I am quite understanding what this error message is saying. Could anyone help me understand what is causing this error and how I could improve my code?
The myfunc function receive four parameters, x, a, b and c.The error message says that you provided 5 parameters. It's because you unpacked popt who probably contains fours elements (and thus four paramaters while unpacking it).In this line:The myfunc function receive my_x + four parameters.It makes five parameters but the function only wants four.More about unpacking here.
