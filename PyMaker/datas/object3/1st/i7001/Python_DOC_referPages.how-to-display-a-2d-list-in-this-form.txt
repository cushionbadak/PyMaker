However, if you want a list to string conversion - ways to output the list as a nice string, you have the option of pprint, or pretty-printing. This is a module from the standard library that seems pretty close to what you're looking for:Gives the outputNow I've had to artificially reduce its maximum width a bit as your lists are so short that pprint, by default, does not consider them worth shortening.Also, if you want the string representation in your program, you can use pprint.pformat in pretty much the same way, except it returns a string:
I assume what you're looking for is the __repr__ of a list - how it is displayed. Semantically, the two are one and the same. However, if you want to display your lists like that, this is how you might do it.The simple way with numpy:The grotesque way, using vanilla python.The other answer mentions pprint.pprint which I consider a simpler alternative to 2, but limited flexibility. You could instead use pprint.pformat to prettify your list and get rid of commas:
