In python (v3.6.1), I am looking to write a class like this:I have tried to set up the FirstClass class like this:But I don't seem to be able to edit the property of the FirstClass from the SecondClass.Is this possible?
Since you're using Python 3.6, you can accomplish what your asking by using the new __init_subclass__ method. From the documentation on __init_subclass__:This method is called whenever the containing class is subclassed. cls is then the new subclass. If defined as a normal instance method, this method is implicitly converted to a class method.For a method that works with Python 3.5  and lower, you can use some Meta class magic:
@classmethod might be your best bet here.(also, don't use property because that's already a keyword in the language
