I'm using tqdm in Python to display console progress bars. I have a function from another library that occasionally writes to both stdout and stderr inside the tqdm loop. I cannot hack the source code of that function.While this doc shows how to redirect sys.stdout, it doesn't easily generalize to stderr because I can pass only one of stdout or stderr to the file= parameter in tqdm's __init__. Please refer to this question and its accepted answer for the minimal code that illustrates the problem.How do I redirect both stdout and stderr together?
Python provides some helpers for you in the standard libraries, look in contextlib:
