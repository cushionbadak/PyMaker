I'm a beginner in coding and my project now involves image classification. In the below code from the deep learning class, there is the function maybe_pickle but I don't know what does "pickle" do and how helpful it is though I have tried searching for some answers.
First check the official pickle documentation. It takes a Python object which can be serialized and turns it into a bytestream which you can save to disk (or the inverse, start from a file and turn this back into a Python object. This is often done if you want to save state between run or if you want to cache the result of long running operations (e.g. maybe_* like functions typically serve this purpose).
