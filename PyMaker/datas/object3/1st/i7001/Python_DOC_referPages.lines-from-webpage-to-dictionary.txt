Natural Text
I have used python for several different things, but I have never worked with webpages before so I am not exactly sure what to do. Basically I have a webpage where I want to find key words and then write the line that contains that key word to a dictionary. I really have no idea how to go about this. This is what I have so far. Any kind of guidance would be appreciated. 
I think the sentences are embedded in javascript within the html, so get the javascript text first, then use python's Regular Expression module, re, in a loop to find each keyword one at a time:Then you can access each sentence in the form dict[keyword] = sentence:note the empty entries:Hope this helps.
