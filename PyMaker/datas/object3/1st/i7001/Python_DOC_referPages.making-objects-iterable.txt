I'm trying to iterate over each row in a list of lists, append an element from each row to a new list, then find the unique elements in the new list.I understand that I can do this easily with a for loop. I'm trying a different route because I want to learn more about classes and functions.Here's an example of the list of lists. The first row is the header:Here's my code:I get the following error:I think the answer is to try to create a method using def __iter__(self) in my Dataset class, but I haven't been able to get this to work. Is this the right track? If not, what's a better one?
According to the documentation for __iter__:This method should return a new iterator object that can iterate over all the objects in the container.You might try the following class definition:If you're open to trying new options, consider using Pandas:Or, if you really want to read in the CSV yourself,
As you mentioned, you'll need to implement __iter__ in class Dataset. Note that this is actually the set(...) call that's throwing the error, since it iterates through your class to enumerate the set elements.Luckily your set elements are likely just Dataset.data, which makes this easy to write Dataset.__iter__.I would point out, however, that your the_set_maker function seems a little too specialized to be top-level. It's also a bit trivial, since it's literally set([el[3] for el in container]). I would put this in Dataset as well.
you need to change a little
