The data looks something like thisI would like the output as Source and Target that concatenate A,B as follows:Basically, what I would like to do is to calculate all the possible number of cases as concatenation by YYMM to view the relations between the two columns.At first, I thought about concatenating them through range i : max-i and then i+1 to max, but despite the values being an integer, I feel like I should use them as a string since the order matters.Is there a function available to manipulate the dataset as I want? Appreciate your suggestions.
Here is one option. We can use the combn function and the help with the tidyverse package.

Once you group your data by YYMM, you can use itertools.combinations for what you want: https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.combinations
