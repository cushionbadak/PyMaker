If i need to ask a condition on every element of a numpy.ndarray of integers, do I have to use a for loopor can I ask the question using [:] syntaxI know the previous is wrong, but is there any way of doing something similar?
You can use the all builtin function to accomplish what your asking:Example:Note however that behinds the scenes, all still uses a for loop. It's just implemented in C:EDIT: Given your most recent edits, what you probably want instead is to use a list comprehension with the ternary operator:Example:
Assuming a is your array, and you want to change values of a that are greater than 1 to be equal to 1:This works because the expression a > 1 creates a mask array, and when a mask array is used as an index (which it is here), the operation only applies on the True indices.
if you need not just check, but map all 0 --> 1, use map:
For testing a condition on every element of a numpy.ndarray at once, as the title could suggest:use numpy's np.all for that:Despite it is not lazy, np.all is vectorized and very fastFor testing a condition on every element of a numpy.ndarray iteratively:can be replaced by np.whereEDIT: precisions according to the OP's comments
