My question is if there's a way to take some values in a function that are not integrated in odeint.Exemple:  if I have a derivative dy(x)/dt = A*x+ln(x) and before to get this equation I computed A throught of a intermediate equation like A = B*D . I would like to take the A's value  during the process.More detailed (only exemple):Can I take A's values of function?The answer for Josh KarpelThe code is like that:# DerivativesThe real code is bigger than that. But, I would like to know if there is a way to store the values of f1 (enthalpy), f2 (specific volume), f3 (heat release) as a vector or tuple during the process of solution of odeint with the same size of p and T. 
It's not entirely clear what you want, but it sounds like you need to pass another value to the function you're integrating over. There are two options I can think of:scipy.integrate.odeint takes an args argument which contains extra arguments to be passed to the integrand function, which could then have signature y(t, A).You could use functools.partial to construct a new function which has the argument A for the integrand function y(t, A) already set.
