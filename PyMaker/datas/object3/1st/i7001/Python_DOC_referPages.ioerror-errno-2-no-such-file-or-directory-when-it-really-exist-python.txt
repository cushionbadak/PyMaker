This question already has an answer here:IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory Python                    1 answer                Python on Windows: IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory                    2 answers                IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory trying to open a file                    5 answers                I'm working on transfer folder of files via uart in python. Below you see simple function, but there is a problem because I get error like in title : IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '1.jpg' where 1.jpg is one of the files in test folder. So it is quite strange because program know file name which for it doesn't exist ?! What I'm doing wrong ?
You need to provide the actual full path of the files you want to open if they are not in your working directory :
os.listdir() just returns bare filenames, not fully qualified paths. These files (probably?) aren't in your current working directory, so the error message is correct -- the files don't exist in the place you're looking for them.Simple fix:
Yes, code raise Error because file which you are opening is not present at current location from where python code is running.os.listdir(path) returns list of names of files and folders from given location, not full path.use os.path.join() to create full path in for loop.e.g. Documentation:os.listdir(..)os.path.join(..)
