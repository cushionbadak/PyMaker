I'd like to join every 4th line together so I thought something like this would work: But line[i-1] and line[i-2] does not take current line -1 and -2 as I thought. So how can I access current line -1 and -2? 
The variable line contains only the line for the current iteration, so accessing line[i-1] will only give you one character within the current line. The other answer is probably the tersest way to put it but, building on your code, you could do something like this instead:
This should do as you requirelikewise you could also doExplanationThis will return every i'th element in a your_list with an offset of nThen you can combine this across a range(4) to generate for every 4 lines in a list such that you getThen the transposed_lines is required to transpose this array so that it becomes likeNow you can simple unpack and join each individual list elementExamplegives
