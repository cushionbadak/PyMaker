The OrderedDict (and dict as well) provide the method update to update multiple values at once.The most pythonic manner to do what you want to do is : It will keep the original order of your OrderedDict.
You could update your OrderedDict based on a new OrderedDict that's created fromkeys. The fromkeys method allows to give a default value for all the keys, so you don't need any explicit iteration here. And because it uses OrderedDicts fromkeys it will also keep the order of your indexes:Note that in case the OrderedDict were empty before the update you could also use:
