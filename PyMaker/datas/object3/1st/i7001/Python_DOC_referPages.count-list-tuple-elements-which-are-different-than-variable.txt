I have list or/and tuple:And I want to count elements in this which are different from 0.How to do that?
You could do a sum over a conditional generator expression which doesn't require any intermediate lists or unnecessary arithmetic operations:or as pointed out by @Jean-Fran√ßois Fabre:In case the MyVar only contains numbers this counts the number of not-zero values.
No need to generate lists, just:
Get the length of the sublist of all elements that are not 0
The following should work:It will convert the list to a list of booleans, with value True iff an element is nonzero. Then it'll sum all elements by implicitly considering True having value 1 and False having value 0.
You could try:
Try with filter():
Not nearly as efficient as any of the answers above, but simple and straight forward nonetheless 
With reduce from functools:
One line :) 
Using sum of iterator:
