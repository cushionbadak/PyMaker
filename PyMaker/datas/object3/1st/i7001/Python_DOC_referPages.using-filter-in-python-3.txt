I am pretty much copying from the example given in online docs, but using filter() in windows-based Python 3 is perplexing me.  What is wrong here:Traceback (most recent call last):        File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>      TypeError: 'list' object is not callableTraceback (most recent call last):        File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>      TypeError: 'list' object is not callableOnline docs say to throw list() in, but that clearly helps not.
First argument of filter must be a function or lambda. You passed b which is a list.
Filter's documentation clearly states that it takes a function and an iterable as input. Perhaps if you want to check if a value is in both a and b, you could do something like:and then loop over f.
You are misunderstanding how filter works, filter needs a function that returns True for each item that you want to keep.I'm assuming b describes the things in a you want to select, then you meant something like::You can also replace filter with a list comprehension:But there is a function in itertools that does exactly this:
Basically filter takes a function and an iterable value to filter inoutput:Confusion occurs when we call filter with NoneThe reason being When we pass filter condition as None filter function checks each value in the list and sees if they qualify the if value condition.Which roughly translates to this.
