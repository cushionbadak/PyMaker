You just need to use the object's uri property to get the actual path:The first part of your code doesn't work because pandas expects the data to be in the local file system, but you're using a GCS bucket, which is in Cloud.
%%gcs returns bytes objects. To read it use BytesIO from io (python 3)if your csv file is comma separated, no need to specify < sep = ',' > which is the defaultread more about io library and packages here: Core tools for working with streams
