How is the workflow of tearDownClass from unittest.TestCase? Is it called after each test method, or just in the end to "close the connection" of the test class?Its explanation wasn't clarifying for me: https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestCase.tearDown
It is called when you deallocate the class: in other words, when you finish with all of the test methods.  It's a direct cognate to the setUpClass  class method, but at the opposite end of execution.
