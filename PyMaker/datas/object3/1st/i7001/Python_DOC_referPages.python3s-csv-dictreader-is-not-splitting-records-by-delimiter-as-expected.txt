I am trying to read a TSV file using csv.DictReader, however, the reader is reporting wrong number of fields. When I looked inside, I found that it is not splitting delimiter properly (I confirmed with str.split(delimiter) and awk -F 'delim'. Output:Note: sample data is posted in a gist. Please download it if tabs are replaced by spaces here.
The difference between raw and csv parsing (and that's why I insisted to get the input data) is that csv module handles quoting by default.There are quotes in your data, and csv consider quote-protected fields as a single field. awk and str.split don't care.Just tell csv module not to consider quoting:doing this, I get all fields filled.
