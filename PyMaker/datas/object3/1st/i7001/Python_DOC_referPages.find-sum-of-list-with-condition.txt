I am stuck at a problem.I have a List L = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]I want to find the sum of elements in lists such that, if the sum exceeds's 25. I want to get the previous sum.for eg. 1+2+3+4+5+6+7=28, 28>25. Therefore i want a final variable sum as 21.i am doing it using for-if combination, but i don't want to use if . Is there a better way of doing this? below is my code.
I think what bothers you is the summ-=val part, not the if. And there is a one line solution with reduce.https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.reduce
You can use a while loop:
Using pandas, take the cumulative sum on a series consisting of the numbers in the list.  Assign the value NaN to any any cumulative sum over max_value.  Fill forward the result and convert back to a list of integers.
How about integrating the condition into the mathematical expression:
