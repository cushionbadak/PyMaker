If I want to check whether a directory is a python package, is it enough to check whether a directory contains a __init__.py file?
Before Python 3.3, only directories containing __init__.py files were considered packages (see regular package in Glossary).Since the addition of namespace packages in Python 3.3, every directory is a Python package, technically.
Based on the documentation:The __init__.py files are required to make Python treat the directories as containing packagesUpdateBased on the answer here:  Is __init__.py not required for packages in Python 3?You can see that it's no longer a requirement.
