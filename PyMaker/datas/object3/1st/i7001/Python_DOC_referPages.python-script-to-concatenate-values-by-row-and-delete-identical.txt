Natural Text
I am using python 2.7, and I have a text file that looks like this:I am trying to get an ouput that looks like this:Much appreciated!

The simplest solution would be to use collections.defaultdict and collections.OrderedDict. If you don't care about order you could also use sets instead of OrderedDict.Result:In case you want to write it to another file just concatenate what I printed with \n and write it to a file.
I think this could also work, although the other answer seems more sophisticated:You end up with a dictionary similar to what you requested.
