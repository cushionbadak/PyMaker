Natural Text
I have a .txt textfile with a list formatted like [' ok ', ' test ', ' help ']How can I read/import this textfile list into a python list?
You can use eval():However, eval() is usually not recommended, since it will evaluate any string you feed to it. That includes arbitrary code a malicious user might have put in the file. To avoid that, you should use literal_eval() instead:Unlike the regular eval() function, literal_eval() only evaluates strings that convert to basic python types (this includes lists and dictionaries, which  are what this is most commonly used for).
The easiest way is to use literal_eval
