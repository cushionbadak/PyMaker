Hi I'm using the following code to implement HTML test runner in my code:but getting the  following error:C:\Users\inswadhwa\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python36-32‌​\python.exe C:/Users/inswadhwa/PycharmProjects/automation/assertion.py Traceback (most recent call last): File "C:/Users/inswadhwa/PycharmProjects/automation/assertion.py"‌​, line 2, in  import HTMLTestRunner File "C:\Users\inswadhwa\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python36-3‌​2\lib\HTMLTestRunner‌​.py", line 97, in  import StringIO ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'StringIO' Process finished with exit code 1I have already imported StringIO.Can anyone please suggest a way to overcome the issue?
It looks like you're using this library, which appears not to have been updated to work with Python 3, where the old StringIO module has been replaced with the io.StringIO class.Try using html-testRunner instead. It should work with Python 3.
