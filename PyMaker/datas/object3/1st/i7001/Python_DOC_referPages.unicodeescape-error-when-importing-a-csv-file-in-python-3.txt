Natural Text
It's a very basic question but I've tried many things. My last code is:I am getting this error:What Should I do?Thanks
Backslash U (\U) has a special meaning in string literals. String and Bytes literals in the documentation says for \Uxxxxxxxx the meaning is „Character with 32-bit hex value xxxxxxxx“.So you have to escape at least the backslash before the U of Users, or put an r in front of the string so no backslash has a special meaning.
