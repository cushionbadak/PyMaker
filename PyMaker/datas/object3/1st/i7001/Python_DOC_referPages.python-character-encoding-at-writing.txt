Natural Text
I've just added Python3 interpreter to Sublime, and the following code stopped working:I get a following exception:I found this rather strange, because as far as I know Python3 is supposed to support utf-8 everywhere. What's more, the same exact code works with no problems on Python2.7. I've read about adding environmental variable PYTHONIOENCODING, but I tried it - to no avail (however, it appears it is not that easy to add an environmental variable in OS X Mavericks, so maybe I did something wrong with adding the variable? I modidified /etc/launchd.conf)
Python 3 decodes text files when reading. The default encoding is taken from locale.getpreferredencoding(False), which evidently for your setup returns 'ASCII'. See the open() function documenation:In text mode, if encoding is not specified the encoding used is platform dependent: locale.getpreferredencoding(False) is called to get the current locale encoding.Instead of relying on a system setting, you should open your text files using an explicit codec:where you set the encoding parameter to match the file you are reading.Python 3 supports UTF-8 as the default for source code.The same applies to writing to a writeable text file; data written will be encoded, and if you rely on the system encoding you are liable to get UnicodeEncodingError exceptions unless you explicitly set a suitable codec.You may want to read up on Python 3 and Unicode in the Unicode HOWTO, which explains both about source code encoding and reading and writing Unicode data.
"as far as I know Python3 is supposed to support utf-8 everywhere ..."Not true. I have python 3.6 and my default encoding is NOT utf-8. To change it to utf-8 in my code I use:as explained in Changing the “locale preferred encoding” in Python 3 in Windows
