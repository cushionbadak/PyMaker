I want to run a bash script from a python program. The script has a command like this:Normally I would run a subprocess call like:But that's not possible here because of the quoting signs. Any suggestions?Thanks!
Escape the ' marks with a \.i.e. For every: ', replace with: \'
While the question is answered already, I'll still jump in because I assume that you want to execute that bash script because you do not have the functionally equivalent Python code (which is lees than 40 lines basically, see below). Why do this instead the bash script? Your script now is able to run on any OS that has a Python interpreterThe functionality is a lot easier to read and understandIf you need anything special, it is always easier to adapt your own codeMore Pythonic :-)Please bear in mind that is (as your bash script) without any kind of error checking and the output file is a global variable, but that can be changed easily.
Triple quotes or triple double quotes ('''some string''' or """some other string""") are handy as well. See here (yeah, its python3 documentation, but it all works 100% in python2)
