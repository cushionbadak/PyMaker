Consider a list  variable  tNow consider a namedtuple 'Point':How do we convert the variable t to a Point?  The most obvious (to me anyways..) approach - of just providing the list as a constructor argument - does not work:
Use Point(*t) to expand the contents of t as arguments to the Point constructor.
More efficient solution: Use the special _make alternate constructor to directly construct the namedtuple from an arbitrary iterable without creating additional intermediate tuples (as star-unpacking to the main constructor requires). Runs faster, less memory churn:Despite the name, _make is part of the public API; it's named with a leading underscore to avoid conflicts with field names (which aren't allowed to begin with an underscore).
