Natural Text
It is a program that calculates a continuous uniform distribution. So for example I enter x^2, with a = 0, b = 1. The program would evaluate x^2 from  0 to 1. The coefficient 1/(b-a) is part of the rules of a continuous uniform distribution. It is telling me that it can't convert the formula from a string to a float. The problem is that the formula string has the variable 'x' in it. So even if I do float(formula) it gives me an error that it can't convert from string to float. Is there any way around this?
If I understand correctly, the user is able to input a formula using the variables a and b. So an example would be: formula = 'a*b', a = 3, b = 5, which would yield 15. Perhaps you could use the python exec(string) method to execute the code given in formula.
