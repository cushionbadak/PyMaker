Natural Text
This is how i applied dictionary for stemming. My dictionary (d) is imported and it's in this format now d={'nada.*':'nadas', 'mila.*':'milas'}I wrote this code to stemm tokens, but it runs TOO SLOW, so i stopped it before it finished. I guess it's problem because dict is large, and there is large number of tokens. So, how can i implement my stem dictionary, so that code can run normaly?I tried to find a method in nltk package to apply custom dict, but i didn't find it.Dictionary sample:post_text sample:
Notice that while the keys in your stem dict are regexes, they all start with a short string of some specific characters.  Let's say the minimum length of specific characters is 3.  Then, construct a dict like this:Of course, you should re.compile() all those patterns at the beginning.Then you can do a cheaper, three-character lookup in this dict:Now instead of checking all 500 stems, you only need to check the few that start with the right prefix.
