I would like to loop over three listsIf I wanted to loop over all possibilities, I could have done this:However, I want to loop in a certain manner. I want to iterate over 'A',1 and 'B',2 for all possible values of the last list. Thus I want to exclude the combinationsBasically I want to generate the following items.'A',1,3 'A',1,4 'B',2,3 B',2,4I am clueless on how to do it.
Because you want to keep 'a' tied together with 1, and 'b' with 2, you should zip the first two lists together. And because you want to iterate over 3 and 4 regardless of which choice you make in the first part, that should be a separate iteration, not part of the zip.
You could use itertools.product
