Natural Text
I am going to paste my entire code so that you can understand everything you need to know, even though I understand that you probably don't need it all. I am also going to warn you that I am very new to programming so I am probably very inefficient with my code and very messy and I apologize for that! If you see anything else I need to fix I would appreciate it.Summary of program goal: Read a file for a 3-letter word, ask me if the word is a 3-letter word for verification before inserting it into a text document with a list of its (known) 3-letter words. (In order to do that it needs to define each character of the 3-letter word found.(?))Error:I realize this problem will probably consume a decent amount of time to fix, so I understand if this takes some time to get resolved.
found your issue in this section of your code (towards the middle)in the for loop you keep setting L to 0 so only wdl[0][n] is setit never goes to wdl[1][n]
