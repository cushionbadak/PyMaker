In the server that work in (as do many other people) the "global" python has a certain version of a package, say 1.0.0.I recently used pip to upgrade that to 1.0.2 locally for my user with the pip install --user package==1.0.2, which worked. However, now I want to uninstall my locally installed version and remain with the global one.I've tried pip uninstall --user package==1.0.2, pip uninstall --user package, and a few other options but nothing seems to work. I always get this error:I also tried pip install --user package=1.0.0 but now I have both versions installed locally and python uses the most recent.How can I do what I want?
The --user option for pip seems to have been removed but is still an option with setuptools.So if you want to use the --user function what you can do is use pip download which will download the .whl file. You then need to extract the file using wheel unpack. I then ran python setup.py install --user (worked for numpy) and it installed the package to my home directory under .local.I followed the documentation here.
Apparently this cannot be done with pip directly. I ended up solving it just by removing the package from ~/.local/lib/python3.5/site-packages/. A bit more manual than I was hoping I'd have to do.
