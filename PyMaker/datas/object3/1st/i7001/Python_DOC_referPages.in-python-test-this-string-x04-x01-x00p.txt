I am working on a webserver access log analysis tool. Sometimes i get malformed requests hitting the web server. I want to be able to identify these. However when trying to test whether this string "\x04\x01\x00PÀcö60\x00" starts with \x0. Python reports no match.I am doing:What am i missing here? I tried regex as well, but no dice. :(I even tried to strip the slashes, but i cannot. What wizardry is this?
That's because if you'd look at the first character you'd actually see this:So the first character is represented by a hex value of 04 while you tested it with a value of 0.
The first character of the input string '\x04\x01\x00P\xC0c\xF660\x00' is '\x04' as the escape sequence has the format \xhh.'\\x0' in your example is actually a string composed of 3 characters: '\', 'x' and '0'. Compare:So the correct check would be t.startswith('\x04'):See the Literals documentation for more details.
You can use list comprehension to break the string up by \\:t contains:To access the first character, you will have to provide a hex character that is not 0, but 04:
