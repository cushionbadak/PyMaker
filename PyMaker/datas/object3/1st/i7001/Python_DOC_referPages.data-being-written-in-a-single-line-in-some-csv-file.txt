Natural Text
I have written some code to read data from a specific page of a "pdf" file and write it to a csv file using python. It does it's job only partially. However, when it comes to write data to a csv file, it writes those in a single line instead of the regular pattern. How should I modify my script to serve the purpose? Thanks in advance. Here is what I've tried so far:Data in pdf are like these:I'm getting data in csv output like:
For this Specific Code :as contents is a list of items[lines]Try this and let me know.
Suppose you have Or a representation of that string:If you split by \n, the line ending are no longer there:So if you print each line to a file in turn, you get one line:So you need to add the lines endings back when you write to the file: You should also either use a context manager (the with I used above) or close the file or you may only get a partial write. 
This is the solution I was after:As vintol was very close to what the output I was looking for, I'm gonna accept his solution as an answer.
