I've recently learned about typing module in Python (https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html) and expected to use it for static type checking and for better intellisense in VS Code, like it works with TypeScript, but I can't seem to find any tools/plugins that actually do that.What are my options, if any?
from bashinstall pluginthen install this in VSCodehttps://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=donjayamanne.pythonand configsettings./.vscode/settings.json  ./.vscode/launch.jsonOMG, this is Python 3 only!https://pypi.python.org/pypi/flake8-mypy/17.3.3 Yes, so is mypy. Relax, you can run Flake8 with all popular plugins  as a tool perfectly fine under Python 3.5+ even if you want to analyze  Python 2 code. This way you’ll be able to parse all of the new syntax  supported on Python 3 but also effectively all the Python 2 syntax at  the same time.  By making the code exclusively Python 3.5+, I’m able to focus on the  quality of the checks and re-use all the nice features of the new  releases (check out pathlib) instead of wasting cycles on Unicode  compatibility, etc.  IDE & Linter Integrationshttps://github.com/python/mypy#ide--linter-integrationsIDE & Linter IntegrationsMypy can be integrated into popular IDEs:Vim: vim-mypyEmacs: using Flycheck and Flycheck-mypySublime Text: SublimeLinter-contrib-mypyAtom: linter-mypyPyCharm: PyCharm integrates its own implementation of PEP 484.Mypy can also be integrated into Flake8 using flake8-mypy.
