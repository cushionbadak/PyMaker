This question already has an answer here:How to make a class JSON serializable                    25 answers                New to Python, trying to define a very simple class that will hold a few values, and then get it output into JSON notation.I was hoping to see something likebut instead get an error: "TypeError: <main.Multiple object at 0x0149A3F0> is not JSON serializable"
You can serialise the __dict__ attribute of m:You can also call vars:What to use and why:Use `__dict__` or `vars()`?For more complicated classes, consider the use of jsonpickle.jsonpickle is a Python library for serialization and deserialization  of complex Python objects to and from JSON. The standard Python  libraries for encoding Python into JSON, such as the stdlibâ€™s json,  simplejson, and demjson, can only handle Python primitives that have a  direct JSON equivalent (e.g. dicts, lists, strings, ints, etc.).  jsonpickle builds on top of these libraries and allows more complex  data structures to be serialized to JSON. Emphasis mine.
