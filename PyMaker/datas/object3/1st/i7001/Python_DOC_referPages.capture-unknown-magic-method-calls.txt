I have a class for which I would like to override a variety of methods such as __str__, __iter__ or len. However, the implementation of all of these methods are identical. For example, I might have something like this:My idea was to capture the methods or magic methods, and call them after performing do_something (in a type of wrapper function). Is there a way to do this? Or maybe there are alternative solutions?
If you really want to encapsulate all the "magic" methods, you could use a decorator and a metaclass.You would implement whatever functionality you need to impose on MyCustomObject's magic methods inside func_wrapper.What is a metaclass?What is @functools.wraps?
