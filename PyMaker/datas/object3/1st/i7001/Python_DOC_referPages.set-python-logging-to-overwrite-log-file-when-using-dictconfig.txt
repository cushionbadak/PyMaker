I'm using dictConfig() to configure my logging. I want the process to overwrite the specified log file every time the process is run. How do I do this?I see filemode as a setting in basicConfig() but I can't figure out where to put this in the dictConfig() configuration.I've tried this but get an unexpected keyword argument 'filemode' error. I've tried it in a few other places too. Python logging docs are confusing as hell!ANSWERThanks to @Vinay Sajip for his selected answer below. Here is my updated configuration that now overwrites the specified log file every time the process is run. I simply added LOGGING_CONFIG['handlers']['file']['mode'] = 'w'.
You need to use mode rather than filemode. In general, you need to use the argument names specified in the documentation for the handler initialisation - see here for FileHandler.
