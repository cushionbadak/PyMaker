I am attempting to make a program for the sake of self-knowledge. I want to ask the user what their name is, and I only want the user to be able to use letters from the alphabet to answer, or only strings. I do not want them to be able to answer with numbers, symbols, etc.
You can enforce this requirement using str.isalpha. From the documentation:Return true if all characters in the string are alphabetic and there is at least one character, false otherwise. Alphabetic characters are those characters defined in the Unicode character database as “Letter”, i.e., those with general category property being one of “Lm”, “Lt”, “Lu”, “Ll”, or “Lo”. Note that this is different from the “Alphabetic” property defined in the Unicode Standard.Here is an example program:Demo:Note this method will not work for people with hyphenated names such as "Anne-Marie".
I agree that this question is a little misleading. However, with what you have said, you just need to use a regex to accomplish this.
