I'd like to get a list of all of Pythons keywords as strings. It would also be rather nifty if I could do a similar thing for built in functions.Something like this :
You asked about statements, while showing keywords in your output example.If you're looking for keywords, they're all listed in the keyword module:From the keyword.kwlist doc:Sequence containing all the keywords defined for the interpreter. If any keywords are defined to only be active when particular __future__ statements are in effect, these will be included as well.
The built-in functions are in a module called __builtins__, so:
The closest approach I can think of is the following:The standard keyword module is generated automatically.  For other things related to Python parsing from Python, check the language services set of modules.Regarding listing the builtins I'm not clear if you're asking for items in the __builtin__ module or functions in that package that are implemented directly in the CPython interpreter:
>>> help()help> keywordsHere is a list of the Python keywords.  Enter any keyword to get more help.False               def                 if                  raiseNone                del                 import              returnTrue                elif                in                  tryand                 else                is                  whileas                  except              lambda              withassert              finally             nonlocal            yieldbreak               for                 not class               from                or continue            global              pass
Or you can import builtins:OR (this does not contain errors and stuff with __ beside them):
