i want to get some string, range from 0000 to 9999, that's to say, i want to print the following string:i tried to use print "\n".join([str(num) for num in range(0, 9999)]), but failed, i get the following number:i want python to add the prefix 0 automatically, making the number remain 4 bit digits all the time. can anyone give a hand to me? any help appreciated.
One way to get what you want is to use string formatting:So to do what you want, do this:
try this
http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#str.zfillReturn the numeric string left filled with zeros in a string of length  width. A sign prefix is handled correctly. The original string is  returned if width is less than or equal to len(s).E.g.:
Simply using str.rjust:Return the string right justified in a string of length width. Padding  is done using the specified fillchar (default is an ASCII space). The  original string is returned if width is less than or equal to len(s).
str.zfill also works:  print('\n'.join([str(num).zfill(4) for num in range(0, 10000)]))
another way to do that:or
