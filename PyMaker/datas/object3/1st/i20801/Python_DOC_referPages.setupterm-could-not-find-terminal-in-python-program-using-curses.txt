I am trying to get a simple curses script to run using Python (with PyCharm 2.0).This is my script:When I run this from my IDE (PyCharm 2) I get the following error:If I run the script from bash it will simply be stuck in the while loop not reacting to either pressing p or q.Any help would be appreciated.
You must set enviroment variables TERM and TERMINFO, like this:And, if you device have no this dir (/etc/terminfo), make it, and copy terminfo database.

Go to run/debug configuration(the one next to Pycharm run button). Sticking on Emulate Terminal In Output Console. Then you will be able to run your program with the run button.
I found this question when searching for examples because I am also learning to use curses so I don't know much about it. I know this works though:I also added the try: finally: to make sure I get the terminal to it's original appearance even if something simple goes wrong inside the loop.You have to use the addstr to make sure the text is going to be displayed inside the window.
