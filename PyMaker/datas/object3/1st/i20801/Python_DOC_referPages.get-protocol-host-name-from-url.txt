In my Django app, I need to get the host name from the referrer in request.META.get('HTTP_REFERER') along with its protocol so that from URLs like:https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=blah-blah-blah-blah#gid=1https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1234567/blah-blah-blah-blahhttp://www.example.comhttps://www.other-domain.com/whatever/blah/blah/?v1=0&v2=blah+blah ...I should get:https://docs.google.com/https://stackoverflow.com/http://www.example.comhttps://www.other-domain.com/I looked over other related questions and found about urlparse, but that didn't do the trick since
You should be able to do it with urlparse (docs: python2, python3):
https://github.com/john-kurkowski/tldextractThis is a more verbose version of urlparse.  It detects domains and subdomains for you.From their documentation:ExtractResult is a namedtuple, so it's simple to access the parts you want.
Python3 using urlsplit:
Pure string operations :):That's all, folks.

Here is a slightly improved version:OutputFiddle: https://pyfiddle.io/fiddle/23e4976e-88d2-4757-993e-532aa41b7bf0/?i=true
Is there anything wrong with pure string operations:If you prefer having a trailing slash appended, extend this script a bit like so:That can probably be optimized a bit ...
if you think your url is valid then this will work all the time
This is a bit obtuse, but uses urlparse in both directions:that odd ("",) * 4 bit is because urlparse expects a sequence of exactly len(urlparse.ParseResult._fields) = 6
If it contains less than 3 slashes thus you've it got and if not then we can find the occurrence between it:
You can use the urlparse from the urllib library:
I know it's an old question, but I too encountered it today.Solved this with an one-liner:
to get domain/hostname and Origin**Origin is used in XMLHttpRequest headers
