I want to find the position (or index) of the last occurrence of a certain substring in given inputted string str.For example, suppose the inputted string is str = 'hello' and the substring is target = 'l', then it should output 3.How can I do this?
Use .rfind():Also don't use str as variable name or you'll shadow the built-in str().
You can use rfind() or rindex() Python2 links: rfind() rindex()The difference is  when the substring is not found, rfind() returns -1 while rindex() raises an exception ValueError (Python2 link: ValueError).If you do not want to check the rfind() return code -1, you may prefer rindex() that will provide an understandable error message. Else you may search for minutes where the unexpected value -1 is coming from within your code...Example: Search of last newline character
Use the str.rindex method.
Try this:
The more_itertools library offers tools for finding indices of all characters or all substrings.GivenCodeCharactersNow there is the rlocate tool available:A complementary tool is locate:SubstringsThere is also a window_size parameter available for locating the leading item of several items:
If you don't wanna use rfind then this will do the trick/
Not trying to resurrect an inactive post, but since this hasn't been posted yet...(This is how I did it before finding this question)Explanation: When you're searching for the last occurrence, really you're searching for the first occurrence in the reversed string. Knowing this, I did s[::-1] (which returns a reversed string), and then indexed the target from there. Then I did len(s) - 1 - the index found because we want the index in the unreversed (i.e. original) string.Watch out, though! If target is more than one character, you probably won't find it in the reversed string. To fix this, use last_pos = len(s) - 1 - s[::-1].index(target[::-1]), which searches for a reversed version of target.
