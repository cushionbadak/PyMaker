The code above outputs [1], [2] or [3] can someone explain why the output has square brackets round it?
Because random.choices(population, weights=None, *, cum_weights=None, k=1) returns a list of k elements. In your case, since you didn't pass any value for k, the list has only an item.If you want to get a value, and not a list, you could use random.choice(seq), but in that case you could not pass a list of weights as with random.choices().
random.choices draws a list of values that you can specify with k=.. when calling it:You can print the single value you get by indexing into it using choices method of specifying probabilitiesor you can use random.choice() providing an iterable that reflects your propabilites:
