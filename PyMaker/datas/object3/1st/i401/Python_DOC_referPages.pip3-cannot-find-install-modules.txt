I'm trying to install packages in Python using pip3.  I've definitely managed to install these packages on other systems, so I know they exist.  But it's as if the pip3 repository I'm using doesn't contain then.  The packages are shelve and os.  The error I get is along the lines of:I'm using RHEL 7 if that makes any difference.
The project has one release in 2011 and the release doesn't have downloadable files. Not a useable project by all accounts.Do you mean shelve from the stdlib? You don't need to install it, it's always available, just import it.
you cal also use for example for install tkinter package :or you can use :
