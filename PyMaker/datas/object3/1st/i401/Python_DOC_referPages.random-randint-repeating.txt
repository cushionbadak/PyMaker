I have this game where you need to react with the 5 random emojis sent from a list. The problem is that sometimes random.randint() spits out the same emoji twice so its impossible react twice to the same message with the same emoji. Is there a better way of doing multiple random.randints?
Random numbers can, by definition, be repetitive as any call to randint is independent of the previous one. You can replace the following:with this:From the docs (emphasis mine):random.sample(population, k)Return a k length list of unique elements chosen from the population sequence or set.That being said, it is a better idea to refactor that part and switch to using a list instead of declaring 5 variables (it would've been messier if you needed 50, or 500).
