Hi there,I'm using python to script my program and I am reading data from a CSV file.1) I would like to check for the first 2 characters in each cell under the "Details" column.2) I would like to filter my data without cells containing "IP" for the first 2 characters.Following an example of the CSV fileThanks in advanced!
Here is a program that you might find helpful. Note how it iterates over the DictReader object and filters lines according to whether the Details field starts with IP.
You can use the CSV module to parse the contents of your CSV File.One of the example snippets in the official docs isFrom that, all you have to do really is do some string manipulation on row rather than just calling print() on it. If you need help with that, again the official docs should prove useful
