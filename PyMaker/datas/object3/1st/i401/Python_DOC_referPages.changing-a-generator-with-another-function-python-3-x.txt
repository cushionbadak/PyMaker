I want to change the behavior of the generator below so that it only yields even numbers. How can I do this? I'm aware that there simpler, clever ways to do this. This is a contrived HR challenge, where the The change_generator function that I wrote does not yield the desired output. I can only change change_generator.I cannot change  positive_integers_generator() nor the for loop below. Can I solve this with a decorator?
You can use the built in function filterOr a generator expression.Or itertools.count from the standard library:But if you only can change the change_generator function, the "correct answer" to the challenge probably involves using generator.send() 
You don't need the parens on generator in your loop, and you don't seem to be printing the output of the right generator.  Updated version that works for me:
In your very specific problem, if you can't change the print(n) part then you are pretty cornered because you can't change the instance of generator g that was created for positive_integers_generator().In what may be a frowned upon answer, in this particular case you might want to update the global g to be reassigned to a new generator after that:
