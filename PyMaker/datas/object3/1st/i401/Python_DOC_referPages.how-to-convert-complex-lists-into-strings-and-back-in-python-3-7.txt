I'm trying to save Python lists to a file and read them back again when I re-launch the program. The problem is my lists are complex: i.e. different amounts of tuples within tuples.The best I could come up with is turning my list into a string initially (which works) but there's no way I can think of to revert the changes.This works but how do I return this to a list?Just to clarify what my definition of a complex list is, here's an example:
As @snakecharmerb already mentioned you can use json or pickle. Here is an example:Code:Output:As you can see json converts tuples to lists.
str function will convert your complex list / nested lists and tuple to stringFurther, eval converts any string to an actual code snippetHowever as mentioned by Taras Savchyn, eval can lead to SQL injections and more. So instead use ast.literal_evalHence:Hope this solves your problem. You can comment the answer to ask any further queries
