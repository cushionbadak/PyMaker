Is there anyway to find the maximum numbers I can choose from a list of numbers and the sum should not exceed 15. Ex: A= [2,5,3,1,10,4,5,9], B=15 output: 5.I have tried this so far:
Sort the list. Loop through the list, sum up to current loopindex. If the result is greater then 15, return the previous index.Output:5
A similar approach to the answer by @J.D. But instead of calculating the sum every time, we could use a variable sum and add an element each time and check.

You could also extend on @J.D.'s method and use numpy. You could perform a cumulative sum of the array and then check if the sum to each element exceeds 15.returns:
