I am trying to break a line with \n with optparse. Example: line1 \n line2But when I type \n it doesn't break it just prints it as line1 \n line2, instead of  doing a break. Here is my code: If I just do a simple print statment with \n then it will break the line, why doesn't it do it when using optparse?
option1, use real new line in your input:option2, eval \n as real new line with ast.literal_eval:note this may raise an exception for ill-formed input.
