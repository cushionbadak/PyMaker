I have a Scheduler class and a test written for __generate_potential_weeks using unittestmain.pytest_scheduler.pyWhen I try to test __generate_potential_weeks, I get the following errorQuestionsWhy can't the test find __generate_potential_weeksHow can I test __generate_potential_weeks? It has some complex logic I would like to test separately from Scheduler
Double underscore has a special meaning within python. The name will be mangled to avoid a conflicting name in a subclass.If that wasn't your intent, I'd encourage you to mark it with a single underscore. If it was, you can still access the function by using the mangled name. I think this will work for you: sch._Scheduler__generate_potential_weeks(4)
