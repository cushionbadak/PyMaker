I want to use a for loop to define a range and I would like to use a while loop to check a condition for every value inside this for loop and give me the results for different values of c, but unfortunately, my algorithm doesn't work and I don't know what my mistake is.The result I am looking for is it puts different values of c inside the while loop and calculate j and check if it is bigger than 5 or not. if yes, it appends it to jl. Totally, I want to define a range with for loop with index and also check each value of this range inside while loop and get the results for j.so expected results are j with values smaller than 5 (c[a]+2<5) and store the values of j in jl
There is one problem in your code: "While loop" never runs because his condition is j>5. Correct that and tell us if it works. 
Please double check if the following suggested solution covers all of your requirements. In any case I think List Comprehensions (e.g.  compare section 5.1.3.) can help you.Will result in the following output:If you want to do more complex data manipulation, you can also do this with the help of functions, e.g. like:
Your algorithm doesn't work becauseis an infinite loop for j = 0, a = 0.What you probably wanted to write was:Still, the list comprehension version in the other answer does exactly the same, but better.
