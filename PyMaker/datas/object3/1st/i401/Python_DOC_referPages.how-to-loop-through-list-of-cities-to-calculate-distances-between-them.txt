I'm working on a brain teaser where I want to calculate all of the possible distances between 4 cities. I wrote a function where you can input the x and y coordinates of the two cities and it'll calculate the distance between them.While I can individually call the function 6 times,that seems inefficient if the data set gets bigger. I think I should be using nested "for loops" but I can't figure out a way to properly increment the inner loop.  My initial idea was to create a list of object and use that in inner loop. 
Use itertools.combinations() like:Code:Test Code:Results:
