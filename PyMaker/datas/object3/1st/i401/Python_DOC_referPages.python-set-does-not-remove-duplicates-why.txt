I create manually a set to remove duplicates:The set has 41 elements.I show the 41 elements:The result:You can see "Innova Ediciones" appears twice. Why?You can see "√Ångeles Editores" appears twice. Why?You can see "University of Dayton Publishing" appears twice. Why?You can see "Editorial Santillana" appears twice. Why?With the 41 elements I create a second set:The second set has 36 elements and finally removes the three duplicated elements.Why?How can I avoid this situation?Thank you in advance.
As @jonrsharpe pointed out, you have trailing spaces after some of your entries and therefore the entries appear duplicated when you print them, but in fact, they are different.
@jonrsharpe Thank you for your support.An improved version to avoid whitespaces at the beginning and the end:A further enhacement: remove double space inside element.
As others mentioned, your initial set doesn't have duplicates. The string with extra space at the end is different from the string without that space.You asked how to avoid this.While creating your initial set, if you are iterating over strings to add to a list, then use the python function strip()For exampleI used the # at the end to show the space. strip() removes any spaces and newline characters on both sides of the string. If you want a specific character removed, you can pass it to the function (like strip(" ")).Your second set returned the results you needed probably because your copy and paste removed the extra space at the end of those strings somehow.When adding items to a set from an iterable, to avoid these extra spaces at the end, I usually do this.I hope this helps.
when you use {} you are defined a dict. You can do this:
