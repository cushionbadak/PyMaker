This question already has an answer here:If loop: “x not in” vs. “not x in” [duplicate]                    5 answers                Which is faster?
They are exactly the same, and thus take the same amount of time. not in is just syntactic sugar. Using the dis module, we can see that both result in the same bytecode:Even adding parentheses as not (x in y) does not change that, unless, of course, you add more to the parentheses:Tested with both, Python 3.6.7 and 2.7.15.
It's exactly the same, there is no difference at all. The standard operator is in fact not in (see the docs), the not 7 in form will get automatically transformed to 7 not in.So the recommended way is if 7 not in [5, 6, 7], that's a straight use of the operator and also has improved readability.
