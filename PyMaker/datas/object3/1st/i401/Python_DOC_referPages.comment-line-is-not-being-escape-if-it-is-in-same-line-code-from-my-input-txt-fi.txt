Natural Text
I have lines containing comments marked by // in my input.txt file:Input FileHere line 3 is being skipped, but line 2 is not.My CodeThe same code rewritten as a reusable function:Both snippets produce the same result. I've tried many times to open with different mode and string but without lstrip, it doesn't work.
you should write your code like this:updateif you want to check more complex comment i suggest the code below:and you can put middle part in while like this so it removes all the comments in line:
str.startswith checks exactly what its name implies: whether a string starts with the requested prefix it not. No amount of stripping leading whitespace with lstrip is going to magically expose comments starting in the middle of a line.A better option would be str.find, which returns the index of the comment on the line.
you can check if '//' is in your line and just keep the text that appear before '//'
