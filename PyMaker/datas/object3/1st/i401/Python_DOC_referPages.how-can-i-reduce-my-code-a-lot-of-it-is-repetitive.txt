The code creates a random addition problem and spits out "Congratulations" if correct and "sorry...." if the inputted value is wrong. The while loop repeats this process until the user inserts "N" for the question "continue (Y/N):, at the same time it keeps track of how many questions have been answered, and which ones are correct. The code works fine, my problem is it has repetitive code. I was wondering if there is a way to shrink it.  **I appreciate everyone one's help and advice. I"m a noob that's just learning python  **  
A first start, would be eliminating the code before the while, by initializing the count variable (which keeps track of the turns), in zero, and allowing the while loop to run the first turn, we just need to have a variable like want_to_play and by default it's True, so the first time we'll be playing, and at the end of the game If I don't input Y or y it will asume I don't want to play any more and set the variable to false, that way I can have all the turns ran by the while loop. and you'll be getting something like this.: 
By initializing the variable c as "Y", the condition is met and the loop can be executed:I also added the method upper() to the Y/N input so the user can also type it in lowercase
Try to move as much of the processing as possible into the loop.  The first "paragraph" of your code was basically a duplicate of the main-loop.  By creating the continuation variable c so that it drops straight into the loop, most of that first block could be removed.The two formula printing statements can also be reduced to a single one:could beThe variable sum could be removed, but it does make the code self-documenting, which is a good thing.
