Natural Text
I am very new in coding in Python, and there is an issue I have been trying to solve for some hours:I have 1600+ xml files (0000.xml, 0001.xml, etc) need to be parsed in order to do a text mining project.But an error has occurred, when I have the following code:The error message is the following:where did I make mistakes? Also, I want to only extract the text from one element of each xml files, is it sufficient that I simply attach this line to the code? and moreover, how can I save each of the results to txt files?Thank you very much!
The right way to create path elements is using join:  Add print messages to the code before you try and create the tree.  Is the XML you try parse valid?Once you solve the parsing issue you can use multiprocessing in order to parse many files at the same time.
