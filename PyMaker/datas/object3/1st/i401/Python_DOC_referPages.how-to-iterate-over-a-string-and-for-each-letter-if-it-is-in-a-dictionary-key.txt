What would I write to iterate over a string and for each letter, if that letter is in a given dictionary (as a key), then add that key's value to an empty list?For example the string 'cat', I want to search a given dictionary for c, a, and t. Then for each value of each letter, add them to a new list that is a sum of points (values).I keep getting: TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not iterableHere's what I have so far:
Here's a one liner:sum([values_dict[letter] for letter in user_word.upper()])
I suggest you to use  sum([values_dict.get(letter, 0) for letter in user_word.upper()])This will avoid error if the key is not found.
The TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not iterable is due to line for key, value in values_dict.items:.dict.items is a function and not an iterable. To access the actual values, use the parenthesis to iter over the key and values: for key, value in values_dict.items():
Here is your code corrected : 
You can use the operator itemgetter(). Itâ€˜s faster than a list comprehension:
