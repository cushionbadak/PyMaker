My problem - and I don't know why there is a keyword continue, which should leave the value of 3 and go further. In fact, I have a loop that is infinite - that is, it crashes the program.
It looks like you are trying to iterate through the list until you find a 3 then break. Do something like this:The keyword continue will pass to the next iteration of the loop, where break will stop the loop.
The continue keyword continues with the next iteration of the loop.In your case, it prevents the statement i+=1 to be executed.Here is what happens:Loops through 0,1,2 just fineWhen it evaluates tab[i] = 3 it proceeds with the next iteration of the loop and i+=1 is never executed, hence i remains 3 and never gets incremented. It keeps doing this forever. If you want to exit the loop, you can use the break statement instead of continue.For more information, you can read on the continue keyword here: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html
You're using the continue keyword, but I think you want break.  Your code is running forever because i never iterates past 3. Once i == 4, it enters your if statement and continues the loop. Since it continues, it never iterates after that.
Because you are using the continue keyword that skips the rest of the code.Once i reaches 3, it skips over the i+=1 command.  It appears that you want to use the keyword break.  You could also do:
