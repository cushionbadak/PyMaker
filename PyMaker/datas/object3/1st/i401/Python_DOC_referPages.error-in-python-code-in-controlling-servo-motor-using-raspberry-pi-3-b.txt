I am currently building an automated trash bin using Raspberry Pi 3 B+ with Android application support where I would use a servo motor as an actuator for the lid and the Android application as a form of wireless remote control. Everything went on smoothly until I've encountered a problem that whenever I attempt to press a button on my Android application, the Python shell program has errors during testing.

However, as someone who is still new to Python, I'm afraid that I still don't have the knowledge to apply this on the code.Here is the code that was used in the video:I have already changed the text strings that used the ' ' format into the (" ") format since it also produced some errors in the code which I corrected immediately.Any help will be greatly appreciated and thank you in advance! 
Here's a Python3 version, edited a tiny bit for better clarity and good practice:To show you the code in action, I have hosted a local server on my machine and connected to it using Putty. Here are the commands I have entered:Here is the output of the server (I have swapped the Servo-related functions to print statements):
