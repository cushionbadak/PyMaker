Natural Text
I Need to replace a XML file with values from a second file.The problem is that for some reason my xml file is completely cleared, all data is erased.The data should be preserved except if it finds the ${key} on the XML file then it should only replace it with the ${value}
Without knowing much context into your overall program, I noticed that you did not close the file.  Sometimes it appears as if nothing has been written, it's becuase it's all stuck in the buffer and has not been written, so use file_write.close() or better yet, use with open(filename, "w") to avoid this in the future.
Manipulate an XML file as Text is a hard task.May you can use a library for that.This sample can guide you for a better approach.
The reason the file is erased is because you reopen it in write mode. When you do so the file is truncated (cleared). See the open() description. It's possible to append to the file, but is not what you want.I think an XML parser (as suggested in @andercurzbr answer) is the best solution. But if you whish to use your code, you could use fileinput module, which allows to quickly loop over the lines of a file. This is an example of your script edited to use fileinput. It's not tested, but should give you the idea.Note that when using the inplace=True option the output is redirected to the file itself. From the docs:if the keyword argument inplace=True is passed to fileinput.input() or  to the FileInput constructor, the file is moved to a backup file and  standard output is directed to the input file (if a file of the same  name as the backup file already exists, it will be replaced silently).  This makes it possible to write a filter that rewrites its input file  in place.This means that print() functions called after the call to fileinput.input(home+file_xml, inplace=True) write to the file. The unedited lines have to be printed too, otherwise they are lost, that is why I added the two elses.
