I have a simple function that creates a set for faster lookups. The function will be used a lot. Now, it also takes time to create a set, but this set is fixed for the lifetime of the program; should I lift its creation so that it is only created once, or can I expect Python to know to do as much without my interference? Example: Is it ok to write the function below, or should the definition of drop_chars be lifted outside the function so that it's only executed once?NotesYes, I know I should use str.translate instead for this example. It's a placeholder to show the use of the constant set.I am asking about the latest and greatest version of Python. Historical versions may differ, that's ok.
CPython doesn't use constants when function calls are involved, because you can always override set to point to a different function. Python 3.2 started supporting LOAD_CONST when a  set literal is used in in conditions, but still not for assignments.If you only want to create the set once, you can turn it to a default argument and use frozenset instead to prevent unwanted mutations.
