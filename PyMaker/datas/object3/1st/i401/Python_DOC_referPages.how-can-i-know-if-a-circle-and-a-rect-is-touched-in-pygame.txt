There is a circle and a rect moving on the surface in my program. I want to know if a circle and a rect is touched to each other. It had to be very accurate. I'm sorry for not explaining its detail, but I hope you understood.
Consider a axis aligned rectangle is given by a top left origin and a width and a height:And a circle is given by a center point and a radius:If you want to test if this both shapes are intersecting, then n order to catch all possible cases 2 tests have to be carried out.First it has to be tested if the center point of the circle is inside the rectangle. This can be done by pygame.Rect.collidepoint with ease:Furthermore it has to be tested if any corner point of the rectangle is inside the circle. This is the case if the distance between a corner point and the center point of the circle is less than is or equal the radius of the circle. A point can be represented by pygame.math.Vector2 and the distance between 2 points can be get by pygame.math.Vector2.distance_to():  A function which combines both tests may look like this:
