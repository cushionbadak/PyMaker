I have the following timestamp 1550588656 which translates to 2019-02-19 15:04:16+00:00 in UTC time convention.I want to convert it to my country's time convention (UTC or GMT -3 in this time of the year) so it should translate to 2019-02-19 12:04:16+00:00I have read on other SO questions that first I have to convert the timestamp to an UTC aware Datetime object and then localize it, I'm doing it like thisSo now it's not a naive Datetime object, from here I should be able to localize it to my country's timezone. In Python that is pytz.timezone('America/Santiago')So it should go something like thisBut I'm getting 2019-02-19 09:04:16-03:00 (UTC or GTM -6 ) as a result and I don't know why. Can someone explain? My intuition tells me it's probably a simple thing I'm not looking at, but I've spent some minutes in it and I haven't been able to tell yet.
If you look at the documentation for fromtimestamp:Return the local date and time corresponding to the POSIX timestampSo the problem is that it is already doing a conversion from UTC to the local time, and you're doing it a second time.
First of all you have epoc time (UTC timestamp). You need to convert it into datetime object (native) which is followed by converting native time to aware time and than finally convert it to your local time.Convert your timestamp to native datetime objectnative_datetime = datetime.fromtimestamp(1550588656)convert native datetime object to aware time (add timezone info, will add timezone info to native timezone UTC for current)localising aware datetime to your local datetimelocal_time = utc_time.astimezone(pytz.timezone("America/Santiago"))You can replace "America/Santiago" with your local time zoneI think this would help you to solve your problem. Thanks!
