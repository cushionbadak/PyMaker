i'm a newcomer to python, and i would like to try moving from one file to another, like looping through fileA then fileB indefinitely. However, when i tried to use the import function, the files only import each other once, then stop. is there a way to import the whole file multiple times?FileA:FileB:So, there was no problem moving from fileA to fileB, but after moving from fileB to fileA, i couldn't "import" fileB anymore. Is the "import" function being used wrongly here?Thanks.
The solution is to put the code that you want to re-use in functions, then you can call the functions repeatedly do do what you want.For example:A.pyB.py
Define a function in fileA and fileB. Use these files with their function to import in your module and create a loop which calls each other. But, this is not a good way to go for.
You should use def() to do this. so for file a your code would beYou should then put your function for file a and b in the same python file and run using fileA() and fileB(). All in one python file.If you want to call it from another python file you will have to do import filea.py and then run filea.fileA()
Rather than writing your code directly in the .py file, each file should define a function (using the def keyword). Then you can import the functions from those files and call them one after another, in a loop.That said, if you really want to re-import the module (instead of just reusing the existing module object, which the import statement does), you can use importlib.reload.
