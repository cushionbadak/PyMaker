This question already has an answer here:Split a generator into chunks without pre-walking it                    10 answers                How do you split a list into evenly sized chunks?                    57 answers                im facing this question, and I was hoping some of you might help out:Write a function that accepts an iterable and a positive number n. The function returns a new iterator that gives values from the original in tuples of length n. Pad missing values with 'None' if needed for the very last tuple.for example:for x in bunch_together(range(10),3): print(x)return values are(0, 1, 2)(3, 4, 5)(6, 7, 8)(9, None, None)This is what I come up with so far:but this obviously doesn't work because I didnt accounted for the range at all(the output as of now looks something like this:I could either create a generator of build an iterator (as in building a class composed of init iter and next)Thanks for the help! 
Try initializing tuple inside for loopOutput
