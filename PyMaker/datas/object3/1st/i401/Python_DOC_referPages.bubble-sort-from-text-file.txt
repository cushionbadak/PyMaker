Natural Text
I have a .txt file with first names, last names, and addresses. I would like to use bubble sort to arrange the list alphabetically by the last name. I have some idea of what to do but I am ultimately lost.
There is a crucial error in the program, you're using f.read() which reads the whole file in a string, and from here anything doesn't make any sense. To read it as a list of strings (where each string is a line), use f.readlines() (check [Python 3]: Methods of File Objects for more details).Then, you're comparing the entire strings (so your sorting is done mainly on the first name which is the 1st part of each string). To sort on the last name (which is the 2nd part), you have to:Split each string on "," (to get its parts)Do the comparison on the 2nd part (index 1), which is the last nameLastly, your outer loop is a for (which involves a fixed number (N) of steps):I didn't spent time thinking whether it's enough for any list (what's the maximum amount of times a list needs to be traversed, in order to perform all the swaps). Anyway, if it isn't, you might end up with the list not being sortedThe other end: if only the last 2 values in the list need to be swapped (and thus, traversing the list once would be enough), you're still traversing it N timesConsidering the above, I switched to while which traverses the list until the last traversal didn't perform any swap (meaning that it's already sorted)Below is just the sorting part extracted (and modified) from your code. Note that because everything is for demo purposes only:There's no error checkingThere are ways to improve it performance-wise, but they are out of the current scopecode.py:Output:
