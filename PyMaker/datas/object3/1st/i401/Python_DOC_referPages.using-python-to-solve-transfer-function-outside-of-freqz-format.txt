I can't get the function into scipy freqz form so I tried to solve directly in python, but can't convert the complex to a float variable. Wrong implementation?Gives the following error:
You are probably using the exp function from the math module, which as stated in the math module documentationThese functions cannot be used with complex numbers; use the functions of the same name from the cmath module if you require support for complex numbers.So, as suggested you could use cmath.exp instead. This would take care of your current error arising during the evaluation of exp(j*w0). Unfortunately, with your posted code you will then get another error trying to compute the quantity exp(j*w) since cmath.exp does not support array arguments (neither does math.exp by the way). To resolve that second error you could create an array and evaluate the exponential on each array element, one at a time with a loop.However, since you are already using numpy, it would just be a whole lot simpler to just use numpy.exp.Also adjusting T and w computations to span the whole spectrum, you should get the following:As a side note, the corresponding computation with scipy.freqz would look like:
