I'm not sure where my error is but here's the code where i got the error from index = plottest(doc):
As said by @Robin Zigmond in a comment, you are trying to call a list, as you would call a function, using the (...) syntax. The following:Is different from:The latter doesn't work because [1,2,3] is not callable. The Python documentation enumerates callable types:User-defined functionsInstance methodsGenerator functionsCoroutine functionsAsynchronous generator functionsBuilt-in functionsBuilt-in methodsClassesClass Instances: Instances of arbitrary classes can be made callable by defining a __call__() method in their class.A list (ie a list instance) is none of them, since the list class does not have a __call__() method:In your example, the first lines states that plottest is an iterable. The error shows it is a list. And you try to call it with index = plottest(doc). My guess is that you want to get the index of doc in plottest. To achieve this in Python, you can write:Hope it helps!
