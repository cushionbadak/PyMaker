I have following block of code: But I get always error which says: AttributeError: 'HwSwitch' object has no attribute 'channel'. It seems that problem is somewhere at self.channel.send(cmd + '\r\n') but I cannot see where. Is there something wrong (maybe indentation?). Thanks
You are accessing 'channel' as an instance variable, either create it in the __init__ or call _create_channel before calling _send_cmd_to_channel.Also refer this
