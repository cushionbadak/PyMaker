I want to repeatedly run 2 python script every 10 seconds from another script.I have a python file with the following statement:-test1.pytest2.pymain codeThe result I get is as followsI actually want it to print asand so on every 10 second.I tried using os.system('test1.py') but it opens the file in pycharm. Im using jupyter notebook.also tried subprocess call.
Either use runpy.run_path or subprocess.check_call to run the file as a script:ororPut the file's payload to be executed into a function, import the module once and invoke the function repeatedly:test1.py:main code:The main difference is that in the first case, test1.py will be executed as standalone code (i.e. you cannot pass variables to it) and will be read and parsed each time (in the case of subprocess, a new Python process will also be spawned each time). While in the 2nd case, it will be read once and as a module (i.e. you can pass arguments to test1.main()).
The easiest way is to define functions in those .py files. Change test.py1 to:And change test2.py to:Than change your main code to:
