Lets say i have variables a,b,c,d,e,f.. every time 2 of the 6 variables will have value = 0 randomly. So my code is like this So the coding will be very long, are there any other approach ?
You can put all numbers into a list and then feed a list comp of that list into the run function - ignoring elements that are 0:Output:run( *[1,2,3]) is the same as run(1,2,3)0 is Falsy - so *[x for x in d if x] for a d=[0,1,2,3,0] does only use non falsy values of x in d: *[1,2,3]truth value testingyou can exchange the list comp run(*[x for x in d if x]) against a generator comp if you like run(*(x for x in d if x)) to avoid the list creation (not that it matters here ;) )@Mehrdad Dowlatabadi raised an interesting side question - if any other of the params is 0 you get an error due to a mismatch between function parameters and provided parameters from the list comprehension - you can negate that by defining defaults:So if you feed [0,1,2,0,0,0] into it it will still run.
If you want to run a function with the variables that aren't set to 0 you can first make a list of elements that are'nt 0then call the function with elements list as argumentsAs a one liner : 
Make run take a list:then use the filter function:filter(None, lst) removes all fals-y elements.
