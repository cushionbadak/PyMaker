I want to only print all the "words" that start with "/watch" from the string, and then add all the '/watch...' to a list. Thanks in advance!Output:Maybe I can use something like .remove or .replace, don't know what to do so I appreciate all help.
you  can do the following
yea re is definitely overkill here.  this is a perfect use case for filterjust be aware it returns a generator, so wrap it in list if you want the list.http://book.pythontips.com/en/latest/map_filter.html is good if you want more information on functions that do this kind of data cleaning.  If you need to get really fancy with your data cleaning look into using pandas.  It has a steep learning curve, but it's fantastic for complicated data cleaning.
This should help you find all the /watch links. You can collect all the URLs in a list and proceed. Good Luck!!
Looking at your code, a simple if statement with str.startswith() should suffice to get what you want. Assuming the links['href'] contains a str, then:Note: .startswith() will only work if /watch is really at the start of the href; you could also try if '/watch' in href:, which will match if that string appears anywhere in href.
