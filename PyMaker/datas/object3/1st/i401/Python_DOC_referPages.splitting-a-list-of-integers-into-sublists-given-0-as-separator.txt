I have this list of integers:and I would have to generate the following list, by splitting the above list using consecutive zeros as a separator, in order to get:
You could use itertools.groupby in order to group the elements in the list that appear between 0s: Details The key argument here key = lambda x: x != 0 is transforming the list so that it is instead grouped by:Note that that groupby groups consecutive values that are equal.So this key will yield the following values as a result of the groupby:Now we only have to specify that we want to keep the values if the key is not 0, which can be done by adding if k != 0 at the end of the list comprehension.Helpful reads:List comprehensionsitertools.groupby
Python has an amazing feature we can use for that called slicing.i think this approach is easier than other answer that uses itertools.groupby.code:result:alternative using list comprehension instead of map built-in func:explanation:the zip() function take iterables (like: list, string, dict), or user-defined iterables and returns an iterator of tuples based on the iterable object.the map() function takes two arguments, The first argument is the name of a function and the second a sequence (e.g. a list) seq. map() applies a function to all the elements of the sequence.we use it here to apply list built-in function to all tuples results from zip function.with help of slicing, we give zip function two iterables made from your list, one start from first item with increment of two, and other start from the second item, with also increment set to two.explaining slicing used here: l[::2]   Lists have a default bit of functionality when slicing. If there is no  value before the first colon, it means to start at the beginning index  of the list. If there isn't a value after the first colon, it means to  go all the way to the end of the list. That last colon tells Python  that we'd like to choose our slicing increment. By default, Python  sets this increment to 1, but that extra colon at the end of the  numbers allows us to specify what we want it to be.slicing tutorial:linkpython zip function docs:linkpython map function docs:linkpython list comprehension docs:link
