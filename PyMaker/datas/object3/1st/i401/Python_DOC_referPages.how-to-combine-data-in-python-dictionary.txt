I have a python dictionary like I want output like I am using that in Django view so if any Django function or python concept can work please let me know.Thanks.
Try something like the following! First of all, create a dictionary to keep as key the orderproduct_id, appending every orderproduct_quantity and orderbatch_id (both as a dictionary to a list). Then, just convert the dictionary to a list of dictionaries using a compression list, where the key will be the orderproduct_id and the value, the batches.
You can use itertools:EditedEdited to:Sort list to use groupby safely.Exclude key on inner list.New code:Explanation You are grouping by orderproduct_id. Then, the natural way is to use groupby function. When another developer see groupby in few seconds he/she understand that the code is grouping elements.Also, my approach uses list comprehension because you are creating new list/dictionaries from another iterables.
You can aggregate your items by orderproduct_id is separated dict:Then make a new list out of aggregated dict items:
