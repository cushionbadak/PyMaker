I am writing a script that can do multiple things, depending on the arguments passed into the command line. For example:I only want 1 argument in the commandline. So, only one of -a,-b,-c,-d would be accepted, and then the code will execute based on whichever argument was passed.I can do this by a series of if statements, likeetc. Is there a better way to approach this?For each command line option (-a,-b,-c,-d), I would like to have some arguments passed in. These arguments would be specific and would vary depending on the initial command line option. For example:I considered using nargs, but I was not sure how to make each argument was in the correct order andthe argument that is needed. In the above example, assuming the number of extra optional arguments would be 3, I want to make sure that all the arguments start with the letter a.How could I approach this?
You can define mutually exclusive options using add_mutually_exclusive_group():Regarding the second part you can specify nargs and a custom type. The type can simply be a function that takes the string of the argument:Regarding the order of the arguments passed to option apple AFAIK you have to check it afterswards:Anyway in your case you probably want to use subparsers instead of options.
