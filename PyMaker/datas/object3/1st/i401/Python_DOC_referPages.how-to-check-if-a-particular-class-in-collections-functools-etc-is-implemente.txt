Natural Text
I know that many parts of stdlib are implemented in C, e.g. collections.OrderedDict. Is there a quick way to check if a particular class in collections (functools, etc) is implemented in C? I would expect such implementations to be faster than pure Python.
In the Python docs (https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html for functools) you can click the link besides "Source Code" (https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.7/Lib/functools.py for functools) and track whatever you want down from there. It's all on the git
