I have a structure of the form:I want to collapse the innermost layers of the lists such that I get the following structure:I have tried to flatten the list by doing:But this collapses all layers instead to a one dimensional list.What is the most pythonic way to address this?
You need to flatten the elements of lst, not lst itself.So use the double loop list comprehension inside another list comprehension, where the outer comprehension iterates over your top-level list:Since your inner-most lists each only contain a single element, you could also use indexing to get those values:Demo:
You need to iterate over sublists and index them to get desired output (but this assumes your inner list holds only one element):Optionally, you can use chain.from_iterable from itertools (Now this handles any number of elements in inner lists):
