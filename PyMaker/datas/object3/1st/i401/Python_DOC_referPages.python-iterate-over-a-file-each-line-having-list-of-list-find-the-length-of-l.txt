I am having a file containing every line as list of lists. I want to read each line from the file and find the length of list and get the count of same number of list. Input in the file.datOutput: I tried to read the file with numpy array and find the length. But I donâ€™t know how to read the file line by line and find the length iteratively. Is there any way to do it?
Suppose each line of the data file has the list in correct format, i.e. one '[' at the start of each line and one ']' at the end; plus each list in a line also use '[' and ']' correctly, then a simpler solution is just count the number of '[' in each line (and decrease by 1) to determine the number of lists in that line.Below is my code basing on above assumption:Output:
This example would work, using ast literal_eval (much safer than a simple eval) and Counter to count the lines with a given length.Output:length of list 1 = 3  length of list 2 = 2  length of list 3 = 3  length of list 4 = 1  number of list with length 3 = 2  number of list with length 2 = 1  number of list with length 1 = 1
Output:
