I hope I can explain my idea clearly enough so you can help me figure it out.LetÂ´s say I click start and the program starts "recording" mouse events, then I click and create a point, click somewhere else and create another point, when the second point is created a line is drawn connecting those two points, and so on until I create the last point I desire and click STOP, and then I get in return the length of the lines combined.How hard is it to accomplish this in Python? There are libraries that can help me implement something like this? Is there a way to do this without the points at all? Just click and then click again and a line is drawn and so on?
There's no additional library needed. You can simply bind <Button-1> to an event and calculate distance by using event.x and event.y.
