I am trying to read the frames using imageio API. I have a reader as an object which I have received using imageio.get_reader(video_path,"ffmpeg")Traceback:Initially, the nframe was a float value then I tried to convert it into an integer but then I am getting an OverflowError.I will appreciate your advice on this. Thank you. 
In Python, float type can be infinity. To fixe your bug, you check if the value is inf ou -inf before convert to int:As @ShadowRanger noted, this solution just prevent the OverflowError error. You should investigate on the reader to fix the problem of infinite float. 
According to the new 2019 update 2.5.0 version from imageio : "The reader of the ffmpeg plugin now always reports inf as the number of frames. Use reader.count_frames() to get the actual number, or estimate it from the fps and duration in the meta data."imageio update
