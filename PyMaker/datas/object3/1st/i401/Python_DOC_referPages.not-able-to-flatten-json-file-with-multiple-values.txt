I have a json file which I am trying to flatten. The function works properly if there is only one message in the json file, however when there are multiple messages i get the following error:JSON file sampleMy code:I am trying to parse the entire JSON file and load all the data into the dataframe so that I can start using it for analysis purpose. If I have just one message in the file, then the code works correctly and outputs rather a very wide table with lots of columns.If I have multiple message in the JSON file i get the error that I have attache d above. I looked at many solutions in stackoverflow but they dont seem to Is there a easier way to read and flatten the JSON file. I tried using the pandas's json_normalize but it only flattens level 1.
You can do it like this. Lets assume that j is the complete json object.Your JSON however is not valid since you are missing a , to separate the two objects.
If you only have one message in the file, the file is a valid json, but if you have more (as you placed them), the json is no longer valid ([JSON]: Introducing JSON). Example:For more details, check [Python 3]: json - JSON encoder and decoderThe simplest way to have a valid json consisting of multiple messages:All of them should be enclosed in square brackets ("[", "]")Every consecutive 2 should be separated by comma (",")Just as in the "locations" sub messages' case.
