I have a list of Arrays:[ ['ALC', '10.0', 240001], ['ALC','2401', 240010] ]How do I get the entire second array entry when I have the string '2401'
This should work:Filter filters out an item based on boolean criteria you provide. So here the critera we are providing is 2401 in x.The x in lambda, represents one element of the list your provided as an argument. The list provided is tests, (at the right-end of the lambda function).Here are some more examples of filterhttp://book.pythontips.com/en/latest/map_filter.htmlHere is the documentation:https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#filter

You can use a simple list comprehension to get a list of matches:filtered_data contains [['ALC', '2401', 240010]].If there are multiple matches:filtered_data will contain [['ALC', '2401', 240010], ['ALC', '2401', 240011], ['ALC', '2401', 240012]].
A generator approach, also capable to find more than one match:Test:
You just need to iterate over the main list and then use the in operator to check if the "term" you are looking for is inside of the "sub-list"
