Is it a way in Python (2.7 preferably) to compress a file in several equally-sized .zip files??The result would be something like: (lets assume 200MB selected and compressing a file of 1100MB)
I think you can do it in shell command. Somthing likeand you can execute shell from python.RegardsGanesh J
NB: This is based on assumption that the result is just a chopped up ZIP file without any extra headers or anything.If you check the docs, ZipFile can be passed a file-like object to use for the I/O. Hence, we should be able to give it our own object which implements the necessary subset of the protocol, and which splits the output into multiple files.As it turns out, we only need to implement 3 functions:tell() -- just return number of bytes written so farwrite(str) -- write to file until max capacity, once full open a new file, repeat until all data writtenflush() -- flush the currently open filePrototype ScriptTrace OutputDirectory ListingValidation
