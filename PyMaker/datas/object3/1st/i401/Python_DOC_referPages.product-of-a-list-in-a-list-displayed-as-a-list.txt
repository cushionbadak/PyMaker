Input Parameter: takes a list of lists of numbers [[x1, x2, x3, ..., xn],[y1, y2, y3, ..., ym],...]Returns: a single list of numbers where each element is product of the inner list at that position, [x1*x2*x3*...*xn, y1*y2*y3*...*ym, ...]Cannot use append operator or other built in functions.I don't know how to exactly approach this. This is what I have so far:I haven't been able to find anything about it online. And I am not supposed to use any built in functions such as numpy or list operators. Just have loops and conversions like list() as shown above.
One approach could be to use a list comprehension, and functools.reduce to multiply all elements in the sublists, where you can multiply all elements in the sublist with operator.mulFor a solution with no imports, you could do:
You can use the reduce method in order to get the result of a list multiplication. And use list comprehension to loop through the lists.
Try this:
You could do simply:Giving an output:
simple solution , without use of external library and list operations
