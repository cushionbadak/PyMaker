Suppose you have a label which increments in multiple spots:For example, 1-A-1.Suppose the third spot can increment up to 10 times (1-A-10), after which, A will become B: 1-B-1. Then, this process repeats until 1-Z-10, and after that is incremented, you have 2-A-1.How can I write a generic function that will generate a list which has all combinations from 1-A-1 to 10-Z-10?
This looks like a perfect use case for itertools.productproduct(as, bs, cs, ds, ...) creates a generator that produces values akin to a multiple-level-deep for loop:so to use this, you can either cast directly to list:or loop over labels
