I'm running an operation on a pandas dataframe that fills in some missing data using a public geo-data api.The get_geo_data_from_api() function does all the work, fetching and parsing the data, but after a while I get a response 429 from the api:This is all the info displayed but a response 429 is usually sent with a "Retry-after" header with the number of seconds until it can receive requests again.How can I get the full error instead of just a descriptive sentence?Is it possible?
