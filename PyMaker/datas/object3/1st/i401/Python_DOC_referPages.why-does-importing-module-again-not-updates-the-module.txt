I was going through a tutorial on exception handling and had to write this piece of code in module called exception.pythen from the REPL i import this function asand do   convert(7.7)which returned the NameError: name 'prnit' is not defined as expected.After which I corrected typo and did from exception import convert again. But the error remained. Why didn't it import new module?I had to exit() then REPL and import it again then it worked fine and as expected.
Imports are cached in Python, you can read about it in the official documentation.There are ways to invalidate the import cache, but it's strongly discouraged.
Pretty easy: the modules are cached, see the Python documentation on the topic (5.3.1).
