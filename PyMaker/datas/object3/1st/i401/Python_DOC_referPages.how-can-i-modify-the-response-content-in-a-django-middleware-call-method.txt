I'm trying to remove all blank lines in xml response by processing it in a middleware as suggested in this example: https://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/StripWhitespaceMiddlewareNow the problem is that in Django 2.1 that code is no more current since Dajngo 1.10 the way the Middleware works change quite a bit.Now I see that the response.content is of type bytes and so no straightforward editable with regex.What is the correct way to do this in Django 1.10+?  
As your said, response.content is a bytes so all arguments in the regex have to by of type byte, including the replacement string.From the documentation:Both patterns and strings to be searched can be Unicode strings (str)  as well as 8-bit strings (bytes). However, Unicode strings and 8-bit  strings cannot be mixed: that is, you cannot match a Unicode string  with a byte pattern or vice-versa; similarly, when asking for a  substitution, the replacement string must be of the same type as both  the pattern and the search string.
