I want to multiply a tuple.Expected output:My code is:But it causes an error that the dict has no attribute 'extend'.
This should do the trick:Or alternatively (as Alex Hall suggested in the comment below) you could use the zip function like this:I would suggest using one of the above instead of your original approach. But for future reference, the reason you are getting the error dict has no attribute 'extend' is that extend() is a method for lists, not for dictionaries. When you attempt to call res.extend() it is throwing this exception because res is a dict, not a list. If you want to add multiple key/value pairs to a dict, use the update() method.
You can use the function starmap() with the operator mul inside a dictcomp:Alternatively you can use numpy.multiply():
We can do like follow
