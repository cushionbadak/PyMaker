I am writing a code that handles Python AST nodes, that should be compatible for both Python 2 and Python 3.However, Python 3 has ast.Try, where Python 2 has ast.TryFinally and ast.TryExcept, so I need to use visit_ aliases to handle both cases.If I write my node visitor code using compatibility aliases, like the following, my pre-commit mypy check will complain when using Python 2, that error: Name 'ast.Try' is not defined:If I instead use ast.TryFinally in the type hint, it will instead complain error: Name 'ast.TryFinally' is not defined if I run it in Python 3. I know that I can use a more general type for the node, but that makes me writing a lot of # type: ignore in the code which I don't want.How can I resolve this issue?
Mypy knows how to handle Python version checks, and you could use conditional type aliases to pick the right type for the right Python version:You can further save yourself the runtime cost of the if sys.version_info tests by placing that code in a if TYPE_CHECKING: test.As a side note: if you are handling ast.Try in Python 3 to track both finally: and except ...: components of the try statement, you want to handle both ast.TryFinally and ast.TryExcept in Python 2, as before Python 2.5, you could only use try...finally or try...except in one statement.
I was thinking that you could make the script using this codesys.version.startswith() checks for the version of Python.
