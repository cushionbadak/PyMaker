Natural Text
I have a data frame created from a CSV file and I need help to filter on the data frame based on the inputs from configuration file (it can be text or CSV). The config file will contain the column name on which I have to filter and the values or condition on which I have to filter. I have the following code so far my config text file looks like, my dataframe has a column named I am getting 'Type Error' : series object is not callableI am looking for any approach where I can pass filter conditions from a config file to a Python program
Looks basically OK. The error you're getting is due to the line filter_col = row('Target_Column'), where you are using parentheses () instead of brackets []Other issues:pd.Series.isin expects a list, but you're providing it a single value. You can just replace those first three lines with df = df.loc[df[row['Target_Column']] == row['Filter']]This also lets you avoid making a variable called filter, since that overwrites a python builtin and you should avoid that.
