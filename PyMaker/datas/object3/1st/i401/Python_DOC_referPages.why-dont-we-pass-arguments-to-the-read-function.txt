Passing the file as an argument and storing to an object reference seems very straightforward and easy to understand for the open() function, however the read () function does not take the argument in, and is using the format file.read() instead. Why does the read function not take in the file as arguments, such as read(in_file), and why is it not included in the Python Standard Library of built-in functions?I've checked the list of built in functions in the standard library: https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open
It's not included there because it's not a function, it's a method of the object that's exposing a file-oriented API, which is, in this case, in_file.
Because you have file reference by in_file = open(from_file) so when you do in_file.read() you are calling the read on the reference itself which is equivalent of self it means the object in this case file object
