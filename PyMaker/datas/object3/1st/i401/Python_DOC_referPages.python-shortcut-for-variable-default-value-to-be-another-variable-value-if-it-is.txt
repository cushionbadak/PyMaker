This question already has an answer here:Is there a way to set a default parameter equal to another parameter value?                    4 answers                I have the following function declaration:Is there a python shortcut, where type is equal with 'name' value(default r passed) if is None ?
The usual idiom is:(But don't actually use type as a variable name, it'll mask the built in function as described here: Is it safe to use the python word "type" in my code?)
