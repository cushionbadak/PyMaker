Given an input:and a regex:This will successfully print say hi.However, switching the last part to an optional group:now doesn't print anything.  It's not the regex doesn't match it at all, because result isn't None.Why is it that it works when the regex is not optional, but stops working when it is optional, and how would I go about solving it?

regex.search() will find first match substring. You can use regex.findall() in this case.regex.search() docs said:If there is more than one match, only the first occurrence of the match will be returnedBecause /[/*] optional, it has no constraint to match / character. So it can even match first space, it can match any part.You can check this regular expression online in regex101. you can find its process and results.
In the above example, ?P<command>.*? use the non-greedy qualifiers *?, +?, ??, or {m,n}?, which match as little text as possible. See Greedy versus Non-Greedy for more detailsAnd since the (/[/*])? is optional, the command group could be match nothing.If you want to regex a line without comment, use the followingto match
