I'm consuming an API and the info from it would be something like this:But, in some records, it doesn't contain the geolocation field, so I have to check if geolocation exists inside my code.I was trying to use hasattr to do this trick, but I think I'm doing something wrong.Here is the part of my code:My thought here is that it will check if in the position of index i exist something inside geolocation. If there is something, then it returns true and enter inside the condition, else the var will receive 0.0.So, am I doing something wrong? Is this the right way to use hasattr? 
It's simpler than that:hasattr is useful for checking if an object has an attribute. This is a more specific case, you just need to check if a key is in a dictionary.A minor complaint: i is a confusing name for a dictionary, at first sight I thought that was an index. Better rename it to something meaningful!
You could use the dict.get method that allows to supply a default value that will be returned if the key does not exist, e.g. like:
You could use a try except clause:
hasattr is usually using for an object.In your case, the best way to check if a key exists in a dictionaryit's to do something like that
You can use get and set the default values for lat and lng if they doesn't exist.
