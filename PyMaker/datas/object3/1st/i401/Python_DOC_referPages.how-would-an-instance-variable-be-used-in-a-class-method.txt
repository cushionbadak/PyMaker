Is there a way that in a class methods I can use an instance variable to perform a calculation?Very simplified, this is what I am attempting to do:
all I want is to declare a variable 'a', then use it in a class method for calculation purposes.If you want to cache a class-wide value, these are your basic options:Set value explicitly:Set value at class init:Set value at first instance init:
If you want the namespacing use @staticmethod instead and let users pass in the variables e.g. Test.calculate(a, b)
