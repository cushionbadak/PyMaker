There are a few things you can do to neaten this up.Firstly, print('') can be achieved by adding a '\n' to the end of the previous print statement.Secondly, the spaces for indentation can be achieved by using '\t'Thirdly, you can break the repeated sections into for loops.If you are using Python 3, you can utilise f-strings for syntactically neater formatting.https://medium.com/@NirantK/best-of-python3-6-f-strings-41f9154983e
