I am working with Visual Studio 2015 and .NET framework 4.7.2. I have set up a simple test program that executes an external program in C#. The program is a Python script that simply prints some string to stdout every 0.5 seconds. I want to read the stdout of this sub process in my C# application.The program basically works, but I get the output of the Python script only shortly before the sub process exits. What do I need to change in order to get a more responsive behavior, i.e. getting the output every 0.5 second as soon as the Python script writes it to stdout?Here's my C# code:Here's my Python script:UPDATE: I uploaded the mini project here.
The print function takes a flush argument which controls whether buffered output is flushed.The default value of flush is False, meaning flushing is controlled by whatever file print is writing to (for example, sys.stdout).  Set flush to True to force immediate printing.
