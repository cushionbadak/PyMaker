I have this tuple of dictionaries and am trying to get the count of all the distinct keys. I am only able to do this so that all the keys are counted. The output here should be 7 but I am getting 9 because c and e are being counted twice.I have this so far:
The view returned by keys() already acts like a set. So if you take the union (or_) of all the key sets from your dicts, you get the set of all keys. The length of that set is the number of unique keys.

sets are definitely the data structure you want here. There are a few different ways you can accumulate the set:ororIn all cases, len(new) will be the number of unique keys.
