I have pandas like belowActually i want to compare the time so i want to change to time col to second unit or millisecond unithow can I do it in pandas?i am thinking can I strptime ?Thanks
Use for seconds list comprehension with converting to int if no NaNs values:Another solution is split values with expand=True for DataFrame and process it:And for miliseconds multiple by 1000:
You can use datetime.timedelta to perform this calculation for you. For convenience, you can wrap this in a function and apply via pd.Series.apply.
