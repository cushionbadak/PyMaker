The dict() constructor accepts an iterable with key, value pairs and cursor.fetchall() produces exactly that, so all you need to do is just instantiate a dict with the returned result:
Sould do it as fetchall return a list of tuples and the tuples have the values in order.
You can try like this , Your result object will be like list of tuples or lists, since you want to two return two values you can try dict comprehension :
Something like this should do the trick:Obviously, you have to select the right indices yourself when accessing the row tuple.
