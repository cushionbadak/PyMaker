I am trying to write some data out into a unicode XML file with the following statement:...but am getting the following error:I have seen this given as an accepted answer on here to a question, but that was for Python 3xx. Is the syntax slightly different for version 2?Thanks
Yes, the syntax is different for Python2 - regarding the encoding argument.  Python2 open description:  Python3 open description:As you can see, in Python 2.7 open doesn't accept the encoding argument, hence the Type Error.  However you can use the built-in io module to open your files.  This would allow you to specify the encoding, and also provide compatibility with Python3. For example,   Note that you don't have to explicitly close your files when using the the with statement.
