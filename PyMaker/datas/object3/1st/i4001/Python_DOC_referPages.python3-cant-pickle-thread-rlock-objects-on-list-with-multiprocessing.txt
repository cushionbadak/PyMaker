I'm trying to parse the websites that contain car's properties(154 kinds of properties). I have a huge list(name is liste_test) that consist of 280.000 used car announcement URL.When I start my code like that:It works and getting results. But approximately in 1 hour, I could only obtain 1500 URL's properties. It is very slow, and I must use multiprocessing.I found a result on here with multiprocessing. Then I applied to my code, but unfortunately, it is not working.And it gives:I found some kind of responses with respects to this error. But none of them works(at least I can't apply to my code).Also, I tried python multiprocess Pool but unfortunately it stucks on jupyter notebook and seems this code works infinitely.
Late answer, but since this question turns up when searching on Google: multiprocessing sends the data to the worker processes via a multiprocessing.Queue, which requires all data/objects sent to be picklable.In your code, you try to pass header and engine, whose implementations you don't show. (Since header holds the HTTP request header, I suspect that engine is the issue here.) To solve your issue, you either have to make engine picklable, or only instantiate engine within the worker process.
