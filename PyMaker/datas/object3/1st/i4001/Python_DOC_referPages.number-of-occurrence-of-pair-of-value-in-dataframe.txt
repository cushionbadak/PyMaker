For performance implications of the below solutions, see Pandas groupby.size vs series.value_counts vs collections.Counter with multiple series. They are presented below with best performance first.GroupBy.sizeYou can create a series of counts with (Name, Surname) tuple indices using GroupBy.size:By sorting these values, we can easily extract the most common:value_countsAnother way is to construct a series of tuples, then apply pd.Series.value_counts:The result will be a series of counts indexed by Name-Surname combinations, sorted from most common to least.collections.CounterIf you wish to create a dictionary of (name, surname): counts entries, you can do so via collections.Counter:Counter has useful methods such as most_common, which you can use to extract your result.
Seems like a good use case for the performant Counter:
