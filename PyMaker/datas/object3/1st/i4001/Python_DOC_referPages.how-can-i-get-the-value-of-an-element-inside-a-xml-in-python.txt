Natural Text
I want to read that xml with that program or something alike but I cant get the information inside the titles and the price and stuff, i need to print the information of the bookstore first, then the information of every book and then the information of the authors.Any help will be apreciated Thank you.
There are a lot of nodes in an xml document. For instance, with title is not childNodes[0]. That one is a text node with the newline and spaces between <book> and <title>. You need to search child nodes for the title element and the easiest way to do that is with getElementsByTagName. Once you get the right element, there may be multiple nodes holding text. You need to enumerate all of them to find the text you want. You also need to decide which bits of white space around a node can be stripped or you risk having odd gaps in your output.One reason to move to ElementTree or lxml is that they tend to tidy this up and give you an easier API.You also need to be careful where you call getElementsByTagName. When you did listaAutores = arbol_dom.getElementsByTagName("author"); you got all of the authors in the document, when you really just wanted the author for a given book. As an aside, get rid of the extra semicolons at the end of the line. They are unneeded and drive python programmers nuts!As another aside, print adds spaces and converts objects to strings. Just use its functionality instead of string concatenation so that your code has a consistent look and feel.
I would suggest using xmltodict.The output would look like this:You can install it with pip.pip install xmltodictThen you can access all the information in a standard dict.
