I'm new to python and I can't figure out a way to do this so I'm asking for someone to helpI have URL like this https://abc.xyz/f/b/go_cc_Jpterxvid_avi_mp4 and I want to remove the last part go_cc_Jpterxvid_avi_mp4 of URL and also change /f/ with /d/ so I can get the URL to be like this https://abc.xyz/d/b/b it change regular I have tried use somthing like this didn't work newurl = oldurl.replace('/f/','/d/').rsplit("/", 1)[0])
What you had almost worked.  The change is to remove the trailing right paren ) at the end of your assignment to newurl.  The following works in both Python 2 and 3:Edit:  there are much better solutions as Sumner Evans pointed out in your question's comments; perhaps try his library suggestion once you get this working.  In addition, the re library can be used for text substitution once you learn about regular expressions.
Late answer, but you can use re.sub to replace "/f/.+" with "/d/b", i.e.:Regex Demo and Explanation
You can apply re.sub twice:Output:
exmaple input:'https://abc.xyz/f/b/go_cc_Jpterxvid_avi_mp4'and output:['https://abc.xyz/d']
