This question already has an answer here:compare current item to next item in a python list [duplicate]                    1 answer                Iterate a list as pair (current, next) in Python                    8 answers                pretty simple question I guess, sorry I'm pretty new to Python.So I have a given list and want to iterate through it.I want to compare every item in the list to the upcoming one.Unfortunately it does not work for me.(As an example, for the first step I would want to have 45 compared to 24)
A quick rewrite: 

I assume 1) you want to compare consecutive elements by the code segment given. 2) You want to print the actual value rather than the index.You need to add range(len(values)-1) so that you i would be the index rather than the value at the position.
