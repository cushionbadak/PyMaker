When I execute the following code on Python console using the below statement,for the code below, each result appears just once. But, if I remove else and remove the associated indentation of the code below it, I receive each result twice. Why does it happen?
From docs:The big difference between yield and a return statement is that on reaching a yield the generator’s state of execution is suspended and local variables are preserved. On the next call to the generator’s __next__() method, the function will resume executing.So this happens because if body doesn't break execution, so it moves forward to the next yield statement and with else clause reaches end of function and implicitly returns.CheckandAs we can see without else execution will continue and call counter with step equal to -1.So you can leave else or refactor your if clause and add return statement into it to explicitly finish execution likeFurther readingGenerators.return and yield statements.
Because you are yielding twice, if there is no else loop.
