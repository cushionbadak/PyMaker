I wonder how to check if two lists of numbers are the same except exactly 2 numbers
If order of list elements is important, you can use something like this:If order is not important, and repeated elements do not matter, you could also use set intersection (&) and compare length:If order is not important, but repeated elements matter, use the same approach, but with collections.Counter:
Example
This will make accommodations for duplicate values, order is not taken into account.
