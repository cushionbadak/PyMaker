The following While loop obtains a randomly generated number and compares it to a user generated number. If the first guess is correct, tit allows the user to use to the name they entered in another module. If however the first guess is incorrect, but the second guess is, it is supposed to output a hardcoded name. If the second guess is incorrect, it should inform the user that all guesses were incorrect and that they do not have superpowers. The problem is I can get the program to work for the if and else statements but not the elif. Please help.
You don't need to break out of an if/elif/else conditional. These are NOT loops. elif and else will only run if the elif and if conditions above them fail. All you are doing with your break statements is breaking out of your while loop. 
Your else clause doesn't make sense to be where it is. It's syntactically valid, but logically doesn't make sense. What you've written is:You want the logic for "tell the user they've failed" to only trigger after the while loop ends, since the while loop is enforcing the "do it three times" thing.
You're iterating over a limited number of tries. I feel it's more natural to convert this into a search-style for: We can go a step further and iterate over the messages instead:I noticed the getUserGuess calls didn't actually change g. You'll probably want to reconsider that (this revision changes r too, which is likely also not what you want). This would explain why you never see the second success message; you entered a second guess but the program checked the first guess again. 
Thanks to @ytpillai for the solution. With a slight modification to limit the number of guesses to 3. Regardless of whether guess 3 is correct or not the user is to get the same message.
