Natural Text
I am trying to read the contents of a .txt file. Contained within the file is  a URLs list.  I need to open each of the URLs with urllib. I get the error shown below. Can someone explain me how to fix it?
Extract the urls from the text file first. Then use urllib to access each url.You can find details of reading and writing files from the official documentation.Here for simplicity, I assume you want to store the retrieved data in a listNow you can print the lines of each retrieved url if you want to.
