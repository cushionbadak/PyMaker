I am executing an external executable from python using the subprocess module. And every time i am sending the input to the executable using the communicate( ) method of subprocess. Apparently i want execute the same exe for thousands to hundreds of thousands of times for my project. What's the fastest or best way to do this  I want to send input to it and not worry about output . I want to execute it many times and the input keeps changing every time.
Consider using coroutines from the asyncio library with the create_subprocess_exec function.
