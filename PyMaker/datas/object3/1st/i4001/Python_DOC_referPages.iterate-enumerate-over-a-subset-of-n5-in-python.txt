Natural Text
I have a subset of ℕ5, five dimensional vectors whose elements lie in the natural numbers. This subset is defined as the product of intervals [a1, a2]×[b1, b2]×...×[f1, f2], and I would like to enumerate the subsets of size 1, that is the vectors (x1, x2, x3, x4, x5) where x1 is in [a1, a2], x2 is in [b1, b2] etc. What is the best way to do this?
This is the cartesian product and you can use itertools.product to compute it:output
