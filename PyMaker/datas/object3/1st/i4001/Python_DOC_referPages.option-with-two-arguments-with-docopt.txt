I want to have an option that takes two arguments. I.e. would like to be able to useOr what I really want is:But I don't know how to do it? (In fact I fear that it might not be possible...)What I don't want, but which is closeI know how to have a repeating option (see below), but that is really not what I want here.Could be called with
This can be easily archived with docopt.Syntax: Usage: ./foo [--path <src> <dst>]...Input: ./foo --path src1 dst1 --path src2 dst2Code:Result:And now do something with it:To add a multiple positional arguments, require path option and arguments to be in the correct order with parens "( )".Attention: docopt doesn't raise a SystemExit in case the user mixes up the syntax and inputs ./foo arg --path src dst if you use options with multiple arguments like that. You will have to handle it yourself or add another (sub)command in front of it.
This is not possible to accomplish with docopt.The owner of the project gives the following reason:Because in invocation like prog --foo bar baz qux there's no way for a person to tell if it means prog --foo=bar baz qux or prog --foo=bar,baz qux or prog --foo=bar,baz,qux.which I think is pretty reasonable.I would suggest using two options instead, maybe --from and --to, or --old-path and --new-path.Alternatively, you could use argparse instead, and set the nargs option (e.g. nargs=2).
you can use click libhttp://click.pocoo.org/5/options/
