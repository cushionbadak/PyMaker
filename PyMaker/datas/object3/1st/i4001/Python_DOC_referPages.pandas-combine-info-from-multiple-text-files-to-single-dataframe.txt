Natural Text
I have multiple text (.txt) files saved in a folder.  I'm trying to combine them all into a single dataframe.  So far I have been able to combine them, but not in the manner I'd like.The text files (named yob####.txt where #### is a year) have information that looks like this:I'm trying to open each file, add the year to the end of the row, and move on.This almost works...except it takes each file and puts the data in a column, the next file in a second column, next file in a third, etc.Current output:The expected output is the same, except when it opens the 1881 file, it adds the info to the end of 1880. Then 1882 goes after the 1881 data, etc. etc.
With read_table, the default separator is assumed to be whitespace (sep='\t'). Change read_table to read_csv, which infers your separator. Alternatively, specify sep=',' for the same effect.You're trying to add a new column year, but you're not doing that correctly. You can use assign to add it inConcatenate vertically (axis=0, the default), not horizontally.
You can use pd.DataFrame.assign to add a column seamlessly while you iterate.Note also that it is good practice to use os.path.basename instead of splitting by specific characters: this will ensure your code will work on multiple platforms.Updated: Add header=None and use pd.read_csv, as discussed on other answer.A more efficient way is to use a list comprehension:
