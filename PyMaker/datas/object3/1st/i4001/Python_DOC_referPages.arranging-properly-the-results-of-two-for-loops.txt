So as you'll see from the code below, I'm scraping some info with Scrapy. Everything works fine, I'm just not happy the way the scraped data is stored. With the current code, I get results as a column of 'X' and a column of 'Y' side by side (which is fine), but the results for 'U' show up as a row as it is run from a 2nd loop. So what I would like, is to have the scraped data in three columns side by side: X / Y / U. Can anyone help with this? Thanks in advance!
You can use itertools.zip_longest to zip both results together and yield them based on their Truth value *.*  itertools.zip_longest(*iterables, fillvalue=None):Make an iterator that aggregates elements from each of the iterables. If the iterables are of uneven length, missing values are filled-in with fillvalue. Iteration continues until the longest iterable is exhausted.
