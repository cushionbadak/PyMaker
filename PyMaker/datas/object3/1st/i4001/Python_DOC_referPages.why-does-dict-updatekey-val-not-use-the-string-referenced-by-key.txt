As the title suggests, I am trying to update a dictionary using the update() method like in the following code blockIf my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2} I would expect the result to be that new_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2} (assuming of course that new_dict is already defined). However, when executed, I instead get new_dict = {'key': 2}.What am I doing wrong?
Keyword arguments always use the fixed identifier as the key. Use keyword expansion instead.Or if new_dict really is a dict, just pass the dict itself.
Here is a code for the update method, so you can see why it behaves the way it does (it is not the real source code, just an example):So if you call new_dict.update(key=val) your kwargs will be equal to {"key": value}. You need to pass your arguments inside a dictionary if you want to dinamically set the new keys. 
update uses keyword arguments to update dictionary, or dictionary or iterable of pairs. You can just pass your dictionary as the first argument:update designed to work with several keys at once. If you just want to set single value, you can just set the value:
