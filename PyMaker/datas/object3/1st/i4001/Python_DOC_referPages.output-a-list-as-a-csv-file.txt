You can write it in a new file, by opening a new file with write permissions. 
You can use csv.writer to write a entire row each time, make a list with your elements in this case. and use on the method writerow from csv.writer. Frist of all you import module csv and then you construct a object writer object, with the dialect that you want in the csv like the quotting char, the separator char, with this object you can pass a list to it and he will automatically write the row on the file to you. Example from documentation is bellow.https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.writer
