I am currently working on an exam project in python, where I have to make a choropleth map that shows all the different countries in the world, and what their populations are. I get my data from an api and store that data in 2 different lists, let's call them a and b.a contains values looking like this:and b:I want to create a new list named c that contains only the values, which appearsin BOTH lists.What confuses me the most, is that, "a" contains both country names and country codes, and "b" contains single values, listed next to each other.list "c" should end up looking something like this: ['Afghanistan','Albania',Algeria','Angola']...Thanks in advance
You can flatten the first list using itertools.chain.from_iterable and use set intersection:If you don't want the itertools import (at the cost of a bit of performance):
i too new to python and i dont know the predefined functions and i write my logic to you. Hope this work for you ...    have fun in python
