Original Question hereI want to sum the [qty] based on [pid][dbid][eid][sid].this code works on v3.6.4 but when i migrate to v3.4, then i got an error message:
** can be used to unpack dictionaries into keyword arguments in function calls. Beginning with python 3.5, PEP 448 -- Additional Unpacking Generalizations was added to the language. This expands the places where you can unpack tuples (*some_tuple) and dictionaries (**some_dict).  Ini[0] is the first dict in the list and {'qty':sum(b['qty'] for b in i)} is a dict with one key that sums the 'qty' values in the list. The ** operator unpacks both dictionaries and since the dictionary constructor now supports an arbitrary number of unpackings, the two dictionaries are merged into one.This can all be done with a function for python 3.4 and earlier
