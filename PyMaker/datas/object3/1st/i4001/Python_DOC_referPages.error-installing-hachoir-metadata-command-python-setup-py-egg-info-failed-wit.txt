I am installing hachoir-metadata from reference[3]. I have completed the following for the installation of hachoir-metadata:I am using the software versions below:Python Version 3.5.5Anaconda: 3.6.5I get an error stating Command "python setup.py egg_info" failed with error code 1 in...\hachoir-metda which is shown below. I have completed the following in attempt to fix the problem:1)Installed setuptools2)Installed ipykernelNon of the above work.Firstly, when analyzing the error it is due to a syntax issue. Therefore, could the error be caused by the fact that the Python version is incompatible(i.e. hachoir-metadata uses an old version of python but this should not be the case right)?What can be done to solve this issue? 1 https://github.com/facebook/prophet/issues/418[2] http://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install/kernel_install.html[3] https://pypi.org/project/hachoir-metadata/#description
So this it what I discovered (NB: that I am new to python), hachoir metadata works with python 2 and can not work with python 3+.There are a few options to address this:1)Conversion of 2.x code to 3.x for pure Python is generally a straightforward mechanical translation.  There's a program called 2to3 .2)You can also Port codes from python 2 to python 3 [2]3)I also found this,Hachoir3 is written for Python 3.3+, it uses the new yield from syntax.[3]Lucky Us! Guess I'm going with option 3.[1] https://docs.python.org/3.0/library/2to3.html[2] https://docs.python.org/3/howto/pyporting.html[3] http://pydoc.net/hachoir3/3.0a2/[4] https://docs.python.org/3/howto/cporting.html#cporting-howto
