It does return the dictionary. That's what return count does. Do you want to print out the dictionary? Then change main() to For the record, there's a Counter object (a subclass of dict so can do all the same things) in the standard library that will do this all for you.Output:
As said, you code works but you didn't do anytinhg with the return value of the function.That said, I can think of some improvements though. First, the get method of dict will make the case of a new letter cleaner, setting the default value to 0:Otherwise, you can use a Counter object from collections:If you have a very long list of words, you shouldn't use str.join since it builds new string. The chain_from_iterable method of itertools module will chain the letters for free:
