I have two arrays:I want the next sum:How can I do that?(I know that it can be done with two for loops but I want something more efficient if possible)Note: those two arrays are contained in a dataframe (pandas)
I do not think pandas is necessary here If they are in the dataframe Update
I wanted to recommend using itertools.product here, https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html included a lot of other recipes that allows you to code more clearly
