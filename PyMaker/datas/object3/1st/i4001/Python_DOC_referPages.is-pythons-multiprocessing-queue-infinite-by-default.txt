The documentation for python's multiprocesing queue: https://docs.python.org/2/library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing.QueueIsn't as clear as the one for queue.Queue: https://docs.python.org/3/library/queue.htmlAs to whether or not the size of the queue is "infinite" (as in, within the possible bounds of whatever the program can manage to allocate memory wise) when the maxsize argument isn't given to the constructor.Is this the case ?
multiprocessing.Queue mimics queue.Queue completly with all features (except .task_done() and .join())Queue implements all the methods of Queue.Queue except for task_done() and join().So without arguments (or a negative number) it can take infinite elements(as an side-note since Queues are internally list like structures (dequeue, heapq, list) it is harder to have an limit, then to not have an limit.)Edit:Ok as it turns out after looking through the source code, it turns out that multiprocessing.Queue does have a standard upper bound if no value is specified: 2**31-1So it is not infinte, but praticly infinte
