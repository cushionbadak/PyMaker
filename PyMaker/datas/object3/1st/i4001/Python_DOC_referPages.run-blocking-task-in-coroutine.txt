I have a server which reads messages from SQS queue with long polling which blocks coroutine execution. Is there a way to leave processors running while the scheduler is blocked on waiting for new messages?
To integrate with SQS, it is preferrable to use aiobotocore library - asyncio-compatible AWS driver. Here is example of SQS usage: http://aiobotocore.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html#sqsIn general, if you must use an external library with blocking function calls - use asyncio executors API, which delegates blocking calls to thread pool.
