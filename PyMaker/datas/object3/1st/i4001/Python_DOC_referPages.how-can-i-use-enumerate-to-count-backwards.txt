Assume this is my list. Where for i, letter in enumerate(letters) would be:How can I instead make it enumerate backwards, as:
Try this:Output:
I would try to make a reverse list first then you may use enumerate()
tl;dr: size - index - 1I'll assume the question you are asking is whether or not you can have the index be reversed while the item is the same, for example, the a has the ordering number of 2 when it actually has an index of 0. To calculate this, consider that each element in your array or list wants to have the index of the item with the same "distance" (index wise) from the end of the collection. Calculating this gives you size - index. However, many programming languages start arrays with an index of 0. Due to this, we would need to subtract 1 in order to make the indices correspond properly. Consider our last element, with an index of size - 1. In our original equation, we would get size - (size - 1), which is equal to size - size + 1, which is equal to 1. Therefore, we need to subtract 1. Final equation (for each element): size - index - 1
The zip function creates a list of element-wise pairs for two parameter lists.
