I have following python code:output of above code is:I want that input should be give by python there should not be any user interaction :I know certificate can be generated by python pyOpenSSL library but I want to use normal linux commandMy python version is:I saw following link but it didn't helpPython execute command line,sending input and reading outputIf you run the command in shell it runs as below:
In his comment, Jean-François Fabre is right about this:But the real issue is that piping input to a password entering routine doesn't always work.But not about this:You have to generate a keyboard event at a lower level.Though it would be true in general, in the case at hand the command openssl genrsa … offers the option -passout stdin to read the password from standard input:So, this Python script works:Note that one cannot call communicate() with timeout=None more than once, since it waits for process to terminate. But it isn't necessary either, because with -passout stdin the command doesn't ask for verifying, thus no need to enter the pass phrase a second time.
I usually don't like subprocess for this kind of tasks ... I would prefer to use pexpect to emulate human behaviour (typing in data ... and so on). This one is a rough example to do the job
