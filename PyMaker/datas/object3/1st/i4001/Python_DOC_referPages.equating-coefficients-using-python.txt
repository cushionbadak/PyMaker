This is actually a quite simple task to do manually, given the two equation, but nevertheless I wanted to know if its possible to equate coefficients in python (maybe using numpy or sympy/scipy?).So the equations I have look something like this:Now ideally the second equation should be first multiplied out to take shape like the one above and then kB should be calculated via the three coefficients a (=1.0066), b(=1.8908) and c (0.888) with r0 being a constant aswell (basically giving me 3 values for kB)So the only variables are x and r ,but I am not really interested in themIs it possible to perform such a task? Bare in mind that I am just a beginnerThank you
You could use SymPy to represent the right-hand sides as expressions with respect to symbolic variables x, r, r0 and kB:Now we can convert y and U into polynomials with respect to x and r:sym.Polys have a all_coeffs method which returns a list of the coefficients:We can use zip to pair the coefficients from the two lists:and then use sympy.Eq to equate the expressions, and use sympy.solve to solve them for kB. The Python construct I'm using here to generate the list is called a list comprehension:Putting it all together:prints
