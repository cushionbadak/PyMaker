I actually have one dataframe, here is an exemple:and I would like to remove duplicated sequences:here in the exemple seq20 seq56 is duplicated because there is also seq56 seq20 and the same for  seq7 seq4 and seq4 seq7 I guess a solution would be first to sort all columns such: and then remove one of the two duplicated sequences and get: Thanks for your help :)Report of the script you gave me :here is a head of my first data (see picture to see in color the duplictaed groups)and here is the result I shoud obtain: But i'm actually getting:I used this code: 
I think need numpy.sort with drop_duplicates - return sorted rows:Or use DataFrame.duplicated for mask with inverted mask by ~ nd filtering by boolean indexing - original not sorted values in output:EDIT:I test it with new data:
You can try this:
For example:
You can use pd.DataFrame.apply to apply sorted on axis=1. Then use pd.Series.duplicated to drop duplicates.
