I scraped a site for data and I was able to print the desired output with json format containing only value but what i actually needed is to get the data with both key and value pair and save it into output.json format so I can insert into my django database. Here is what I have done so farAnd here is my attached output screenshotSo how do I approach this?
Use json.dump
