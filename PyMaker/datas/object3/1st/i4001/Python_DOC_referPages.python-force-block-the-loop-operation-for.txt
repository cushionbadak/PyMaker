i've this code, how to force the exit of for loop?:i wuold block after print("dddddddd") how can i force the exit?
To exit a for or while loop, use the keyword break (docs). This works for "infinite" loops too (like the one below).Example:will print:(since it'll run when n is 0, 1, 2 and 3 -> 4 times)
