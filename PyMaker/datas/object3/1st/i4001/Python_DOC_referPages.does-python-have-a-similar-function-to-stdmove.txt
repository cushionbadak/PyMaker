I have two large dictionaries(i.e. cache and buffer). Periodically, I need to move the content from cache to buffer and delete the copied item from cache.Does Python offer similar function to C++11 std::move so that I don't have to make an extra copy of the item which will be removed later?Updated based on comments from @JETMIt looks like the value of cache['1'] is NOT copied into buffer['1'].
In this particular case, you could use dict.pop:It's worth noting, though, that in Python objects are more synonymous with pointers; that is, when you perform this copy, no data gets duplicated, you're just adding a reference to the object in buffer and removing a reference to it from cache. That is, only the pointer is getting copied.
