My zip file contains a lot of smaller zip files.I want to iterate through all those files, reading and printing each of their comments.I've found out that  zipfile file.zip or unzip -z file.zipcan do this to a file in separate, but I'm looking for a way to go through all of them.Couldn't find anything perfect yet, but this post. However, the code is too advanced for me, and I need something very basic, to begin with :)Any ideas or information would be great, thanks!
Not sure exactly what your looking for but here are a few ways I did it on an Ubuntu Linux machine.oror
You can use the zipfile library to iterate through your files andget their comments using zipinfo.commentThe example above prints the comment of each file in your zip file.You could loop through your zip files and print their contents comments similiarly.Check out the official zipfile documentation, its super clear.
