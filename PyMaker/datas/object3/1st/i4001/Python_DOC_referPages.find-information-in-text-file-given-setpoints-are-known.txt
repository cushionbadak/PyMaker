Natural Text
So I know the setpoints <start point> and <end point> in the text file and I need to use these to find certain information between them which will be used and printed. I currently have .readlines() within a different function which is used within the new function to find the information.
You can try something like this:
This seems like a job for regular expressions. If you have not yet encountered regular expressions, they are an extremely powerful tool that can basically be used to search for a specific pattern in a text string. For example the regular expression (or regex for short) Number=\d+ would find any line in the text document that has Number= followed by any number of number characters. The regex Word=\w+ would match any string starting with Word= and then followed by any number of letters. In python you can use regular expression through the re module. For a great introduction to using regular expressions in python check out this chapter from the book Automate the Boring Stuff with Python. To test out regular expressions this site is great. In this particular instance you would do something like:This would return a list with all matches to the number regex. You could then do the same thing for the word match.
