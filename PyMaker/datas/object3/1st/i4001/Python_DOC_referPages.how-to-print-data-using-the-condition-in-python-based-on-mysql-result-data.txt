i have a mysql sample data resulting like below tableI want to print top 2 main_cat for every organization. For every top 2 main_cat, I want to print top 2 sub_cat for every organization. So every organization should have 4 or less records with top 2 main_cat and top 2 sub_cat for each main_catPlease help me.
For grouping python provides itertools.groupby(), which groups sorted input by a given key function.In this case the input needs to be sorted first by org_id, then by main_cat then by number in descending order, e.g. if your data as a list looks like this:then you'd sort it like this:or by altering your sql statement to include ORDER BY main_cat, sub_cat, number DESC, then you'll aready get it in the right order from the database.Now you can use groupby to group, and islice to limit the number of results per grouped category:Output:
You can use pandas to process your query into dataframe with read_sql:Variable connection is your connection to db and query is your SELECT string.
