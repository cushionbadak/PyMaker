While I can manipulate a CSV file with Python without an issue if it's strictly comma delimited, I'm running into a massive problem with this format I'm working with. It's comma delimited but the last column conists of a mesh of about six commans withiin the following figure:The other columns are standard comma separation, but this one column is a mess. I need to only pull out the timestamps' YYYY-MM-DD; nothing else. I can't seem to figure out a way to strip out the unnecessary characters, however. Any suggestions? I'm working with Python specifically, but if there's something else I should look to, let me know! Thanks!
Rather than splitting/stripping, it may be easier to use a regular expression to extract the datestamps you want directly.Here is an example with the line you provided in your question:This will print an array containing the datestamps, in the order they appeared in the string (i.e, ['2018-05-07', '2018-05-09'])See The Python 3 Docs for more information on regular expressions.
You're looking at JSON format, so try using the json module:The data variable should now contain your data in a more easily accessible format.
