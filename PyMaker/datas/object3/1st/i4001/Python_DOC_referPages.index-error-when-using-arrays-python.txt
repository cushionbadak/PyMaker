I'm having some trouble when trying to make a string that changes one character at a time, i'm not sure what the problem is!? I get a index out of range errorUsing Trinket
inside while loop, it gives error when random.randint(0, len(target)) returns 12.so change that line into:
index = random.randint(0,len(target))Should beindex = random.randint(0,len(target)-1)
As the documentation says:random.randint(a, b)Return a random integer N such that a <= N <= b.It seems your problem is in the statement:index = random.randint(0,len(target))The position len(target) is invalid.I think it should be index = random.randint(0,len(target)-1)
