From a set of files, I'm creating a tar file and, from the tar file, a tar.gz file (using python).The creation of the compressed file could take time, so:I'd like to know if there is a way to know that the "process to create a compressed file" is "on-going".Maybe checking by some temp file or similar?Thanks
you could use python to create your gzip file (possibly in another thread) so you can know when the file is created (and even get a progress indicator)Write in chunks and a progress report since you get control everytime you write a chunk of the file to the compressed output (there are fancier progress bars out there, I'll do a simple print):another solution would be to use the gzip output mode of the tarfile library and use a progress bar on the files being written / left to write (knowing that it won't be exact if the files are of very different sizes)
