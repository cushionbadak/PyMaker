If I have aaabbbccc, I'd like to change them in to a3b3c3.I am using if statement for this.. but it looks too inefficient.Maybe Regex would be helpful, but regex for searching only the consecutives is possible?if I have aaabbbcccaaa then I'd like to change them a3b3c3a3 list this.. which means the algorithm only search the "consecutives and count them" change into integer.Any hint to proceed would be appreciated.
itertools.groupby:Make an iterator that returns consecutive keys and groups from the iterablejoin to finish up:If needed, replace to remove 1:''.join(groups).replace('1', '') instead of ''.join(groups)
Maybe itertools groupby?
