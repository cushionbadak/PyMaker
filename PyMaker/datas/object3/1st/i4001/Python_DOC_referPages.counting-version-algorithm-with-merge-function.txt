Im trying to code the optimal version of the counting version algorithm. I'm having this error in line 84: int object is not iterable.But I can't figure out why i'm having this issue. Function mergesort: Merge a list of number in increasing order (this one works when I use it alone)Function merge_and_count: Take two merged arrays in input, and count the number of elements from the left array that are bigger then the elements of the right arrayFunction sort_and_count: The function that will give the number of inversions (it also return a list because it allows me to use recursivity)Here is the code:
You forgot to return a pair from sort_and_count here:Since these lines expect an iterable on the right hand side of the assignment operator and get only an integer, you get int object is not iterable error.
