I am searching for all .csv's located in a subfolder with glob like so:If I call:path = r'/data/realtimedata/trades/bitfinex/'scan_for_files(path)I get the correct recursive list of files:However when using the actual sub-directory containing the files I want - it returns an empty list. Any idea why this is happening? Thanks.path = r'/data/realtimedata/trades/bitfinex/btcusd/'scan_for_files(path)returns: []
Looks like btcusd is a bottom-level directory. That means that when you call os.walk with the r'/data/realtimedata/trades/bitfinex/btcusd/' path, the dirs variable will be an empty list [], so the inner loop for d in dirs: does not execute at all.My advice would be to re-write your function to iterate over the files directly, and not the directories... don't worry, you'll get there eventually, that's the nature of a directory tree.However, on more recent versions of python (3.5+), you can use recursive glob:Source.
