I am trying to open up an 2 excel files (soxs.csv and nugt.csv) , look at the column "close" and find the max, min, mean in the "close" column for each file.The result I am getting is "TypeError: 'str' object is not callable". But I am calling it with attributes that should run just trying to do it with less code by using a loop. Any suggestions on how to get around this?
Thestat is a string so you can call it, you can get the attr by like this:It returns the method, for calling that you should use () and send the parameters if needed, like this:
You're calling the stat which is a string at following line:Change it to:Also, for accessing multiple attributes at once you can simple use operator.attrgetter which accepts an iterable of attribute names.e.g.But in this case since you need to call the getattr result again, it's not a Pythonic way to use operator.attrgetter(). Instead you could dimply loop over the attrs and just call the result manually in a list comprehension.
Use methdcaller instead of attrgetter for calling methods.max, min and mean are all methods of pandas.Series, not attributes. Since methodcaller only calls one method at a time, you can apply multiple methods via a comprehension.Here's a complete example:
