I have a nested list:where I want to find the max index 1 of all the sublists. To do this I've created this function: Once I have the max index 1 of the list, I want to check to see if there are duplicates (there are in the example.) If there are duplicates I want to return only the sublist with the smallest index 0. How can I do this?
sorted() can do that with a key like :Code:Test Code:Results:
As someone already shown the key parameter of sorted function, I want to mention that the min and max functions also have a key parameter.
