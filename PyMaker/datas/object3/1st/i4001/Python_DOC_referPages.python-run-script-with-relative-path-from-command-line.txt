TL;DRWhat are the options on Windows 10 to run from command line a python script specified by a relative path? Can environment variables be changed to do so? How can this be done?LONGI am using Windows 10. When I follow this installation guide (written for Linux), everything is fine until I need to perform the following on WindowsOn Windows, I added the two paths (the entire, absolute, path) to PYTHONPATH. When I execute the following; I see the extra two paths added.However, if I create a simple test.py scriptand run it from the command line:it works if the test.py file is saved in C:\User\me\, but NOT when it is saved in the folders of PYTHONPATH.This SO Q&A says that PYTHONPATH is used by the python interpreter. It is not the same as  Windows' PATH environment variable. You can't use it as a search path  for passing files to the interpreter on the command line.But I could not find how I can achieve what I need, using relative path of script to run it from command line. Please note that using the absolute path is not an option, because the instalation guide requires 2 folders are added to the PYTHONPATH, in order for the task to work.It should be possible but I did not find any answer - Python 3 documentation describes Command line option for running script with relative path:Execute the Python code contained in script, which must be a  filesystem path (absolute or relative) referring to either a Python  file...
These lines from the install guide are intended to be run after a cd .../tensorflow/models/research/ and thus are absolute paths:You will likely need to do something similar on Windows.  The equivalent would likely be to add the absolute paths to the libraries to PYTHONPATH environment variable.
I haven't tested this but as mentioned in here, this >>> export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:pwd:pwd/slim should be used asset PYTHONPATH=%PYTHONPATH%;%cd%;%cd%\slim
