(I'm an absolute beginner in terms of coding, this is my first ever project.)I'm trying to use Mutagen on Windows 10 to loop through a directory and add ID3 tag track numbers for each of the files encountered. Unfortunately, it seems Mutagen is having trouble recognizing said files. Here is what my code looks like so far:This is essentially cobbled together from various other things I've googled, but it gives me a massive error when I run it, of which I'll post the first few lines here:As I said, I'm an absolute beginner, so I don't really understand what most of this means, though it seems like it's implying that the directory (or files in the directory?) I've selected doesn't exist, which it very much does. Can anyone help me out with this?
Your issue is with the path - os.listdir() only lists the files/directories but not their paths so, unless you happen to be executing your script from the specified path, Python won't be able to find the file.You can always define your home path as:You may also want to look into glob.glob() for direct directory list with an applied extension filter pattern so you don't have to do the manual check yourself.
