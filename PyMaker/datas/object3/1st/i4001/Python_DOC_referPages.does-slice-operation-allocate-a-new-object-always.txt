I am confused about the slice operation.What allocation rule does slice operation follow?
For most built-in types, slicing is always a shallow copy... in the sense that modifying the copy will not modify the original. This means that for immutable types, an object counts as a copy of itself. The copy module also uses this concept of "copy":Objects are free to use whatever allocation strategy they choose, as long as they implement the semantics they document. y can be the same object as s, but z cannot, because s and z store different values.
