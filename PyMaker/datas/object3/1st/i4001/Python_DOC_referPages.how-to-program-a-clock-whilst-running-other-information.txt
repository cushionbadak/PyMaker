Natural Text
I want to create a game where the idea is to spam as much as possible in the time limit:9.58 (it's linked to running). Here is what I've got. My problem is I'm not sure how to create a clock whilst counting the number of something/receiving input I have tried to approach this in different matters but it there may be a line of code I don't know which may help.
you might want to consider something like non-blocking input.
