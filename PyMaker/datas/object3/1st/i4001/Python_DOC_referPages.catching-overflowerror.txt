In Python 3 I have a class representing a range [x,y] of values and computing the length of such range.If the length is too large, I'm not sure how to catch the OverflowError exception inside the class itself. It is raised only in the outer code using a class instance...This is what happens upon execution:
That's because the OverflowError doesn't occur within your magic __len__() method - Python is perfectly capable of handling much bigger integers than that - but in CPython len() itself is implemented as PyObject_Size() which returns a Py_ssize_t, which is limited to 2^31-1 (32-bit) or 2^63-1 (64-bit) and thus the overflow occurs when your __len__() result is coerced to it.You can do a pre-check before returning the result to make sure you capture the overflow before it even occurs, something like:
