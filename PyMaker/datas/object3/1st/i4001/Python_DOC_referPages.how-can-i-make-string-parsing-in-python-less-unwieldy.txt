Apologies if the question title is too vague - would welcome edits.I'm trying to parse XML using BeautifulSoup, but because each function call could return None, I have to parse a single element over a number of lines. This gets unwieldy very quickly:Doing the same thing in Swift, a language I'm far more familiar with, it's a lot cleaner:Is there a similar way I could do this in Python? I want to avoid using try/catch as causing it to potentially have a runtime error constantly in my code doesn't feel like good practice.
