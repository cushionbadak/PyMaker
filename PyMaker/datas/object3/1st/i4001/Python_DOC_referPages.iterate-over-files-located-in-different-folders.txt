I’d like to write a function to iterate over excel files that are in different folders. Parts of the path of each file are the same, for instance:  C:\Main\Division\Reports\Year\Data.xls   The only part of each path that changes is ‘Year’.  The files all have the same name.    Is there a way to do this with a placeholder for Year?  If not, what approach should I take? 
You can use os.listdir function
You could try os.walk
