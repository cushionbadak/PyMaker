Here is the below code we have developed for single directory of filesI want loop for all directoriesThanks in advance
If you're using UNIX you can use grep:The -R flag allows for a recursive search inside the directory, following the symbolic links if there are any.
My suggestion is to use glob.The glob module allows you to work with files. In the Unix universe, a directory is / should be a file so it should be able to help you with your task.More over, you don't have to install anything, glob comes with python.Note: For the following code, you will need python3.5 or greaterThis should help you out.What glob.glob does is, it Return a possibly-empty list of path names that match pathname. In this case, it will match every file (including directories) in /user/stream/. If these files are not directories, you can do whatever you want with them.I hope this will help you!ClarificationRegarding your 3 point comment attempting to clarify the question, especially this part we need to put appi dynamically in that path then we need to read all files inside that directoryNo, you do not need to do this. Please read my answer carefully and please read glob documentation.In this case, it will match every file (including directories) in /user/stream/If you replace /user/stream/ with /ai2/data/prod/admin/inf/, you will have access to every file in /ai2/data/prod/admin/inf/. Assuming your app ids are 1, 2, 3, this means, you will have access to the following files.You do not have to specify the id, because you will be iterating over all files. If you do need the id, you can just extract it from the path.If everything looks like this, /ai2/data/prod/admin/inf/inf_<$APP>_pvt/error, you can get the id by removing /ai2/data/prod/admin/inf/ and taking everything until you encounter _.
