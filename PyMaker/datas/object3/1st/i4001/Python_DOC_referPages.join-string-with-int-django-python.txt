You can split the dept_name with .split(" ") and then use only the first letter of each word with [:1]. Example:This will output:Edit: Same for the year, to get 18 from 2018 use:This will output:
Use str.format instead. To pick the first letter of a string just index it with [0]. You can pass {:03} to zero pad with three zeroes, like so
