I have developed a webscraper with beautiful soup that scrapes news from a website and then sends them to a telegram bot. Every time the program runs it picks up all the news currently on the news web page, and I want it to just pick the new entries on the news and send only those. How can I do this? Should I use a sorting algorithm of some sort?Here is the code:
You need to keep track of articles that you have seen before, either by using a full database solution or by simply saving the information in a file. The file needs to be read before starting. The website is then scraped and compared against the existing list. Any articles not in the list are added to the list. At the end, the updated list is saved back to the file.Rather that storing the whole text in the file, a hash of the text can be saved instead. i.e. convert the text into a unique number, in this case a hex digest is used to make it easier to save to a text file. As each hash will be unique, they can be stored in a Python set to speed up the checking:The first time this is run, all articles will be displayed. The next time, no articles will be displayed until the website is updated.
