I wanted to write a regular expression for a string test = "ID=ss59537-RA:exon:0;Parent=ss59537-RA;" and I so I had this searchstr = re.compile(r'(ID = ss[\d]+-RA)(:)(exon:[\d]+)(;)(Parent = ss[\d]+-RA;)') but when I tried to run the re.search command, I am not getting anything back. What am I doing wrong here? I made sure the regular expression matches the string but when I ran it with reg.search, it doesn't work. 
It seems you planned to allow any number of spaces around the = signs. You may use \s* instead of literal spaces to match any 0 whitespace chars. I also advise removing [ and ] from around single atoms ([\d] = \d), and move the last ) before the ;:See the Python demo.
