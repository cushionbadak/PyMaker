I am trying to increase the number i in the URL, ten by ten, to be able to open several pages at the same time, but I get the following error. Can someone help me to correct the code?
you have to convert integers to strings using str() when joining ints with strings. Try something like this:
You want to just increase the value of i by 10 every time. You can use a builtin function like range in python. Do check it out, range is used quite often in conjunction with the for loop in pythonThe above for loop will start with a value of i = 1, with an increment of 10 every time until i reaches a maximum value that is less than 100. The value of i in the above for loop will beWhen i becomes 101, it ends the for loop.Edit : To write these url's to a fileFor more information, checkout reading and writing files in python3
