I'm trying to do an interactive console using the curses lib.similar to this :But it return this :(after the Execute qwe block and print result# line I pressed the enter key)The stdscr.getstr() function only wait for input half the time. The other half command = '' without any input. This is why you see the double # sign or the # sign at the end of each output.The expecting result should be : Any recommendation ?
I was using the pyCharm terminal (with the run > edit configurations... > emulate terminal in output console checked) but apparently curses lib and pyCharm are not compatible.When running the script in the normal terminal, it worked perfectly.Hope this will help someone!
