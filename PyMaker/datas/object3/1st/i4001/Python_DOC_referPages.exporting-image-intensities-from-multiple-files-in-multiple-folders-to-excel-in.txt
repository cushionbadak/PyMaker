I need to export lists of pixel intensities derived from multiple images in multiple folders to an excel spreadsheet. Each folder contains a list of tiff files each representing a certain time point in a timelapse. I've managed to obtain the pixel intensities of each folder subset, but I'm struggling with the output to excel using DataFrames with pandas. The data frame only displays the list of values from the last folder, and I need the spreadsheet to display each list in a separate row. Here is what I have:Printing out the ratios gives: Folder1:[list of values]Folder2:[list of values]Folder3:[list of values etc.But the data displayed by df (DataFrame) is only from the list in Folder3. So, what do I need to do differently to export values derived from multiple folders into Excel? I also made sure that each image is read as a ndarray and the type=uint8.  
Replacing the assignment sentence inside the for loop by a call to the extend list method should fix the issue:
