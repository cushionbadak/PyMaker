I tried to run:It fails with this message:I have a fresh install of Python 3.6.5 including pip 9.0.3. python -m pip works. The install is user-local and the only Python installation.

It's all in my user area: both the full python install and the venv target directory are on a network drive. (I've redacted part of the path to Python in the error message)How can I fix this? Should I report it as a bug? The error message would be confusing for a beginner following the basic tutorial.Conclusion: Don't work on UNC paths. Map a drive letter.
The following should work:The options are documented here
