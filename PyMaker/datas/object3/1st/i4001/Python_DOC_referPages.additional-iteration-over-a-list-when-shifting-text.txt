I've encountered a small problem with a simple shift deciphering.The idea is for every character of my input string to be replaced with a different character from the alphabet that's been shifted by a given key (K).The problem occurs when c-K < 0 and the replacing key is taken from the back of the list. Then the loop is being iterated twice.If the key is 3 and I input A instead of getting X, I'm getting U as the first iteration gives X but then X is also iterated and becomes U.
Your mistake is looping over all the letters in alph:The for loop tests all the letters of the alphabet, in order, and 'A' is matched. You set mylist[b] to 'X' (0 - 3 is -3 and myalph[-3] is 'X'.The loop then continues to test all the other letters of the alphabet against mylist[b], so eventually it gets to 'X', sees that the letter matches and sets mylist[b] to 'U'.The loop continues to test the remaining letters of the alphabet against mylist[b], and reaches the end without further matches.At the very least you need to break out of the loop when you have shifted a letter.But rather than loop, you could use the str.find() method (directly on the alph string) to find a matching index for the letter; it'll be set to -1 if the letter is not found at all:Aside from that, there are some other improvements you could make:You can loop over and index into strings directly, there is no need to turn alph into a list here. When you do need to to turn a string into a list of individual characters, you should use list(stringobject). So mylist = list(s) would suffice.myres is already a list of strings, there is no need to convert each to a string again.Rather than put all the letters from s into a list, then adding the whole mylist list to res to myres, you could just directly append each letter you processed to myres; that also removes the need to alter myres.Python variable names do not need to be limited to single characters. Use more descriptive names so that it is easier to understand what your code does when you return to it later.Taken together, that'd lead to:
