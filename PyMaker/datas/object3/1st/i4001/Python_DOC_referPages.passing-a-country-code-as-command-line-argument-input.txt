I have a program that gets the code of a country with raw_input() and then send an email based on it.My code is:I want to change it to send the country code as command line argument input.Example:and the related email ids as output.
you should try argparse module, 
raw_input reads from standard input whereas sys.argv is the list of command line arguments. So if you want to use command line to pass in the country code, just delete the line containing raw_input and let country be sys.argv[1].
