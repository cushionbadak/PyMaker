I making a fighting game. Its like there are two players. They have 100 hp and they choose attack value btween 0-100 when they're fighting. After they choose value they should have %(100-value) chance of being successful with this attack. For example if they choose value 60, they have %40 chance to be successful with this attack.Can you please help. Sorry for my bad english.
What you want is to generate a random number between 0 and 100 and check if it's greater than your inserted number.For example, if you enter 50, there's a 50% chance the random number will be greater (or equal), 50% lower. If you enter 10, there's a 90% chance the number will be greater.You can use random.randrange(101) to generate a random number between 0 and 100 inclusive. Then it's a simple comparison to your value, and that should be all you need.
Generally, in statistics, a chance is expressed as a number between 0 and 1, so 0.6 represents a 60% chance. Then, if you want to have a 0.6 chance of success, you can determine success or not by picking a random floating point number between 0 and 1 and check if it is smaller than or equal to 0.6.Intuitively, you can look at it this way:If you'd pick a random point on this line—your random number between 0 and 1—the chance of it being on the left side of the 0.6 is... 0.6 (60%).You can use random.uniform for this:Now as a simple check if this is functioning properly:The expected result is about 0.6 * 100000 = 60000 successes and the actual result is 59954, so that's close enough.
