I have a function that is supposed to generate a tuple of all built-in exceptions, (for use in the except (Exception1, Exception2, etc...) as error: form) and when I run it normally, it works just fine.and when run:which is just as I wanted.however, at the following, through the shell,nothing happens. even in a file:i get:this seems very strange. any help would be great!by the way, I looked at these, they weren't really related to what I had in mind.import fails when running python as script, but not in iPython?http://python-notes.curiousefficiency.org/en/latest/python_concepts/import_traps.htmlif you have any questions, just ask :)
The fundamental problem with your approach is that you are relying on two things you shouldn't rely on. The first is dir, the behavior of which should not be relied on because it exists mostly to aid debugging in the interactive shell. From the docs:If the object does not provide __dir__(), the function tries its  best to gather information from the object’s __dict__ attribute, if  defined, and from its type object. The resulting list is not  necessarily complete, and may be inaccurate when the object has a  custom __getattr__()....Note Because dir() is supplied primarily as a convenience for use at an interactive prompt, it tries to supply an interesting set of  names more than it tries to supply a rigorously or consistently  defined set of names, and its detailed behavior may change across  releases. For example, metaclass attributes are not in the result list  when the argument is a class.Furthermore, you use the __builtins__ variable, which is an implementation detail Again, from the docs:As an implementation detail, most modules have the name __builtins__  made available as part of their globals. The value of __builtins__ is  normally either this module or the value of this module’s __dict__  attribute. Since this is an implementation detail, it may not be used  by alternate implementations of Python.Essentially, you are relying on two unreliable things. Note, what is actually happening in your case is that when you run the module directly, it returns the actual builtins module, however, when the module is imported, __builtins__ contains the "value of this module's __dict__". A few debugging prints could have illuminated this:And from the interactive interpreter:So when you call dir on a dict object, it simply returns the attributes introspectable from the dict-object, e.g. copy, fromkeys, get, items and all the other dict methods. The solution is to use the builtins module and don't use dir, use vars (which just returns the __dict__ attribute), since you want the attributes of the module object.Finally, your approach with exec is not good. If you want to do this sanely, check if it is a subclass of BaseException, which is the parent class of all built-in exceptions, so from the docs:exception BaseExceptionThe base class for all built-in exceptions. It is not meant to be      directly inherited by user-defined classes (for that, use Exception).So something like:Does what you are trying to accomplish. Note, this iterates over the values directly, so you don't end up using something like eval or exec, which is an abuse in this case. Note, this catches every built-in exception, things like warnings, (e.g. BytesWarning) and more esoteric things like SystemExit.  FinallyJust because you can do this, doesn't mean you should. Your stated purpose is:I have a function that is supposed to generate a tuple of all built-in  exceptions, (for use in the except (Exception1, Exception2, etc...)  as error: form)Well, you could just use except BaseException as error instead of going through the rigamarole of finding those exceptions in the first place (indeed, except <something> essentially checks if <something> issubclass of whatever error is being raised. And fundamentally, there is rarely ever any good reason to have such a broad except clause. You should always try to catch as narrow an exception as possible.
This works, and seems to be the common technique for getting at the builtins module.
