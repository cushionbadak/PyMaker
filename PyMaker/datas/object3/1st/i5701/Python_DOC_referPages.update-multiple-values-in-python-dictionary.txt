Hi I am new to python and I am watching a lot of youtube videos to learn. I know how to update dictionary values individually. I want to update them all at once.Example:I want to update this to Each person's age increased by 1.
A one-liner:
You can use the dict.keys() functionality. Just tested, it works in Python 2 and 3.
Single liner with dictionary comprehension:#driver values:
You can call function keys() to do what you try to do.
