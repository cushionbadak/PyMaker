I am trying to use itertools to make this code perform better and be more pythonicI think I should be using itertools.permutations and itertools.chain, but I'm not sure how to put them together to get the equivalent result either as a list or an iterator. If you have another solution that does not use itertools, I will also consider it.
Are you not looking for itertools.combinations_with_replacement([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 6) ? :)
