A first resource is chr, e.g., chr(92).If chr does not fit your needs, you would get the backslash from "somewhere".Under Windows, a possible "safe" place to look for is in path names.E.g.,Or, you may have it stored somewhere you know, and go look for it.E.g., in a file, written in memory, etc.I am not sure these are acceptable options for you.
You may do this with eval. As eval simply takes a string as an argument, you're arguably not using the chr built-in function directly ;)Take this as an example and do not wonder about the double backslash, it's because a single one is for escaping characters:
