Natural Text
I have a folder that has a mix and match of camelCase and non camel case filenames. I have used this in Python to remove underscores and was hoping I could easily tweak it to replace 'camelCaseExample' with 'camel Case Example':Could anyone help me edit this to get it working for regex?I have tried this with no luck:I would also be able to use a c# solution if that would be easier
You will probably want to try regex using the re library.Will output:If you want it to be lowercase after this, you could just callWhat the regex is doing is looking for any point immediately before an upper case letter and substituting a space there. This regex101 link will help explain it better.
