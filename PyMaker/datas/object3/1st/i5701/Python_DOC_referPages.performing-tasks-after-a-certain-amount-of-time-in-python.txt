I am currently writing an audio playout system using python3 and afplay. I have run into a problem where I cannot get it to automatically go to the next song in the playlist, whilst still allowing for user control.Above is the code that plays each song inside a folder. I want to be able to manually go to the next song using the "next" command, but also have it automatically go to the next after some time has passed, specifically the length of the song.I have tried using the threading package, but I then run into a problem when I can't break the while loop from a function:I apologise that the question is incredibly convuluted, but any help would be greatly appreciated.
You may want to use scheduler.It would change somewhat the logic of your code, but it would likely be more functional.You would, by default, schedule an event for playing the next song (use enter or enterabs). You could get the running time of the current song so you know when to schedule the next one.If "next" is selected, you would cancel the previous event and schedule two others: 1) a new one for immediate execution, play the next song, 2) play the following song.
