I have an xml file which I want to sort based on attribute values.  The following is the xml file:The desired output is this:I tried the following two options:This code just realigns the box attributes and not the image file attribute, which is not desirable.  The following is something I have taken from SO, but doesn't do anything.How do I get the xml sorted?
Use the key named argument for list.sort to use the file attribute of each <image> tag as the key for sorting:key specifies a function of one argument that is used to extract a comparison key from each list element (for example, key=str.lower). The key corresponding to each item in the list is calculated once and then used for the entire sorting process. The default value of None means that list items are sorted directly without calculating a separate key value.Alternate solution using lxml based off of this answer that points out that lxml serializes attributes in the order they are set (unlike xml):Note: This will remove any child (immediate descendant) of <images> that is not a <image>.
