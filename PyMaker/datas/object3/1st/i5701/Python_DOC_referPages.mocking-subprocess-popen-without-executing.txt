I'm trying to write a unit test for a method that calls subprocess.Popen.  All I want to test is that arg argument sent to Popen is as expected.  I don't actually want Popen to run.  Is this possible without mocking the arg list?e.g.Then, to test.The issues I'm getting here is that, first the binary is called (which I don't want) and second, call_args_list is empty.
When using mock.patch you must point to the object where it is importedSee the documentation  and this article that explains it well.For example, in your case:code.pytest.py (Assuming both file are in the same folder, you need to patch code.Popen and not subprocess.Popen in the test)
