I wrote a script that updates a table. Since I couldn't find a way to "batch" update, my script updates the table one row at a time. I assumed that for a set of 100,000 rows, it would take a few seconds to do the update.No. Each write operation takes ~100 milliseconds. The entire write operation takes ((((100,000 * 100)/1000)/60)/60) = 2.77 hours. Why does it take so long to write?Here's the code I'm using:What am I doing wrong?
Have you tried:You can profile this code with https://docs.python.org/3/library/profile.html
Instead of updating table row by row from the client side you could to upload your data into server-side temporary table using copy_from() method and then update the table by single SQL.Here is the artificial example:Output:As you can see the second way is about 20 times faster.
