My app engine app receives emails and adds the sender's email address to my datastore, but it does so in this format:John Smith <jsmith@email.com>Is there anyway to strip the name and brackets from this string so it just reads jsmith@email.com?This is my incoming mail handler if it helps:
Please try to add this code:this method will bring you this resultinput:"John Smith <jsmith@email.com>"output: jsmith@email.com
