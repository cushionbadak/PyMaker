Hey there! I am new to Python and programming in general. I have found a way of printing a grid of random 0 and 1. I need to save these grids and to count the amount of 0's in them. This is what I have so far: (Im using Python 2.7)
To count the amount of '0's in your matrix, you could do:To generate the matrix, you can save yourself some code and doIf you want to store the string representation anyways, there's an even easier to read way:
To count the amount of 0s you can use thisTo store the grids you can use a list and append to it. Like this:
i would recommend, to add a for-loop. To get the same results don is the length of your Arrayand to count add a variable berfore the loop, likeand in the loop add
First, I'd suggest using actual 0 and 1 instead of '0' and '1'. Also, you can use list-multiplication for foo and list-comprehensions (but not list-multiplications!) for A to make the code a bit clearer. Then, you can just get the sum of sums and subtract that from the total number of elements in A.(Of course, if you know the dimensions of A you do not have to sum the lens.)Or use a collections.Counter (also works with strings):
Dear all sorry for the long wait! I had a friend help me and this what he came up with:
