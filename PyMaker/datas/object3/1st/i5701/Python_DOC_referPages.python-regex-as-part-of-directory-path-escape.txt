Natural Text
I have a list of directories named by date MMDDYYYY (11222013).  I'm ultimately trying to delete all directories from the year 2013.    I believe my regex should be looking for 6 digits [0-9].  I've tried breaking the code into multiple variables but have had no luck.I suspect I'm not escaping the regex correctly.  I keep running into this error:  FileNotFoundError: [WinError 3] The system cannot find the path specified: 'C:/U  sers/USER/Desktop/test/\d{6}13'I've tried printing my output and I get this path:C:/Users/USER/Desktop/test/\d{6}13My code:
This code should do the trick:The code above will remove any "date" folder that ends with '2013'.
