Natural Text
when i wrote this codes there is a error second row."TypeError: 'builtin_function_or_method' object is not subscriptable". could you help me about that?
Presumably, header is a sequence (e.g. a list) and index is the builtin method to find the first occurrence of an element. The problem is that you are trying to call the method with square brackets ([]), which are Python syntax for indexing, instead of parentheses. The right syntax should be:Which will give you the index of the first occurence of the string "NoExamples*NoFeatures" in the sequence header.
