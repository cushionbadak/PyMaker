On compilation of this code it shows None as Output
reverse() mutates the original list and doesn't return a new one.so  reverse_list=list.reverse() makes reverse_list None.Here's an answer you might want to check outHow to check for palindrome using Python logic
You're using wrong reverse function in python try this one
Instead reverse the string itselfUse the following
Why it says None ?Here's an example,As you can see, calling mylist.reverse() returned None, but modified the original list object. This implementation was chosen deliberately by the developers of the Python standard library:The reverse() method modifies the sequence in place for economy of space when reversing a large sequence. To remind users that it operates by side effect, it does not return the reversed sequence. SourceSo in your case it should print None, and since list == reverse_list is evaluated to false nothing other than the previous will print. Why is explained earlier.Hope you want to check a word is palindrome or not, if so you don't need a list for that. Below solution uses some inbuilt functions to achieve that.See this working example
