Hello :) I have a big bin file which has been gzipped (so it's a blabla.bin.gz). I need to decompress and write it to a txt file with ascii format. Here's my code : But I got this error : I'm not so new to Python but format/coding problems have always been my greatest weakness :( Please, could you help me? Thank you !!!
First, there is no reason for decoding anything to immediatly write it back in raw bytes. So a simpler (and more robust) implementation could be:If you really want to decode but are unsure of the encoding, you could use Latin1. Every byte is valid in Latin1 and is translated in the unicode character of the same value. So whatever is the byte string bs, bs.decode('Latin1').encode('Latin1') is just a copy of bs.Finaly, if you really need to filter out all non ascii characters, you could use the error parameter of decode:or:
