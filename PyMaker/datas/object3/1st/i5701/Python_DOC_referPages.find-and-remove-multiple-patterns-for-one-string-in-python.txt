I have a string url, it might starts with http:// or https:// or ftp:// etc.First I need to check if the string indeed starts with the header using url.startswith(header) then I need to remove the header. For example, if input is http://example.com/example the function will check that the url starts with http:// and return example.com/example. So how to write pythonic code for this task (don't really want to use a for loop)? Or should I just use regex?
Regex would be a bit of an overkill if that's all you want, just split your string on :// and check if it starts with any of your approved protocols:This, however, doesn't guarantee the validity of your URI so if you think your string might contain an invalid URL you'll have to use something more complex.
According to the docs, you could pass str.startswith() a tuple of strings to test for:str.startswith(prefix[, start[, end]])Return True if string starts with the prefix, otherwise return False. prefix can also be a tuple of prefixes to look for.
