I have this little project to web scrape a website. I completed another website for a competitor but I am having a hard time with the current one.What the code is currently doing is creating a csv file (which is what I want), and in the csv file, I have the headers shown, but no data under it. Can someone help me with my for loop script. I believe it's not capturing the data in order to write it into the csv file.Thank you for your help.Below is the python script:Below is the HTML for containers:and finally below is the HTML for the address:
There is only one address on the webpage so you only need to fetch it once. So you can get rid on one of the for loops. You had a typo in resulting in a None value. From the zip documentation https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#zipThe iterator stops when the shortest input iterable is exhausted.So it stopped on the None value and you didn't get any output. Otherwise it would have stopped after one iteration when the address details were exhausted.Fixing these your code works:You could update it if you like to use the Python csv module https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html
