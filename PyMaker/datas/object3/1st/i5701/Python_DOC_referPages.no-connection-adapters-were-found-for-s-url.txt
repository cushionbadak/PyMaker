Sorry to ask this ! I'm newbie so feel free to teach me anything you guys know.I'm making a scraping tool for my marketing purpose to scrape contact information from website. I'm using Python 3This is my code:Have no idea why it gets me st like this:I know that get() only gets string, but have no idea how to convert these links into strings. This is my cvs file:only one column with 5 row:I tried to put str(link()) but it does not work.
You should understand that csv.reader returns an iterator that iterates over each row to return a list of columns for each one. csv.reader(csvfile, dialect='excel', **fmtparams)Return a reader object which will iterate over lines in the given  csvfile.[...]Each row read from the csv file is returned as a list of strings.Bold emphasis mine. Your CSV appears to contain a single column, so you can access the first column using link[0]. I consider it good practice to always use a with...as context manager when handling file I/O, as it automatically closes your file and results in cleaner code.
