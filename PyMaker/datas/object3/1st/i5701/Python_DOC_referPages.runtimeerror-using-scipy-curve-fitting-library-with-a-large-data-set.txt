How can I turn off this error using the SciPy curve fitting function fitting a Gaussian curve? In other words, if it doesn't fit a model peak then its not a peak so I don't want to return anything. Also, are there faster approaches? curve_fit may be too slow for my application looking at huge data.RuntimeError: Optimal parameters not found: Number of calls to function has reached maxfev = 800.
To handle the RuntimeError, use a try-except block:Some ways to reduce the running time:Reduce the maximal value of function calls maxfev, so that the routine will fail faster: e.g., curve_fit(gaus, x, y, p0=[1,0,1], maxfev=400)Sample your data points. If you have 10000 points, pick 1000 of them at random, and find that there is a Gaussian curve that fits them well, it will probably fit well to the rest of data points. Or at least it will make a good starting point for subsequent refinement of parameters with the full data set.
