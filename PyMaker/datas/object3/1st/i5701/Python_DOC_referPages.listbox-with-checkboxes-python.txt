Natural Text
I want to make listbox with checkboxes in it. I made only listbox for now, but I do not know how to put checkboxes in it. And then I want to create a button , so that I can print all selected items. Can you please help me?
The following would give you the check buttonsbut not in a listbox. Listbox can only contain text.
