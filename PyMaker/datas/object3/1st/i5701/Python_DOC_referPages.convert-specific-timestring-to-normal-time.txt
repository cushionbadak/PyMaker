Natural Text
I'm currently working on a small project, but I got a problem, I don't know how to convert this "2017-12-22T05:00:00+01:00" time, to an readable time, I would like to get it to this format "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S". Without success so far, is there something I can do to archive this?
First you need to parse the input datetime string into a datetime object. Then convert the datetime object to the required format. The easiest way to do that is with the third-party dateutil package. You can install it with pip.Converting to a new format can be done with datetime.strftime():
See the answer to this question: How to print date in a regular format in Python?It's a very comprehensive answer with links to the documentations
If it's the same string each time, you could use something like this:(but there's probably a much better way to do it.)
