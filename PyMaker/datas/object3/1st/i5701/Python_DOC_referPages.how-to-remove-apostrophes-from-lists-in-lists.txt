I'm trying to calculate line averages from a .csv file and return a list of the averages of each line. Currently, I can get but I need to remove the apostrophes as to average the individual lists! I have tried using int() but have had no luck.My desired outputmy current code is:
You are re-inventing the CSV-reader wheel here. Use the csv module to handle the splitting for you instead; we then only have to convert the string columns to integers:This produces a generator, and iteration gives you rows with integers:You can also return a list of lists:Your attempt splits on whitespace, and not on commas. You'd have to explicitly split on ',', and convert your columns to integers:I used nested list comprehensions here to produce a list of lists, transforming each line from the file to a list of integers.I also used the file as a context manager in a with statement; this makes sure the file is closed no matter what happens in the managed block; there is no need to manually close it.I also used the file as an iterator; each time you iterate (like the for loop would do) you get the next line in the file. There is no need to read all lines up front with file.readlines().
