Hello I'm a learning developer and I'm facing a challenge that i am so confused with it that i dont know where to even star from.this is the challenge: You'll probably want to use try and except on this one. You might have to not use the else block, though.Write a function named squared that takes a single argument.If the argument can be converted into an integer, convert it and return the square of the number (num ** 2 or num * num).If the argument cannot be turned into an integer (maybe it's a string of non-numbers?), return the argument multiplied by its length. Look in the file for examples. and in the coding section all there is is this: I would really appreciate the help.
Here's some psuedo code to get you started:Some useful python docs you should read: Getting the length of an objectConversion to intTry and except
