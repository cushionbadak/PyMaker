This question already has an answer here:Check if a given key already exists in a dictionary                    21 answers                Access dict key and return None if doesn't exist                    6 answers                I am looking for a convenient, safe python dictionary key access approach. Here are 3 ways came to my mind.All three methods work, of-course. But is there any simple out of the box  way to achieve this without having to use excess ifs or custom functions?I believe there should be, because this is a very common usage.
You missed the canonical method, dict.get():It'll return None if the key is missing. You can set a different default as a second argument:
Check out dict.get(). You can supply a value to return if the key is not found in the dictionary, otherwise it will return None.
