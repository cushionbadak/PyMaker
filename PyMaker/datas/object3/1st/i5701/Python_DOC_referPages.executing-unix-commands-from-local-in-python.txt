I need to execute unix commands from my local in python. I can connect to the server and create files, however anytime I try to execute commands, I get no result on the server.The path to the server iswhere M is a mapped windows network drive.I can use fh to create a file and write to it, but then I need to change the permissions to executable and execute it in another call.How can I do this?
Try using os.chmod as seen here https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.chmod to change permissionsTo execute you can use subprocess.Popen(["executable_file"],  stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
