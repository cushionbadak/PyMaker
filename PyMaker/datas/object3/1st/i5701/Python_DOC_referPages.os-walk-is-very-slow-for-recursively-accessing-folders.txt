My data-set have more than 1000 folders and i am using os.walk for recursively accessing each image inside every folder. os.walk went well for few folders but loading 1000 more folders its very slow. I need alternate solution or if anything that can handle this issue.You can see the code something similar:
debug your code and execute file sequentially you can use sorted(os.walk(path)) and check at which file your code slows down.check this it might help how os.walk works
You question is not clear but Python has os.scandir that don't call stat on each file and is much faster. Related doc.PyPI package for old Python versions (<3.5) https://pypi.python.org/pypi/scandir.
