I am new to python and trying to simply replace the values of a list when they meet a condition with values from a shorter list.For example:The output I want is:I can use a loop with a counter:But this seems inefficient for something so simple, so I'm guessing there might be a way to do this with a list comprehension, something like:(although this fails due the lists being different lengths).Is there any other concise way of doing this in base python, perhaps using map or filter?
You can use an iterator made from the short list and just call next on it in the comprehension:Note that you can provide a default value to next if there are not enough filler elements:
Try something like:Note this removes items from list2.
If you want to use map(), you could try this:Which outputs:Note: I used a stack/queue data structure, collections.deque to allow a O(1) popleft() from the front, instead of using pop(0), which is O(n). If you don't wish to use this library, you can just reverse list2 beforehand, and call pop(), which is also O(1). 
You can try this:Output:
