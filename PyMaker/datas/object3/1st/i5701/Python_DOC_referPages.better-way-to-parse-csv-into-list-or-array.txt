Is there a better way to create a list or a numpy array from this csv file?  What I'm asking is how to do it and parse more gracefully than I did in the code below.
You should never parse CSV structures manually unless you want to tackle all possible exceptions and CSV format oddities. Python has you covered in that regard with its csv module.The main problem, in your case, stems from your data - there seems to be two different CSV structures in a single file so you first need to find where your second structure begins. Plus, from your code, it seems you want to filter out all columns before Details_Table0_Netbios_Name0 and include only rows whose Details_Table0_Netbios_Name0 starts with SMZ- or MTR-. So something like:should do the trick.
You can always use Pandas. As an example,To convert it, you will have to convert it to your favorite numeric type. I guess you can write the whole thing in one line:You can also do the following:
You can use pandas and specify header column to make it work correctly on you sample fileYou can check your content using:You can check headers usingAnd to convert it to numpy array you can useIt comes with a lot of options to parse and read csv files. For more information please check the docs
I am not sure what you want but try thisthis should read the csv line by line and store it as a list
