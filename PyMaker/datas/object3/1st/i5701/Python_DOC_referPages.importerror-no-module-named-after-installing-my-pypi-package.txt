To add a __init__.py in getHello:
Python is likely trying to import from the 'getHello' subdirectory in your tree (or, the getHello.py file), not the package you just installed.The way Python finds and loads modules can be occasionally surprising.  See:  https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html#searchingUse the -v command line option with the Python interpreter to see exactly what's going on. To avoid any confusion about what exactly is importing, start the Python interpreter from another directory (one that doesn't have a getHello subdirectory, or a file named getHello.py).
