In Python, True != True is False, and False != True should be True. However, shouldn't the result of the evaluation then be True, as well?
This is because the two checks are preformed independently. True != True != True is equivalent to True != True and True != True, which evaluates to False, as neither of the operands evaluates to True (in fact, it doesn't even evaluate the second True != True comparison, due to short-circuiting).The relevant documentation:Comparisons can be chained arbitrarily, e.g., x < y <= z is equivalent to x < y and y <= z, except that y is evaluated only once (but in both cases z is not evaluated at all when x < y is found to be false).
