I found this code in CodeChef twitter https://twitter.com/codechef/status/941329495046459395 . It was written in C. I did it in Python3. Here is my code:And this is the answer:My question is, why my 'vegas' function is not swapping the value of variable 'a' and 'b'
It won't work the way you intend it for work. This question is answering this in full. In short: Python turns the arguments a and b into two variables which are only visible in vegas. They are initiated with the values of a and b but then have no relation to the outside a and b variables.To make your code work, do this:Also, you might be interested to know that you can swap two values with a,b = b,a
This code snippet is a joke that "what happens in vegas stays in vegas" because the function doesn't affect the values of the variables. To affects the values, the function needs to return the result of the swap. Without a return statement, the function will not affect variables since the function creates its own temporary variables to be used within the function.
Yes and no...The function vegas do the work but never returns a and b so a and b still 6 and 9 outside. Arguments are passed by assignment in Python.You can see more here
