My ultimate goal is to let the user draw a closed curve and get a matrix with the positions of those points. Obviously those points would be infinite but lets say they consist of a grid of points that are separated by 0.1 units Finally I will place any point in the 'canvas' and guess if its inside or outside the curve--> this last part I already know how to do it.
you need a lib to get you the graphics, then you can read it. for that You're looking for turtle or tkinter:https://docs.python.org/3.1/library/turtle.html https://docs.python.org/3/library/tk.html
