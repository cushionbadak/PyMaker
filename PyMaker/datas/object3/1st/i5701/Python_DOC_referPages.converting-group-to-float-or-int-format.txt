Natural Text
This is a followup to Python. How to print a certain part of a line after it had been "re.searched" from a fileHere is the initial code, based on the accepted answer to the linked question:I was able to find the requested IP address in text file.My goal is to somehow convert the string "10.226.27.60" to a format that would allow me to use it in mathematical formulas. For example, I want to get another address "10.226.27.59" by subtracting 1 from the last octet of the original address.
You can use the ipaddress module for Python 3:The IPv4Address class allows for arithmetic operatorsDocs: https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipaddress.html#operators
You could take the string (what you end up with):and then split on '.' and use a list-comprehension to convert the parts to integers:and then finally, subtract 1 from the last element:to get p as:Note that if you want to display this list in the original string format, then you can use join with a generator-expression:
You can do:[10, 226, 27, 60] you can calculate each element convert back:10.226.27.60
