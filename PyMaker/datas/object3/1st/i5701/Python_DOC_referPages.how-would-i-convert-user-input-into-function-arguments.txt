I'm trying to make a custom command line to control a robotic arm.So I want to be able to run the program and type in servoMove(arg1,arg2) and have arg1 and arg2 get transferred into the function servoMove. I believe that is what you would call a command line interface.Clearly, the code below doesn't work for this.Does anybody know how I can do this?
You can use a regular expression to parse the command.This is a really crude way to do it -- if the user doesn't enter the command exactly right it will complain that the command is unknown. If you want something more robust, you need to learn how to write a real parser. Or use a better user interface, such as Tkinter to implement a form that the user can fill out.
Just looking at the structure the problem is in the if statement: arg1 and arg2 are undefined at that stage, so you'll get a False. For starters you'd want to replace that with something like:To extract your arguments, I'd use some string manipulation as in here. I've sliced the input to take the text between "(" and "," as arg1, and "," and ")" as arg2.Putting it together:
You can use the cmd module to build a command line interface.Here's an example:
