NEWBIE USING PYTHON (2.7.9)- When I export a gzipped file to a csv using: It is printing in the csv with a comma deliminated in every character. eg. How do I get rid of the comma so that it is exported with the correct fields? eg. SVR,2144370,20161804,50501342364,,565929674,2007245235,0002,1,PPDAP,PPLUS,DEACTIVE,,,EN,N/A,214370,:IR_,N/A,,,,,  SVR,473455,208082557,14501648637,,2000553929280,2044108378,0002,1,3G,CODAP,INACTIVE,,,EN,N/A,35455,:IR_,N/A,,,,,
You are only opening the gzip file.  I think you are expecting the opened file to act automatically like an iterator.  Which it does.  However each line is a text string.  The writerows expects an iterator with each item being an array of values to write with comma separation.  Thus given an iterator with each item being a sting, and given that a string is an array of characters you get the result you found. Since you didn't mention what the gzip data lines really contain I can't guess how to parse the lines into an array of reasonable chunks.  But assuming a function called 'split_line' appropriate to that data you could doOf course at this point doing row by row and putting the with lines together makes sense.See https://docs.python.org/2/library/csv.html
I think it's simply because gzip.open() will give you a file-like object but  csvwriter.writerows() needs a list of lists of strings to do its work. But I don't understand why you want to use the csv module. You look like you only want to extract the content of the gzip file and save it in a output file uncompressed. You could do that like that:If you want to use the csv module because you're not sure your input data is  properly formatted (and you want an error message right away) you could then do:Is that what you were trying to doÂ ? It's difficult to guess because we don't have the input file to understand. If it's not what you want, could you care to clarify what you want?
Since I now have information the gzipped file is itself comma, separated values it simplifies thus..In other words it is just a round about gunzip to another file.
