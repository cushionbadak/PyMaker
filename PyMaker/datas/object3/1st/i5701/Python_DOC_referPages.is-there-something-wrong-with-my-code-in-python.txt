This is what I did during my free time, but for some reason whenever I try this code, I get everything. The goal for it is to pick a random number from 1 to 6. Instead, this is what I get
The value of number is the tuple (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), so this is working as expected. If you want to select a random number from that set, you might try using the random.sample functionExample:or, if you know that you're always going to be using a selection from a contiguous range, you can use randint

If seq is empty, raises IndexError.As for the problem in your code, you are not getting any randomly generated numbers or selecting from the tuple, but are rather just printing the whole tuple.
Yes it's wrong in your code you just printing list of ints. To get a random number you need to use random.randint function like:
