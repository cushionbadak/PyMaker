I'm not sure if this is possible as having trouble finding and answer online, could be as I don't know have to work the question. so the code below is a basic example of what I am trying to do. I have a list of the Name class and want to return True if a name already exists in there. If know how I could get this working?
There are a couple of ways you could do this.The easiest is to iterate through with any:The more complex version is to define an __eq__ method on your class:and now your original "bob" in i code will work.(For real code, you'd probably want to check in that method if you're between two instances of Names, rather than with a string.)
You can iterate over your list and check the .name attribute of each object against your string.
To point out more detail.When you ask you are asking if the string "bob" is in the list. Even if you ask ifyou get False because that exact object isn't in the list.You can add an __eq__ method inside you class if you want to treate Names with the same name as identical:
