Can someone shed some light on what I'm doing wrong with my code?I'm using Python 3.6. And a beginner. Thanks!
The input() returns a string, so you have a string in user_input. In dice1, you have an integer. Try print(type(user_input)) and print(type(dice1)). You cannot compare values of different types.Convert the value in user_input to an int, then compare it with dice1, like so:Running the above code:More about input():input([prompt])If the prompt argument is present, it is written to standard output without a trailing newline. The function then reads a line from input, converts it to a string (stripping a trailing newline), and returns that.
What you are really looking for is a while loop that keeps asking for the hidden number as long as you have the wrong answer. As the user Li357 stated, in Python3 the input is always a string, so you have to convert it to an int. In Python2 you wouldn't have to put the int (just in this specific case)
convert the input to an integer:
