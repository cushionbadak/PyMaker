I have this nested list of strings which is in it's final stage of cleaning. I want to replace the non letters in the nested list with spaces or create a new list without the non-letters. Here is my list:And this is the pattern that I want to use in order to clean it all the code doesn't work and this is the error that I get: I understand that list is not a string but a list of lists of strings, how do I fix it?Any help will be very much Appreciated!
You need to step deeper into your listAdditionally, you must not name your variables list.
You are attempting to pass a list to re.search, however, only strings are allowed since pattern matching is supposed to occur. Try looping over the list instead:Also, note that your original variable name, list, shadows the builtin list function and in this case will assign the list contents to the attribute list.
First of all, shadowing a built-in name like list may lead to all sorts of troubles - choose your variable names carefully.You don't actually need a regular expression here - there is a built-in isalpha() string method:Return true if all characters in the string are alphabetic and there is at least one character, false otherwise. Here is how you can apply the same filtering logic but using map and filter (you would need the help of functools.partial() as well):
