I'm new to python and self learning wherever possible. I'm trying to read data from a .csv file containing integers into a one dimensional array (python list).The .csv file looks like this:I tried like this:I get a 'list of lists' (2D array) instead of the linear list I intended.Also, I would like the list to contain integers and not strings.
Actually, you are not getting a list of lists, but a list of strings (the lines in your file), with each string looking like a list. First, you need to split the lines. You could do this using line.split(","), but since you are having a CSV file, you should instead just use the csv module. This will also take care of removing the "..." for you.Now, we have an actual list of lists: [['1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8'], ['9', '10', '11', '12', '13', '14', '15', '16']]Next, if you want a flat list with all the numbers from all the lines, you should use extend instead of append, and you can also cast those str to int:This gives you [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. You can also do all this in a single line using a list comprehension:
