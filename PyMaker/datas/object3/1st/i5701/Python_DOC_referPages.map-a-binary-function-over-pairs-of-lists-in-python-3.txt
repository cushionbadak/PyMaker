This question already has an answer here:Getting a map() to return a list in Python 3.x                    9 answers                Why do I get in Python2and in Python3?What should replace map(max,[1,2],[3,1]) in Python3 ?I read that one should use list comprehension in Python3 but does not give the desired result and neither do the variations that came to mind.
That's because Python2 returns a List for multiple return values.From Pydoc[2]:If there are multiple arguments, map() returns a list consisting of  tuples containing the corresponding items from all iterables (a kind  of transpose operation). The iterable arguments may be a sequence or  any iterable object; the result is always a list.Whereas Python3 returns an Iterable.From Pydoc[3]:Return an iterator that applies function to every item of iterable,  yielding the results.So to get the list in Python3, just do :Basically :
