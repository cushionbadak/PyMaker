I'm new to Python and trying to get my head round creating a case statement equivalent which will store sql strings that I want to pull out of a dictionary and then execute. The problem is that the sql statements themselves will have variables/functions within them (effectively they are dynamic sql statements). I've read a myriad of comments about whether dict or if..else is the best way to implement what I'm trying to achieve in Python.Here's my starting code which doesn't return what I want it toOutput when passing CR, bloggsj, APP for example isWhen I wanted it to come back withHow do I get it to recognise user as a variable and execute the genpass() function ?
Assuming you use pymssql, you could do something like this:In short: prepare switcher, where the actual parameters are replaced with placeholders (pymssql uses a syntax similar to Python's) â€” no need to create it every time in the function. Then, collect parameters passed as keyword arguments and let the library do its magic matching the names and escaping anything dangerous.Note that the output of print() before executing the command does not necessarily match the actual query sent to the database and is for illustrative purposes only.
Now in temp_action, temp_user and temp_role you data will get saved. You can use you where ever you want . But I will recommend you , if you want to reuse the same variables again again in different functions, just go for the classes.Try this, if you face any problem just let me know.Enjoy coding:)
