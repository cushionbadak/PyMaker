I have implemented a script that connects to a Cisco device and collects the show run output. The script is:The script output is:QuestionIs there a way to change the script so the output is presented line by line way?
The documentation for telnetlib isn't very clear about Telnet.read_very_eager, but it mentions that it reads and writes bytes for other methods. type(s) is probably bytes.Use bytes.decode to get a string: print(s.decode('ascii')) (use the appropriate encoding)Note: This is for Python 3.
You need to check the string with some common special character that separates the lines using python split() function and after that initiate a for loop with the length of variable and then print.
