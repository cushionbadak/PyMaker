I have a string host which can be a hostname (without domain), ipv4 address or ipv6 address.Is there a simple way to determine if this refers to localhost loop-back device?Python Version: 2.7
You could check if IP address of the inputted host within loopback address block, 127.0.0.0/8 for IPv4, ::1 for IPv6:yields:Update: there is a python2 backport of python3 ipaddress library, you could replace checker part with checking against its .is_loopback property, internal logic is the same.
try this on Unix:you need the subprocess module to find out the local hostnameimport subprocesshn = subprocess.Popen(['hostname'], stdout=subprocess.PIPE)hn_out = hn.stdout.readline().strip('\n')Test if "host" string is the IPv4 loop back address, IPv6 loop back address or if it's the local host nameif host == '127.0.0.1' or host == '::1' or host == hn_out:    print("It's localhost")
