I'm running a Python script on my windows 10 machine. The script reads compressed data files, stored as .tar.gz, processes it, and then reads the next one. In this manner it processes thousands of files.I run the scipt in a windows10 powershell, and -seemingly randomly- I often get the following error:Some times this happens after a day, sometimes already after a few minutes.I select 'Close program' and the script is terminated. Looking into Windows event viewer, I can see the following entry:Faulting application name: python.exe, version: 3.6.2150.1013, time  stamp: 0x59c1326e Faulting module name: multiarray.cp36-win_amd64.pyd,  version: 0.0.0.0, time stamp: 0x59c3eeda Exception code: 0xc0000005Any ideas on how to avoid this error message?
0xc0000005 means 'memory access violation' error.The related info seems to indicate this happens when python is processing arrays.You can try to trouble shoot by adding logs so you can identify the issue.The problem may be solved by changing related code.If you are able to replicate the issue consistently and the python code seems correct - it may be a rare case of a bug in python.
