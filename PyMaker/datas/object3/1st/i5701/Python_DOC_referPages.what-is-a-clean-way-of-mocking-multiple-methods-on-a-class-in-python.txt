When writing tests I am often faced with the needed to mock several class methods. Currently I am doing this by nesting with statements contain the mock references e.g.Is there a neater / recommended way of doing this? It would be nice to be able to remove several nested calls!During this process there may or may not be other methods on the class that are not mocked.
