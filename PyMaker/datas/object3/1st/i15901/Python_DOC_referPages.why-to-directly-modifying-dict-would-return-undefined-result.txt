I'm reading the book 'Beginning Python'. In which it mentions:In general, you should not modify the dictionary returned by vars because, according to the official Python documentation, the result is undefined. In other words, you might not get the result youâ€™re after.I'm confused here.As vars() get the __dict__ of the specified object.And all the variable in that scope are based on that __dict__. How could it be so called undefined when modify it?e.g. I did this:Won't this x keep the value of 2 in that scope until someone changed the value of x? So, what does result is undefined mean here?
Maybe the documentation does answer your question:Objects such as modules and instances have an updateable __dict__ attribute; however, other objects may have write restrictions on their __dict__ attributes (for example, classes use a dictproxy to prevent direct dictionary updates).
As the documentation states:Without an argument, vars() acts like locals(). Switching to locals, then:Note: The contents of this dictionary should not be modified; changes may not affect the values of local and free variables used by the interpreter.Note the "may not"; undefined means exactly that, there isn't an exact definition for what should happen. In other words, it's not guaranteed and you shouldn't write code that relies on it (either way).
