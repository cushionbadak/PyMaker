This question already has an answer here:How do I use a Boolean in Python?                    6 answers                I wrote some code for a python file scanner, but the only problem is my custom error codes won't run! I have to use 1 and 0 for the true and false because python3 doesn't accept true and false! Here's the code.****UPDATE BECAUSE I'M NEW TO STACK AND HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO REPLY****I tried some new stuff and it works...but only on certain files. It can scan lots of them, but sometimes it just hits one and gives the IO error after the program is done. Here's the new code
..... What?
