Natural Text
I'm a complete newbie in python. I've been trying to strip the first two characters and a period from a file that contains this data:I want to strip the 12.1 from line 1. Also, I want to remove the newline. But in line 3. there is a space after . I need to remove that too.So far this is what I've tried:import reCan someone guide me to get this thing done?
^ matches only the start of the line then \d{2} selects two numbers, \. the literal dot. sub replaces then everything selected by the aforementioned regular expression with an empty string (the second argument). strip() then removes whitespace from both ends of the result.Reference: https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.sub
Use str.partition() to get everything after the first dot, then str.strip() to remove all leading and trailing whitespace:Demo:Using str.partition() does result in an empty string if there is no . in the line. The alternative is to use str.split() with a separator and limit:which will result in the original line (but stripped) if there is no period at all.A quick demo showing the differences:
