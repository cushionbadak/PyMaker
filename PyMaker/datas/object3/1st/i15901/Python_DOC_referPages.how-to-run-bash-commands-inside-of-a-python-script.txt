I am trying to run both Python and bash commands in a bash script.In the bash script, I want to execute some bash commands enclosed by a Python loop:How can I do this?
Use subprocess, e.g.:There is another function like subprocess.call: subprocess.check_call. It is exactly like call, just that it throws an exception if the command executed returned with a non-zero exit code. This is often feasible behaviour in scripts and utilities.subprocess.check_output behaves the same as check_call, but returns the standard output of the program.If you do not need shell features (such as variable expansion, wildcards, ...), never use shell=True (shell=False is the default). If you use shell=True then shell escaping is your job with these functions and they're a security hole if passed unvalidated user input.The same is true of os.system() -- it is a frequent source of security issues. Don't use it.
Look in to the subprocess module. There is the Popen method and some wrapper functions like call.If you need to check the output (retrieve the result string):If you want to wait for execution to end before proceeding:If you need more functionality like setting environment variables, use the underlying Popen constructor:Remember subprocess is the higher level module. It should replace legacy functions from OS module.
I used this when running from my IDE (PyCharm).
