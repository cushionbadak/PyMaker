In a running instance of python, is there a function I can call to say "Hey python, refresh what you know about timezone information"?  So lets say I open python, and then I change /etc/localtime .  How can I get python to update to the new timezone?  My goal is to not mess around with the TZ environment variable or reference /etc/localtime directly or use any OS-specific commands.  I would also like to not restart python.  Is this possible?
The answer I was looking for was time.tzset():
time and tzlocal:
