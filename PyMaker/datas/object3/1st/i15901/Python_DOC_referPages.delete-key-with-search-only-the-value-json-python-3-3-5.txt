i want to search only the Value in my Dictionary. I got this strucutre in my JSONfile So, how i can now search at the same time for the Values "Name", "Nachname" and "Keyword" and when i find the 3 Values in the Key, to remove the hole Key, for example, i search the Values in the key "Teilnehmer2" and i find the 3 values, than i want to remove the hole key Teilnehmer2 from my JSONfile ? I dont know, how to do that :/
How about something like this:In the for statement, we're iterate over key/value pairs in the dictionary using items() and for each value, we get the "Name", "Nachname" and "Keyword" before delete the key from the dict using the del statement.Is this what you're trying to do?
If you want to remove the keys/dicts that contain the keys "Name", "Nachname","Keyword"
