Natural Text
I am trying to make a function that takes a string(key) and returns the slot number the hash table.Such that:    The function needs to convert each letter of the string to number form using alphabet position(eg. a=1, b= 2, c=3, etc). So the hash will be: John = 10+15+8+14= 47 -----> = 47 % tablesize(13) 
You can convert the string to lowercase with lower function and iterate through the characters in the word, with a for loop, like thisThen, you can get the character code corresponding to the character with ord function.Since we need to get the offset of the character in the alphabets, you can subtract the first value from the current value. Then finally, you can use modulo operator % to get the remainder of the division by tablesizeThe same can be written succintly with a generator expression and built-in sum function, like this
Use ord function and substract the ascii offset (a letter is 97 code, b is 98, and so on)
