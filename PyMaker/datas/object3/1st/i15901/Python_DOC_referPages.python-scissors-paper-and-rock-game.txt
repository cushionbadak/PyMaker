So, I'm making this game in python. The thing is, in scissors, paper and rock there can be different combinations like .. Rock and paper, Rock and scissors, and so on. So how would I make this without doing heaps of elif statements.So how do we make this game without having to do so many elif statements or type less code. Surely there has to be a better programming sequence for dealing with these types of things?
If you want to avoid the elif tree, you may use a set to store all the winning combinations:
How about doing a map of possible results:(Note that keys must be tuples). And then do a lookup with like this:You'll need to handle the case of the same choices (as you already do).
