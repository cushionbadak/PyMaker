Natural Text
I have been using python since last summer and i think that i have absorbed enough information to do at least basic programming.The thing is that i'm making text-based rpg-game and i have already done the saving process and the game now transfers information to savegame.txt. But i want to make game hacking harder. I saw in forums that changing file name is possible, but it wasn't close enough this case and/or i weren't able to read through lines how it works. So the idea is that it becomes unreadable format, but code inside won't change and it can be 'normalized' back.so more clearly:How do I change savegame.txt to savegame.xsave (or something like that) and vice versa?
I agree with the comments that this probably isn't the best use of your time. But the simplest thing to do would be to take advantage of the rot13 encoder.
Just encrypt all text in file with any encryption algorithm.For example, you can pycrypto library.
If you just want to make the text file unreadable you could just encode it with, for example, base64:You can read more here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/base64.html
