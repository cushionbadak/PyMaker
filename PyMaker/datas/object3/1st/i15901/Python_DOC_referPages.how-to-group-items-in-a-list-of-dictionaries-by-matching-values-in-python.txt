I have the following an array of dictionaries:how do I get the dictionaries that have the command with the second and third value after ';' respectively equal?For example: 'command': '1;2;3;4' is equals 'command': '2;2;3;4'
You can use itertools.groupby. You can construct a lambda expression that looks for the value corresponding to the 'command' key, then finds the [1] and [2] elements of splitting on the ';' character.OutputTo find groups that had more than one member, you need one more step:
You can iterate the items and for each item check the items to follow and compare the last part of 'command':OUTPUT
