I know similar questions exist for this topic but I've gone through them and still couldn't get it.My python program retrieves a subsection of html from a page using a regular expression. I just realised that I hadn't accounted for html special characters getting in the way.say I have:regex_title = ['I went to the store', 'Itlt&#039;s a nice day today', 'I went home for a rest']I obviously want to change lt&#039; to a single quote '.I've tried variations of:but had no success. What am I missing.NOTE: The purpose is to do this without importing any more modules. 
str.replace does not replace in-place. It returns the replaced string. You need to assigned back the return value.
If your task is to unescape HTML, then better use unescape function:
You need to change your code to this :But it doesn't change your list so you need to pass the replaced index to list:
You don't explain why you want to avoid importing standard library modules. There are very few good reasons to deny yourself the use of Python's included batteries; unless you have such a reason (and if you do, you should state it), you should use the functionality provided to you.In this case, it's the unescape() function from the html module: 1Reimplementing html.unescape() yourself isPointless.Error-prone.Going to mean constantly going back and adding new cases when new HTML entities crop up in your data.1 Since Python 3.4, anyway. For previous versions, use HTMLParser.HTMLParser.unescape() as per @stalk's answer.
Instead of doing this yourself, you'd be better off using the HTMLParser library, as described in https://stackoverflow.com/a/2087433/2314532. Read that question and answer for all the details, but the summary is:So in your case, you'd want to do something like:That will unescape any HTML escape, not just the &#039; escape that you asked about, and process the entire list all at once.
Try like this:-
