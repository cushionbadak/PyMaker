The decimal value 100 has a hex value of 64 as seen here. How can I convert 100 to that hex value? I have triedbut that returns(a bytes object with a length of 64) not what I want.Thank you for your help
Your copied output is wrong, compare bytes([source[, encoding[, errors]]]):As opposed to:To convert an integer v to a hex string, use: hex(v)
In python hex is inbuilt function to convert integer to hex value you can try:hex(100)will give you result:'0x64'
How about this?
