I wrote 3 Questions and I want to use Random Randint to pick and display one by one randomly. I don't know how to use Random Randint to use that in my Code. 
You wouldn't use random.randint() at all. You'd use random.choice() instead:The function picks one element at random from a sequence.If you need to produce questions at random without repetition, you want to do something different; you would use random.shuffle() to randomize the whole list of questions, then just pick one from that list (perhaps removing it from the list) every time you need a new question. That produces a random sequence of questions.or
Don't use randint, use random.choice. This function will select a random item from a list.
If you need to use randint because of an assignment, you can look at how choice works. Slightly simplified, it's this:And randint(a, b) is just "an alias for randrange(a, b+1)".So, you know how to use choice from Martijn Pieter's answer, you know what choice does, you should be able to figure out from there how to use randint from there.
If "you want to pick with replacement (that is, each time there's a 1/3 chance of each)":"without replacement (that is, each one only shows up once, so after 3 choices there's nothing left)":"or some hybrid (e.g., pick all 3 in random order, then repeat all 3 in random order again, etc.":
