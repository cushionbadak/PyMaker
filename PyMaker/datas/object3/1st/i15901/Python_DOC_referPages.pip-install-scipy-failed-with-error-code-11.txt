I was installing scipy for theano in virtualenv, it fails right after the start the installation. And it says it fails with error code -11. Could anyone can help me with this, what is the error code 11?Here is the full trace of the error, from the beginning of when I run the command:I break the second last line into several lines, for the convenience of reading.I think this is very strange that the error occurs barely after the installation starts and I have just use pip to install numpy successfully, so it's unlikely to be the problem of pip. Then, where is the problem? How should I fix it?Could it be related with the system? But I guess I cannot print the system information out since I don't have sudo permission...Could it because that our cluster is too old? That's the only explanation that I can think of. Thanks a lot!
Have you tried updating setuptools?Then try installing theano again. When I encountered this problem while developing my own package, the root cause was with imports in setup.py. I changed what setup.py imported and then it worked. Maybe theano's setup is importing a package which has an incompatible version?If the problem isn't solved by updating packages or editing imports in setup, you can try to debug by using the vvv flag to get more information, as in pip install -vvv theano. As for the error code you're seeing:A negative value -N indicates that the child was terminated by signal  N (Unix only)https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.Popen.returncodeCode 11 means segfault in *nix, although os.strerror(11) reports "Resource temporarily unavailable". Since I get segfaults when I attempt python setup.py egg_info, I'm betting it's the first (segfault) definition of 11 that's relevant.If your segfault dumped a core, it's probably in /var/lib/systemd/coredump/ if you're using systemd.https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/349433/183163If you can't find a core, check ulimit -c. If it reports 0, run ulimit -c unlimited to enable core dumping. You can get the full path to the most recent dump file by ls -rtd /var/lib/systemd/coredump/* | tail -1To read the dump, you can use gdb. For example:
