I've tried to make a simple function, that tosses coin n times, fifty (50) times in this example, and then stores the results to the list 'my_list'. Tosses are thrown using the for loop.If the result of the tosses are not 25 heads and 25 tails (i.e 24-26 ratio), it should erase the contents of the list my_list containing the results and loop  50 tosses again until the results are exactly 25-25.Function:Print the empty list.Start the while-loop which only ends, if my_list.count(1) is 25.Toss the coin using random(1,2).Input results to my_list.If my_list.count(1) is not exactly 25, then the code should erase the contents of the list and repeat the while loop.-- coding: latin-1 --ProblemWhen I try to use my_list.remove(1), it doesn't remove anything from the list. If I replace my_list.remove(1) with my_list.remove('test') and add 'test' to my_list, then the program removes 'test', if conditions is not met (as it should).Why it doesn't remove numbers? I'm not sure if these "1" and "2" are stored to list as int or as str. My guess is that in strWhat have I done wrong?
As @poke stated, list.remove(x) only removes the first appearance of x in list. I would simply use a new my_list list in every iteration and get rid of the entire if inside the loop.You don't need to check again if you have 25 heads inside the loop because you are just checking it in the loop condition while my_list.count(1) != 25BTW: is the same as your while condition but less readable.
list.remove(x) only removes the first item which equals to x, so you are only removing a single item each time with this:As such, you don’t clear your list at all. Instead, you can just clear the list completely, by setting it to a new empty list:Since you are only interested in the number of head/tails throws, you can also just count them instead of remembering all individual tosses. So you’d just have a counter:
