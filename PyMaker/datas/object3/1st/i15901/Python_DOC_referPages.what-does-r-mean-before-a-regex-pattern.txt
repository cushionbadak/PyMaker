I found the following regex substitution example from the documentation for Regex. I'm a little bit confused as to what the prefix r does before the string?
Placing r or R before a string literal creates what is known as a raw-string literal.  Raw strings do not process escape sequences (\n, \b, etc.) and are thus commonly used for Regex patterns, which often contain a lot of \ characters.Below is a demonstration:The only other option would be to double every backslash:which is just tedious.
The r means that the string is to be treated as a raw string, which means all escape codes will be ignored.The python document says this precisely:"String literals may optionally be prefixed with a letter 'r' or 'R'; such strings are called raw strings and use different rules for interpreting backslash escape sequences.
