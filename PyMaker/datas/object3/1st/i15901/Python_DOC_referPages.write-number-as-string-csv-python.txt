I'm trying to write a csv file from json data. During that, i want to write '001023472' but its writing as '1023472'. I have searched a lot. But dint find an answer.The value is of type string before writing. The problem is during writing it into the file.Thanks in advance. 
Convert the number to string with formatting operator; in your case: "%09d" % number.
Use the format builtin or format string method.If your "number" is actually a string, you can also just left-pad it with '0''s:The Python docs generally eschew % formatting, saying it may go away in the future and is also more finnicky; for new code there is no real reason to use it, especially in 2.7+.
