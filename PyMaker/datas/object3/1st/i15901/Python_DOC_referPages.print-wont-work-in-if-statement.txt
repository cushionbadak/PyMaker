When I run this script, it skips the print function in line 8. I cannot figure out why for the life of me. I have tried so many things to get this working but I just can't seem to figure out the problem here. I am very new to Python so excuse me if it's a very simple issue.Edit: woops, forgot the actual code! facepalm here it is:
When you type 'start' into stdin and then hit enter, the entire string including the newline character ends up being stored in line1. So in reality, line1 == 'start\n'. You need to remove that \n from the end of the string before you do your comparison. An easy way to do that is using str.rstrip:Edit:As Ashwini Chaudhary pointed out in the comments, you should really just be using raw_input (or input if using Python 3.x) instead of sys.stdin.readline. It would make your code shorter, and remove the need to strip the trailing newline altogether:
