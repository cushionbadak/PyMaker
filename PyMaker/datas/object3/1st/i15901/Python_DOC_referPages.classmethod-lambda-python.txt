I'm having a hard time understanding this piece of code.I understand that we are using some mock instead of the API endpoint to save time on the tests.What I don't understand is the classmethod(lambda cls: self.preapproval) structure.What is the point of using a lambda cls if inside the code I don't use at all the cls.I hope I'm clear enough, I'd be very happy if someone could shed some light on this one..Thanks a lot.
classmethod's first argument needs to be a function that takes one argument or more. Calling any of this will cause an error:This works, but it's too verbose:That's why that code uses lambda.Probably it can be improved a little bit:This makes it obvious that the argument is not needed.
cls is just a argument name for lambda ! and you don't use it at all ! lambda cls: self.preapproval) yields a function objec for classmethod ! , As lambda yields a function object you need to use it for pass self.preapproval because of classmethods first argument needs to be a function object !
