I have a strange bug that I'm encountering when trying to use multiprocessing.Pool.starmap. The minimum code needed to reproduce the bug is here :Basically, I have an array of pairs of parameters, something like this : [[move, otherParam], [move, otherParam], ...], I print out every first parameter to show that the moves are valid before using the starmap function. Then I call the starmap function using the pool that was created earlier, and tell it to use the pairs of parameters I have. Then, inexplicably, every move's coordinates become tuples of the form ((coordinate), ), instead of (coordinate).I can't seem to figure out why starmap would change the properties of an object passed to it, any help would be greatly appreciated, thanks.
This is an interesting one. The issue isn't just with starmap. It happens with all Pool functions - apply, map, etc. And, as it turns out, the issue isn't with multiprocessing at all. It's happens when you pickle/unpickle the Coordinate class:Pickling a tuple subclass isn't as straightforward as it looks, at it turns out. You can fix it by defining a __reduce__ method that fixes the pickling process:Now it pickles just fine:And your example code works fine, too.
