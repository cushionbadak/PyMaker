How can I get the most left part of relative path in python?I started with something like this:Then I removed some of it to get:Using:Now how can I get the most left part - the "1" ?I can only find tools that go from the right side, but in this case I want the most left thing because it correspondents with a user ID. Also I want to avoid going from the right side, because there might be more sub directories.
Using str.split might give incorrect results if names contain os.path.sep (escaped of course). The safest solution imho is:
poke mentioned the pathlib library that's built into Python 3.4. You can also use pathlib on Python 2.6 or 2.7 by running pip install pathlib, as stated here: http://pathlib.readthedocs.org/en/pep428.Your code would look like this:And use p.parts[0] to get the part you want.In fact, you could do the whole thing with pathlib as follows:
If you use Python 3.4, you could use the new pathlib for this.Otherwise, you could just use normal string manipulation to get that part, for example with str.partition:You could also use os.sep instead of '/' if you want to split on the operating systemâ€™s path separator.
