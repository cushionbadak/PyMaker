Kind of similar to a class, but should also work inside a class. I'm not sure if it's possible, and not sure the correct keywords to search for, so apologies if there's already an answer.For example, I mean like this -Then by typing location().x, you'd get the number 5. It'd be a lot better using location().x instead of location()[0] in my opinion.Edit: I'm asking for this way instead of a class as you may want to have it inside a class, something like objectInfo( object ).getLocation().x
Using collections.namedtuple:using namedtuple, you can still access the values using indexing [..]:UPDATEIf you use Python 3.3+, you can also use types.SimpleNamespace:Otherwise, use following class (which came from the above SimpleNamespace link):
You could use a "bunch":
You can do it as a matrixdef (x,y,z):x=1y=7z=10``return A=[x,y,z]and after you can take the numpers with this way A[1] for x .I thing you understand what i mean, and this is a way to have your variables in a series
