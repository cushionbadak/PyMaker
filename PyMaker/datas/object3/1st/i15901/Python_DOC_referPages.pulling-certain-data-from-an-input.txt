Im trying to extract a certain part of my input from the first line and use it to calculate the problem and then put it back together. For example,I want to extract the pounds and work that first or am I looking at this wrong? Here is the problem description:Write the pseudocode and the Python 3.3 program for the following problem. A monkey is being fed some food. Read in the starting weight in lbs:ozs. Also read in the ending weight in lbs:ozs (you may assume this is smaller than the starting weight. Find the difference and  print out the amount of food consumed by the monkey in lbs:ozs. Some sample data is shown below (with the corresponding output). Hints: convert all values to ounces first. Use the “find” command to locate the “:” in the input data (see sample2 on Y:).Run#1:>
Try this:
This should get you started. All that's left is to write the code that converts pounds and ounces to pounds, and to calculate how much food the monkey has consumed. Good luck.
