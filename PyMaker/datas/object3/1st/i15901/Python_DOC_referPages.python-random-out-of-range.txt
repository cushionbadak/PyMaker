I am writing a code in Python 3.3.3 that makes a list of 32 teams if you enter say 12 and makes sure that the team that is repeated the most is only repeated once more than that which is being repeated the least. If have done this:I run the program and enter 12 teams then done. It comes up with the following message:I know this means the number is not in the range of the array's length, but how do I fix this?Thanks for the feedback. I now have:However this returns the Error:
You should be aware that there is a special function for ramdonly choosing an element from a list:â€¦should do what you are intending.
random.randint(a, b) returns random integers between a and b inclusive. Here, randoms[len(randoms)] is giving an error. Try random.randrange or random.choice instead.
Try this
randint takes as arguments the inclusive bounds for the range. So if your lower bound is 0 you probably want to set the upper bound to len(randoms)-1.
