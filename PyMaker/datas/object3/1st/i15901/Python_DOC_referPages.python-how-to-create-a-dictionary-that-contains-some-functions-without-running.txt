I have the following dictionary containing a bunch of functions and their keys as in the bellow example:Actually there are about 5 times more, but I simplified it for this post...My question is, how should I proceed so that when I define the function_list dictionary, it will not run all the functions from it's content, rather just at when I call them in the following manner: function_list[current_selection], based on the value of current_selection parameter.I'm doing this so I don't have to have a long and complex if... elif statement like:If anyone could help me out, I would really appreciate it.Thanks!
Try this : 
The problem is you are making function calls. The values in the dictionary should be function references.function_list = {0:power_off}and then to call, function_list[0]().If you have to pass arguments, you can replace the function reference with a lambda expression.function_list = {1: lambda arg1, arg2: image_capture(arg1, arg2)}
