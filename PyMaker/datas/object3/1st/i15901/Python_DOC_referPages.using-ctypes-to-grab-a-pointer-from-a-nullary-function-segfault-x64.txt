I've reduced my problem to the following toy file and command:python -i -c "from ctypes import *;clib = cdll.LoadLibrary('/home/soltanmm/tmp/a.out');CFUNCTYPE(c_void_p).in_dll(clib,'r2')()"^ results in a segfault in a call directly within ffi_call_unix64.I'm on an AMD64 Linux machine running Python 2.7. What am I doing wrong?EDITTo lend weight to how the pointers don't matter, a second example that segfaults:python -i -c "from ctypes import *;clib = cdll.LoadLibrary('/home/soltanmm/tmp/a.out');CFUNCTYPE(c_int).in_dll(clib,'r1')()"
CFUNCTYPE is used for callbacks (or pointers to functions defined as a variable in the shared object). After you do cdll.LoadLibrary you should simply be able to call C functions on the returned library object directly. So something like this should work:Method in_dll is generally used to access variables that are exported from shared objects. Not functions themselves. An example of using in_dll would be something like this:File a.c:Python script:More on the usage of ctypes can found in the Python Documentation
