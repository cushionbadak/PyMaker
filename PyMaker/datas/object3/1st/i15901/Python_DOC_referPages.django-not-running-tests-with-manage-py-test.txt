I have a problem with Django's test. I start this command for running test:gastrobook is my app, tha comand would be fine for the Django's documentation, in fact it works but don't run nothing test but in tests.py i have written some test! This is that terminal say:This is my tests.py
from the unittest documentationA testcase is created by subclassing unittest.TestCase. The three individual tests are defined with methods whose names start with the letters test. This naming convention informs the test runner about which methods represent tests.change your test function to test_hard_no_more_than, then the test runner whould be able to discover the testcase.
Test methods need to be named starting with "test" for the test runner to find them. So your method should be called "test_hard_no_more_than".
