Here's what I want to doThe above code won't work, because the coord tuples get passed as x, and there is nothing for yA workaround that works isBut the first solution looks more elegant to me. Probably I've to add an extra step to split the coord tuple. How do I do that?
You can use tuple-unpacking to call the Vertex constructor:Or for your example:Alternatively, since you are on Python 2, you can also make the lambda accept a tuple:Instead of calling map (which actually returns a generator in Python 3, so your code wouldnâ€™t work there), you can also use a list comprehension to create the Vertex objects:
Just put parentheses around (x, y):Edit: it turns out the above won't work in Python 3 (PEP 3113).The following generator expression will work in both Python 2 and 3:
use zip along with unpack operator *:also, your __init__ signature is possibly wrong, as I assume it misses self argument:
