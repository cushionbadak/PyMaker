In a sample code I am taking start IP and end IP as input . Out of which I will create a list of IP pool. I want to add a validation that start IP should be always lesser than end IP.How can I validate that start_ip should be lesser than end_ip ? 
Convert the strings to a list of ints.Then, it's possible to compare them as you want:
If you use Python 3.x then you can use the ipaddress stdlib package which has objects designed for ip addresses. These objects support comparison in this way.py2-ipaddress can be used (with some reduced functionality) if you are using Python 2.7.
