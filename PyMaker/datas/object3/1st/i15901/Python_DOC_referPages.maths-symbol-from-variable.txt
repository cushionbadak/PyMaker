I have a challenge at school, but i am stuck with a small bit of my code.Here's what I have; what I'm missing is how to finish the answer = line:The variables num1, num2 and symbol are randomly generated, num1 and num2 are both integers, and symbol is either '+', '-', '*' or '/' I was wondering how to use these to get an answer to an equation. For example, num1 is 50, symbol is '-', and num2 is 25. How would I use the variables to get the answer 25?
The clean way to do this is to create a mapping from symbols to functions.The only question is, what is the function behind the + operator?The answer is in the operator module: a + b is operator.add(a, b), and so on. So:I'm assuming here that you want 100 / 3 to be 33, not 33.333333333333336. If I'm wrong, use truediv instead of floordiv above. (See Numbers in the tutorial for an introduction to the difference, with links to more details.)Anyway, now, you can do this:Even if you didn't have operator, you could always build a function for each operator:This may come in handy if you want to extend your language to a symbol that doesn't have a matching operator in Python.If your maths language is a strict subset of Python's expression language (which it may not beâ€”notice that the symbol '/' maps to the Python operator // if you want integers), and you're sure that you're never going to extend it in a way that isn't (e.g., using ^ for exponentiation), and you're sure that you will never be using any numbers or symbols that you didn't generate yourself, it may be simpler to just build a Python expression and eval it:However, you should always be careful about using eval; if the clean thing to do is simple enough for you to write, and to read and understand later, it's almost always a better answer.
I think the best way is creating conditonals and check the symbol..
