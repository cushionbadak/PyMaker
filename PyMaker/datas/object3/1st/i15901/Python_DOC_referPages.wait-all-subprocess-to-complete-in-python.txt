I have a method which executes a command using subprocess,I want to call that method "n" no of times and wait for all "n" subprocess to complete for example:
You need to store references to the Popen objects to call wait methods of them later.(The code in the question overwrites the Popen object with the last Popen object, and waits only the last sub-process.)Other issuesThe code is passing the entire list (directory) instead of item.The last if statement should compare __name__ with '__main__'.
