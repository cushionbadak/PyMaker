I am trying to make a simple calculator that calculates basic statistic functions. I am almost done but I cannot figure out how to make a user input a list of numerical values. This is where I am currently at:This gives me the error: TypeError: can't convert type 'str' to numerator/denominatorHere is a link to all the code: http://pastebin.com/B7u5a6LA
Change those to int with int(some_string):EDIT: As suggested by @tobias_k and @DSM, you can use map fucntions:
Depending on how robust to bad input you want to be, you can do the following in one line to get it done:Note that the user entering something that wasn't a number, or something that wasn't a comma delimited list of numbers, will cause this to throw a ValueError. If that is something you're worried about.
