Is there a better way than what I am doing?
You can use the string replace function with a maximum count:as in the following transcript:From the documentation:str.replace(old, new[, count])Return a copy of the string with all occurrences of substring old replaced by new. If the optional argument count is given, only the first count occurrences are replaced.
Will replace a only once with nothing, hence removing it.
