First, your regex doesn't even attempt to capture anything but four dotted numbers, so of course it's not going to match anything else, like a /32 on the end. if you just add, e.g., /\d{1,2} to the end, it'll fix that:Debuggex DemoHowever, if you don't understand regular expressions well enough to understand that, you probably shouldn't be using a regex as a piece of "magic" that you'll never be able to debug or extend. It's a bit more verbose with str methods like split or find, but maybe easier to understand for a novice:As a side note, depending on what you're actually doing with these things, you might want to use the ipaddress module (or the backport on PyPI for 2.6-3.2) rather than string parsing:You can combine that with either of the above:
In this particular case, a regex might be overkill, you could use splitThis should produce a list of strings, which are the ip addresses.
