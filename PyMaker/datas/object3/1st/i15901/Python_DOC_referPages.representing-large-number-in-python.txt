Natural Text
I am getting a large value as a string as followsI want to do arithmetic as (100/d)*sTo do this, I need to convert the strings to appropriate large values. What would be the way to represent them as a number?
Just convert them using float. Python takes care of creating appropriately large representation. You can read more about Numerals here.You could convert them using int, but as @GamesBrainiac pointed, that will work only in Python3; in Python2 it will most of the time give you 0 as result.
If s and d are large e.g., thousands of digits then you could use fractions module to find the fraction:float has finite precision; It won't work for very large/small numbers.
