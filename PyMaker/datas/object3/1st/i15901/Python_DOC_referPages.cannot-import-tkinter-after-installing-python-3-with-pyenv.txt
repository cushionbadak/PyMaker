I got problems with importing tkinter after installing Python version 3.4.2 with pyenv. My system Python is version 2.7.6. I am using Ubuntu 14.04. For the following sample script t.py:I get:Note that pyenv installed Python version 3.4.2 in ~/.pyenv/versions/3.4.2/.
This problem seems to be solved now using the approach described in this post:First uninstall Python 3.4.2 : pyenv uninstall 3.4.2, thenRun  sudo apt-get install tk-devAnd reinstall Python 3.4.2 : pyenv install 3.4.2
Change your code to:Documentation link:Most of the time, tkinter is all you really need, but a number of additional modules are available as well. The Tk interface is located in a binary module named _tkinter. This module contains the low-level interface to Tk, and should never be used directly by application programmers. It is usually a shared library (or DLL), but might in some cases be statically linked with the Python interpreter.
