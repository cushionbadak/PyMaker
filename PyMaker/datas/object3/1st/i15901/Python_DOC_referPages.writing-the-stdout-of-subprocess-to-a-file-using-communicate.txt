I am using subprocess to run a executable and piping the output of it using communicate. Finally, I write the contents of communicate to a file. The exact code is shown belowIn the above process, the logfile is written at the end of the run. However, is there a way to write the output to the log as the executable is running?
You mean something like:
I think I found the solution to this:The first line creates the run.log for writing and stdout writes directly to the logfile as the executable is running. The run.wait() waits for the executable to complete and then the log file is closed.
