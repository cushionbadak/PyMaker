I am trying to extract statistics for an image such as the "mean", "standard-deviation" etc.However, I cannot find anything related in the python-wand documentation about it.From the command line I can get such statistics like this:orHow to get such info from a python program using wand?
Currently, wand doesn't support any of the statistic methods from ImageMagick's C-API (outside of histogram and EXIF). Luckily the wand.api is offered for extending functionality.Find the method you need in MagickWand's documentation.Use ctypes to implement data types/structures (reference header .h files)Extend wand.image.Image, and use the newly supported methods.
Just a note to anyone following the excellent suggestion by @emcconville:The documentation on the imagemagick site is for v7.xWand will only work with imagemagick 6.xIn IM6.x, there is actually one more field on the end of _ChannelStatistics, a double called entropy, and if you leave it out of your ChannelStatistics declaration your structure won't align properly with what you get back and it'll contain a bunch of nonsense
