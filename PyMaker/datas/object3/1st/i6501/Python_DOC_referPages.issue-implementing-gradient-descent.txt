I'm implementing gradient descent from scratch and I've got a segment of code which is giving me trouble.It's not changing theta_new[j]. If I print theta_new[j] just after the assignment of theta_new[j] then it gets changed, but somehow the third line in which I assign theta_old[j] reverts theta_new[j] back to initial value. I assume this has something to do with how arrays are referenced, but I can't wrap my head around it.
You should use deep copy to copy objects and create a new memory value and a new pointer :https://docs.python.org/3/library/copy.html
