So here's what my program does. It takes in a file of emails and checks it one by one to see if it is valid.The problem is when I load a list with more than one email, the emails after the first all end up saying "The email must not contain any invalid characters in the domain."Can someone tell me why this happens and how I can fix it?Cheers,
When reading from a file, your lines will end with a newline character of some sort (\r\n or \n).  If you want to parse it line by line, you should make sure to strip the line of trailing and leading spaces:See string.stripAdditional tips:Regarding this snippet:Snippet:You could condense all this into a set, like this:At the cost of having less readable error messages, you could condense this into a regular expression.Your parsing does not accept all valid email addresses (such as those that include a + or a . in the left side of the @).  Something like email_regex = re.compile(r'.+@.+\..+') would be a simple regex that covers most use cases (given the issues with validating email).
Starting with the line if "@" not in line:, you need to give everything another indentation, I think.
