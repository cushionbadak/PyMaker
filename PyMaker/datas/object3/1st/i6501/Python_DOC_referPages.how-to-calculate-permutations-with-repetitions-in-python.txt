How to find number of permutations when items are repeated?For example, for the string aab I want the following output: aab, aba, baa.
You can use the standard-library itertools module:By executing that code, I get the following output:
The following should work:The permutations will produce all permutations, but it will repeat some of it's output because it can't differentiate between a1 a2 b  and a2 a1 b. Here a1 is the first occurrence of a, and a2 the second. So you need to just keep the unique elements, and a set is a good way to do that, as the constructor transforms the input iterable into a unique collection.
