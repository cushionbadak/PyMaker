Using python fabric, how do I check if a file pattern such as /foo/bar_* exists remotely on a machine?It would be useful to also get a list of those files which matched.
I use glob from the python standard library.I just reread your question - you want to know this on the remote computer.Although I can't find an API that does this for you, I have noticed a couple of ways.getThis solution only really works if you want to have the files locally, or their size is negligable.echo (via run)This could look something like this;That solves the issue of needing to know if the file exists. However it does have problems as far as working out which files exist - as parsing it out isn't that trivial (ie, files/folders with spaces in their names). It should get you started for now though.
