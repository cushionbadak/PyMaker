I am looking for regular expression for validation IP address for different maskExample:among these IP's I need to parse(find) IP for 10.0.1.1 only .
Try using the python ip_address library found here (https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipaddress.html)What you can try to do is parse them all into a list of objects
Simple regex to match exactly that number of digits in ip is following:\d{2}(\.\d{1}){3}Pythex for that regular expression
You should provide little more information on which pattern you are looking in ip address?Basis on your current need you can use this :output:
