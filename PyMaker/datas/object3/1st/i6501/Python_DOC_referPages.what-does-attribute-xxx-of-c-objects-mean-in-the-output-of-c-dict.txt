In <attribute 'xxx' of 'C' objects>, does 'C' objects mean instances of C?does <attribute 'xxx' of 'C' objects> mean xxx is an attribute of instances of C? But it is listed by C.__dict__ as an attribute of C.Why are some attributes ( e.g. __doc__ and __module__) of C not mentioned with <attribute 'xxx' of 'C' objects>, while others are?Re: "note: <attribute ..> is basically the repr of these descriptors"Why is <attribute ..> not shown in the following example?
These are PyGetSetDescrObjects which are computed attributes (descriptors implemented in C) for instances of the class C. Documentation on these is minimal (or I can't seem to find it :-), but, you can take a look at tp_getset in the C-API that talks a bit about these:struct PyGetSetDef* PyTypeObject.tp_getsetAn optional pointer to a static NULL-terminated array of PyGetSetDef structures, declaring computed attributes of instances of this type.For each entry in the array, an entry is added to the typeâ€™s dictionary (see tp_dict below) containing a getset descriptor.The objects that don't have <attribute ..> (note: <attribute ..> is basically the repr of these descriptors) are simply not descriptors (__doc__ is usually a string or None if not defined while __module__ holds the name of the module in which the class was defined).Re: "note: <attribute ..> is basically the repr of these descriptors"Why is <attribute ..> not shown in the following example?To address this update that I missed.Because that's a descriptor implemented in Python and inherits the default repr from object. The repr function of the PyGetSetDescrObjects implemented in C uses a different repr, mainly in order to distinguish them (I'd assume).
