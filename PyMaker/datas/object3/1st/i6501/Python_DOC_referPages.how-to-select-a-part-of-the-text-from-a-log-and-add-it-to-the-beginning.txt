Natural Text
please can someone clarify to me what would be the best way to take some text from a log line and insert it in front of the line in python.Ex.InputOutputmany thanks
You can use the re module.If the pattern you want to prepend is unique, then it will be something like:
For 2 strings to connect  "+" operator is good enough, but for 3 or more parts strings I recomend using join() method:orAbout exporting log into string there are many methods, all depends on what form and where you have wrriten log.Also as @RomanPerekhrest mentions, it is unclear what you want to put before log, if it is something inside log, you will have to use regular expressions.
You should first split text with .split(" ") then you your log file will converted to list then you can use log_elements[index]+log to concate them together.
