Natural Text
I need to print out a list differently depending on how many items it has:For example: For no items i.e. [] should output {} For 1 item i.e. ["Cat"] should output {Cat}For 2 items i.e. ["Cat", "Dog"] should output {Cat and Dog}For 3 or more items i.e. ["Cat", "Dog", "Rabbit", "Lion"] should output {Cat, Dog, Rabbit and Lion}I currently am doing something like this with a bunch of if statements:Is there a more pythonic way to do this?
Assuming the words will never contain commas themselves. You could instead use join and replace to deal with all your cases in just one line:
Here's how I'd go about this:This way you have a fully functional list, only the representation is customised.
