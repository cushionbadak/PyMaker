I'm having trouble with this function. It doesn't work when I try to run it.Can anyone help me fix it please?
We loop over the list using enumerate. This gives us the index of each list item (idx) and the string itself (student).Then we call split on each string to extract its contents, saving the first item as name, and the rest as data. Then we convert the strings in data to floats. Then we compute the average of those floats. And then we save the average back into the appropriate list item.output
UpdateNow that I understand what you're trying to do (with @PM 2Ring's help), here's a completely different answer (the problem is actually much simpler than I original thought).  It would have helpful if you responded to either my original answer or various comments from myself and others, and explained what you were trying to do more clearly...
Returns:After update:Loop through L and create a new list, split, which splits the elements in L where there are commas. Then change the strings to floats where needed. Then run the summation and average on the floats. Set the element in L to the calculated average.
Try this.I know enumerate() works better for this.
