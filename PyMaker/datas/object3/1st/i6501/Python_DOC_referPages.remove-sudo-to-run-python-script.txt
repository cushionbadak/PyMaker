Every time that I need to run my python program with:I get some error saying that some import was not found.Some error like this:Than I run:And every thing works just fine. How do I remove the sudo command to run my python codes?
ImportError: No module named 'matplotlib' happens when your Python doesn't find the module. sudo changes the enviornment variables; That's why.To fix this, locate where matplotlib is installed in your computer, and verify the folder is part of your sys.path.Then you've two options: insert that path from your script, i.e adding a line such import sys; sys.path.append(<folder>) or configure PYTHONPATH env variable under your user appending the folder to the path.PYTHONPATH env variable gets loaded to sys.path on startup.
Best solution to me is a general workflow for all projects: use virtualenviroment]1.Then you should install your libraries again with pip and they will be installed in your virtualenviroment, isolated from everything else.
