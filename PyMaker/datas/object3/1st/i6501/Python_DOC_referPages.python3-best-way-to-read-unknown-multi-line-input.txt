What is the best way in Python 3 to read in multi-line user input when the amount of input is unknown? The multi-line input will be separated by Enterwhen I try usingI receive an EOFErrorThen if I change it to a try-catch blockI still get the EOFError.
The EOFError occurs when you call input(), not when you test it, nor when you print it. So that means you should put input() in a try clause:That being said, if input reads from the standard input channel, you can use it as an iterable:Since every line now ends with the new line character '\n', we can use end='' in the print function, to prevent print a new line twice (once from the string, once from the print function).I think the last version is more elegant, since it almost syntactically says that you iterate over the stdin and processes the lines individually.
