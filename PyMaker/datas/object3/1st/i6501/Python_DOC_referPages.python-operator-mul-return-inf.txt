i have list:and i try to get common value via operator.mul:also i try to use lambda:and when i print it - i get 'inf' - what this? and what happened? 
Your multiplication result can't be performed this way because it overflows float. Try to do the same with numpy.float128 or decimal:Use sys.float_info.max to check maximum float value (it depends on implementation):If result of multiplication overflows this limit, Python represents it as float('inf')
As the comments pointed out, the problem is that the resulting number is too big. To give you a hint how big it is you can use the equivalence AÂ·B = x^(log_x A + log_x B):That is a decimal number with 348 digits.Let's see what the biggest number is that your implementation supports:10348 > 10308. That is bigger than the biggest supported number, so Python uses float('Infinity') instead.
Your list only contains float numbers, so naturally, the multiplication operations are done using floating point arithmetic. Python uses IEEE-754 double-precision floating point numbers as the underlying structure for floats. This means that the number is bound to the limitations of that data type, which means that there is a maximum number it can represent.You can see that maximum number using sys.float_info:So 1.7976931348623157e+308 is the biggest number a float in Python can represent. Above that, you will reach inf which is a special constant for infinity.Unfortunately, the result of the multiplication of the items in your list is approximately 3.46027898e+348 which is larger by 40 orders of magnitude. So you simply cannot represent that value using float.You can however use the decimal library to represent the numbers using infinite precision decimals. This will allow you to get a result:
