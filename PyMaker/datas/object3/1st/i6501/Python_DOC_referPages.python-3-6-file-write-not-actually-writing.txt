Natural Text
In case you didn't catch it in the title, this is Python 3.6I'm running into an issue where I was able to write to a file, and now I cannot. The crazy thing is that this was working fine earlier.I'm trying to either append my file if it exists, or write to a new file if it doesn't exist. main_area_text represents the div tag text belowand below is my code:Earlier, in it's working state, I could create/write/append to .html and .txt files.NOTE: If the file doesn't exist, the program still creates a new file... It's just empty.I'm somewhat new to the python language, so I realize it's very possible that I could be overlooking something simple. (It's actually why I'm writing this code, to just familiarize myself with python.)Thanks in advance!
Since you're not closing your file, the data isn't being flushed to disk. Instead try this:The python with statement will handle flushing the data to disk and closing the data automatically. It's generally good practice to use with when handling files.
