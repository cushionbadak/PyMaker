Natural Text
I am having problems with this bit of codeIt returns this error Can anyone help me with this 
This code return list. List don't have attribute split. You should replace like thisBut better if you start using module csv for read this file.
The csv module gives you this text parsing functionality, you do not need to do it yourself.The problem you have is that list.split() does not exist, you are trying to use str.split() but you already split it into a list of strs. You would need to do it for every str in the list.
