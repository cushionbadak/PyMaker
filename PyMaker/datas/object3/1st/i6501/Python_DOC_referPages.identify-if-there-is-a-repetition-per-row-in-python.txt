I am pretty new to Python.I am trying to identify if an item is repeated or not in a column.If I have:I would like to get:Can I do this with a for loop? Or maybe apply a function?Any guidance would be appreciated.
Use a set to keep track of what you've seen, and append conditions based on if an element is in the set:
Starting with a reproducible object, sayyou could use list-comprehension and doAnd if you want to turn booleans into yes/no, simply do
Sure, all you have to do is iterate over consecutive pairs of items in the list and check if the two in each pair are equal. There's a handy function you can use to do this called pairwise(), whose implementation is given in the itertools package documentation, or you can just use it directly from the more-itertools library. You'd use it like this:I'd actually recommend putting this in a list comprehension, that way you build up the results into a list right from the beginning.Then you will have to stick an extra 'no' on the front because the first element has nothing before it to be equal to.
