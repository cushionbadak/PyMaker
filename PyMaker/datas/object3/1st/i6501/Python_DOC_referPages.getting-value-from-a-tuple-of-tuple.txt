I am new to python, I need help with how can I get the returning values from a function call.I tried doing this which is apparently wrong I need to assign the returning values to the mentioned variables and I cant make changes on how I return the values from the function as that is what is needed in the question.I am returning this type of value from the find_maximum_crossing_subarray function:
Just drop the outside enclosing parenthesis:
That's really strange syntax, but basically you're being shown the return signature from find_maximum_crossing_subarray(..).You can see a simplified version,Notice how I still had access to a, b, and c. Similarly, you will have access to your cross_* variables.If you need to find the max of something, max is a built-in function, and so is sum.If you can change the return signature of find_maximum_crossing_subarray(..) I would do this instead:
