I'm trying to implement IPC using named pipes in Python, but there is a problem. open blocks the processSame with open(path, 'r')What am I doing wrong?Python 3.6.1
Figured this out. open blocks until the pipe is open on the other side
According to os.mkfifo, you need to use fifo = open(path, dir_fd='w')
the function os.mkfifo(path) create the path is needed (if all the folder does not exists it build all the path).so, you need to add the file name like this: fifo = open(path + file, 'r')Generally, FIFOs are used as rendezvous between “client” and “server” type processes: the server opens the FIFO for reading, and the client opens it for writing. Note that mkfifo() doesn’t open the FIFO — it just creates the rendezvous point
