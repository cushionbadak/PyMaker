I am using Python.I want to make a regex that allos the following examples:So, each letter of a word, one or more times.How can I write it easily? Exist an expression that make it easy?I have a lot of words.Thanks
We can try using the following regex pattern:This matches and captures a single letter, followed by any number of occurrences of this letter.  The \1 you see in the above pattern is a backreference which represents the previous matched letter (and so on for \2 and \3).Code:Demo
To match a character one or more times you can use the + quantifier. To build the full pattern dynamically you would need to split the word to characters and add a + after each of them:Then just match the pattern case insensitively.  Demo:
Try /d+a+y+/gi:d+ Matches d one or more times.a+ Matches a one or more times.y+ Matches y one or more times.
As per my original comment, the below does exactly what I explain.Since you want to be able to use this on many words, I think this is what you're looking for.This works by converting the string into a list, then converting it back to string,  joining it on +, and appending the same. The resulting regex will be ^d+a+y+$. Since the input you presented is separated by newline characters, I've added re.MULTILINE.
