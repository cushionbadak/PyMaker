I've wrote this code to write headers to a csv file:However, it comes up with an error saying that directory is not defined.Why is this happening, what would I define directory as?Is there a better way to write headers?Thank you.
Directory is the location of the directory (aka folder) that you want to save UserPass.csv. See os.path.join docs for more info. 
Easiest way would be using sed since you mention alternatives, just do,
