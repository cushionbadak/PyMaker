I would like to know if is possible to make this with a list comprehension.The line "total = 0" is what gives the error All i can think of isBut of course doesn't work, I can't find how to handle statements that aren't ifs or for loops (in this case the "total") in list comprehensionsany help would be appreciated
Although in this caseis an efficient answer.Conceptually to handle some arbitrary aggregation (say different from a simple sum) in your case total on a sublist you can use reduce.
To count the number of 1 occurrences in each sublist:The output:https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=count#bytes.count

You can simply do this to get the total count of 1:or in case you need individual counts in the subarrays , this should do:So,and :
It's not possible with just plain list comprehensions.You can use [sum(filter(lambda x: x == 1, l)) for l in listsoflists] if you're ok with using a few functions as well. EDIT:[l.count(1) for l in listsoflists] is of course better.
