To solve this, you can try something like this:The globals() function produces a list-like series of values, which can be indexed using the typical l[i] syntax."var%s" % x uses the %s syntax to create a template that allows you to populate the var string with various values.
Unless there is a strong reason to create multiple variables on the fly, it is normally in these situations to put things in a list of some sort,or a dictionary:Now access values with:
I don't like your Idea but yeah you can do it in python:
I wouldn't recommend doing this using varying variable names. Instead, you could put everything into a list and you would still be able to access each value independently. For example, you could do: Then you can access any element from that list like so:This would return the number 33.If you really did want each to be its own variable, you could use exec as others have noted.
You should better use dictionary for this:
