I have a 12x12 dictionary with values, which are 0 for all.I want to set some values to 1 with the following snippet (it checks whether the surrounding fields are free):if I test this in python console, all works and the 4 selected values are set to 1, but in my Django view function I got an TypeError on the following line:    matchfield[str((m+k, n))] = 1did I miss something? I do not understand the error
I would expect the argument 2 must be str error to occur if you had In Python 3, the second argument to str is the encoding, so an integer n would cause that error.However, your traceback shows matchfield[str((m+k, n))], which shouldn't cause that error. Try restarting the Django server to make sure you're running the current code.At first, I suggested that you use tuples as dictionary keys, e.g.However, if you are serializing matchfield to json then that won't work because the keys need to be strings.
