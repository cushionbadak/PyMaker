So I recently posted my code for a simple dice program I'm having trouble with. It is supposed to randomly generate 5 numbers in an array, then check if there are any matching values, if there are, it adds to MATCH, so once it's done checking, MATCH+1 is how many 'of a kind' there are(match=1 means two of a kind, match=2 means three of a kind etc.)It randomly generates and then displays the numbers correctly, and the program seems to check without errors except when the last two playerDice elements match, then it throws an out of bounds error, Why is it doing that? Also it never actually displays the last print line with how many of a kind there are, even when it runs error free, Why is that?Here is the code:
There's a much easier way to look for matches: sort the dice, and then look for runs of repeated dice. You could look for those runs manually, but the standard library has a function for that: itertools.groupby. Here's a short demo.outputHere's an alternative version of find_matches that doesn't use groupby. It's probably a good idea to run through this algorithm on paper to see exactly how it works.
