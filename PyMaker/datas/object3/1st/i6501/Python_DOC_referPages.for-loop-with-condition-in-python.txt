I'm stuck on this problem. How can I create a program that adds 1 randomly to a list of [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. And I wanted to keep it going until all the numbers in the list is at least > 0.I have three problems in my code and I don't know what it is. This my code and the list Votes = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]:It stops printing after the 7th timeSometimes itâ€™s starts with more than 1 in an itemI want it to start it with an just 1 in a list and from there add 1 randomly to a item in the list.So I want at least one of each in the list which would be greater than 0.My code isThis is what is printed It only does 6 times, and sometimes it starts like this. I wanted it to start just by having just 1 number in the list like the previously printed stuffs 
If I understand your problem correctly, you could use all to check if every element is larger than 0 and keep looping with while until this condition is fullfilled:
