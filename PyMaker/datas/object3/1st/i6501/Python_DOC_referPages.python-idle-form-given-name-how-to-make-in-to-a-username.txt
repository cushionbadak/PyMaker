How to form a for loop?For example, I want to run a for loop when there is a two words or three words in a name.I need to make for loop for different number of names. For example, for two words, saint christopher to get just the s from saint and get christopher to get the result of schristopher.Another example, kyrie andrew irving, I want to get k from kyrie, a from andrew and irving to get the result of kairving.Given:Result:I have done:Where should I fix?
What you are trying to accomplish is fairly simple, and you get pretty close to it in the code in your question, even though your for loop syntax is off. Here is what you need:Let me walk you through it, Line by Line:Start out with a list of namesIterate over the listSplit the name into a list, using space to determine where to make a new elementAssign an empty string to be our user nameIterate over all the separated names except the last oneAdd their first letter to the usernameAdd the last item in the separated names to the usernamePrint the usernameI recommend you read this. It is a tutorial from the official python docs themselves. It should give you a basic grasp of syntax and how to use python in general. 
...this will make a username for a name consisting of arbitrary amount of subnames. It takes first letter of every subname, except the last one where it takes the whole subname.
Thank you Steampunkery, your comments helped me alot!I have edited my coding to
