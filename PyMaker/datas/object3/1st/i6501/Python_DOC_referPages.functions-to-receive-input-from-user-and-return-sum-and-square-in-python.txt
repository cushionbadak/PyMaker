I am a first time programmer learning Python and need to receive input from the user and return the input along with the sum and square of the entered data.  I have prompted for the input and can print that but not sure how to pass the input to the sum function and square function. Here is what I have:and this is the same for my square function.  not sure how to make:return(list**2) #return each number in list by **2?
Your code has a lot of problems, but they're mostly pretty simple ones that trip a lot of people up their first time.  Don't let  them get you down.First, you shouldn't reuse names that already have meaning like list and sum.  Basically, any of the names in the table at the top of this page.Second, you are taking in two "lists" (Not really, but we'll get there).  One is being passed into your function as an argument (list in def sum(list):). The other is data in the line Third, data in the above line isn't really a list, it's a string.  If you want to split data from that input up and use it as numbers later, you'll have to do that manually.Fourth, when you use the name data again in the line for data in list() you're overwriting the information contained in the existing data variable with the elements in list().  At least you would be except that.Fifth, list() is a function call.  There is a list function in Python, and this would work, but I think you probably expect this to iterate through the list you passed into the function.Sixth, return sum(list) will call this function again, potentially forever.Now, how do we go about fixing this?Thankfully, the built-in function sum can add up lists for us if we want, but first we have to get the list from the user.The [int(x) for x in ...] bit is something called a list comprehension.  You'll see another in a second.This function takes input like and turns it into a list of ints.Then we can justThe squares are a bit more difficult, but list comprehensions make them easy.  JustFeel free to ask any followup questions if any of this is unclear.
repl for code below:Output of code above:Enter a list of numbers or enter to quit:  1 2 3  input string: 1 2 3  numbers as a list of strings: ['1', '2', '3']  list of numbers:  [1, 2, 3]   The sum of your numbers is:  6  The squares of your numbers are: [1, 4, 9]  This can also be done more succinctly using map, reduce and list comprehensions.However, this seems more appropriate, based on content of OP's question.
Firstly, you shouldn't use list as a variable name as it is actually a data type (https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#list).As for doing mathematical operations on a list of numbers, I would recommend looking into numpy. It allows you to do operations on arrays as well as a lot more varied and useful mathematical functions.For your squaring each item in the list, you could simply do the following:The above code would print [ 1 4 9 16].More information on numpy (http://www.numpy.org/) and the square function (https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/reference/generated/numpy.square.html).
