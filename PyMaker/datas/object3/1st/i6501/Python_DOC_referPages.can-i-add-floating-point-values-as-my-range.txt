Help! I'm fairly new to python and I was wondering can I use floating point values in my range? Here is what I am trying to do.but it tells me that expects int instead of float in the (x, x*y) spot. Is it possible to put floating points in my range? If so, how?Edit: Thanks everyone for your help I got it working now!
No. The reason is that it raises too many questions on what to do with them; the simplest was demonstrated by user2357112's comment, where you didn't know the answer. Another is that there are floating point values where adding 1.0 doesn't produce a different number, because their magnitude exceeds their precision. And that's before we hit the denormalized values, including infinity and not a number. Faced with restrictions like these, range() was implemented for int only rather than have a bunch of tricky to understand special cases for other types. The main guidelines for these decisions is documented as the Zen of Python, which you can see using import this. Another subtle example is numbers that aren't quite what was entered, such as 0.1. If you try to take a range from 0 to 1 (exclusive) in steps of 0.1, how many values do you get?
No, the arguments to the range constructor must be integers.You can convert your range arguments from floats to ints using functions such as round(), int(), math.floor() and math.ceil().
There are a few ways we can go about this:
The range argument expects int as far as I know but for your problem, you could come up with custom range like this
