os.system returns the exit code not the data. You should use subprocess instead, see Assign output of os.system to a variable and prevent it from being displayed on the screen.If you are using python 3.5+, you should use subprocess.run()Otherwise, use subprocess.Popen()Or, you can use the Requests library.
