When I run this command from a bash terminal, I got the expected result:I need to run this command from a Python script. This is what I wrote:This is the result when running this script:As you can see, it's almost the same thing except the original command db.getMongo().getDBNames() is displayed instead of the expected result [ "admin", "local" ]. Is there an error in my script or is this expected behavior?
Try this. Let me explain - by default check_output has a default value shell=False, hence the reason it escapes the command on it's own.
