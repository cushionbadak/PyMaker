I am making rock paper scissors and when I run it it says "Can't convert 'int' object to str implicitly". 
The problem is that you're adding int variables to the print statements. Try doing something like this: In that example, you're setting playerscore to the string version of the int.
Need to wrap the integers cpuscore and playerscore with str to convert them to a string, as it won't do it implicitly. Another nice option is using format, which does call str on objects for you so you don't have to worry about it in the future: str is the built-in function that will convert non string objects to a string. It does this by calling the objects .__str__ method if it exists (and knows how to otherwise for objects like ints and floats.) Read more about it in the docs here https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str
I'm nor sure if this is the best solution, but my approach would be to use str() to convert the integer (cpuscore) to a string.
cpuscore is an integer(int) it can't be concatenated with a string. Python doesn't convert it to a string automatically("implicitly"). So you at least need to do: Even better/easier, in Python 3.6+, use  f-stringsAssuming you can put the value inside a variable into a string (integers, strings, lists, dictionaries are ok), you just put them inside curly brackets. Here's how the line with that error looks with f-strings:
