Say I have a list K, and a list B. If an entry in K fulfills my condition x, I want the index of that entry in my list B. The problem is since there are duplicate entries in the first list, using k.index only gives me the index of the first occurrence in that list. Here's what I have:
Here is a simple solution:The built-in enumerate function returns an index value for the iterations starting at 0 just like a list index
This can be done using the built-in enumerate function instead of list.index:Return an enumerate object. iterable must be a sequence, an iterator, or some other object which supports iteration. The __next__() method of the iterator returned by enumerate() returns a tuple containing a count (from start which defaults to 0) and the values obtained from iterating over iterable.
