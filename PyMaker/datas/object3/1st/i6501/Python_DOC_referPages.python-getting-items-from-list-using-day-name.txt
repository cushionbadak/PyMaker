I am trying to make a program that gets the date, works out what lessons i have.Currently, I get a syntax error that I cannot fix, I can't find where I have gone wrong. I would like to use a dictionary to complete my code but I am unsure how to.
First you have a major error in how you are trying to form a dict. It should be this:This is a dictionary called Lessons that has Strings as keys (the days of the weeks) and Lists as values (The lists of lessons). To access a list of lessons you would do it like so:Note that this returns a list, if you want it formatted differently, then you can do something like this:This will give you a comma-separated list of lessons.I am unsure what exactly you are trying to do with books, but if you want to be more specific I will update my answer. However, I can say that if you will be running this program each day, then you will need to store information about the books in a file to maintain their state, otherwise it will be lost when the program ends.Also, variables should be lower-cased (lessons instead of Lessons), but I kept it how you had it to be consistent.
