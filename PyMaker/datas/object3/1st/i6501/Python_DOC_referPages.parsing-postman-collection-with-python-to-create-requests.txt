I have a postman collection which has multiple folders containing around 100 requests with all methods like GET, POST, DELETE, PUT.I need to parse the postman.json collection file in python and create requests and write to a txt file.These request need to be passed to another tool. Can you help me with it. Any pointers would be helpful.I am stuck in parsing collection JSON file, which is very difficult.
HOW TO GUIDERead the doc about JSON encoder/decoderTo parse a JSON string json_str:To parse a JSON file:Read the doc about RequestsThere is a requests.request() function, where you can pass the method (GET/OPTIONS/POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE/HEAD) in parameter. Usage:Write into a binary fileYou can write the result of your request into a binary file. You can also use a text file but some response may be binary, for instance if you download an image.
The code below will help you understand how to parse the Collection JSON file so that you can recursively accumulate all the requests in that collection. I have used the Postman Collection SDK along with a helper utility called Lodash.You can either use this snippet below to get the request information you want to be consumed by using Python requests. Or to keep things simple, just use Javascript if you can.
