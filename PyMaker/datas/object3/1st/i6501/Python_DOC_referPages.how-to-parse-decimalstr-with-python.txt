In my view I make a call to a stored procedure that return to me the ID of the entry it created.I need to use this id as arguments for another stored procedure.My problem is that the result of the first query is : (Decimal('1046'),) and of course wont fit as argument for the second procedure.How can I parse it to only get the '1046' ?Edit :View.py :
type casting in python is as simple as:
It's an instance of the decimal.Decimal class, part of Python's standard library. It stores decimal fractions exactly, unlike normal floating point numbers. As the database does something similar, translating the database's numbers to Decimals is the most correct way of translating them to Python.They're mostly just numbers in Python.If you know it's an integer and you need to pass an integer to somewhere, pass int(yourdecimal).That you get (Decimal('1046'),) with the parens and the comma means you get the result as a tuple of length 1. You can access its first element by indexing it with [0], like with all tuples.
Since nothing worked i just used CONVERT on my query to be sure to get a string in the end.
