Natural Text
i have made a nested list and it works a print i need to write it to a text file but dont understand how to and have tried to do research and not found anything anyone help?Edited:I've changed code to this:
The following code can help you write to file. Not sure what the expected output is. You can modify the write statement to print anything you like.UPDATE:The following code below writes to the file. (Writes everything after the print as wanted), is not accepted as it sees as multiple arguments. Instead + is used to concatenate strings, which then can be written.UPDATE 2:If you want to format the code, you might want to look into formatting but here is a an example to make it look similar
