I got this two list of list:and I want to compare these two lists by alphabet and append the list with the max number into a new list C?EDIT:I got this code but it only outputs
zip cannot work in this case, because elements of B can be used anywhere in C. The iterable returned by zip only has as many elements as the shortest list.You need to keep A's order in C, so A should stay a list but B should be a dict:You can then use a list comprehension to get the max values:
First create a dictionary holding the max values in B taking care to ensure to deal with any possible duplicates in the list. Then create C using a list comprehension based on the the largest value found in B and the current value:Giving you:In the example you gave, B contains unique values, but if there happened to be multiple entries for the same letter, this solution will ensure the maximum is used.
