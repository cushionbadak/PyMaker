I have a file that contains a list of numbers ex:How would I be able to read the first five numbers, compute the sum, and then read in the next five numbers?  Could I use a for loop?  I want my answer to look like this:Is there an easier way than using a for loop?
you can use next on the file handle and convert to integer, pass to sum in a generator comprehension, then unpack to 2 variables, with a default 0 value just in case the file ends before 10 values (next(f,0) does that)
You can use the itertools grouper recipe, which is useful in lots of applications!
Keep in mind for loop in python is equivalent to for each conceptually. It would be better to use a while statement with a condition to stop reading after you have gotten the inputs you want.
