I have a Pandas Dataframe as such,I use a dictionary to map values into a new column called continent using the following code I found in an similar answer,being ContinentDict,All the new items in column continent are NaNs, can anyone help me here?
You wantWhat you tried:generates NaN because you're constructing a Series from the numpy values so the index returned is the auto-generated RangeIndex so when it tries to align against your df, it fails so all rows become NaN
For completeness: pd.Index definitely has a map method.  However, as of pandas 0.20.3, it only takes a callable.  That means it does not work with a dictionary.  We can change that by passing a callable to it.  In fact, a dictionary already has the appropriate method for us.  Namely, dict.get
