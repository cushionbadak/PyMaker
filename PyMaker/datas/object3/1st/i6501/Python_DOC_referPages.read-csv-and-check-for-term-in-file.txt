My code is not working, I want the code to allow me to enter a word and find if it is in a csv file, then it should tell me if it is or if it isn't.
This code won't work because you have an undefined 'count'. Also you need the program to be able to read the file and you missed that little bit of code. Also because you have columns that you are reading from you should have a Don't forget to set 'count' as a variable in itself.Good luck
There are a few fundamental problems in your code. You never use your import csvYou never define the count variableYou never define the column listYou never read any data from the fileYou never close the fileI hate to completely rewrite someone's code, but your code needs a bit of help. This code will accomplish what you want it to:Let me walk you through what this code does and how. We get our input like you were, with input()We use with to open our file and automatically close it when we are done We read the file as one big string, replace all the line breaks ("\n") with empty strings and split the string on commas. We split the string into a list on commas because this is a csv file, meaning everything is separated by commas. If you use a different delimiter, just change the delimiter variable.Test if the word appears anywhere in the list.(a) If it does appear, print that it does, along with it's index (it's row)(b) If it does not appear, print that it does not
