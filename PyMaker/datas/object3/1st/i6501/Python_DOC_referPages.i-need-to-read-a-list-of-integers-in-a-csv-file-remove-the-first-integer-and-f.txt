Natural Text
Here's what I have so fartransactions.csv contains these integers[25, 2, 8, -5, 4, 4, 3, 2, -2, 3] 25 being the first integer.
You can use this to sum up all elements of a list except the first one:If the elements of the list are strings you can do:a_list[1:] this is called slicing, have a look here for an explanation of the syntax.map(int, a_list) applies the function int (cast to integer) to all elements of a_list. Link to the docs.
