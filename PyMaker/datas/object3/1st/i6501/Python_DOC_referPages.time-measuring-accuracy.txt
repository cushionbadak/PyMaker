By implementing the line at the start of my code and at the end of my code I have been measuring the performance of my script (which can take hours to run). I have heard that this may not be the best method due to it being inaccurate. How accurate is it and is there a better alternative?
Try this, timeit from the standard library:The documentation for default_timer is of interest, and should really be quoted in the answer: "Define a default timer, in a platform-specific manner. On Windows, time.clock() has microsecond granularity, but time.time()â€™s granularity is 1/60th of a second. On Unix, time.clock() has 1/100th of a second granularity, and time.time() is much more precise. On either platform, default_timer() measures wall clock time, not the CPU time. This means that other processes running on the same computer may interfere with the timing." 
Try usng datetime
