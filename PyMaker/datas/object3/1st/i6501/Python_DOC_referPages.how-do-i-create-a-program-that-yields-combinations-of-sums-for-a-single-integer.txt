This question already has an answer here:Generating the partitions of a number                    8 answers                In python, I want to have my program prompt me to 'Enter number:' and then I will do so. For example, I will enter '5' and in return I want it to find every combination of numbers between 1 and 5, including 1 and 5, that adds up to 5 without repeating any sequences or numbers. So the output of this should be the pairs 1,4 and 2,3. On top of that, I also want it to tell me how many outputs I have, so in this case 2. And I want to make sure that if I input a number higher, say 10, it will yield every combination even if it is larger than a pair, so it would yield 1,2,3,4 as one of the outputs and 1,9 as another, etc.
There you go, because I like playing with itertools, but yes, next time try something by yourself :This method is kind of a bruteforce, you could probably be much faster using maths.
