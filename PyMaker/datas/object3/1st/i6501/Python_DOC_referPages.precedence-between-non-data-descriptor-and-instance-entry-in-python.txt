Natural Text
In the paragraph "Descriptor Protocol" of “Descriptor HowTo Guide" of the Python 3.6 documentation there is writtenIf an instance’s dictionary has an entry with the same name as a  non-data descriptor, the dictionary entry takes precedenceMaybe I understand something wrong but why does the non-data descriptor has precedence over the instance entry in this exampleI expected that Goodbye will be outputted. However there was outputted Hello World.
That is not is what is meant by "name". Here the "name" refers to the name in the class __dict__ and in the instance __dict__, and not any name attribute the descriptor may have. See the following example for when the class descriptor gets overridden.
