Just started learning python. And it looks to me that rjust() method is counting string that I'm trying to justify in justifying length. Let me clarify a little bit, the book I'm using to study python had this type of small program:Whose output is:And I thought what could I change to make output as (desired output),Well there may be very easy way to solve this but bear in mind I just started learning python. I tried formatting to no avail. After learning about list I came up with this solution,But the output is,That means rjust() method is counting Second and Third to make justified length of 14, while I wanted them to start from 14. Second has 8 spaces in front of it to make justified length of 14, while Third has 9 spaces.So, what can I do to get my desired output? If there is another way to solve this let me know.
What you describe is left-justified, but with an additional offset (also known as indentation).Instead ofsimply doIf there is nothing to the right of listed_order[i], you don't need to use ljust either.You might want to take a look at textwrap.indent, which lets you indent whole blocks of text without splitting the lines manually.
You don't have to do such things: length_of_list = len(listed_order). You can run your loop without checking length of the list:EDIT:As pointed in the comments, this would also print first element which we want to skip. You can do it by telling python to process from second element by adding [1:], which means from element of index 1 (which is second after index 0) untill end), so:Now to the core.What you need is the number of whitespaces. You can get it by running this:And then print it out before each line:Full solution here:EDIT2: Added missing colon, Changed rjust to ljustEDIT3: Added full solution
