I have an ent file, compressed to .gz. I need to read it and put into Biopython parser. The problem is that the parser takes either file path or file object, but I get gzip file instead. Now I convert it like this:As you can see, this solution is ugly af but most importantly it takes loads of time because it writes to a drive and reads it twice, which is a problem as long as I have to do millions of such operations.Googling didn't help me at all, docs didn't too. Is it possible to make the convertion faster?
You don't need to convert anything, just feed your parser with the stream returned by gzip.open():Reason: open() returns a file stream of the file content. gzip.open() returns a file stream of the uncompressed file content. Which is exactly what you need. This is a good example of the old saying: if it looks like a duck and walks like a duck, it is a duck
