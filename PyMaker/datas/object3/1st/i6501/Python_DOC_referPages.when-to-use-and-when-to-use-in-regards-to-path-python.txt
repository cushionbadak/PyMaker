I have a few questions regarding to the path in Python using os module:(1) If using os module, is there any difference between \ and / in regards to the absolute path of a file? For examples:a. Can os.system(example_path_1) and os.system(example_path_2) both work?  b. Can os.mkdir(example_path_1) and os.mkdir(example_path_2) both work?(2) When using the os module in Python, if I'm getting this right, it seems in some situations we have to use /, and the other situations we have to use \. How to tell the difference?
You would be safe with always sticking to forward slashesIf you use windows style, you need to escape them or use a raw stringIn general, stick to doing as much as you can in the os.path module, it will handle these OS-specific issues fairly robustly. For example you can pass a path to os.path.normpath and it will normalize your slashes to whatever platform you're on. Similarly building up paths with os.path.join will insert the correct slashes for your system.
