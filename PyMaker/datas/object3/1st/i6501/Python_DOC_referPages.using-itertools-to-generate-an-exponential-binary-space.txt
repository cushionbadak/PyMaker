I am interested in generating all binary combination of N variables without having to implement a manual loop of iterating N times over N and each time looping over N/2 and so on. Do we have such functionality in python?E.g:I have N binary variables: I would like to generate 2^10=1024 space out of these such as:You see that I don't have repetitions here, each variable is enabled once per each of these iter's sequences. How can I do that using Python's itertools?
itertools.product with the repeat parameter is the simplest answer:The values of each variable will cycle fastest on the right, and slowest on the left, so you'll get:etc. This may be recognizable to you: It's just the binary representation of an incrementing 10 bit number. Depending on your needs, you may actually want to just do:then mask i with 1 << 9 to get the value of A, 1 << 8 for B, and so on down to 1 << 0 (that is, 1) for J. If the goal is just to print them, you can even get more clever, by binary stringifying and then using join to insert the separator:
