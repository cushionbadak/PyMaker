Hi all, I'm using python to read data from a csv file and export them as individual .txt files. My question is how do I refer to a specific field in a specific row?For example my data set in a csv file is as followsname gender age  john   m     15  mary   f     13  sam    m     12Upon the user's input of the name (i.e sam), I would like to be able to export the whole row of data (i.e "sam , m , 12" ) as data and export it as a .txt file.If i want to pin point to sam's gender, for example, how do I go about doing it?And furthermore, how do I use the for loop properly to ensure that I can export all the necessary .txt files I want?I've tried searching around, however my case is a logic error and it's really tough to troubleshoot.Would really appreciate any help.Edit:Error message after using panda module:
If I were you I would think about Pandas package - with that package your task could be very simple e.g.Your output is also comma separated values ((i.e "sam , m , 12" ))so you can save it easily to csv containig only one line which you select by user input.
