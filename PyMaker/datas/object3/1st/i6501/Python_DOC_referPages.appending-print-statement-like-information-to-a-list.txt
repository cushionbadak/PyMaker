I'm making a sort of history generation program in python heavily inspired by Dwarf Fortress. In the program, I want a list of events, in that list being smaller lists such as 'death_events' and 'war_events' etc.The problem I am having is that I would like to be able to look through these lists to see events in the world, and I don't know what way to save that sort of information to a list. e.g:I thought I would somehow be able to save that to a list, but I get:I'm not sure if using a variable to put this information into a list as this "event" could happen many times with different information each time.
You'll have to use the dict otherwise you'll have multiple learning lists in the event list.The best way to write the string would be to use .format() on the string:This way an object will fill the parameters in the string. This can allow you to write these utterances much quicker.Here is a little OOP example:I wouldn't make knowledge that is being learnt, as a dwarf attribute.Side note:If you append strings to the list containing {dwarf.name} without applying .format() on them, you can always apply .format(dwarf=happy) later when you need to use it.
There are multiple ways of combining different strs into a single one, as you want to do. print() by default combines all its arguments into a str but this is not the case for most of the functions.The most pythonic way to join strs is str.format():Basically it replaces {} with the first argument. You can use names for the variables:Or you can change the order:There are multiple more formatting options such as choosing the amount of decimals for floats and so on.In your case you could use:
