Hi everyone and thanks to help me.I have a function called factorial like this:How i transform this function in a character like '!'?for example:use fact function when i put a number before '!', thanks for all! 
considering "3!" is a string, you can always manipulate it. I'd recommend using a more sophisticated system, to check if the input is legit etc. 
You can't do that in python, as suggested by @sheldonzy, you could parse a string somehow to give mathematical meaning to the ! operator. When it comes to python operator overriding, these are the ones python provides you and you can override. So for instance, you could have your own int class and using the unary invert operator ~, like this:In any case, I don't suggest overriding the builtin types for something like this, better continue using the method fact or parsing strings as mathematical expressions.I recommend you to take a look at sympy, it's really handy to make mathematical operations on python.
Python allows you to define new meanings for two kinds of things:names: sequences of characters starting with a letter or _ followed by any number of characters belonging to the 3 categories (digits, letters, digits).existing operators, including but not limited to +, -, *, [], ==, in etc.In order to define factorial as a trailing exclamation mark, as you desire, ! would have to be an existing postfix operator in Python. This is not the case.The summary of all of that is: what you want cannot be done in Python.
