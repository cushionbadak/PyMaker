What I'm trying to accomplish is to mock a the split inside a method like thisIn the testI've made the mock working with string.split Even if that work, the question remains, it is posible to do? mock the result of "".split('-')
The string you want to split is passed into your method. You don't need to use patch, just pass a Mock into the method.patch is useful when you want your production to get a mock through an import statement. If you pass values directly to your production code, you have to make your own Mock objects.
