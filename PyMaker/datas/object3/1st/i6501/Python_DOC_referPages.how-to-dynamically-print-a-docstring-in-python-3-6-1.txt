While reading some Python training books, I was tinkering a little bit with objects, like printing docstrings for common objects and attributes.Consider the list of strings returned by:I am trying to iterate over the above in order to dynamically print the docstrings of the attributes stored in the dir list with the following loop:This returns the dir output for the str object and not for its attribute though, which is not what I'm looking for. How can I dynamically print instead the docstring for all the attributes that populate the list produced by the dir method?EDIT: this is NOT a duplicate of this other question.Using the word "enumerate" is very misleading, at least to me, so I would say that question is improperly titled in fact I spent a lot of time looking for a solution and no search query ever returned that.
You can use getattr(obj, attr) to get the named attribute from the object.
Instead of using dir, which just gives you the names of attributes, use vars - this gives you a dict of names to the actual method objects.
