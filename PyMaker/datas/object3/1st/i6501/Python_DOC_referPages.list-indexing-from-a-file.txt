This question already has an answer here:Convert string representation of list to list                    14 answers                Im trying to reach elements of two lists who both are within a list. And this last list (containing the other two lists) is in a file. When I print the big list from my file, it looks like: ['[0,1],[2,3]'] and it is called rader.I'm trying to print the elements in the big list with the following command:print(rader[0][0]) which should give me the number 0 right? But when I do this I get an error: 'IndexError: list index out of range'.I think that the problem is that when I open my txt.file with the list in it and read from it (file = open('eddie.txt','r')), it interprets the whole thing as a String! Is that why I cant reach the elements in the list?I want it like [[0,1],[2,3]] and not ['[0,1],[2,3]'] from the txt.file(I think?) How do I do this? Here is my code:As you can see Im importing some functions from another file, this code doesnÂ´t run without it, but I think you understand my question!
You need to make rader a list of lists not a list of a stringUse rader = [[0,1],[2,3]] not rader = ['[0,1],[2,3]'] 
You can convert using ast:
Reading a file always produces byte or character strings.  If you want Python data structures, you have to make them.  Obviously, there are many tools already made to do this: the simplest (but usually inadvisable) is eval.  There is a safer variant called ast.literal_eval.Yet other choices involve changing the on-disk format.  You can just use whitespace to separate your values and use things like str.split to make lists, or you can (if your data came from another Python process) use pickle.Also, a simplification: rader=list(fil) is all you need to read text lines.
