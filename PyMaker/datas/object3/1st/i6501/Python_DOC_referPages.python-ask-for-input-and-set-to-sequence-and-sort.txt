I was assigned to complete a short program and as a beginner, this is harder than what I know. Please help!Get input from user to enter into a sequence of first and last names - with a space betweenPut the inputted names into a list called 'full_names'Copy list to another 2d list called 'other_list' that has first name and last names in separate columnsSort that 'other_list' ascending order of 1st nameMake a new 2d list named 'rank' w/ sorted first and last name and their index in 'full names' listIf someone can even tell me where to begin that would be great! 
Start with Python's built-in functions.Notably, for this problem you'll want to use:inputsortedmax / minYou've already broken the problem down into steps, you'll probably find all the functions you need on that page. Good luck!
Get input from user to enter into a sequence of first and last names -  with a space between :First take input from user in sequence :Generally we take input as :But in your problem you want to take input in sequences so:Put the inputted names into a list called 'full_names'User_input will store in a list format so instead of using user_input variable name use full_names :Copy list to another 2d list called 'other_list' that has first name  and last names in separate columnsSort that 'other_list' ascending order of 1st nameYou can use sorted() in-built function:I didn't understand last part what you want there.
