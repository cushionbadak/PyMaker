I am trying to import a .csv file using pandas in python. I am using pandas.read_csv to do that. But I have a requirement to check each row in the dataframe and take values of two specific columns into an array. As my dataframe has almost 3milion(~1gb) rows doing it iteratively after the import is taking time. Can I do that while importing the file itself? Is it a good idea to modify read_csv library function to accommodate this?Due to very large size of lists, this function is running slow. Also, querying a dataframe of such big size is also slowing down the execution. Any suggestions/solutions to improve the performance.
Python's default csv module reads the file line by line, instead of loading it fully into memory. Code would look something like this:
