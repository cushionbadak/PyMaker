I have a small python project that runs on a raspberry pi. It monitors temperatures, checks and sends emails, and controls a PDU. It runs perfectly from the Thonny IDE included in raspbian. However when I run it from the command line, or ideally on startup, it fails in one specific section of code dealing with checking emails. I installed the email module on the system using pip install. Then I realized this was standard in python so i uninstalled it. This is the error code.Here is the script it fails in.
I think the problem is nearby environment where you try to execute your code. Try to check installed modules in both cases. You can read here about How to list of used modules during execution. Also you should check which python instance used in both cases. To do this you can execute this
