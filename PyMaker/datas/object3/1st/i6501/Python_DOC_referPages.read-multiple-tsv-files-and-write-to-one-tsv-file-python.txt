Natural Text
So, I have multiple TSV files with the following format:(First line (a, b, ...) is titles)I want to read them all and if, for each line, the one of the columns has the attribute I want (let's say it's equal to 1), I want to save that line in a different TSV file with the same format as the one above but the data would be filtered.I have the code to extract the line I want and write it to a TSV file but I am not sure how to read multiple TSV files and write to a single TSV file.Here's what I have so far:So say that someDirectory has like 80 tsv files. What's the best way to go about iterating through all those and writing the needed lines to out_file?
You can use glob.glob from the standard library to get the list of filenames according to some pattern:and then iterate over all those as input files. For example:As a side note, you can also use csv.reader module to read tab-separated-value files, by setting dialect='excel-tab'.
