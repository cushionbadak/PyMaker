Why can the attribute '13579' of map be a string, shouldn't it be a list?
map takes a function and a sequence. Strings are sequences as well. You can also iterate it:map(...):   map(function, sequence[, sequence, ...]) -> list
In Python a string is a list of chars. Thats why you can loop (or use map) over a string and then work on every char separately inside the loop.You can find more infos here http://www.openbookproject.net/books/bpp4awd/ch03.html
From the documentation:The documentation describes the map() function as taking a function which is applied to each item in an  iterable:map(function, iterable, â€¦)Apply function to every item of iterable and return a list of the results.And since Python strings are iterables, just like lists, you can pass them into map() as you can lists. We can show that they are iterables by simply iterating over them in a for-loop:which will print out:Hopefully this helps you to see why strings can be passed into map.
