I am having a hard time figuring out how to return my function with a "%" sign.Here is what I have: I want it to return the final answer, but with a percentage sign next to it, like '65%' for exampleI tried these:but none of those really worked and it gave me an error.
For a single returned value: you can'tThe problem is that int(answer) is a number and '%' is a string, so you cant combine these in a return value - unless you convert both to the same data type.Try converting both values to a string:
You could go totally overboard and define your own integer type that displays itself with a percent symbol:You can now make the return value of your function be pint(answer) and reap the benefits of having your number actually be a number while always printing as a percentage.I don't really recommend this approach for your trivial case, but it could have its uses.
