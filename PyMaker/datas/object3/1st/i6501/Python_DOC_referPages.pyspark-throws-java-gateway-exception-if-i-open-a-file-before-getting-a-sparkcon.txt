I am using pyspark on Jupyter Notebook with Spark 2.1.1 cluster running on IP "spark://remote:port" (spark master IP)I am able to create a SparkContext successfully.But, I want to read spark_master_ip and spark.cores.max from a .properties file (instead of hard coding it). When I try to read my custom spark properties file in 'myspark_config.properties' file (which I parse and read successfully), but I get the following Java gateway exception, when I try to create SparkContext().Here is my code:I do not get any exceptions and my code runs smoothly if I don't read from file and hard code the spark master in SparkConf() (currently it is commented). "JAVA_HOME","SPARK_HOME" "PYTHONPATH" are set successfully and I am not using Anaconda. I am using Jupyter notebook on python 2.7 on ubuntu and spark-2.1.1I have looked through various links but found no solution: pyspark java gateway error stackoverflowGithub issue on java Gateway
But, I want to read spark_master_ip and spark.cores.max from a .properties file (instead of hard coding it).That is awesome idea, but you're ignoring the fact, that this is what $SPARK_HOME/conf/spark-defaults.conf is for. Just put required properties there.but I get the following Java gateway exception,This looks wrong:Why would use = in properties? Otherwise it should have no effect. Also Python provides property parser https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html
