I've tried many ways, but don't seem to be progressing that much. I wanted to change the < and > between <p> tags to be entities, but there are line breaks in between the content between  tags:Example:Expected result is:I can't seem to find the all the < and > to do the conversion.If I try the Regex <seg.*(<), it can't find all the <; if I try to use positive lookbehind like <(?=.*<\/p>)(?!p>), it can't find all < when there's a line break inside the <p> content.If I try to use positive lookbehind + re.DOTALL <(?=.*<\/p>)(?!p>), it'll find all the <including those unwanted ones...If you have any ideas on a better Regex or a better way of doing this, please let me know. Thank you very much!
