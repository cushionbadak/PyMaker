format() method is awesome but I want to change identifier of my choice because I dont want to escape { and } in my string.  e.g.'Hi {name}'.format(**{'name': 'Alok'}) will print 'Hi Alok' 'Hi {{{name1}, {name2}}}'.format(**{'name1':'foo', 'name2':'bar'})will print 'Hi {foo, bar}' In 2nd example { and } are part of my string so I have to escape them using {{ and }}.I dont want to escape { and } or even dont want to use template engine like jinja etc. How can I change identifier? I guess there would be way using subclassing str class. 
Sure you could probably subclass the str class but i would recommend againt this. This is an example of how this would look like:You can also use the old style of string formatting.here is a link where the two methods are compared https://pyformat.info/I would recommend avoiding the old style as possible but if the new style clutter the string then maybe using the old style is better for that particular use case.
You can use String Templates which do $-based substitution instead of {..}However, the rules are more simple and you lose advanced formatting features like alignment.Docs: string.Template
