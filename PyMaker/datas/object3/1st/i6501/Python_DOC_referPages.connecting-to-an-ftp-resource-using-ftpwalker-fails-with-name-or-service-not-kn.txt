I'm trying to traverse an ftp directory using FTPwalker, however I cannot connect.The current call is being used:However walker.check_state() gives:Is the url parameter entered here in the correct format? Pinging the hostname works.
While the parameter is misleadingly named url, the official example shows pretty clearly, that the value should actually be a plain hostname:In the the end, the value goes to ftplib.FTP.connect, which takes "hostname".
