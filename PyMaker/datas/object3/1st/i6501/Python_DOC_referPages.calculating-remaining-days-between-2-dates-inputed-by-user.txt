I am trying to calculate the number of days between two dates where the user is inputing the dates but cannot find how to do it. I currently have this code:Thank you
You are making an incorrect use of the datetime constructor. I revised your solution to handle user input in a simple and manageable way. A basic data validation is performed by the datetime.strptime factory method but there could be more (like checking, for example, that the end date always comes after the start date):I did more than a couple of tests, and this is what resulted:
In python, input() method accepts the input as a string variable. You can then typecast it into an integer using int() method. But you cannot typecast an entire tuple. i.e (year, month, day) in your case. You can do it by getting all the values one by one. Hope that helps. 
I think your biggest issue is how you retrieve the date.date() function requires three integers, e.g. date(2017,10,10)When you use input() you get a string:You would also need to solve this by splitting the input somehow:e.g. That means if you do this, you get a date:But what you really want in this case is to use strptime. Strptime() converts a string to a datetime by defining how it looks:Example of full scriptRecommended linksThe various kind of ways to format a string:https://docs.python.org/2/library/datetime.html#strftime-and-strptime-behavior
