I have two tuples a = (('1',), ('2',), ('3',),) and b = (('1',), ('3',),). I need to get the result as (('2',),) since, 2 is the element that is present in a and not in b. I referred this Find intersection of two lists? and Is there a way to get the difference and intersection of tuples or lists in Python? for getting an idea, but these are for lists and not for tuples. I am not able to use intersection() for tuples.Is there a way I can get a-b in python tuples?
Convert to set then you can get the difference, then convert it back to tuple using tuple() function:Running example: https://repl.it/M1FD/1If you want the Symmetric Difference, elements in either set but not in the intersection:or:Running example: https://repl.it/M1FD/2
Sets are very useful for this.If you're only looking for elements that are in a but not in b:If you're looking for elements that are in either one of the tuples, but not the other:
You can still use sets as described in the linked answer:
