I randomly thought of making a program to tell the difference between time and so far it works, although when I add another elif, the code doesn't run. The first part works, but if the numbers are the same the last elif statement doesn't run.
Maybe the problem is because of string operation.Try to replace the input code by this:
Are you running python2 or python3? Additionally, what are using for your time metric?Your bug may be the result of input() having different functionality given the python version you are runninginput() in python2 takes in a string and runs eval() on it which turns it into its most-likely type. For example, if I inputted 2 at the command line, python2 would take in 2 as a string, "2", and then run eval() on it to turn it into an integer, 2. See the documentation for input() here.input() in python3 on the other hand just takes in input from the command line and processes it directly as a string. So if you were to input 2 for num1, num1 would live as "2" until otherwise specified. See documentation for python3 input() here.Thus, if you are running python2, this program should work fine. If you are running python3, you will run into error when you try to subtract strings. 
You can do like this:
I'm running Python 2 and if I encompass your program into a function like this, it works great.
