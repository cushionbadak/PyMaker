I originally tried writing an algorithm to solve a 15-puzzle using a priority queue, but my instructor told us that we were required to write in an a* implementation, and recommended that we use a heapq instead of a priority queue. I'm having trouble finding the length/size of my heapq, and accessing elements of my heapq.  I was under the impression that by using a heapq you would be able to access elements in the heapq that you would not be able to access in a priority queue.  However, there don't seem to be any methods for finding the length/retrieving elements from a heapq.  Do any of you know of a way to get the length/element of a heapq or a better suited data structure for this situation?
heapq heaps are nothing more than lists whose elements respect a special (non-unique) order.You can use len(heap) on it just like you would on any other list.You should also read the python documentation for heapq: the example section should interest you.
