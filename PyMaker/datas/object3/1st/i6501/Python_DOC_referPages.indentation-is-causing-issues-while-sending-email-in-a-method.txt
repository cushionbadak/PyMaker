I am trying to send an email using Pythion smtp library. I have got below code but somehow when I get an email, it doesn't have "To", "Subject" and "Body" contents as they are missing. I believe something is wrong with the way message string is constructed.But when I use exact same below code, it works fine without any issues so I am sure something is wrong with my above code when I put everything in a method. I believe indentation is causing issues with the way message string is contructed or something else which I am not able to figure out.Here is what I see with first code. If you see closely it has lot of spaces in front of each tag as compared to what gets printed out with second code:This is what I see with second code:How do I fix this in first code when I am putting it in a method?Update:I tried with below code but it gives me error about indentation is wrong on print message.
You are allowed to remove the indents:Also, not sure you need the back slash?
Use the stdlib emailpackage to help you building your mail as correct SMTP payloads (headers, encoding, parts, ...). https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.html#module-emailThere are tons of examples in the standard doc or in stackoverflow.
