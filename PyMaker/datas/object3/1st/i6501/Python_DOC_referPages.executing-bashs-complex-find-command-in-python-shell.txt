I am new to python. I am trying to execute a bash script in python to extract the count of different file extensions.I tried the following commandBut it throws a syntax error.On executing find command in bash shell output will be as followsSo how can i get the same output in python code? what is the correction required in my current approach?Thanks in advance
By the way, you could try to do the same thing in pure Python.Here is a minimal code that does it:OK, it's very long compared to the Bash snippet, but it's Python...
As mentioned in the comments any double quote in a string quoted with double quotes needs to be escaped with a backslash:Single quotes inside a double quoted string do not have any special meaning (except directly at the beginning), so that doesn't allow you to avoid escaping.The fine details are explained under the header String and Bytes literals from the Python language reference.As mentioned in the comments another option, which is probably easier to read, is to use triple double quotes:While this answers the question, for ease of reading and maintainability I suggest to replace it instead completely with Python, as suggested in another answer.
