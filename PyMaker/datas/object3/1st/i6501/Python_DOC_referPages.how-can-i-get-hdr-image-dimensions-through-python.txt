Is there a python module that will allow me to read an HDR image's dimensions?Standard python PIL library can't read HDR images.HDR references high dynamic range images.  Photoshop can read this file format, but I have not been able to find any python module that can read this file format.Update:PIL Image.open returns "IOError: cannot identify image file"imghdr returns None when reading an HDR image file format.
There is a python module called smc.freeimage that can read HDR images.  Works well, but the trick is getting the module installed successfully.  Make sure you install the cython module first... then try easy_install instead of pip install.
