This is a script searching for files that are bigger than a specified size:I get the following error message while scanning root folder in Linux:I guessed it is because Python interpreter can not scan itself, so I tried to skip 'anaconda3' folder from the search (marked by #skip anaconda folder in the code above). However, the error message remained the same.Can anyone please explain?(Please let me know if such kind of questions is not allowed here and should be edited. Thank you)
The file python is trying get the size of with os.stat(filename).st_size is a broken link. A broken link is a link that has had it's target removed. It is much like an internet link that gives a 404. To fix this in your script, check if it is a file (preferred), or use a try/catch (not preferred). To check if the file is a file and not a broken link, use os.path.isfile(file_path). Your code should look like this:So before it gets the size, it checks if the file is really there, following all links to make sure it exists. Related SO post.
