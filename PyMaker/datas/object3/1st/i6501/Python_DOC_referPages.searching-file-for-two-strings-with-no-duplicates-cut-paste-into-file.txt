Natural Text
I have a file of configs. I am trying to get my python code to search for two different strings in a text file, copy (Cut would make my life so much easier) and paste them into a text file without duplicates. My code is working for just one string and every time I try to make it do two it will either not work or only find the lines with both strings.What am I doing wrong? 
Okay, here's my take on things.Assuming that you are looking for certain strings within each line, and then want to "copy" those lines to another file to see in which lines those strings were found, this, for example, should work:Depending on how many strings you are looking for on each line, you can either add or remove in statements on line 5 of my example code (I also provided an example line of code on the same line that demonstrates only needing to find one string on a line, which I commented out). The import sys statement does absolutely nothing in this case; the sys module/package is not needed to do this work, so do not include that import statement.
