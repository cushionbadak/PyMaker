Natural Text
I have the output of an elasticsearch query saved in a file. The first few lines looks like this:From all of these nodes I was interested in Unique _Ids, title, and description. So, I created a dictionary and extracted the parts that I was interested in using json. Here is my code:Now, when I run it, it gives me a file with duplicated _Ids! Does not dictionary suppose to give me unique _Ids? In my original output file, I have lots of duplicated Ids that I wanted to get rid of them.Also, I ran set() only on _ids to get unique number of them and it came to 138. But with dictionary if i remove generated duplicated ids it comes down to 17! Can someone please tell me why this is happening?
If you want a unique ID, if you're using a database it will create it for you. If you're not, you'll need to generate a unique number or string. Depending on how the dictionaries are created, you could use the timestamp of when the dictionary was created, or you could use uuid.uuid4(). For more info on uuid, here are the docs.
