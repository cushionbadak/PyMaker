I added this line of Code:As you can see the tweet script uses the first argument as tweet context. Unfortunately I don't know how to use the variable correct... Can you assist me here? 
Of course, don't pass your variable name in the literal string...Just adding out of quotes doesn't cut it because of the spaces. You have to protect with quotes.it should be:(better, but if there's a quote in tweet_string you'll have an issue again)Anyway: don't use os.system it's deprecated. This is better and handles quoting automatically:(Python 3.5 added a unified subprocess.run method which can check return code or not, redirect output in a variable or not, which is the recommended approach to run a subprocess if you don't need to be compatible with previous versions)Of course, always ask yourself the question when running a python subprocess inside a python module: wouldn't it be easier to import the module and call a function?
In generalIf you're using python 3.6
