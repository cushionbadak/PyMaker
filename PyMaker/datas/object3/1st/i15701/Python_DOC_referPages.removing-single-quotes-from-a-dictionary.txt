If you are certain that the values will all be integers and are safe to cast, you can do something as simple as:Note that using .items() works in both Python2 and Python3, .iteritems() is python2 only, irrc.  Performance wise, .items() in Python2 will return a copy (inherent inefficiencies) and .iteritems is a bit better, but in Python3 .items returns a view.
