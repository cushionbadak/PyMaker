Natural Text
I want to compare the s in the for-loop to a bunch of numbers that are multiples of 5 and I don't want to write out all of the or's in-between. Is there an easier way to write this?Of course, it's not correct syntax the way I've written it and it comes up with a bunch of errors.
This is what the in operator is for1:In this specific case however, you could just see if the number is divisible by 5:Also, you need to move this line outside of the loop:Otherwise, lst will be redefined with each iteration.1In Python 3.3 or greater, it would be more efficient to use a set literal here instead of a tuple literal:The newer versions of Python are smart enough to recognize constants such as this, evaluating them just once instead of each time they are encountered.  Thus, it is better to use a set, which has O(1) (constant) lookup time, rather than a tuple, which has O(n) (linear) lookup time.
