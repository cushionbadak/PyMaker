I know you can exclude certain packages using:Is it also possible to exclude single python files?I am building a binary wheel and want to exclude certain source files which I "cythonized" with a custom function:At the moment I remove all python files which also have a .so library file after building the wheel with a custom script and I would like to do that with setup.py.
There is a vague (IMO) article in py-docs "How to include/exclude files to the package". In two words: use combination of find_packages and MANIFEST.inTo check, what is in the package locally (before sending to PyPI), run python setup.py sdist, and then check the content of ./dist folder (there should be tarball with your package).My use-casesIgnore one fileAdd MANIFEST.in to the root of your package, and add these lines:This files won't be included into distribution package.Tests near sourcesIf in your project test files are placed near the code (in other words, there is no separated directory tests), something like this:You could add this lines to your MANIFEST.in, and setuptools will ignore test files:See alsoExclude specific file // on SOExclude submodule, include data // on SO
You can use setuptools.find_packages() along with a revision-control plugin i.e. setuptools-git.Here is some extracts from a setup.py projects setup to exclude the tests directory:Other plugins like the one used above are available for bzr, darcs, monotone, mercurial, etc.Tip:Don't forget to clean your build directory before running: python setup.py bdist_wheel
