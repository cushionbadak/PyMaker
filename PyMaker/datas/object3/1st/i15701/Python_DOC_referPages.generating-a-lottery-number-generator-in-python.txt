I am an amateur and I need some help in my making of a lottery number generator.I have got going a while loop where I make a variable set that variable to 0 then I tell python that while that variable is less than 6 it needs to create a random number within a range of 1,49 and I then tell it to add 1 to my variable this then creates 6 numbers within the range of 1,49 although what I need is for these numbers to be in ascending order and with no doubles, so no repeating numbers.
Are you allowed to use Python's random library? If so, this is trivial.The random.sample function takes a population (in your case the numbers 1 to 49), and number of samples to draw (in your case 6). Then you can use the sorted function to get the numbers in ascending order.A few more just to show that it is indeed random
