I'm a long-time user of the virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper Python packages.How does virtualenv differ from Python3's built-in venv module? Or is virtualenv built on, or incorporate, venv?
Well, at least Python3's venv doesn't have postactivate hook â€“ you have to add any custom environment variables and other stuff to activate.
