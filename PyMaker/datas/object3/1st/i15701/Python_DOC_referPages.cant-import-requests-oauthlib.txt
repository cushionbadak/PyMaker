I've failed to import requests_oauthlib, although I've installed it successfully:update:
requests-oauthlib is installed at /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages.But the latter is not in your PYTHONPATH/sys.pathSo add it.  This is one way.Learn about pythonpath
I had this issue and in addition to making sure the correct path was set, I found that running $ pip install requests requests_oauthlib solved the issue, as oauthlib is not included in the core requests library. https://github.com/requests/requests-oauthlib
