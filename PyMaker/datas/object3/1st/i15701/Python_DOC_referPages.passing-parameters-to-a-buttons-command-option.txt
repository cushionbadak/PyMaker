How do I use a function with parameters for a button? So how do I pass it? Would I:If that doesn't work can someone please explain how it works I saw people using lambda but I don't understand it. 
Yes, you can use a lambda for this:lambda creates what is known as an anonymous function.  It is equivalent to doing:except that the function is created inline.Note that you cannot do:because function(z,v) is a valid function call and will be executed as such when Python interprets the above line.  So, command will be assigned to the return value of function(z,v).
