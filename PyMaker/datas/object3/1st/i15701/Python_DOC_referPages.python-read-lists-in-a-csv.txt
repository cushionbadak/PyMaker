This question already has an answer here:How to turn a 'string list' into a real list?                    4 answers                I have a problem, I can not read a CSV file containing a columns made by list of float.This is the method I used to save the CSV. data is a list of tuples.In this way i get the following file in output, which is fine.Now, when I try to load the file in this wayI get list of strings instead a list of lists. What am I doing wrong?EDIT:I do not think the comma is a problem. Look at this code.The output is [1.1, 1.2, 1.3] [ instead of 1.1
If all you need to know is how to go from strings to lists and strings to numerals please refer to this post How to turn a 'string list' into a real list? and the Python docs at https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#float
I don't know if CSV has a concept of complex objects such as lists. You can map your lists to strings by using ",".join(your_list) given that you only use floats.Mapping back the stored string that represents a list would be as simple as retrieved_string.split(',').You may want to consider a format that supports lists such as JSON, which is also more friendly (from my experience) when using python.
