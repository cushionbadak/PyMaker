I got 2 lists:would like to write a function which returns True if both lists contain the exact same elements, and are same length. I'm kinda new on this stuff, so I got this, which I'm pretty sure it's terrible, and I'm trying to find a more efficient way. Thanks!
Sort the lists with sorted and then compare them with ==:You need to sort them first in case the elements are out of order:Actually, it would probably be better to test the length of the lists first and then use sorted:That way, we can avoid the sorting operations if the lengths of the list are different to begin with (using len on a list has O(1) (constant) complexity, so it is very cheap).
The two ways that come to mind are:1) Use collections.Counter2) Compare the sorted lists
If there aren't duplicates, use a set, it doesn't have an order:
try like this:
