I understand why, in Python, it's a bad idea to have a try..except block that doesn't try to handle specific exceptions.  I can't though, figure out where to find lists of the possible exceptions that can occur with any particular libraries, commands, or methods.For example, I am currently working with the decode statement as follows:How do I know what possible exceptions can be thrown?  In a broader sense, where should I look for this kind of information?Thank you
The built-in exceptions are listed in the Built-In Exceptions section of the library documentation. Decoding bytes to Unicode would throw the UnicodeDecodeError exception.You'd also check the documentation for the method you are calling; you are calling bytes.decode() here:The default for errors is 'strict', meaning that encoding errors raise a UnicodeError.
If you're looking for a list of all the builtin exceptions, you can find that in the documentation.  The brief description of each kind gives you a basic idea of when they might be used.  (Note that third-party libraries can also define their own exceptions, for which you'd need to look at the documentation for those libraries.)If you want to know what exceptions a particular function might throw, you need to look at the documentation for that function.  For instance, the documentation for decode indicates that it might throw a UnicodeError.
