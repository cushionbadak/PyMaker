Assign the variable in a setUp method. This will do the initialization before each test case is run.If you want the work to be done exactly once for the entire suite of tests, then you can use a setUpClass. You can assign the members for which you are interested to the class, and those will be accessible across methods.
By Having Class Level Objects it is accessible at all methods within the Same class. https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/classes.html
