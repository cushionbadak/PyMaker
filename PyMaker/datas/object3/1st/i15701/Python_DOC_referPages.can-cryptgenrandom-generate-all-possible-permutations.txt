I would like to shuffle a relatively long array (length ~400). While I am not a cryptography expert, I understand that using a random number generator with a period of less than 400! will limit the space of the possible permutations that can be generated.I am trying to use Python's random.SystemRandom number generator class, which, in Windows, uses CryptGenRandom as its RNG.Does anyone smarter than me know what the period of this number generator is? Will it be possible for this implementation to reach the entire space of possible permutations?
You are almost correct: you need a generator not with a period of 400!, but with an internal state of more than log2(400!) bits (which will also have a period larger than 400!, but the latter condition is not sufficient). So you need at least 361 bytes of internal state. CryptGenRandom doesn't qualify, but it ought to be sufficient to generate 361 or more bytes with which to seed a better generator.I think Marsaglia has versions of MWC with 1024 and 4096 bytes of state.
