I wanted to try out the python BytesIO class.As an experiment I tried writing to a zip file in memory, and then reading the bytes back out of that zip file. So instead of passing in a file-object to gzip, I pass in a BytesIO object. Here is the entire script:But it is returning an empty bytes object for result. This happens in both Python 2.7 and 3.4. What am I missing?
You need to seek back to the beginning of the file after writing the initial in memory file...
