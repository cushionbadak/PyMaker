So this is pretty simple I think but I can't seem to get it working.The objective is to simply define a function that will print a string, and the last letter of that string must be in the column 70.I did this.In the attempt to create 70 spaces and subtract them to the string's length.I get this error though:I know what it's telling me but can't turn it around.
(if len(s) > 70, you will have a problem)
you can use rjust: here is demo
Use the format function:
You should be doing:or, with a little spacing:This will create a string of spaces whose length is equal to 70 minus the length of the string s.  So, if s is 20 characters long, the code will make a string of 70-20 or 50 spaces.That said, a better solution would be to use str.rjust:Below is a demonstration:The str.rjust, str.ljust, and str.center methods (all explained in the link above) were designed specifically for tasks like this.
You could doIt will be more clear.
Something like this perhaps:
