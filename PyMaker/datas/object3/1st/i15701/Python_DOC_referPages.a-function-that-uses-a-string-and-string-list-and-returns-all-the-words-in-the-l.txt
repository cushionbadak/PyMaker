I want to define a function find_anagrams_in_word_list(str,str_list) where the parameters should be a string and a list of strings. The value returned should be a list of all the strings in the str_list that are values of str. I have a simple code that allows you to see if a word is an anagram of a anotherBut i can't seem to understand how to use this for a list.editI have gotten this far in creating this code but instead of printing the words if they are anagrams of 'str1' it prints '[]' which i think means that the words in str_list are not being appended to 'anagrams'I want a output like thisfind_anagrams_in_word_list("rat", "[art,tar,gar,jay]")'art''tar'as they are anagrams of rat.
if anagram(word,str1) checks each or in the list against the passed in str1, if anagram returns True then we keep that word, finally " ".join outputs all the words in the list as a single string. 
Here, str is the string to be matched and str_list is the list of all the stringsEDIT:To turn this into a fuction, try this:  
Then you have to assign variables and pass them to your function like thisSo you will get variable my_anagram which contains list of matched elements
