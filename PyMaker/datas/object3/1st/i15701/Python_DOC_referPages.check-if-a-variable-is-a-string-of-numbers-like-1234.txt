Natural Text
I am making a small interactive text game in python.i need to check if a string, from the user, is 1234 (a number in a string that would work with int() ) or foo (just a string, python would traceback if I called int() on it)thanks in advance!
If you want to know if something is "a number in a string, one that would work with int()", you do that by just calling int:This is a general case of the EAFP principle: It's Easier to Ask Forgiveness than Permission. Instead of trying to guess whether something would fail, it's usually easier to just try it and see if it fails.That's especially try in cases where trying to guess is more complicated than it looks. For example, people always suggest using the isdigit method here, but that fails in a number of cases. For example:isdigit is false for negative numbers, because the '-' character is not a digit.isdigit is false for numbers with trailing whitespace (e.g., because you're not rstripping newlines from your input).isdigit is true for hundreds of non-western digits and special-form digits that can't be used with int.int has changed its rules at least twice between Python 2.0 and 3.4, and could always change again.You probably could come up with a complicated rule that was exactly the same as "would work with int()" as interpreted in some specific Python version, but why, when int is  obviously guaranteed to always do the same thing as int?
