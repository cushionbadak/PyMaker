the function tornado.ioloop.PeriodicCallback(callback, callback_time, io_loop=None) says I couldn't add arguments for my callback function, but what if I really need to call callback with arguments? Is there a work around?
Yes, use a lambda or functools.partial. Docs for the partial function are here.In this example, if you change x or y, the change will be reflected in the next call to "my_function". On the other hand if you "import functools" and:Then later changes to the value of x and y will not appear in "my_function". And finally, you could just do:This behaves the same as the "lambda" expression earlier.
