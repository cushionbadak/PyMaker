I want to be able to call foo.py -R a b -R c d -R e f and get something like [('a', 'b'), ('c', 'd'), ('e', 'f')] in a variable.  I can instead use foo.py -R a=b -R c=d -R e=f and do the splitting manually, but I'd rather not do this, because I'm building a wrapper around another program and would like to mimic it's command line option input format.I have tried the following:but then I get ['e', 'f'] when I call it as foo.py -R a b -R c d -R e f.
You can use a custom argparse.Action class.https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html#argparse.Actionoutput:
