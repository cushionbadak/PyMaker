I went onto a piece of code which goes like this:I am trying to replace the numpy.max with some regular Python (math?) function, but I can not find what exactly does numpy.max does.I tried googling but I only found:numpy.maximum which is not the same as numpy.max I suppose.And:numpy.amax which is again not what I need.Does anyone know how I could replicate this numpy.max funtion into some standard python one?EDIT: I am using Python 2.7
You can't replicate the behavior of np.max very easily in pure Python, simply because multi-dimensional arrays aren't standard in Python. If the A and B in your code are such arrays, it would be best to keep the NumPy function.For flat (one-dimensional) arrays, the Python max and np.max do the same thing and could be exchanged:For arrays with more than one dimension, max won't work: By default, np.max flattens the 3D array and returns the maximum. (You can also find the maximum along particular axes, and so on.) The Python max cannot do this.To replace np.max, you'd need to write nested loops over the axes of the array; effectively trying to find the maximum in a list of  nested lists. This is certainly possible, but is likely to be very slow:
numpy.max is the same thing as numpy.amax:Or, more specifically, max is an alias for the amax function.The purpose of this function is listed in the docs link you gave, but it seems that it is mainly used to find the maximum value inside a numpy.array regardless of how many nested levels it has.  You can mimic this behavior with a simple function to flatten a list:and the built-in max function:See a demonstration below:
