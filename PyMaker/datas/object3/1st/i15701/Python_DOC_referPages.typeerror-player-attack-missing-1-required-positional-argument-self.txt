I keep on getting this error and I have absolutely no idea why, I have 3 files importing information from each other however this main one only draws information from monster_01.py and its player.py. ---main code---I've been up and down this code a hundred times, any help would be much appreciated.
The problem is with your get_player_attack method:It calls player_attack as if it were a stand-alone function and not another method.  But player_attack is a method of the class Player and therefore may only be called on an instance of Player.The function should be called like:Also, stuff like this:is just a problem waiting to happen.  It should be written as:Otherwise, the condition of the if-statement will be interpreted as:which will always evaluate to True.  For more information, see How do I test one variable against multiple values?Finally, you should not be putting all of your methods inside another function named battle.  I don't know what you are trying to do here, but method definitions should be just under the class header:I really think it would be good for you to read some tutorials on Python classes and OOP.  Here are some to get you started:https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.htmlhttp://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_classes_objects.htm
It's not clear what you're trying to do within battle().  You haven't defined a self parameter, but neither have you used the @static decorator to indicate you want it to be a static function.  You've defined player_attack within battle, so it can't be an instance method.  The syntax is incorrect.If you meant battle() to be an instance method, add a self parameter and provide a method body or pass, then make player_attack de-indented.
