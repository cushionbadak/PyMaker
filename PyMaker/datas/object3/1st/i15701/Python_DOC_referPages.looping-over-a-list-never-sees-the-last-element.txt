I do not know why, when I enter the "apathetic" mood, it just does not work.
It's because of this line:range returns a half-open range. For example, range(4) gives you the four numbers 0, 1, 2, 3. So, range(4-1) gives you the three numbers 0, 1, 2.Meanwhile, it's worth noting that avoiding off-by-one errors like this is a major part of the reason you should just be looping over sequences directly. Instead of this:â€¦ just do this:Or, as Joran Beasley points out in the comments, if the only thing you're doing is checking whether mood is equal to any of moods, you can do that much more simply:But you can simplify this even further. You set a flag to break out of the outer loop, then break out of the inner loop, all so that you can return. Why not just return directly?
