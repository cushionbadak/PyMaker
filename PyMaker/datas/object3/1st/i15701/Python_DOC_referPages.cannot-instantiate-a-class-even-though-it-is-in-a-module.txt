I want to use pycvss so I installed it via pip.  Instantiating the Cvss() class fails, though:When inspecting the module it indeed looks quite empty:But when I check where python looks for the module:it looks like that,/usr/local/python-2.7.8/lib/python2.7/site-packages/pycvss/pycvss.py does define `Cvss():I must be missing something obvious, but the more I look, the less I see (other modules are fine, including those installed by pip like for instance requests).
The __init__ file in that project is empty. You need to import the nested pycvss module:The documentation is rather unclear about this; I'd file a documentation issue with the project.Personally, I'd add one line to the __init__.py file here:and update the documentation to illustrate how to import that class.Note that the project expects the enum library to be available. If you are not using Python 3.4 or newer, you'll have to install the enum34 backport package too.
pycvss is a package you need to import it as or do it:-
