I'm creating a text based game with multiple stats you have to keep up, such as stamina, health, etc. and I am having trouble with what happens if they go below 0. I know a while-loop would work I could do:But I don't know how to do that with multiple conditions such as stamina, hunger, strength etc.
You can combine them into a single test using min:
Since 0 evaluates to False in Python, you can use all:This will test if all of the names are not equal to zero.If however you need to test if all of the names are greater than zero (meaning, they could become negative), you can add in a generator expression:
You can always use and and or. For example:
You could put if statements into the while loop that check those stats at the start of each iteration.  That way you can handle each event individually.
