I have been banging my head against Multiprocessing in Python for the better part of the day now, and I've managed to make very little progress - I apologize if my question is a duplicate or my ignorance is apparent - I couldn't find it asked anywhere else in this way.I'm looking for a way to run functions in parallel, and return some arbitrary thing they've produced back to the main script.The question is:  Can a Process() started from Multiprocessing return a list or some other arbitrary variable type?For example, I would like to:And then somehow access the list from 30_second_function and the dictionary from 5_second_function.  Is this possible?  Am I going about this the wrong way?
Process itself does not provide a way to get return value.  To exchange data between processes, you need to use queue, pipe, shared memory, ...:Alternative using multiprocessing.pool.Pool:Or using concurrent.futures module (also available in standard library since Python 3.2+):
