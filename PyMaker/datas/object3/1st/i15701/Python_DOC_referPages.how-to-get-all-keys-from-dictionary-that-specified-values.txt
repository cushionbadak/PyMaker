If I have dict like this:How to get keys that have values 2, like this:This is example. Assume some_dict is has many thousands or more keys.
You can do it like this:This uses a list comprehension to iterate through the pairs of (key, value) items, selecting those keys whose value equals 2.Note that this requires a linear search through the dictionary, so it is O(n). If this performance is not acceptable, you will probably need to create and maintain another data structure that indexes your dictionary by value.
you can also use dictionary comprehension, if you want result to be dictionaryoutput:
Well, you can use generator to produce found key values, one by one, instead of returning all of them at once.The function search_keys returns generator
