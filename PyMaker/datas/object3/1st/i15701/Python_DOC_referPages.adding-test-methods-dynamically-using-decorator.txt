I've been using DDT to parameterize my tests with great success for the past few months. My issue now is that I can't seem to inject a list variable as my data source. Doing so seems to confuse DDT causing it to not parameterize my tests. I started to create my own solution, but I can't seem to figure this last part out.Here is what I have thus far as decorators - And I use it as such - How can I make the Python testing framework recognize that I've added via decorator? I know the methods have been added because issuing the dir command in PDB displays them. The goal for this is that I would duplicate the test(s) I decorate for each item in a list. For those wondering why wrapper() has no code, I did this because uncommenting the line the return call causes the method I decorate to be executed without parameters, thus causing an error.In my example, I would expect 4 tests with different names to be executed.
The best solution is to use the sub tests feature of unittest in python 3.4. Documentation found here and used like:For those who cannot use python 3.4, the following is a poor man's replacement.
