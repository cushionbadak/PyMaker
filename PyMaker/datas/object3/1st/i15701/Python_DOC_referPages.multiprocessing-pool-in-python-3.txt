I had a scripts working in Python 2 and I am trying to make it work in Python 3.One thing I stumbled upon and have no idea about how to solve is the fact that the get() method in the class Applyresult() seems to throw now:In Pycharm the Traceback is:The line offending is in pool.py:It is called from the following line in my script:This script was working in Python 2 and I cannot understand why it would not be working in Python 3. Does anyone have an idea why ?
From the multiprocessing documentation:get([timeout])It seems likely to me that your exception comes from run_regtest.The exception you are getting is pretty common when you switch from Python 2 to Python 3. Many functions in the standard library (and other libraries) that used to return strings now return bytes. A bytes object can be converted to a string using b.decode('utf-8'), for example, you only need to know the encoding.
