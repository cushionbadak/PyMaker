I use a randomizer to make random number from 5 to 10. Can't be so hard? I have used it previously on code (+2000 lines of code, too much for here) and no coding errors occurred.My code is simply easter egg to my game but it broke all my code:act is a string whose value is provided by the user simply with act=str(input("type here.")). It is directly done before this part.Error message:What is the actual problem?
You are trying to pass floating point values to random.randint(). That function only takes integers.You need to use the random.uniform() function instead; it'll produce a uniformly random value between the lower and upper bound (inclusive):Return a random floating point number N such that a <= N <= b for a <= b and b <= N <= a for b < a.Demo:
random.randint(0.1,0.9)You have to pass integers to that function. 0.1 and 0.9 are not integers
