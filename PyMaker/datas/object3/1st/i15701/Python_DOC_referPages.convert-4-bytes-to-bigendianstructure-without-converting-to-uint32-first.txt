I am converting date and time stored in 4 bytes to Python format. I came up with naive approach first. Then I tried to use ctypes so it should be faster:However, what I do not like is this part:I am converting 4 bytes to uint32. Can I change my Union to be able to easier accept 4 bytes array without converting it to uint32 first? I tried c_ubyte * 4 but got TypeError: expected c_ubyte_Array_4 instance, got bytes.
You can use the from_buffer_copy method thatâ€™s available on all ctypes types to create a PackedDate object directly from the bytes data:
