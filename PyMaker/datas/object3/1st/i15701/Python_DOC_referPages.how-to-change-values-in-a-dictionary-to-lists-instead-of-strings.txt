Your current code is not working because your loop is just repeatedly reassigning the name v to list(v).  It is not actually changing the values inside dict1.The easiest way to do what you want is to use a dict comprehension:Note that in Python 2.x, you should do dict1.iteritems() to avoid creating an unnecessary list.
