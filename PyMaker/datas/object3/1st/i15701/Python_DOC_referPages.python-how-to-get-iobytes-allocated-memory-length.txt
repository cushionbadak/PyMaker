This is the code i am using to test the memory allocation How to get the allocated buffer/memory length by BytesIO ?what am i doing wrong here ? python doesn't allocate fixed buffer length ?
I am not sure what you mean by allocated buffer/memory length, but if you want the length of the user data stored in the BytesIO object you can doBut this seems equivalent to the len(buf.getvalue()) that you are currently using.The actual size of the BytesIO object can be found using sys.getsizeof():Or you could be nasty and call __sizeof__() directly (which is like sys.getsizeof() but without garbage collector overhead applicable to the object):Memory for BytesIO is allocated as required, and some buffering does take place:
io.BytesIO() returns a standard file object which has function tell(). It reports the current descriptor position and does not copy the whole buffer out to compute total size as len(bio.getvalue()) of bio.getbuffer().nbytes. It is a very fast and simple method to get the exact size of used memory in the buffer object. I posted an example code and a more detailed answer here
