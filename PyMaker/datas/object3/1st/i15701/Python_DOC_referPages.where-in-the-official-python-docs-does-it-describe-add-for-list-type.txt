Natural Text
In both the Python 3 and Python 2 documentation, there is no reference to __add__ for the list type.It exists neither in the list type description nor in the special methods section.Do the official docs omit description of the implementation of + for list?
There's a documentation for Common Sequence Operations.s + t:  the concatenation of s and tIt's not specially for list, but for sequence types.
