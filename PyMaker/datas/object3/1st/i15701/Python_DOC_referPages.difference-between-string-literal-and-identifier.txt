What's the difference between a string literal and an identifier? I tried googling this and ended up being more confusedSpecifically interested with the difference in Python, and difference in SQLiteFrom SQLite DocumentationReference Documentationhttps://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#identifiershttps://www.sqlite.org/lang_keywords.html
An identifier is a variable name. In the following python linefoo is an identifier and "bar" is a string litteral. In Python, string litteral can be enclosed in simple ('') or double (") quotes.In SQLite (and more generally in SQL), string litterals are enclosed in single quotes. Double quotes are use to force a string containing otherwise special characters to be interpreted as identifiers.Example assuming a table foo with column bar :In this select, the first column will have name Bar. Without the ", the name would have been bar since SQL does not normally distinguishes case. The second column will the the constant zz and the column name will be other.The " are also useful to have accented chars like éè for non english languages.
In Python both 'keyword' and "keyword" are just string literals, no difference.In SQLite, if you want to use a SQLite keyword (not a Python keyword) as a string literal (so a value of a string) you should use ''. If you want to use it as a SQLite identifier, e.g. a table name, you have to use "".
