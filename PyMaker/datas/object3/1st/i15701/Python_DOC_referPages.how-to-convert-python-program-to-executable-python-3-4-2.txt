I'm wanting to convert a python 3.4.2 program into an executable file. I've tried using PyInstaller and Py2exe, But neither is being ported to the python 3.4.2 suite. Do I have any alternative way to do this?
Got the solution from an online forum, cx_Freeze is cross-platform and does the same, as that of PyInstaller and it also supports Python 3.4
You can use Python Launcher for Windows (new in 3.3).The Python launcher for Windows is a utility which aids in the location and execution of different Python versions. It allows scripts (or the command-line) to indicate a preference for a specific Python version, and will locate and execute that version.
