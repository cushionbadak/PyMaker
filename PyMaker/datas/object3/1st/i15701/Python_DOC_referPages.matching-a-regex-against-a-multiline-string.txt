I am trying to match a Regex against a multi-line string, but the match fails after the first line.These expressions work as expected:Whilst this expression does not work:
re.match was designed to match from the first character (the start) of the string.  In the first two examples, the match works fine because a is the first character.  In the last example however, the match fails because \n is the first character.You need to use re.search in this case to have Python search for the a:Also, just a note: if you are working with multi-line strings, then you will need to set the dot-all flag to have . match newlines.  This can be done with re.DOTALL.
Why doesnt match work?match searches the pattern at the start of the string.How to correct?use search instead
