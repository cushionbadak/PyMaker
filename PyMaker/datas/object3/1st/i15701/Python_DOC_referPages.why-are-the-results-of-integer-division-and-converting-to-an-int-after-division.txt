Output of the codes:Why different values? Why the output of the second print() looks so?
The floating point representation of 10**40//2 is not accurate:That's because floating point arithmetic is only ever an approximation, especially when you go beyond what your CPU can accurately model (as floating point is handled in hardware).The integer division never has to represent the 10**40 number as a float, it only has to divide the integer, which in Python can be arbitrarily large without precision loss.Also see:Floating Point Arithmetic: Issues and Limitations in the Python tutorialWhat Every Programmer Should Know About Floating-Point ArithmeticWhat Every Computer Scientist Should Know About Floating-Point ArithmeticAlso look at the decimal module if you must use higher-precision floating point arithmetic.
