Natural Text
Say I have an array with integers 1 through 10 and have to replace all integers less than 6 with 0 and all integers equal to or greater than 6 with 1.  Currently, I am doing this:I was wondering what would be a way to combine these two statements into one line of code, or any other solution for that matter.
I assume that arry is a numpy array (the smart indexing that you are using seems to indicate this). In that case you can simply do:where astype(int) will convert the array of booleans arry >= 6 to an array of integers.
You can use a simple list comprehension:Which is equivalent to the following loops:
for numpy array, (arry >= 6) gives an array of True/False which you can multiply by 1or add 0or cast to int
This works because True is defined to be the same value as 1 and False is defined to be the same value as 0.
