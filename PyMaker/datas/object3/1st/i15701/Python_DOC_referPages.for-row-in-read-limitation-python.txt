Natural Text
I only want to execute this loop rownum times:Inserting something like for i in range(0, rownum): doesn't work, but I can't make sense of where to put it, either.  How do I say for y in x N times?
Use itertools.islice
if you don't want to import itertools, you can also use enumerate and break: itertools is more pythonic, though.
