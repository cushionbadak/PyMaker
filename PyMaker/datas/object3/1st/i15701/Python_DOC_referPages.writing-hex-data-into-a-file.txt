I'm trying to write hex data taken from ascii file to a newly created binary fileascii file example:my code Thought hexList holds already hex converted data and f.write(hex(i)) should write these hex data into a file, but python writes it with ascii modefinal output: 0x9f0x2c0x380x590xcd0x110x7c0x590xc90x30xea0x37 which is wrong!where is the issue?
Use binascii.unhexlify:
replace:With:Or,ExplanationObserve:65 should translate into a single byte but hex returns a four character string.  write will send all four characters to the file.By contrast, in python2:This does what you want: chr converts the number 65 to the character single-byte string which is what belongs in a binary file.In python3, chr(i) is replaced by bytes((i,)).
