I'm trying  to print the data columwise from my csv file.This gives correct prints where I can display data columnwise but when I tried:It printed just 1st column correctly rest all columns are blank!Where exactly I'm going wrong?
The problem with your code is that data is a one-shot iterator (whether a csv.reader or something you wrote yourself). Once you get to the last row at the end of the file the first time, for each in data: is just going to give you all the rows after the last row, of which there are none.You could fix this by closing the file, reopening it, and wrapping another reader around it. Or by calling f.seek(0) on the file. Or by reading the whole file into something repeatably-iterable like a list of strings, and iterating that. But really, none of those are very good solutions.A better idea is to just reverse your loops:Now it's equivalent to your original code, except without all that repetition.An even better idea is to just use zip to transpose your data, as in Joran Beasley's answer:
thats all you should need
