Natural Text
So I have a text file that reads something like:I want to read this file into a 2D array in python such that matrix[] array will hold arrays containing integers of each line.For example, matrix[2][3] == 6I am not sure if my logic or programming is right in this (I am new to python) but here is what I have so far:I get an invalid syntax error covering the nested for statement, as in int (n) for n
List comprehensions must be enclosed in square brackets [...]:Also, there is no reason to do openfile.close() because the with-statement automatically closes the file for you when control leaves its code block (that is what it is for).
