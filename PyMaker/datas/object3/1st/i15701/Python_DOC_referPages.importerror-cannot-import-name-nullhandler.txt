I'm trying to deploy a hello-world type app on Elastic Beanstalk. Just about everything seems to work, packages are installed, etc. up to the point where mod_wsgi attempts to retrieve the "application" object from wsgi.py. At that point, the following appears in the logs (once in the logs for each unsuccessfuly HTTP request):Link to concurrent AWS Forum Post.
NullHandler was introduced in version 2.7. Are you sure you are running 2.7 on your server?
After much trial and error, the (immediate) problem was solved by removing python logging from requirements.txt and rebuilding the environment.I do not yet fully understand why this is a problem.  On my local machine, I'm able to install logging and run Django without error. I suspect as vikramls pointed out that something weird is happening in the intersection between mod_wsgi, the baselineenv in which mod_wsgi executes, and the virtualenv in which my app operates.But, at least for now, I'm fixing this error by not including "logging" in requirements.txt when deploying Django 1.7 on Elastic Beanstalk.
I had similar problem and in my case the issue was that for some unrelated project I created logging.py file in home folder and when I ran something in home, it was importing this file instead of the real module.You can check which file is being imported like this:I fixed it by deleting logging.py I created previously.
The NullHandler is only available on Python version 2.7+. You could create the NullHandler yourself on an ImportError:More information about logging.NullHandler: https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.handlers.html#logging.NullHandler.
