I use a data structure which is a multi-dimensional numpy array. For some use cases, this array has n, and for other n+1 dimensions. I want to keep the nice structure it has and not clutter the code with too many conditions, so I was wondering if there's a way to always use n+1 indices and have the last index ignored by an indexing operation.For instance the following should work equivalent:
How about Ellipsis?  Normally I see it in the brackets, but this test shows it can be assigned to a variable
