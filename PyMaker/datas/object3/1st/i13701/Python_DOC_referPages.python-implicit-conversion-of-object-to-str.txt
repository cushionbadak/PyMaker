Given the following codeI am wondering why B's __repr__ is not called when "adding" A's self.b to a string.https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.reprhttps://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#operators
Concatenation doesn't cause self.b to be evaluated as a string. You need to explicitly tell Python to coerce it into a string.You could do:But using str.format would be better.However as jonrsharpe points out that would try to call __str__ first (if it exists), in order to make it specifically use __repr__ there's this syntax: {!r}.
You can use repr()its works for me
