Hi I am fairly new to python and I am trying to create a program that starts a thread that after five seconds will interrupt the input () function and print the message “Done!”.Currently it only prints “Done!” after input is given. Even after five seconds has passed, the user must enter input before the message "Done!" is displayed. How can I get the thread to interrupt the input() function?(Using Python version 3.4.2)
You don't need a thread to do this, use a signal instead:You can read the documentation on signal module:https://docs.python.org/2/library/signal.html
As NeoWang shows, you can do it with a signal.  You can also do it with a thread and a signal.  Here is a slightly more complete example that will let you enter several lines of data, and will exit if it has been more than 5 seconds since you pressed enter:
