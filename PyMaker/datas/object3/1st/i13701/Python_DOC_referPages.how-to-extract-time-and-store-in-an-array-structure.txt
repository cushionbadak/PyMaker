I want to measure the time difference between two time readings in a Python script.I got the result as 0:00:04.052000.What exactly is this time format I am getting?How to extract the time in seconds from time_stamp?How to store time_stamp in an array like variable (as I want to use a loop and store the time_stamp for each loop)How to store time_stamp_sec in an array like variable
1) It's a datetime.timedelta object which is being printed nicely:2) You can use total_seconds():This gives you a float as the datetime.timedelta may represent an amount of time which isn't an exact number of seconds.3) You can append it to a list at each step in the loop:4) You can do the same with the result of total_seconds():
