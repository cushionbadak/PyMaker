This question already has an answer here:Finding in elements in a tuple and filtering them                    4 answers                I have the following tuple containing molecule number (MolNum) and corresponding distance from certain reference point. The molecules are arranged in ascending order according to distances. I can extract MolNum and distances as two individual lists. However, I would like to get the elements of g by satisfying the following condition, if  10 < distance < 100 ; so I will get gg. How I can get this ? After satisfying the condition; 

You can use the builtin filter function for this, giving the condition as a lambda expression in first argument and the list to filter in second argument -For Python 2.7 , you do not need the list(...) as filter returns a list.In Python 3.x, filter() function returns an iterator which yields elements where the condition is satisfied (that is the condition returns True .In Python 2.7 ,  filter() function returns a list of elements where the condition is satisfied (that is the condition returns True .Example/Demo -
You can try like thisOr you may think about @Anand S Kumar is answer of using filter(), which is a more pythonic way.Hope it helps
You might want to look at Pandas, it's a very commonly used package for tabular data analysis of this type:
