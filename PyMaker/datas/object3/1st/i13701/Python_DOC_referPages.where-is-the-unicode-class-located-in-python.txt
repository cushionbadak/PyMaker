I am trying to use a Python package called bidi. In a module in this package (algorithm.py) there are some lines that give me error, although it is part of the package.Here are the lines:and here is the error message:How should I re-write this part of the code so it works in Python3?Also if anyone have used bidi package with Python 3 please let me know if they have found similar problems or not. I appreciate your help.
Python 3 renamed the unicode type to str, the old str type has been replaced by bytes.You may want to read the Python 3 porting HOWTO for more such details. There is also Lennart Regebro's Porting to Python 3: An in-depth guide, free online.Last but not least, you could just try to use the 2to3 tool to see how that translates the code for you.
You can use the six library to support both Python 2 and 3:
If you need to have the script keep working on python2 and 3 as I did, this might help someoneand can then just do for example
Hope you are using Python 3 ,Str are unicode by default, so please Replace Unicode function with String Str function.
