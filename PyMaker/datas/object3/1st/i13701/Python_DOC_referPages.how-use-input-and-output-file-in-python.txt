Natural Text
I have a Python script that inputs all words from a file and sorts them in order:But instead of asking every time for the input file I would like to choose the input file with a "-i" and save the output file with a "-o", this way:and BTW, how to save the output on a target file?
This should do it:argparse is a built-in module for parsing command-line options. It does all the work for you.
To get started on your parameters, take a look at sys.argv.To write into an output file, use the write mode "w", and .write() to it.For the latter there are definitely good tutorials out there.
