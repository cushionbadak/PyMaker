I have a set of two values called mySet. It looks something like this:And I have a list, myList, of lines that contain four strings each. A line in the list looks something like this:with each of the four strings separated by a single space. I would like to construct a loop where if both of the values in mySet are contained in a single line of myList, the loop will return TRUE. I have an idea that maybe I could make a new list of just the second and third elements of each line of myList and then check the values from mySet against that, but I'm not sure how I would implement that either. Thanks in advance for your time.
If by "return" you meant a function (or any callable), you need to do so separately despite the for loop, because for loops don't return anything. However, this problem can be easily solved with the builtin any and all functions like this:It will print True. We have done all of the calculation in one single line. Also, notice how I converted all the integers in to strings in the mySet - you might want to do it separately in another set, if you don't want to mutate that set.
split to convert space-separated values to listmap to convert all list elements to floats for comparisonissubset (or equivalently issuperset) to check whether one is a subset of the other
