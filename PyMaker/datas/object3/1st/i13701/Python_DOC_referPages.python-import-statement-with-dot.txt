Natural Text
I have an import statement and it has periods.Is it equivalent toxyz/app/lib_procs?
Dots denote namespaces. Usually that means the code is organised into packages, and the easiest way to create such packages is by using directories with __init__.py files in them.There are esoteric ways to make such a statement work without directories, using custom loaders for example, but 99.9% of cases where you come across such a statement you probably have directories yes.For your example, you would expect there to be a xyz directory, containing an app directory, in which either lives a lib_process.py file that contains the procs name, or there is a lib_process directory and procs is eiter a name available in the __init__.py module in that directory, or a procs.py module file.See the original packages specification.
No, app is a submodule of app, which is itself a submodule of xyz
