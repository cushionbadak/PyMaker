I have a list of lists as shown below with name of an animal as key and an ID,Status as value. One animal can have multiple value and each ID is repeated multiple times with pass/fail status. There are many lines of record like this for many animals. I am trying to iterate through each line in python and want to calculate - for an animal what all IDs are passed. An ID will be considered pass for an animal if if there is no Failed status in it. Logically I understand it will use two for loops but not able to put this through python code. Thanks for your help.
Store the successes in a set, and the failures in another set. Go through the data and put each entry into the proper set based on whether it contains a failure. Finally, subtract the failures from the successes, and you're left with all the successes which have no failure match (I printed this result directly).Result:You can group these by animal as well, with a defaultdict:
Try:It will give you:
Well first in order to iterate through your list and keep all of the items as unique variable names in one nice for loop:A really quick and dirty way of solving your specific question while using only native python data structuresThis code with your data outputs:
