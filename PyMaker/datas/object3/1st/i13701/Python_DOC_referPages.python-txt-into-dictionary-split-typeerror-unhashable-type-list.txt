I just started with Python and I'm having some troubles with one exercise. I am really sorry if the question is too "basic stuff" but I've done my research on google and can't find any short and not too complicated answer. And now the exercise:"Write a program that reads the words in words.txt and stores them as keys in a dictionary. It doesn't matter what the values are. Then you can use the in operator as a fast way to check whether a string is in the dictionary."I tried this: However, I don't get the words, but sentences. So I thought I could use split() like this:But now it doesn't work. I get:Can anyone please explain to me why is that happening and give me a hint about how can I fix it? Please, pretty please? 
After using str.split() you would get a list of the split words, you would need to iterate over that list and set it to the dictionary. Example -
