I'm looking for a way to navigate to a particular iteration in a generator object.I have a generator object that goes through a list of JSON objects. Instead of loading all of them at once, I created a generator so that each JSON object loads only at each iteration.However, now I am looking for some way to navigate to the nth iteration to retrieve more data on that user. The only way I can think of doing this is iterating through the generator and stopping on the nth enumeration:Any better ways to do this?
This should do it:This is one of many useful utilities included in the itertools documentation.
