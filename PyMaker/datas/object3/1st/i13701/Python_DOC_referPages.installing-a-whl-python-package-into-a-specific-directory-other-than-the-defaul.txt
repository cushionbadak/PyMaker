I am trying to install the 64-bit version of NTLK, which comes in a .whl file, in a different directory than the standard python34/Lib folder. I am using Windows 10 64-bit and Python 3.4 64-bit.I first tried using the instructions in this question (which worked for other modules).The command I typed into CMD was:It promptly gave me the following error:UserWarning: Disabling all use of wheels due to the use of --build-options / --global-options / --install-options.It appears that I can't install WHL files using the --install-option. Is there an alternate way I can install the .whl package in a non default directory?Edit:  I marked this as solved because the proposed solution allows me to do what I need in my own use case. However, it doesn't completely answer the question due to inherent limitations in using --root to choose an alternate directory. There is technically no correct solution to this problem, see the answer's comments for details.Edit - March 3, 2017: It looks like this issue has been resolved in version 8.0 of PIP with the addition of the --prefix parameter. I've changed the accepted answer accordingly.
You can use the --prefix option of pip install, available since version 8:--prefix Note that pip uninstall does not have the --prefix option, so there is no obvious way to uninstall packages installed this way. As a workaround, set PYTHONUSERBASE to the prefix directory, e.g.:
Why it happensWhen running pip install from source, it invokes a build process, which runs the setup.py script and passes to it the --install-option you pass in.Installing wheels however does not invoke this build process, and no decision has been made about supporting these use cases, as of yet (see the ongoing discussion).Possible solutionHowever, pip install does currently support installing to custom locations with the options --user and --root, which may achieve what you are looking for.CaveatsAs mentioned in the comments, there seems to be an issue with detecting whether the package is already installed when using --root, and the workaround could be using --upgrade or --ignore-installed options.Additionally, using --root will install the module to user_defined_path/python34/Lib/site-packages/. This makes this option useful for installing the library on a different drive or a non-default python installation, but does not allow installing to a specific folder within a specific directory. 
See another way of solving your problem would be by using 7-zip and unzipping the whl file which inside the unzipped directory  will give you a proper folder of the python module which you can then copy and paste wherever you wish
