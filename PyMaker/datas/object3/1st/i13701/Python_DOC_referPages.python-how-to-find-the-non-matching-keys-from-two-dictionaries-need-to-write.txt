In python I have two dictionary which are present in a list. I need to find out the non matching keys & need to write in a fileI have tried with set & symmetric_difference concept. Now i got all the non matching key in a form of set. Now i don't know how to write in a file.output should be in file.
You can use writelines() to write an iterable to your file :
You could use file.writelines() and a generator expression:Contents of disk_output.txt file afterwards:
You don't need a set, you can use dict.viewkeys for python2 then just format the output however you want and write, also open the file once using with which will automatically close your file:Just use .keys for python3.
