I have a webserver (CherryPy) running with on a Cubox (armhf platform) and upon starting the wever i get the following error:I'm not sure whether I understand the problem correctly and I am not sure if it can be fixed by me. As far as I can tell by the Traceback it is caused by CherryPy. This error causes a 500 Internal Server Error and won't load the page.As asked in the comments I inserted a print. I don't see any thing special. This is the output of starting the server and once trying to load the page:I am not sure which of these values causes the error. I am guessing it's the one with 4 in front? On a windows machine time.gmtime(4593151133.439074) returns a struct which contains the year 2115.On the Cubox when starting a python shell and entering time.gmtime(4593151133.439074) I can reproduce the error. But I don't know where these values come from. EDITI have found the file and line in CherryPy that returns me the floating numbers which lead to the year 2115. It is line 949 - 951 in the file session.py: Why I get such a high timeout, I don't know.
I have found the issue. A coworker set the timeout to a very high value for timeout which didn't cause any issue on Linux or Windows with 32/64 Bit architecture but on armhf. I was able to fix the problem by setting the timeout to a lower value via
To workaround the range limitation for C gmtime() on armhf platform, you could use the explicit formula to get the UTC time from a POSIX timestamp as the docs suggest:
