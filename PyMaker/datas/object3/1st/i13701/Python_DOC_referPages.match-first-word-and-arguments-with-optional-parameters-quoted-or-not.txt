All, I'm attempting to parse instructions from users (stored as a single-line string) with the following characteristics:first word is a command- no spaces allowed, but can have leading or trailing spaces depending on how disciplined the user isoptional arguments after the command with either a comma or spaces (or both) separating the argumentsinput in double quotes is considered a single argument, so commas inside double quotes aren't used to separate arguments (this is used to create lists).Examples of input and desired parsing (shown as a dictionary); single quotes start and end examples and are not a part of the string to be parsed..:I'm on PY3.4, but the critical issue is the RegEx, no real need for a python-specific implementation.

You should consider using argparse or optparse for python < 2.7.
