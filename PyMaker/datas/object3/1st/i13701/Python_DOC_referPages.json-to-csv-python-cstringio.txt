Here is a snippet of the JSON:Essentially, this should create a CSV (in memory) with 2 rows, that looks like this:Currently, the output comes out like this, which is wrong:I believe the 'u' bit refers to Unicode, but I don't know how to change the encoding. Any help would be greatly appreciated!Here is the Python code I have so far:EDITHi guys, slight change of plan.Essentially, I have a String object, but it actually is structured like a JSON file:How do I go about converting this to CSV? I can't use the json module as it is not a JSON file.
Here is my approach: use csv.DictWriter to handle converting from a dictionary to a row of CSV data:
Here's a little snippet I wrote up, I think it should handle your scenario and give you a list of lists. Ereli is onto something with that module though, it might make your life easier. But in the meantime maybe this will help. 
You should probably consider using something like csvwriter. it will handle the escaping and delimiter setting for you.See example for python3:it can also be used with cStringIO.
