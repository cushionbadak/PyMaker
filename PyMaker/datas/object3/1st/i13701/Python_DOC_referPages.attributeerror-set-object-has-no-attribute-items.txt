I am very new to python and have been trying to teach myself as I go (not the best method this deep into python but for time's sake I need too). The modules I've imported are Tkinter and csv. Let me know if you have any questions,For the sake of brevity I am not going to post my entire code on here but I will include the entire error and indicate the line that the error is applying to. Everything that is below is in a class called MainApp.I wrote this code out separately to make sure it worked before putting it in the program and it worked perfectly, but when I put it in the class and made the changes (I thought) I needed to make to the lines of code / variables it didn't work. So that leads me to believe that I'm just correcting something incorrectly.Here is the error:Where line 328 refers to the line:"or (self.key,self.val) in self.changes.items():"I have changed around (I feel like) the presence or absence of "self." for all variables but I just can't get it to work.EDIT:I altered the code to look like this:as per the comments, but still get the exact same error.
As you can see from the latest updated code -When you define self.changes as above , you are actually defining a set , not a dictionary , since you used ',' (comma) instead of colon , I am pretty sure in your actual code you are using comma itself , not colon .To define a dictionary with "MTMA" as key and 123 as value , use a colon in between them , Example -Do similarly in your actual code as well.If what you want is an empty dictionary , define it as -
