I am trying to write iterator class that will allow me to specify the length of steps the iterator makes. But I am stuck with that problem.My code:this shows me letter 'l' alwaysbut loop gives me: =TypeError: next() missing 1 required positional argument: 'step'`:
Your __next__ method should not take any arguments (other than self). You are not even using the step argument, you are (correctly) using self.step. Just remove the argument:Next, you have an error; you want to test if the index drops below 0 after subtracting, otherwise you generate negative indices. You could test the index together with the step subtracted:Demo:
I realize this is not a direct answer to the question, but in case you just want to get the job done, and think you need to implement it all yourself; you don't.
To implement this:as your own iterator:Example:Note:self.index starts with len - 1__next__() does not accept any argument except selffirst you get value then you decrement the indexA more flexible design would separate the reversing (e.g., delegate it to the reversed() builtin) and using step != 1 (accept an arbitrary reversible iterable and/or use/implement extended slicing) e.g., based on @Cyphase's suggestion:
