Problem Description:I want to crawl some info from the bbs of my college. Here is the address:http://bbs.byr.cnBelow is the code of my spider:However, with this code, I often get an Error: raise ValueError("No element found in %s" % response)My Investigation:I find that this Error happens when scrapy try to parse the HTML code of the url: http://bbs.byr.cn, scrappy parses the page with lxml. Below is the codeSo I look into the code with the code:    print etree.tostring(root)And find that HTML element:</form>is parsed into &lt;/form&gt;no wonder the code forms = root.xpath('//form') will return an empty forms list.But I don't know why this is happening, maybe the HTML code encoding? (The HTML code is encoded with GBK not UTF8.)   Thanks advance for anyone who can help me out? BTW, if anyone want to write code against the website, I can give you an test account, pls leave me an email address in the comment.Thanks a lot, guys!!
