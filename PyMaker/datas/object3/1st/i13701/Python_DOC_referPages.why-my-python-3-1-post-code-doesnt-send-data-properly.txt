I'd like to make a post like this, using Python 3.1 (I just used the "Copy as cURL" on firefox): I've made many searches on stackoverflow, and I make this code (only the necessary parts shown):Even with response.getcode() == 200, the POST doesn't change values on the Host. If I try to execute this cURL command, the POST occurs properly, so the problem isn't the Host. The problem is with my code.Can someone give me a clue?EDIT:What I'm trying to do is:1) log in a server with my credentials2) get PHPSESSID and SERVERID returned3) add data to the server with HTTP POSTThings to consider: when I do a get to login.php, the server already gives me a PHPSESSID and SERVERID. When I POST my credentials {'login': '...', 'password': '...', 'sendButton': 'buttonValue'}, I don't know how to check if user/password was sent correctly.I can see that, if I do a login via browser, take PHPSESSID and SERVERID, and replace them into the cURL command, I can send data to the server. But, using python, I'm not getting the same sucess.
I'm not sure that I properly "translated" everything from cUrl request to python requests, but try following (after installing requests package) and let me know result:
