The following regex working online but not working in python code and shows no matches:https://regex101.com/r/lY1kY8/2s=re.sub(r'\x.+[0-9]',' ',s)required:re.sub(r'\x.+[0-9]* ',' ',r'cats\xe2\x80\x99 faces')Out[23]: 'cats faces'basically wanted to remove the unicode special characters "\xe2\x80\x99"
As another option that doesn't require regex, you could instead remove the unicode characters by removing anything not listed in string.printable
Use raw mode flag.Use findall as match starts matching from beginningwith re.subEDIT:The correct way would be to decode to utf-8 and then apply regex.
Assume you use Python 2.xMeans chars like \xe2 is with 1 length, instead 3. So that you cannot match it with r'\\x.+?[0-9]*' to match it.Help this help a bit.
