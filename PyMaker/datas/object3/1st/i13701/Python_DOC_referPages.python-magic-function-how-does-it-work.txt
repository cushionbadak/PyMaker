How does this magic function work (below) i.e. hex = '%032x' % self.int for some reason it turns the following value... 265631021230191344138857284998518456 into....0033289ed88646a64b9fc63c808fd6b8But all this should actually do from my knowledge is append 032x to the end of the string 265631021230191344138857284998518456, so whats going on? How does it do what it does?  Full code here
%x is a format code for hex. Your function is representing a decimal value in hex.The full format codeMeans represent the value in hex and pad it with zeros on the left until it is 32 characters wide.
