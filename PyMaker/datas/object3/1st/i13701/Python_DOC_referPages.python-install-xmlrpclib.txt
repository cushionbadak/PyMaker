I'm in a virtualenv and trying to run a script I get the following:Ok so that seems that I need xmlrpc, which I'm assuming means I need xmlrpclibSo I try that:Ok, so then I'll try the --allow-external to get it working:Not sure why xmlrpclib isn't seen to be a valid argument?
The answer is that the module xmlrpc is part of python3, not python2.xdetails: https://docs.python.org/3/library/xmlrpc.server.htmlShould already be installed, just go ahead and use it.
I'm not sure if pip provides this lib. Just download xmlrpclib from here http://effbot.org/downloads/#xmlrpclib, unpack it and then run:
If you are using python 2.x then xmlrpclib is part of standard lib. No need of installing it.Anyway you can download xmlrpclib from http://effbot.org
I believe the answer to your question can be found here. Try adding --allow-unverified to your last command.EDIT: I think your import statement is wrong. The module is called xmlrpclib, not xmlrpc
