Why is the following python code throwing an exception?Traceback
Because the functionality was moved to the urllib.request module:A whole lot of things were moved in Python 3 from their former Python 2 locations. The Python 2 documentation usually names the new location; the urllib documentation page is no exception:Note: The urllib module has been split into parts and renamed in Python 3 to urllib.request, urllib.parse, and urllib.error. The 2to3 tool will automatically adapt imports when converting your sources to Python 3. Also note that the urllib.request.urlopen() function in Python 3 is equivalent to urllib2.urlopen() and that urllib.urlopen() has been removed.The Python 3 documentation page for urllib names all new modules under the namespace.
