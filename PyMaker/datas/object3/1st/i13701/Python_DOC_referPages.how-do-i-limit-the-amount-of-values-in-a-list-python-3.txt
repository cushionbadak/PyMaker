I have written a program that asks the user 5 random maths questions and will save their name and score to a csv file. I only want my list to store the latest 3 scores for each student. How can I do that in a list with Python 3?The code I currently have is:An example of the code that I have stored in a csv file is:Josh Hill   8Lisa Hale   7Max Wood    10Sally Jones 5David West  2The program should read this information and append it to a list. I would like to display the latest 3 scores for each student. 
You could use a deque, setting maxlen=3 so you only keep the 3 latest:If you want to actually keep the latest three scores in a file you will need to update the scores by overwriting, if that is the case using a dict with json might be an easier way to store the data, using keys to access the students scores.
So you want to fetch the last 3 scores from the list? Slicing is the answer:This is assuming you are using append as the method for growing the list.
Assuming you had more than 1 score per student in the data file, for example:You could extract the last three scores from each row using slice syntax as follows:Output:
