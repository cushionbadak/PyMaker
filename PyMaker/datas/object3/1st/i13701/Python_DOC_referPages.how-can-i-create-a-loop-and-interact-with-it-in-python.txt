This question is unfortunately a tad more conceptual, but I want to give it a shot anyway.I have an aiohttp app running on a loop, taking input from clients and handling it.I want to have another loop, a game loop, that occasionally takes input from this other loop, and advances. Conceptually it seems like I have these two (this isn't my actual code, the loops are called via asyncio and such. this is just a thinking diagram):I have the latter working, but I'm very new at this, and something just isn't clicking.
This sounds like a typical producer/consumer case. You should share a queue and have the socket loop put into it and the game loop get from it.Python's built in queue has an option to block while waiting for something to be produced. https://docs.python.org/2/library/queue.html#Queue.Queue.get.
This does the trick. Thanks skyler!
