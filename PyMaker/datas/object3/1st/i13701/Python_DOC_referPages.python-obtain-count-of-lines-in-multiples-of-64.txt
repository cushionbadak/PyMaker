Didn't quite understand how to do this enough to Google properly. I'm trying to iterate over a list which contains lines from an input file. I am keeping track of the line number for each line for error logging purposes.I would like to write the results of my loop to an output file. I have placed the newline character to my list.append function call and it works great to determine if there is something wrong with one of the lines in the file. After each iteration it writes to a newline.In blocks of 64 i would like to then write two newline characters to they are distinguishable in the output file. Here is what I have so far. 
In this line:You are looking for this:When the remainder of the line number divided by 64 is zero, it will go into that if block.Oh, and you want # for Python comments, not //.And as Cyphase mentioned, you'll want if line.strip(): instead of just if line:, because linefeeds count as a character.
Unless you are going to process the lines later, you can read and write at the same time, without having to store the lines. Also list is a poor choice for a variable name as its the name of a built-in method list().You also have a try/catch that won't raise any exceptions, try this version of your code:
This script should do the same thing as what you want yours to do, except it's a lot cleaner IMHO:grouper() is a generator that will yield tuples containing groups of n items from iterable, which we use to group by 64 items.main() is pretty well-commented, so I won't explain it here unless someone finds something to be unclear.
