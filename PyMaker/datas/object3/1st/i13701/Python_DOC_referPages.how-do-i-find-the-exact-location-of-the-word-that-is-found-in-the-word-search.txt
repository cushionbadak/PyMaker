My program reads two external files one containing random words another containing the grid of the word search. My code reads the words from one file and then attempts to see if the word can be found in the grid. My code can successfully determine whether or not the word in present in the grid. I however need to print the exact location of where the word is found such as: active found: row 3 col 3 to row 3 col 8I am not sure as to how to get the program to locate the exact occurrence of the word.
You can try using enumerate as suggested in a comment: Using enumerate allows you to loop over a list whilst keeping track of the index at each iteration. This should allow you to find the location of what you are looking for.Sorry, your question is clearer now. I have this which works for simple situations. It creates a walker which walks around the board looking for letter matches, and returns if it finds all the letters.If you dont need diagonals, change the search parametersYou may need to debug/alter for more complex boards. Good luck!
