ProblemGiven a file, for example:Using regular expressions, the program will find variables names that are corresponding to dictionaries or set literals and print them. The output for the above would just be:A line like thisShould only return yes.The variables could be found with \w+? expression I'm just not sure where to start.Current codeThis only functions properly for basic examples and there are some problems. Multiable variables on the same line don't work either. Also it doesn't use Regular Expressions.
You may do like this,orIf you want to define it as a function, you may use the below.
Don't use regular expressions for this.Well, that's probably a bit too strong.  Don't just use regular expressions for this.Start by matching the code against this regex:Then, take the second capturing group, and pass it through ast.literal_eval().To wit:Note that ast.literal_eval() does not handle set and byte literals in 2.x.  This is yet another reason to upgrade to Python 3.
