Natural Text
I have a text file and two lists of strings.The first list is the keyword listThe second list is the words I want to replace the keywords withI want to take the text file as input, where when k appears, it's replaced with r, thus, "hi, how are you bob" would be changed to "ok, how are you bye"
Let's say you have already parsed your sentence:What you want to do is to check whether each word in this sentence is present in k. If yes, replace it by the corresponding element in r; else, use the actual word. In other words:This can be written in a more concise way:Using list comprehensions, here's how you go about processing the whole sentence:new_sentence is now equal to ['ok', 'how', 'are', 'you', 'bye'] (which is what you want).Note that in the code above we perform two equivalent search operations: word in k and k.index(word). This is inefficient. These two operations can be reduced to one by catching exceptions from the index method:Now, you should also note that searching for word in sentence is a search with O(n) complexity (where n is the number of keywords). Thus the complexity of this algorithm is O(n.m) (where is the sentence length). You can reduce this complexity to O(m) by using a more appropriate data structure, as suggested by the other comments. This is left as an exercise :-p
I'll assume you've got the "reading string from file" part covered, so about that "replacing multiple strings" part: First, as suggested by Martijn, you can create a dictionary, mapping keys to replacements, using dict and zip.Now, one way to replace all those keys at once would be to use a regular expression, being a disjunction of all those keys, i.e. "hi|bob" in your example, and using re.sub with a replacement function, looking up the respective key in that dictionary.Alternatively, you can just use a loop to replace each key-replacement pair one after the other:
