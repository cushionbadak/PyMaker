Natural Text
The origin code is(simplify for example):now I only called func_a, or maybe func_b, it depends on configuration.so I want to dynamic do from ... import ..., such as:but I don't know to how to implement it?What I have thought is do import in func_X():but this way will do import every time when call function.Supplement:I have tried __import__ / importlib, but can't implement this condition
__import__ is a builtin function which takes the module name as a string and returns the module as an object. See the documentation:The function imports the module name, potentially using the given globals and locals to determine how to interpret the name in a package context. The fromlist gives the names of objects or submodules that should be imported from the module given by name.
before I ask the question, I have tried __import__ and importlib, but can't write out the code.thanks for @machine-yearning, I read the entire doc of __import__.this is my solution:
