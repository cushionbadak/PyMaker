Natural Text
I have the following text file and I want to retrieve the numbers in bracketsSo I've tried this But it only displays the first result : (12930).I was wondering if it was possible to have a list of all the matching results.Thanks
You can use re.findall for example
All you have to do is replace that search with findall. This will produce a list of all the matches.
