I have a bunch of files names like so:And I want to change the julian date contained in [9:16] of each filename to gregorian date, and then reinsert the new date back into the filename.  I have converted for julian to gregorian using this code:This will give me the julian date for each file, so for a file like this LT50300281984137PAC00_sr_band3.tif, this would be returned 1984-05-17 00:00:00, but I don't want the 00:00:00 and I want to insert the gregorian date back into the filename, preferable as 19840517.Edit:Using suggestions from all of the answers so far I am able to do everything but execute the rename (last line of code in this example) using this:this returns error: WindowsError: [Error 2] The system cannot find the file specified and I think it may have something to do with my os pathway.  All other variables till this point populate as expected.Edit:  This code works for me
You could use regex for that:
Once you have year and day the method strftime give your result. For 1984 and 137 you get:So you can now do:
To convert a string into a date object, use datetime.strptime():Note: the input is interpreted differently: 1984137 is 1984-05-16 here (137 is interpreted as a day of the year where January 1st is day 1) while datetime(year, 1, 1) + timedelta(day) formula in your question implies that the day is zero-based instead (February 29 is counted in both cases).To convert date object into a string, use .strftime() method:To replace fixed positions in a filename:To rename a file if the destination might be on a different filesystem, use shutil.move():If the destination file might exists already; call os.remove(dest_path).
