Natural Text
I am writing this code to read a text file and then print the line number after each line here is my codeI should expect some thing like that Line one1Line two 2Line three 3 but instead I am gettingLine one 1 Line two 1 Line three 1 Why is that !?
You can just use enumerate() :Also note that you don't need to close the file when you use the with statement. It will automatically does it for you.And about the x variable in your code, you shouldn't initialized it in your loop, you need to put x=1 out of the loop.
Adding comments to your code will help you see why you always print out  1.
The problem is that you are initializing x to 1 inside the loop and before the print statement.try:
The issue with the code would be the x=1 inside of the loop. By moving that outside and initializing that before you should get the result you want. For example: This should work
