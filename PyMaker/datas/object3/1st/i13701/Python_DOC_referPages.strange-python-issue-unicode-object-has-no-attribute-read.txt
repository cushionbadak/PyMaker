Natural Text
Here is my code and does anyone have any ideas what is wrong? I open my JSON content directly by browser and it works,thanks in advance,Lin
This error raised because the data is a unicode/str variable, change the second line of your code to resolve your error:json.load get a file object in first parameter position and call the read method of this.Also you can call the json method of the response to fetch data directly:
requests.get(…).text returns the content as a single (unicode) string. The json.load() function however requires a file-like argument.The solution is rather simple: Just use loads instead of load:An even better solution though is to simply call json() on the response object directly. So don’t use .text but .json():While this uses json.loads itself internally, it hides that implementation detail, so you can just focus on getting the JSON response.
