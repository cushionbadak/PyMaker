With C# and NUnit, there exists the TestCase attribute and the TestCaseSource attribute, both of which allows unit tests to be parameterized, so that the same "test" can be used multiple times with different input. This reduces code duplication while maintaining readability.Does something similar exist for Python?EDIT:@Dunes mentioned subtests, which I should have included as part of this question. Unfortunately, it is a 3.4 only functionality, and I'm looking to support 2.7 and 3.4.
The answer is subTest. However, this is only available as of Python 3.4.There is unittest2, though. It provides a backport of the latest features of unittest in Python 3.4 (including subTest). unittest2 is tested to run on Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 and pypy.
Several libraries will allow you to do this. For example, the py.test example is as follows:This is from the py.test documentation.
