This is the function call below and I'm trying to construct the function fee, I need to map the tuple using functional prog. so that it turns into (6-7)**2 + (7-1)**2 + (1-4)**2, and the last one is (4-6)**2. Then I will sum these and return this value in fee.
You can play with python built-in functions :Demo :You can use map function to apply the lambda function on pairs and sum the result :Instead of map as a more efficient way you can use zip and a generator expression within sum :
You can do this with a combination of zip, map, and sum:Explanation:zip(vals, vals[:-1] + [vals[0]]) combines vals into a list of 2-tuple pairs.map(lambda t: (t[0] - t[1]) ** 2, x1) performs the mathematical operation on each 2-tuple element.sum(x2) sums the results of #2 together.
This should do it:
