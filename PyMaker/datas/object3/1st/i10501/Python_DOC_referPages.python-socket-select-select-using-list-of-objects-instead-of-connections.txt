Typically using select.select() will require a list of connection objects to work like this:read, write, error = select(self.all_connections, [], [], 0.1)Say I have the below object:I will create a list of remoteDevices before using select after accepting the connections and append them to a list:Now all_devices will be  alist of multiple devices, and their connection object is given to each remote device.Is there a way I can pass in all_devices into the select statement to iterate through the connection property of each remoteDevice object? Will I have to store the connection objects seperately just to use select.select()?
According to the select.select() documentation you can supply a sequence of objects that have a fileno() method. You can easily add that method to your class:The fileno() method simply returns the file descriptor of the connection's socket object. Since you instantiate RemoteDevice with the return value of socket.accept(), this a tuple in which the first item is a socket object.
