I need to return True if the array contains a 2 next to a 2 somewhere. But it gives me an error that says:"list index out of range". What should i change?I'm pretty new to the stuff, so probably my code is one of the longest ways to solve it, but i appreciate any help. Thank you!
I think the error you report can only happen if nums is an empty list. In that situation, nums[len(nums) - 1] is not a valid index (as there are no valid indexes into an empty list).For this problem, there's really not much point to special casing the last two items in the list. You can make your code much simpler by handling all the cases with one loop:As the comment says, the loop body where I use list indexes won't run if the length of the list is less than 2. That's because the range will be empty, and iterating on an empty sequence does nothing.A slightly fancier approach would be to use zip on two iterators of num that are offset by one place. This is more advanced Python stuff, so if you don't understand it yet, don't worry too much about it:This approach to iterating over pairs using zip is inspired by the itertools documentation, where it's given in the pairwise recipe:
