I was trying out a problem on hackerrank contest for fun, and there came this question.I used itertools for this, here is the code:Is their any other efficient way than this? As I am getting time out error on some test cases which I cant access (as its a small contest).
Here is an implementation following @User_Targaryen's logic. heapq returns the 2 largest and 2 smallest numbers in the list, mul operator returns the products of these 2 pairs of numbers, and max returns the largest of these 2 products.
Iterate over the list and find the following:Largest Positive number(a)Second Largest Positive number(b)Largest Negative number(c)Second Largest Negative number(d)Now, you will be able to figure out the maximum value upon multiplication, either a*b or c*d
Just sort the list and select the largest of the products of the last 2 items in the list and the first 2 items in the list:This is a O(n log n) solution due to the sort. Someone else suggested a heapq solution which I found to be faster for lists longer than a few thousand random integers.
