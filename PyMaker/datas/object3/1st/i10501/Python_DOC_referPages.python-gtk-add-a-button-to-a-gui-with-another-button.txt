I'm trying to add another button to my GUI by pressing a button on the GUI itself. Essentially I'm just trying to update it but I'm relatively new to OOP so I'm having issues with scope. This is what I have so far...When I run this, my GUI pops open. And when I hit my update button I get the following error: How do I get my update function to recognize the GUI/grid I've already created in the def init function? Is there a better way to do what I want? 
Define an instance variable in your MyWindow class to keep track of that button. For example, in your code, whenever you see a draw_button change it to self.draw_button. It will let you track this button in other methods. This would look like:But there are a few other problems in your code:I presume that you are using Gtk 3.0. If that's the case, you should require it before importing Gtk like this:In Deck.__init__() you have used range(1,2) in a for-loop. The problem is that range(1, 2) is equivalent to [1] because you have asked for a range beginning at 1 but stopping just before 2. I'm not sure that was what you wanted.You should add a self.show_all() at the end of your MyWindow.update() method otherwise you won't be able to see the freshly created button.You should use self.close() instead of Gtk.main_quit() in your MyWindow.on_stop_button_clicked() and MyWindow.on_card1_button_clicked() methods otherwise your code won't be able to properly destroy your window when clicking those buttons.This is how this would look with these recommendations:
