This question already has an answer here:== comparisons against lines from readlines() fail                    3 answers                my code has an issue. I'm relatively new to reading from files, and as such, I don't know what is wrong with my code.When I execute run(), everything works fine until I enter my answer. I am prompted for an answer, and when I enter it, even if my answer is exactly the same as the answer in string_lines_split1, the program prints that my answer is wrong. Link to text document:  http://web.mit.edu/jesstess/www/IntermediatePythonWorkshop/state_capitals.txtThank you for reading about my issue, and guiding me toward a solution. I look forward to working with the stackoverflow community.
First your code has error: print(string_lines_final[1]) should be print(string_lines_split[1]).Your problem is that there is a trailing '\n' in string_lines_split[1] which causes the comparison failed.Try changing string_lines = lines[ran_lines] to string_lines = lines[ran_lines].rstrip().
"even if my answer is exactly the same as the answer in string_lines_split1, the program prints that my answer is wrong"Then they are not exactly the same. You have to accept that, because because Python can't ever bend or flex. If they're not the same but they look the same, try other things until you work out why.Hint: how come the file is arranged like this:instead of this:?Hint: Compare the len() of your input vs. the correct answer. Hint: Compare them character by character. Maybe printing character codes.
So when you read the file, the list returned by read_file.readlines() looks like this:So your code should be like this:
