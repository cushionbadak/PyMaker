This question already has an answer here:Python giving FileNotFoundError for file name returned by os.listdir                    2 answers                I recently moved my config files to another folder in my Project. I try to load the like this:I'm running the code fromAnd the specified CONFIGPATH is correctly set toNow in that iteration loop, the open(config) raises an exception:I can't see why my program can't open a file, which clearly has to exist since it is given out by os.listdir. Actually, a print(config) in the loop confirms that there is a file with that name. So why won't it open and instead raises a FileNotFoundError?Do I miss the obvious here? The code worked before I moved the files upwards. I'm working with Pycharm on Windows 7, if that is of any relevance.
os.listdir only return the name of the file, not the complete path.If you're on 3.5 you can use os.scandir where the returned item has a path attribute. If you're not that lucky, you'll have to construct the full path yourself.It would be: json.load(open(os.path.join(CONFIG_PATH, config))) in your case.
