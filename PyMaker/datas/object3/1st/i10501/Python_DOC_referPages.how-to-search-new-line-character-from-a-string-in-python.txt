I want to split string based on new line character and replace the new line with a '.' in python. I tried this code but I'm not getting it.
The newline character is \n. So If you want to replace all new line characters in string with . you should use replace() method. In this case:A second approach is to .split('\n') by newline and then '.'.join(your_string). You should checkout the Python documentation.
