How do I create a list with the selected attributes of an object in python ? Using list comprehensions.E.g: My object A hasand many more attributesHow do I create a list [name,age]I can do it manually but it looks ugly:but I am looking for a shortcut.
Why not just [A.name, A.age]? list literals are simple. You could use operator.attrgetter if you need to do it a lot, though it returns tuples when fetching multiple attributes, not lists, so you'd have to convert if you can't live with that.
What you're looking for is operator.attrgetter
You can collect them going through all A class attributes and checking if they aren't method or built-in.
