How can I define characters(in a LIST or a STRING), and have any other characters replaced with.. lets say a '?'Example:
Put the legal characters in a set then use in to test each character of the string.  Construct the new string using the str.join() method and a conditional expression.
If this is a large file, read in chunks, and apply re.sub(..) as below. ^ within a class (square brackets) stands for negation (similar to saying "anything other than")
