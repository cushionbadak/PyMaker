This question already has an answer here:What does ** (double star/asterisk) and * (star/asterisk) do for parameters?                    18 answers                I am following this tutorial: http://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/04/20/sorting-contours-using-python-and-opencv/#comment-405768 and in one of the lines there is the function:I want to know what is the use of the asterisk before the sorted function call. 
Asterisk is unpacking operator:More about unpacking operator:https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#unpacking-argument-lists
If the syntax *expression appears in the function call, expression must evaluate to an iterable. Elements from this iterable are treated as if they were additional positional arguments; if there are positional arguments x1, ..., xN, and expression evaluates to a sequence y1, ..., yM, this is equivalent to a call with M+N positional arguments x1, ..., xN, y1, ..., yM.
