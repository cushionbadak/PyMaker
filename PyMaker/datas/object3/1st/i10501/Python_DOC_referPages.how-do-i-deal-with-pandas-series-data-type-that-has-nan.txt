What happens when using max() and min() on pandas.core.series.Series type that has NaN in it? Is this a bug? See below,
First, you shouldn't use the Python built-in max or min when dealing with pandas or numpy, especially when you are working with nan.Since 'nan' is the first item of mydata['Has NaN'], it is never replaced in either max or min because (as stated in the docs):The not-a-number values float('NaN') and Decimal('NaN') are special.  They are identical to themselves (x is x is true) but are not equal to  themselves (x == x is false). Additionally, comparing any number to a  not-a-number value will return False. For example, both 3 <  float('NaN') and float('NaN') < 3 will return False.Instead, use the pandas max and min methods:With regards to the histogram, it seems this is a known issue with plt.hist, see here and here.It should be fairly straightforward to deal with for now, though:
you should use Pandas or NumPy functions instead of vanilla Python ones:
