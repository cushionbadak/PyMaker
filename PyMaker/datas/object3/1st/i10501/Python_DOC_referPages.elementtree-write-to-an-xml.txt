What's the easiest way to write an edited XML root to a new file? This is what I have so far and it's throwing AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'write' PS: I can't use any other api besides ElementTree.
Your tree is a ElementTree object which provides a write() method to write the tree. For example:
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'write' is saying that you cannot call the write method directly from ElementTree class, it is not a static method, try using tree.write('file-after-edits.xml'), tree is your object from ElementTree.
