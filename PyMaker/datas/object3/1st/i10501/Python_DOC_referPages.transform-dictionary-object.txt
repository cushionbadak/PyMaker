This line makes sure that the key category is in the dictionary, before using it. Then you get the value from the dictionary corresponding to category and iterate it. You can simplify this with dict.get method, which would return a default value, if the key is not there in the dictionary. So you can do something like thisIf the category doesn't exist in the dictionary, then an empty list is returned and the loop will have nothing to iterate.Similarly, you are checking if the key exists in the categories dictionary, if not, setting a default value (which is a list). You can avoid that if...else also, with dict.setdefault, like thisdict.setdefault is similar to dict.get, except that it sets the default value against the key and returns the value corresponding to the key.
You can solve it with a defaultdict(list), iterating over the categories and appending keys:
