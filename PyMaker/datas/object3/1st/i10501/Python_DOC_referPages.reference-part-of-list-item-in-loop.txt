Natural Text
I am trying to turn a txt file into a new txt file with specific formatting so i can put it straight onto a website.I have created a list called stats of the items to go under the Statistics heading but am now trying to write the loop to tell it to format the text in a specific way and I'm getting invalid syntax errors.Here is what I have so far..but it says the i.split is invalid syntax. Any suggestions?Thanks!
Try to use the + operator when concatenating strings: '<h5><a href=/"' + i.split("\t")[4] + '" target=...'
