Using Python 2.7. Let us say we have list_of_nums = [1,2,2,3,4,5]and we want to remove all occurrences of 2. We can achieve it bylist_of_nums[:] = filter(lambda x: x! = 2, list_of_nums) or  list_of_nums = filter(lambda x: x! = 2, list_of_nums).Is this an "in-place" substitution? Also, are we creating a copy of list when we use filter?
andare two different operations that end up with mostly the same result.In both cases,returns either a new list containing items that match the filter (in Python 2), or an iterable over list_of_nums that returns the same items (in Python 3).The first case,then deletes all items from list_of_nums and replaces them with the items from the new list or iterable.The second case,assigns the new list to the variable list_of_nums.The time when this makes a difference is this:With this code, list1 ends up with the new contents [1,3,4,5], whereas list2 ends up with the original contents [1,2,2,3,4,5].
