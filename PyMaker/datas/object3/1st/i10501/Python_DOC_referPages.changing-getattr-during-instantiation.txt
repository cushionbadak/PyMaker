I am wanting to change __getattr__ during instantiation of the class.  For example:I would have expected this to behave like:But it does not.For example, when I run:I would expect both classes to print Getting test, but the top class throws an AttributeError.Can __getattr__ not be changed in this way?
For special methods like __getattr__, Python searches in the base(s) __dict__, not in the instance __dict__.You can read more details about this in the special lookup section of the data model documentation.I have two implementations of __getattr__ that each use a different  type of serialization (json, pickle), and I wanted my class to be able  to select one based on a kwarg.This is not a good use-case for overriding __getattr__.  Abandon this idea, and instead consider to use @property or descriptors to handle your serialisation dynamically.
