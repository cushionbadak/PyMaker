I need a hash function to take a sequence of decimal numbers and return a decimal number as hash value.for example:My questions are:does python has a built-in lib to do this more efficiently?  how could I make the output hash value in a relative small range?Question 2 explanation:because 1, 3, 4 has six different combinations as following:the corresponding output is [14, 15, 18, 21, 21, 23], and I expect the hash values of the six output would be something like [1,2,3,4,6](a small range)any suggestions would be appreciated. thanks in advance :-)
If you just want to hash a number sequence you can dowhich returns the hash (for the current run of the program) of the args-tuple (hash is fast and well tested for builtin-types) - but this is still most often a large number.For getting a smaller value you can take the modulo likeActually you could also usewhich doesnt change between runs of the program but sum does not distribute the results evenly at all.Warning: These are not cryptographical hashes
