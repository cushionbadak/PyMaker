With multiprocessing.Pool, there are code samples in the tutorials  where you can set number of processes with cpu counts. Can you set the number of cpu's with the multiprocessing.Process method. 
Actually Process represents only one process which uses only one CPU (if you dont use threads) - it is up to you to create as many Processes as you need. This means that you have to create as many Processes as you have CPUs to use all of them (possibly -1 if you are doing things in the main process)You can read the number of CPUs with multiprocessing.cpu_count
