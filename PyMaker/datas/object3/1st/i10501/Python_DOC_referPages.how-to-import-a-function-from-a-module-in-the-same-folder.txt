I am trying to separate my script into several files with functions, so I moved some functions into separate files and want to import them into one main file. The structure is:posts_run.py has two functions, get_all_posts and retrieve_posts, so I try import get_all_posts with:Python 3.5 gives the error:Main.py contains following rows of code:Then i need to import api to functions, so I have ability to get API calls to vk.Full stack traceapi - is a api = vk.API(session) in main.py.absolute_url and fullname are also stored in main.py.I am using PyCharm 2016.1 on Windows 7, Python 3.5 x64 in virtualenv.How can I import this function?
You need to add __init__.py in your core folder. You getting this error because python does not recognise your folder as python packageAfter that do
MyFile.py:start python interpreter:Alternatively: Does this not work on your machine?
A cheat solution can be found from this question (question is Why use sys.path.append(path) instead of sys.path.insert(1, path)? ). Essentially you do the followingThis will get round that as you are running it in PyCharm 2016.1, it might be in a different current directory to what you are expecting...
Python doesn't find the module to import because it is executed from another directory.Open a terminal and cd into the script's folder, then execute python from there.Run this code in your script to print from where python is being executed from:EDIT:This is a demonstration of what I meanPut the code above in a test.py file located at C:\folder\test.pyopen a terminal and typeThis will output the base directory of python executablenow typeThis will output C:\folder\. So if you have other modules in folder importing them should not be a problemI usually write a bash/batch script to cd into the directory and start my programs. This allows to have zero-impact on host machines
