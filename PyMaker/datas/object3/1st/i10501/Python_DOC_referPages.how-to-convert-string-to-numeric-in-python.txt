I would like to convert string (%) to float.but my method didnt work well.the result slightly differ from correct number.for example,first, I strip "%"I tried to convert to numeric, but the result is strange.I guess this phenomena come from binary digit system...and of course I couldnt convert % to numeric.I also tried .astype(float) method. but The result was same..why this phenomena happen ? and how can I avoid this phenomena
Many rational numbers can't be represented exactly as a floating-point number. In particular, any number that has to have a five as a factor in the denominator, like 1/(2*5), can't be represented exactly. There isn't much you can do about this: either round the displayed number so it looks right, or use an infinite-precision library or a rational-numbers library. Here's a basic way to round the displayed number:>>> print "%.20f" % 0.10.10000000000000000555>>> print "%.4f" % 0.10.1000 
As a folow-up to the suggestion by @D-Von, the following python packages can be useful to you: decimal and fractionsThen you can do some things like:And all the time you are not working with floats but with rational numbers. See the documentation for more examples.
