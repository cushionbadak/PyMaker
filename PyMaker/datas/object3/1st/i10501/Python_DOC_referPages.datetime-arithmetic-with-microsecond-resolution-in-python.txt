I want to calculate the difference (in terms of days, hour, min, sec, microsecond) between two time stamps (having microsecond resolution) in python e.g. between (1)2016-05-10 11:32:18.025635 and (2) 2016-05-13 18:59:52.094672Any pointers, how to do it?
You can use the python-dateutil package:This will give you a datetime.timedelta object which represents the time difference between the two datetime objects.If you don't want to install a package then it can also be done using datetime.strptime but in that case you have to define what the string looks like.
