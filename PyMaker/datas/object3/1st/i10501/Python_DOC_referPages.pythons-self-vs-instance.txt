What is the difference between the self and instance keywords in Python 3?I see code like,
Neither self nor instance are keywords in Python. The identifier self is used by convention as the first parameter of instance methods in a class. The object instance on which a method is called is automatically passed in as the first parameter.In the above snippet, update is most probably a method of some class and self seems to be the conventional first parameter as described above. The second parameter instance is just another parameter and the name instance does not have any significance in Python.
The snippet is a bit short but instance is not a keyword (neither self, that is just convention).It is an argument to another instance of another (maybe same) class.
The question is rather generic, but let me see if I can shed some light on it for you:self refers to the class(by convention, not a keyword) of which update is a part. The class has variables and methods and you can refer to these with the self keyword(not a reserved keyword) by calling self.update(instance, validated_data)In the case of the snippet above, self refers to the class. instance likely refers to some model instance "the big hint is the instance.save() and validated_data is a dictionary or class object with attributes you are gettting and assigning to instance attributes before saving themHope this helps
