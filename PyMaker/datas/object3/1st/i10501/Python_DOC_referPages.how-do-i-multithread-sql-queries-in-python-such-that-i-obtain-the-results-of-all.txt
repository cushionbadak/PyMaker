Is there a way to use threads to simultaneously perform the SQL queries so I can cut down on processing time of my code below? Is there a better method to perform the same result as below without using the pandas module? Given the size of the data sets I am working with I cannot store the entire dataset in memory and I have found looping over the rows of a SELECT * FROM statement and comparing them against the list I am querying with adds to the processing time.
Some advices:Instead of reading the records by chucks using a iterator, you ought to use pagination. See this questions:Efficient paging in SQLite with millions of recordsSqlite LIMIT / OFFSET queryIf you're using multithreading / multiprocessing make sure your database can support it.See: SQLite And Multiple ThreadsTo implement what you want you can use a pool of workers which work on each chunk. See Using a pool of workers in the Python documentation. Example:
