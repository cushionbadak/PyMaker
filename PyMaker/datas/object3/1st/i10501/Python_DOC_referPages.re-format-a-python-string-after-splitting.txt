I have string like "week32_Aug_24_2016".I want to change this string like "week32_2016_Aug_24"I have tried this. My expected output is "week32 2016 Aug 24".I already got that but I want to know is there any better way to do this. Suppose I have long string and no of split value is 10, then this is very long way. So I want to know a better way to arrange the split values. Thanks....
