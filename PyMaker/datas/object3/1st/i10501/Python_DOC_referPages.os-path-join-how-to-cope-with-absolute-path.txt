Python 3.5.2I want to join them:The result is '/static/'.  This is the documentation:https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.htmlWe can read that "If a component is an absolute path, all previous components are thrown away and joining continues from the absolute path component."In my case BASE_DIR in the debugger is '/home/michael/PycharmProjects/photoarchive/photoarchive'.Well, this is an absolute path. Well, it eve was acquired via abspath function.So, there first component - BASE_DIR - is an absolute path. Could you tell me why it is thrown away? And how to get '/home/michael/PycharmProjects/photoarchive/photoarchive/static'?
"If a component is an absolute path, all previous components are thrown away and joining continues from the absolute path component." applies here: STATIC_URL is an absolute path because it starts with /, so BASE_DIR is dropped.Drop the leading / else dirname thinks that STATIC_URL is absolute and keeps only that.
