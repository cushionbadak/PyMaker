I have following config file:I need to convert it to the YAML file. I've done it successfully, except part for sysHandler:How to provide arguments for sysHandler in yaml format? Why it was ok to simply put args in original config file and here I have to specify stream / filename?
The logging dictionary schema details have the following to say about handlers:The SysLogHandler has the following signature:The key stream, which is not a mandatory or optional key for a handler, is passed as keyword argument to SysLogHandler() and that is not a keyword you can use to instantiate an instance of that class.The non-mandatory/optional keys for the StreamHandler (i.e. stream) and FileHandler (i.e. filename) match the respective signatures).I assume you really have to supply to suppy the address with the tuple argument as sequence, to get this accepted:(Please note that the args entry for [handler_sysHandler] in your INI style config file should start with a tuple.
