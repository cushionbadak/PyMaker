Natural Text
I have many lists exactly like the ones below, provided by a weather station.However, how can I "merge" the two daily observations into a single one? (the records available on the first set of daily observations are never present on the second set).
You can use the pairwise iteration to group the pairs, then zip() the groups item by item and use or to choose one of the non-empty values:where data is your input list of lists.Produces:You may additionally think of merging 0000 and 1200 in a better way cause now 0000 would be chosen.
You can also use pandas and its groupby() + apply():Prints:Here, Series.max() works for us to merge the grouped items - maximum of an empty string and a non-empty string would always be a non-empty string. I though feel there should be a better (more appropriate, so to say) merging function.
Maybe something like that:Update
