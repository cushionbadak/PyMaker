I am trying to create a dictionary from the values in the name_num dictionary where the length of the list is the new key and the name_num dictionary key and value are the value. So:I want to create the following dictionary:I've tried many variations, but this code gets me the closest:Output:I know I need to loop through the code somehow so I can add the other values to key 3.
Dictionary, associative array or map (many names, basically the same functionality) property is that keys are unique.The keys you wish to have, which are integers, are not unique if lengths are the same, that's why your code doesn't work. Putting a new value for existing key means replacing the old value.You have to add key-value pairs to the existing value dictionaries.should do the trick
This is a good use case for defaultdict:Output:
Just an alternative to others; you can sort by length and use itertools.groupby:In a worst case scenario where each inner list has a different length, this performs O(n^2) which is fairly inefficient compared to other solutions posted above.
