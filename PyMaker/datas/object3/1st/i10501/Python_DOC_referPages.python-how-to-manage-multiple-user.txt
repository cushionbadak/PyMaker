I have a list of users IDs and each user ID has a lot of friends IDs. I want to write a program to send message to user's friend.  So how to manage these information ? I think I should using 1 single file and write this Json format into file:If i use this way, after that, the file will have few dozen million rows.So, What is best way to manage these users ? What type of database I should use ?  Thank you !
I hope my answer is not too biased...Depending on what else you want to accomplish, there are several options:In standard library you have sqlite3 which is a relational database engine (which can handle large amounts of rows quite well)There are other relational database engines like mysql for which python libraries exist (most have better performance for huge datasets that sqlite)There is ZODB (tutorial on zodb.org) which is an object-database engine (you can actually use it as an ORM, too)There are object-relational mappers (ORM) like sqlalchemy or the one included in django that can help you build databases.You should have a look at the Python Wiki which providess deeper info about that
