i need to get the latest file of a folder using python. While using the code:I am getting the below error:  FileNotFoundError: [WinError 2] The system cannot find the file specified: 'a'
Whatever is assigned to the files variable is incorrect. Use the following code.
is quite incomplete code. What is files? It probably is a list of file names, coming out of os.listdir().But this list lists only the filename parts (a. k. a. "basenames"), because their path is common. In order to use it correctly, you have to combine it with the path leading to it (and used to obtain it).Such as (untested):
Try to sort items by creation time. Example below sorts files in a folder and gets first element which is latest.
I would suggest using glob.iglob() instead of the glob.glob(), as it is more efficient.glob.iglob() Return an iterator which yields the same values as glob() without actually storing them all simultaneously.Which means glob.iglob() will be more efficient.I mostly use below code to find the latest file matching to my pattern:LatestFile = max(glob.iglob(fileNamePattern),key=os.path.getctime)NOTE:There are variants of max function, In case of finding the latest file we will be using below variant:max(iterable, *[, key, default])which needs iterable so your first parameter should be iterable.In case of finding max of nums we can use beow variant : max (num1, num2, num3, *args[, key])
(Edited to improve answer)First define a function get_latest_fileYou may also use a docstring !If you use Python 3, you can use iglob instead.Complete code to return the name of latest file:
I have tried to use the above suggestions and my program crashed, than I figured out the file I'm trying to identify was used and when trying to use 'os.path.getctime' it crashed.what finally worked for me was:this codes gets the uncommon object between the two sets of file listsits not the most elegant, and if multiple files are created at the same time it would probably won't be stable
A much faster method on windows (0.05s), call a bat script that does this:get_latest.batwhere \\directory\in\question is the directory you want to investigate.get_latest.pyif it finds a file stdout is the path and stderr is None.Use stdout.decode("utf-8").rstrip() to get the usable string representation of the file name.
