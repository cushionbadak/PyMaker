Is there a way to make a function that makes other functions to be called later named after the variables passed in? For the example let's pretend https://example.com/engine_list returns this xml file, when I call it in get_search_engine_xmlAnd here's my code:I get the following error.Defining engine_name and engine_address seems to be working when I log it out. So I'm pretty sure the problem lies in create_get_engine_function, which admittedly I don't know what I'm doing and I was trying to piece together from similar questions. Can you name a function created by another function with an argument that's passed in? Is there a better way to do this?
You can assign them to globals()Although, depending on what you're actually trying to accomplish, a better design would be to store all the engine names/addresses in a dictionary and access them as needed:
