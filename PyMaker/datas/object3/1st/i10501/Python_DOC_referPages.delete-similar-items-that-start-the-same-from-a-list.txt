For example, I have this list:How can I remove with a command all the items that start with "0."?
You can filter the desired items in a list using a list comprehension using str.startswith() to check if a string starts with "0.":Note that list is not a good variable name - it shadows the built-in list.You can also approach the problem with filter() and a filtering function:Note that in Python 3.x, unlike Python 2.x, filter() returns an iterator, hence, calling list() to demonstrate the result.And, a "just for fun" option and to demonstrate how can you overcomplicate the problem with different functional programming-style tools:itertools.filterfalse() and operator.methodcaller() were used.
With filter():
