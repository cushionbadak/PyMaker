I'm constructing a class Heating. Every instance of this class has the property 'temperature'. It's mandatory that Heating also supports the method temperature() that prints the property 'temperature' as an integer.When I call the method temperature() I get the error 'int' object is not callable because self.temperature is already defined as an integer.How do I solve this?code:
You can't have both a method and an attribute with the same name. Methods are attributes too, albeit ones that you can call.Just rename the attribute to something else. You could use _temperature:Now your class has both _temperature (the integer) and temperature() (the method); the latter returns the former.
