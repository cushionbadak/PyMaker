Natural Text
Running the following code works flawlessly, once it is ran I would press the button labeled "Draw Text" and the following error is displayed:There is a task which requires me to draw some text on a tkinter screen using turtle. I have added in code which tells the turtle to draw this if the button in the menu is pressed, but this error than shows up. I am rather new to python and don't understand how to go about fixing such a problem.
The problem is that the RawTurtle object, from the turtle module, has no attribute move. You can use the commands forward, backward, left, and right to move your turtle. Before using the above commands, I suggest looking at the documentation for the turtle module, as you seem to be confused about how to properly use it.Here is a quick explanation for the basic turtle move methods:turtle.forward(int\float): This method moves a turtle object forward(in pixels). Use a integer or a float to specify how far to move the turtle.turtle.backward(int\float): This method moves a turtle object backwards(in pixels). Use a integer or a float to specify how far to move the turtle.turtle.left(int\float): This method turns a turtle object left(in degrees). Use a integer or a float to specify how far to turn the turtle.turtle.right(int\float): This method turns a turtle object right(in degrees). Use a integer or a float to specify how far to turn the turtle.
This is fairly straightforward. You initialize theTurtle in the caller to be a turtle.RawTurtle. RawTurtle doesn't have an attribute or method named move, it has special purpose methods for moving forward or backwards, and other methods to turn relatively (right and left) or to an absolute orientation (setheading).If your goal is to, say, move the turtle forward by move "distance" or something from its current heading, you'd call forward/fd.
