I'm new to python and xml-rpc , and I'm stuck with decoding binary data coming from a public service :the service request response with this code is :response :I need to decode these two binary objects , and I'm stuck with this code :that ends in :Traceback (most recent call last):   File "stat.py", line 18, in        dat = xmlrpc.client.Binary(res)   File "C:\Users\Leonardo\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python35\lib\xmlrpc\client.py",  line 389, in init      data.class.name) TypeError: expected bytes or bytearray, not dictThe only doc I found for xmlrpc.client is the one at docs.python.org , but I can't figure out how I could decode these binaries
If the content of res variable (what you get from the 2nd (s2) server) is the response you pasted into the question, then you should modify the last 3 lines of your 2nd snippet to (as you already have 2 Binary objects in the res dictionary):Notes:According to [Python]: Binary Objects:Binary objects have the following methods, supported mainly for internal use by the marshalling/unmarshalling code:I wasn't able to connect (and this test the solution), since DEV_KEY is (obviously) fake
