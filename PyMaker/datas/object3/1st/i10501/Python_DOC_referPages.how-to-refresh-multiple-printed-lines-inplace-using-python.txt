Natural Text
I would like to understand how to reprint multiple lines in Python 3.5.This is an example of a script where I would like to refresh the printed statement in place.What I am trying to do is have:Write on top of / update / refresh:The values of each line will change each time. This is effectively giving me a status update of each Line.I saw another question from 5 years ago however with the addition of the end argument in Python 3+ print function, I am hoping that there is a much simpler solution.
If you want to clear the screen each time you call print(), so that it appears the print is overwritten each time, you can use clear in unix or cls in windows, for example:
If I've understood correctly you're looking for this type of solution:This solution won't work with some software like IDLE, Sublime Text, Eclipse... The problem with running it within this type of software is that clear/cls uses ANSI escape sequences to clear the screen. These commands write a string such as "\033[[80;j" to the output buffer. The native command prompt is able to interpret this as a command to clear the screen but these pseudo-terminals don't know how to interpret it, so they just end up printing small square as if printing an unknown character.If you're using this type of software, one hack around could be doing print('\n' * 100), it won't be the optimal solution but it's better than nothing.
You could use curses for this.
