I know in python the builtin object() returns a sentinel object. I'm curious to what it is, but mainly its applications.
object is the base class that all other classes inherit from in python 3. There's not a whole lot you can do with a plain old object. However an object's  identity could be useful. For example the iter function takes a sentinel argument that signals when to stop termination. We could supply an object() to that.This will ask for input until the user types stop, exit, or done. I'm not exactly sure when iter with a sentinel is more useful than a generator, but I guess it's interesting anyway.I'm not sure if this answers your question. To be clear, this is just a possible application of object. Fundamentally its existence in the python language has nothing to do with it being usable as a sentinel value (to my knowledge).
This is a source code example from the Python standard library for dataclasses on using sentinel values
