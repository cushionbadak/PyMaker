when I use gevent, I can not use requests, is my useage wrong?it raise the error:The version of my Python is 3.3If I add ssl=False to monkey.patch_all(), it returns:
This is really a bug in gevent. It is trying to import a socket constant from the ssl library.That specific constant happens to be imported into the ssl library because that library makes use of it. But it is only there because a fix for issue 19422 required it to be imported in to the ssl module. The fix for that bug was included in Python 3.3.4, and you have version 3.3.3 and you thus don't have that specific constant available in the ssl module as well.You could just fix it by adding from socket import SOL_SOCKET, SO_TYPE in gevent/_ssl3.py (located in the /usr/local/lib/python3.3/site-packages directory on your system). Or you can upgrade to Python 3.3.4 or newer. I've filed this as issue #856 with the gevent project.
Install the Python 3.5 version can fix this problem.
