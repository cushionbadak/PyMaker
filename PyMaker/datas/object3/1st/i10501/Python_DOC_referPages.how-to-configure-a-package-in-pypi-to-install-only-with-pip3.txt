I distributed my package written in Python 3 on PyPI. It can be installed by both pip2 and pip3. How can I configure the package to only be available in Python 3; i.e. to install only with pip3?I've already added these classifiers in setup.py file:But it still can be installed by pip2.
I'm not sure if such an option exists. What you could do though is manually enforce it by checking that the version of python in which it is installed is larger than the version you want to dictate:While this won't stop it being reached from pip2 it should stump any users trying to use an old version of Python  
As of pip 9.0.0 and setuptools 24.2.0 you can add a python_requires keyword as a setup() argument in setup.py. This should handle exactly what you need. Here are some examples on how this might work (taken from the docs):If your package is for Python 3+ only, write:python_requires='>=3',If your package is for Python 3.3 and up but youâ€™re not willing to commit to Python 4 support yet, write:python_requires='~=3.3',If your package is for Python 2.6, 2.7, and all versions of Python 3 starting with 3.3, write:python_requires='>=2.6, !=3.0.*, !=3.1.*, !=3.2.*, <4',
