I'm new to python, so I want to know how to store the data in a database! For a sample example, I want to store informations about users :The question is how to connect the input with the database? we can take the example of the sqlite3 that is preinstalled in python! and we suppose that we have a database called user.db connected to the cursur and a table called users that contains three columns (name, adress, number_phone)thanks for the help!
Use sqllite3 library to perform SQL insert query to insert data into database. For exampleYou can also have a look at the official documentation for detailed info and API references.
You can emulate a database with Python objects.Create a dict, and store all your data therein.Then, serialise (pickle) the data to disk (with pickle.dump) and next time you need to access/manipulate the data, use pickle.load.
