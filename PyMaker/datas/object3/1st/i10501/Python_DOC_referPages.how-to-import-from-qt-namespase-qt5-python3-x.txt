For my application I need to set some widget parameters like alignment (Qt::AlignBottom) and others. But I can't import them (other PyQt5 staff imports withot any issues).Using this codeI got following error:And using this one works:Though I have working sollution I would like to import only Qt.AlignBottom and not *. And why Qt.AlignBottom doesn't work with from PyQt5 import Qt?
I think the confusion here is that PyQt has a special virtual module called Qt, which imports everything into a single namespace. This is a quite useful feature, but it's a real shame that the name clash with QtCore.Qt wasn't avoided.In the first example, the error can be "fixed" by using the somewhat weird-looking Qt.Qt.AlignBottom. But obviously, explicitly importing from QtCore is a much better solution. It's also worth noting that the PyQt5 package is a lazy loader, so import PyQt5 will just import an empty namespace with no access to the other modules.
You can do thisYou can't import AlignBottom only because QtCore is not a package itself, it's just a module on it's own (a single file). it's important to know that all packages are modules, but not all modules are packagesso this won't workLooking at the output you can see that QtCore is a single file which contains a class Qt that contains other classes and methods on which AlignBottom is part of, you can see that with.On the otherhand PyQt5 is a package (folder containing other modules) points to it's __init__.pyi'll suggest you read the docs on Modules and this SO question
