I'm not really sure what this code actually do. what does w and i represent  in this code?  
This is a dict comprehension. If you are familiar with list comprehension ([do_stuff(a) for a in iterable] construct), that works very much the same way, but it builds a dict.See Create a dictionary with list comprehension in Pythonand https://docs.python.org/3.5/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries for the official documentation
This code creates char_dic dictionary with chars from 'helo' string as keys and their occurence indexes in given string.i is an index of w element in char_rdic list.
