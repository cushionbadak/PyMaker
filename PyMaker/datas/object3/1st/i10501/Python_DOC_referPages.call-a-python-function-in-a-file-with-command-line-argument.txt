I'm trying to pass arguments from Node.js to Python with child_process spawn. I also want to invoke the specific Python function with one of the argument that I specified in the Node.js array.test.jsThe second argument here is test, which should call the test() Python function.lib/test.py:If I try to run this Python file without any Node.js from the command line, the execution looks like this:$ python lib/test.py test arg3 2Where test, arg3, and 2 are just command-line arguments, but test should call the test() function, which will use the arg3, 2 arguments for print().
I'd recommend using argparse to parse the command line arguments. Then you can use eval to get the actual function from the input.
