According to Python 3.5 documenation (time module) all three functions  clock_getres(clk_id), clock_gettime(clk_id) and clock_settime(clk_id, time) are available for Unix Systems. According to documentation: clock_getres(clk_id)  Return the resolution (precision) of the  specified clock clk_id clock_gettime(clk_id) Return the time of the specified  clock clk_idclock_settime(clk_id, time) Set the time of the specified clock  clk_idBut Python documenation doesn't say anything about clk_id.Can someone explain me how to get clk_id using python.
Basically clk_id it is integer id of clock, list of clock you can find at: https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.htmlfor example time.CLOCK_REALTIME == 0 and time.CLOCK_MONOTONIC == 1, etcfor each clock you can set the time and surely time is different for every single one as well.
