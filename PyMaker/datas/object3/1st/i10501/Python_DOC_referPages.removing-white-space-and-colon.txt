Natural Text
I have a file with a bunch of numbers that have white spaces and colons and I am trying to remove them. As I have seen on this forum the function line.strip.split() works well to achieve this. Is there a way of removing the white space and colon all in one go? Using the method posted by Lorenzo I have this:Although I get this error:
I think the above syntax is not correct, but anyways as per your question, you can use replace function present in python.When reading each line as a string from that file you can do something like, Here I am using replace function to replace space with blank string, and similar with colon.
You did not provide an example of what your input file looks like so we can only speculate what solution you need. I'm going to suppose that you need to extract integers from your input text file and print their values.Here's how I would do it:Instead of trying to eliminate whitespace characters and colons, I will be searching for digits using a regular expressionConsecutive digits would constitute a numberI would convert this number to an integer form.And here's how it would look like:But before you run away with this code, you should continue to learn Python because you don't seem to grasp its basic elements yet.
