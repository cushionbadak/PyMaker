I'm learning Python through Exercism.IO, I'm currently on the Bob problem where the object of the problem is as follows:Bob is a lackadaisical teenager. In conversation, his responses are very limited.  Bob answers 'Sure.' if you ask him a question.  He answers 'Whoa, chill out!' if you yell at him.  He says 'Fine. Be that way!' if you address him without actually saying  anything.  He answers 'Whatever.' to anything else.So far I've passed a few tests and I'm stuck at a point where it's suppose to return whatever but all the characters are integers, so of course it's not working.Here's where I'm failing:All the characters are integers and my test to see if they're yelling looks like this:Obviously the characters are the same when upper or lower case because they're numbers so the program thinks they're yelling. My question is how can I refactor this program to make it so that when the assertion is all numbers, it won't count it as yelling?
consider using the built-in String method str.isupper()
