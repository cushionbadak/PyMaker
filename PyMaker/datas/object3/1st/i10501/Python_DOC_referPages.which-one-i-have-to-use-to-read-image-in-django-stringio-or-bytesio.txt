I'm trying to compress the image file before uploading in my django application.I found nice code snippet site : https://djangosnippets.org/snippets/10460/but It doesn't work in python3. I think the problem is about str or byte.Someone advise to use BytesIO instead of StringIO.So, I edit my code like this.But it occurs an error : '_io.BytesIO' object has no attribute 'len' --> output.len in my code occurs an error.I start to doubt that It is right way to use BytesIO instead of StringIO. And need some helps how to edit my code, too. Thanks.
I modified the code to use the with statement so there is no need to close the files yourself.
