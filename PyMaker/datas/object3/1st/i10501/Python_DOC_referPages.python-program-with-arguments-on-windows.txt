How to run this program saved in the file test.py on Windows XP with python 2.7 installed.I tried to run it with command line. For exampleorgives error "invalid syntax".
I tried running your script at the command line and it works perfectly:In the above, the $ is the shell's prompt.  What I entered is python arg.py 1 2 3 4 --sum.  It works.Now, let's do what I suspect that you are doing: let's start an interactive python shell and enter the above:This generates the SyntaxError: invalid syntax error that you see.  (There is one minor difference: I am on Linux and you are on Windows.)The solution is to exit the python interactive shell and enter the command at the command prompt.
This is just me being naive, but considering the short error message you posted...Any chance you're getting this code off some book and try to run this on a command line?The book uses $ to mark command line/terminal commands, but the character is actually not part of the syntax or command you're supposed to use.So instead of running this:Run this:
Your test script is the first example on the Python argparse documentation.   https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.htmlYour comment with new lines added isFrom this I deduce that you saved the script as test ('test.py` would have been better), and ran it, from a Windows command line, aswhich producesThat usage message from the parser; test is the name of the script.I'm not sure about the RESTART line.  My tests (at the end) suggest your Python call (or some default environment feature) includes the -i option, which leaves you in the interactive Python session, even after the argparse step fails.The next command is straight out of the Python example:But the context is all wrong.  The docs include $ to indicate that this is being typed in a commandline (Linux shell or Windows commmand).  And the meaning, in the correct context is:run Pythontell it to run the test.py scriptand pass it the arguments '1','2', etcBut if you are already inside a Python interpreter (indicated by the >>> prompt string), this does not make sense.  python and test.py are strings that don't have a default meaning inside Python.  So the interpreter gives you a syntax error.  And none of the variations fix that.A little further along, the argparse documentation gives an example of calling a parser from within a Python interactive session:That has a very different syntax.  In this python -i context it should run.Going back to the Windows command window and typinghas a better chance of working.  If that doesn't work, then you/we need to focus on running an even more basic Python script.=========Here's an example of running another simple script from a Linux shell.  The ...$ is the shell prompt; the >>> is the python prompt.  Adding the -i to the initial python call ensures it stays in python after parsing.The main difference between my test and yours is that I don't get the RESTART and I get a traceback.  Without the -i I simply get the usage message and a return the command line.
