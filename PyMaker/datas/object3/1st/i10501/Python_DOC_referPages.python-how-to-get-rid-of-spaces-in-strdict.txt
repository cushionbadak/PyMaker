Natural Text
For example, if you use str() on a dict, you get:However, I want the string to be like:How can I accomplish this?
You could build the compact string representation yourself:It will leave extra spaces inside string representations of nested lists, dicts etc.A much better idea is to use the json.dumps function with appropriate separators:This will work correctly regardless of the inner structure of dct.
There are two spaces naturally occurring. ': ' and ", ". So I think you can just replace them using replace Note: To use this solution plz assume, you are not having : or , in any of the values or keys of the dictionary.
