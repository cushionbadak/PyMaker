Hello I'm having issues with an exercise that is asking me to write code that contains a function, 3 dictionaries, and an optional argument.Here is my code:Whenever I try to run my code however, my compiler states that it is missing 1 required positional argument: 'num_tracks' for my second print statement.But this should not be an issue because of my if-else statement, unless I wrote my code incorrectly and the compiler isn't reading my if-else statement? Any feedback would be greatly appreciated, thank you for your time.
You need to def the function with a default for the argument to be optional, e.g.:Arguments without a default are always required.
