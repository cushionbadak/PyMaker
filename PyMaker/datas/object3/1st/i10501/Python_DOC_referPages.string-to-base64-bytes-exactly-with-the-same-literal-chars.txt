today I got stucked with the following issue. I can explain it better with the inverse purpose: Say we have the following base64-variable,Imagine that what we want it's not to decode it into string object of python, namely,but the literal equivalent characters in string instead,Ok, now it's my question. I want to build a function that performs just the opposite,I got stucked, I don't know how to do it.. Any suggestion? Thank you in advance.
Is this doing what you want?
Ok, I found the problem, it was easier as I expected.First I am going to try to clarify what actually I wanted to do,Console,My goal was to guess how to build that fun_str_2_b64samechars function. And here it is exactly bytes(str_var,'utf-8'),Probably it was because I thought it was some kind of base64 class as long as I employed the base64 module (due to this I edited the title). Thanks for the help and I hope it could be useful for someone :)
