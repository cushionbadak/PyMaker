I am using Tornado, and in my app I import logging so I can log some information about the server.I put this:right before:but when I run the server and click any link I get the following error:What is causing this?I've already changed to another directory to steer clear of namespace conflicts.
Psychic debugging says web_LOGGING has a key named stream with a str value (probably a file path); stream is only for already opened files, if you want to pass a file path, it's passed as filename.
