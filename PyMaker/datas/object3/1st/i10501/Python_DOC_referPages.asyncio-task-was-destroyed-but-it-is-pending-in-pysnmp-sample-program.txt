I am testing pysnmp asyncio module and as the start used the sample program provided along with the documentation. When I run the sample program, it gives the Task was destroyed but it is pending! error. I checked SO for similar questions and could not find what is wrong with my (inexperienced) eyes. I am using Python 3.4.2 and asyncio that came with it and pysnmp (4.3.2) on Debian 8.5The program I using (the same as the sample program in pysnmp documentation)Error is:Any help to figure this out is much appreciated!Thanks.
There is an internal timer function in pysnmp which is used for handling caches, retries etc. With asyncio transport that timer is driven by asyncio Future. The message you observe warns you about that Future object is still pending right before main loop is shut down.To fix that you need to cancel pending timer task once you are done with all the SNMP I/O. A [hackerish] way to do that would be to append the following snippet to the example script you mentioned:I am working on adding similar coroutine into pysnmp so you could run it out-of-the-box.
