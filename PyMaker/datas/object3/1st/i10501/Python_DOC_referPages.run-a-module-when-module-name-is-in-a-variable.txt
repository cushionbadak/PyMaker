I'm trying to run modules from a directory. A simplified version of my project tree would be:Each module in modules/ has an empty __init__.py and a run() method that does some stuff in <module-name>.pyFrom main.py I would like to load all modules, and then run a module by passing it's name as parameter to a function. For example what I would like to do from main.py:I've googled a bit but can't seem to find a way this would work. Is this even possible? I'm working with Python3 but would welcome a Python2 solution for guidance even.
You can do this with importlib.
