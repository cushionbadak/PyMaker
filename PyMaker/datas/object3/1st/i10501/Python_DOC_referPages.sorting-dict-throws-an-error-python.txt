A dict doesn't have a sort attribute. You can sort it by keys using sorted:
Here's the thing, your original code works in python 2.x:Because d.items() returns a <type 'list'> class, but not with python 3.x, with python 3.x it returns <class 'dict_items'>, which doesn't have the sort method, so a possible workaround would be doing like this:As you can see, casting d.items() to list will allow you to use list.sort
