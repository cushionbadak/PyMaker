I was trying to have a program using Python to create a "pyramid" based on a number, n, out of o's and came up with this: ( I would print nn, that would be the lines.)Not sure how to make nn the o's and not sure what line 6 does either. Does anyone know the answer to either question? ( I'm not in a class just programming for fun.)
You can also use the built-in formatting options offered by python. Take a look at this:The ^ symbol says that you want your print centered. Before it ({1}) comes the padding symbol and after it ({2}) the total width.This is fully customisable and fun to play with.
As someone has mentioned in the comments "o" * n will give a a string containing n "o"s.I've fixed the print line to use the correct method a calling the center method.
You can try this:
This will be the answer to your questionThe reason why they have put time.sleep(1) is to make it look like an animation. print (nn, str.center(40, " ")) this must be changed to nn.center(40, " ") as .center is a method of string.
