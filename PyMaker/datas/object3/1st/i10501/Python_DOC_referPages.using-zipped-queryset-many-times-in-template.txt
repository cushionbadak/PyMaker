I have a model that is only a string :There are 2 registered instances of the model in my database.It is rendered by this view, which zips the queryset which another list: and here's the template code: This template iterates over the data twice, printing out the elements in the zipped list.Here's my output:I am expecting 4 lines of output, because the 2 instances are looped over twice. However it's only printing them out once. What am I doing wrong?
In Python 3, zip will give you an iterator, meaning it will be consumed on the first loop and therefore not print anything on the second loop.You can fix this by casting the iterator to a list, replacing zip(data, data2) with list(zip(data, data2)).
