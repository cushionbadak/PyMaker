I have a list of files, using command in python from filename import * , works for a single file as I am giving the exact name of the file, but if I want to use it as from list[i] import * to iterate over a list and importing function from files one after the another to  work on it, it doesn't work? what changes should I make so as to use it for a list of files, so that I can easily iterate?
Use importlib for that:As stated by the documentation, do not use internal things such as __import__.
If you're looking for dynamic imports, you're looking for the __import__ function.
