Use chain to chain your lists together and then iterate through them. Then you can unpack in the print call to get every sub-element element printed out.So, if for example your lists are named l1, l2 and l3 as so:You're able to access each individual and print it with:Yields:Now, the output from your original attempt, namely:is due to the fact that chain returns an iterator object and that is its representation in the Python REPL. Remember, iterators are meant to be iterated over.
To get each seperately as string:
