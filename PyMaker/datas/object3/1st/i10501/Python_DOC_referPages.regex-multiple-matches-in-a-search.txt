This question already has an answer here:Capturing group with findall?                    4 answers                I am using search and then group to extract a specific parts of a string. The problem I have, however, is that it only finds the first time it occurs. Which is correct because that is how search works.I need to to find every instance of where it occurs, but if I use findall it creates an array which is not what I want and I can't get group() to work with it so it would take a lot of extra steps. Is there another way to do this?Here is the code I have:I only get the first url in the line. 
Use re.finditer and loop over the result; finditer returns each match object one at a time, not just the first hit.
