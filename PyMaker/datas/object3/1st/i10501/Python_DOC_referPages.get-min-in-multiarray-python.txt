I have a multiarray with this structure in python:And I need to get whats array contain with the minimun in the six and seven fieldFor example in the three array above [0, 0, 2000, 0.2, 75, 0.2767137, 0.41646746] contain the minimun in the six field, and [0, 0, 2000, 0.2, 50, 0.31941691, 0.38137865] contain the minimun in the seven fieldThank you very much!Regard, Andres.
That will do (using min() with the key argument):(Next time please clarify your question and provide a mcve)
Here's a better way to use numpy that doesn't involve a for loop:You might want to look into using numpy's structured or record arrays here, so that you can give meaningful names to the 6th and 7th field. pandas may also be relevant to your problem.
This will loop over every column (assuming all rows have equal length). It will then generate a new array which is the column of interest (the ith column).It will then find the index of the lowest value in that array, which is the row that contains the value. Finally it will append the results to the predefined result array.The result looks like this:In each subarray, the first element represents the column and the second element represents the row that contains the lowest value of that column. In case of equal lowest values, it will pick the row with the lowest index.If you just want to get this information from 1 row:Here min_row is the row that contains the lowest value of column col_index.
Here you go, if you don't mind using numpy.As suggested in the comments, this solution isn't very performant.Calling multiarray[:, field].argmin() is about two orders of magnitude faster.
