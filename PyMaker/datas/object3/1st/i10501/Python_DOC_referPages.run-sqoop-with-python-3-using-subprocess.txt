I am trying to run Sqoop command with pythonable to execute this code but when I am trying to execute with "--fields-terminated-by"+" "+"'~'" it's giving tool import errorError parsing arguments for import
Try:process=subprocess.call(["sqoop","import","--connect", "jdbc:oracle:thin:@hostname:1521/ARSMTREP","--username", "hadoop_user" ,"--password", "password","--table","ARADMIN."+line,"--fields-terminated-by","'~'","--as-textfile","--target-dir","/data/"+line])
This code call the sqoop command and executes them from linux terminal . Subprocess call Python subprocess you can also use os.system() to execute the Sqoop query from python . But its preferable the call Subprocess .There is no white space in arguments inside the subprocess.call() or else it will provide the error. In above code all the argument are Sqoop command only the lineis variable which takesthe table name from list.
