I often see Tkinter applications initialize Menu widgets using tearoff=0 in the constructor.effbot.org's documentation for Menu specifies that the default value for tearoff is 1, but it doesn't explain what the value is used for.What does the tearoff attribute do when initializing a tkinter Menu widget?
The official python docs admit that they're a little light on details:The tkinter package is a thin object-oriented layer on top of Tcl/Tk. To use tkinter, you donâ€™t need to write Tcl code, but you will need to consult the Tk documentation, and occasionally the Tcl documentation.The Tk documentation for tearoff gives you what you're looking for:tearoff allows you to detach menus for the main window creating floating menus. If you create a menu you will see dotted lines at the top when you click a top menu item. If you click those dotted lines the menu tears off and becomes floating.
Here you can see a tkinter Menu tear-off with the code for it in the background. I'm not sure how useful this is going to be but according to New Mexico Tech:Normally, a menu can be torn off: the first position (position 0) in the list of choices is occupied by the tear-off element, and the additional choices are added starting at position 1. If you set tearoff=0, the menu will not have a tear-off feature, and choices will be added starting at position 0.
Try this if you want to test the floating menu if you are using Windows.This example is Hover Class by Gogo. Display message when hovering over something with mouse cursor in PythonI Just set tear-off to 1 to see the floating effect.
