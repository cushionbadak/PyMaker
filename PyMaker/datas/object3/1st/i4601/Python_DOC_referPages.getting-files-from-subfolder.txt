I'm pretty new to python, so please bear with me.I'm trying to write a code that utilizes face-recognition, and with that i need to be able to access subfolders.Currently i'm having issues with finding the folder "images". When executing the code, i'm in the folder face-recognition and need to access images that is one level under.- root--- face-recognition-- imagesExecuting this code gives error `FileNotFoundError: [Errror 2] No such file or directory: '../images/'Edit:After trying to rewrite the code i saw what the actual problem is:Running this code snippet trough the terminal on my mac works with no errors. But running the same code on the raspberry-pi 3, the error is thrown, and it does not make sens.Solution:While checking the images folder i found that i have a .gitkeep and .gitignore that ignores all files, (even .gitkeep), and that's why it threw an error because it removed the folder when cloning the repo on the raspberry pi.
Two parts to this:1) You're going the wrong way. ../images/ goes up one directory. You just want images/. For absolute referencing you want /face-recognition/images2) glob is your friend here https://docs.python.org/3/library/glob.html or whatever extension you need.
The Pathlib module is handy (Python version 3.4+). For the directory structure above...  In tmp.py:The image directory is under the parent of tmp.py's parent.
