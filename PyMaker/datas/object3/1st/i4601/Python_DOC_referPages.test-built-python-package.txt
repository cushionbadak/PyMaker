So I recently built a Python package that required a few YAML files for configuration. Following the distribution instructions I created a manifest file that looks like the following:According to the docs, I should have expected for the file to end up in the package... but it didn't, and after this screw up, I'm wondering how would I go about testing the built package against my pytest suite to make sure everything will work as expected after a build?
I believe the manifest file is four source distributions. To include data files in built distributions you use the package_data option in the setup function.
