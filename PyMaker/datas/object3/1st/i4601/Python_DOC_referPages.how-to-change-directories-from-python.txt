I need to change the directory in the cmd with the command 'cd' ..example: (cd users / desktop) .. but when I run the script, nothing happensI have already tried with the following commands..but neither of them works, nothing just happens.How do you navigate in the directories with python?
You can check the current directory usingos.chdir() takes the path not a command as argument.You can either use absolute or relative pathAssuming Documents is in your current directoryyou can do.
What I'm looking for is to change the current directory .. I want the run script to reach the directory I'm looking for, as if I were doing it directly in the cmd
