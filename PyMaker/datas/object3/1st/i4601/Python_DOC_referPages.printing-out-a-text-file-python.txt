Natural Text
I am making a Quiz. When I try to print the results which are stored in a file, this is the output:Instead of actually creating new lines when there is a '\n' it prints the '\n' instead.['\n', 'Username:\n', 'Tes123\n', 'Subject:\n', 'Computer Science\n',  'Difficulty:\n', 'Hard\n', 'Score:\n', '5\n', 'Grade:\n', 'A\n']In the text file the results are presented like this. This is what I want the output to look like:This is my code to read the data from this text file and then print it into the interpreter.
Here is a simple and efficient way to read data in from a file and creating a new lines.This reads the data into new lines every time it reaches the end of the sentence or line. For more information see Input / Output for python.
You might want to try this instead:p.sit might be better for you not to save \n in the file at all and just do this:
You basically have to iter on your data.How about this?
you can try these after your print method
Another way of '\n' is os.linesep.This page helped me with printing the file if that is what you need.
