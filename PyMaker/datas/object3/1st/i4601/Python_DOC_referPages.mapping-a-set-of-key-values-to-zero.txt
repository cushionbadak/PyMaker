I am entering a set of keys through a for loop.The values being entered (for n = 10) are:I have been trying to get these names to be initialized to a value 0 in a dictionary while in the for loop. For instance, this is the end result I want:To get this implemented, I tried using myDict.fromkeys(t1,0) and I keep getting a series of empty lists. Alternately, I have also tried creating an empty list (lst), and appending every value of t1 to it: lst.append(t1) and creating another empty list lst1 and appended 0 each time: lst1.append(0). I then used:However, although this gets the result, it is only until after the for loop is finished. Is there any way to add the above input values to the dictionary while in the for loop? For example, as you enter 'Trucker' 'Trekkers', it gets added to myDict with a value of 0 (eg. myDict = 'Trucker':0,'Trekkers':0).EDIT:For each team in this league, the first team (t1) represents the home team and the second team represents the away team (t2), the 3rd and 4th arguments represent the points by each team respectively(i.e Truckers score is 87 and Trekkers score is 75). In this league, when a home team wins they are awarded 3000 points, when an away team wins - 3500 points, draw - 1000 and a loss - 50 points.In the first case Truckers is the home team and they win (87 > 75), so they awarded 3000 points plus the 87 points from the match. Also since Trekkers lost, the awarded 50 points (due to the loss) + 75 from the result of the match. So therefore, 3087 would be added to Truckers and 125 to the Trekkers. In the second case, Riders is the home team and Bikers is the away team since 80 < 90. Bikers is awarded 3500 points + 90 (3590); and Riders is awarded 3000 + 80 (3080). So currently, the myDict would look like this: In the end, the dictionary should look this:Complete Code:
collections.Counter can be used to keep track of these scores for you.It removes the need to set starting scores at 0 for each team. It also removes the need to define keys before you run your algorithm.SolutionResultExplanationcollections.Counter acts like a simple counter for any keys which are provided, even if they have not been explicitly added.Therefore, c['MyTeam'] += 100 will add 100 to an existing score, or set c['MyTeam'] = 100 if the key does not exist.
you just need to addwithin your for loop
