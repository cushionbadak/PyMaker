When coding a class that provides abstraction over one or more HTTP APIs that it transparently consumes, what is the appropriate Exception to raise when the service request ends up in a HTTP 404 or similar?The class is intended as a composite object for consumers who have a high-level overview of what services are being consumed but would appreciate a specific exception for failures at the API access level. Of course, one could always write and raise a Custom Exception Object:But going through, Standard Python Exceptions, I am not sure if I am  overlooking a suitable candidate. What is the best practice if not this?
Use requests:requests.exceptions contains a multitude of built-in HTTP exceptions, and includes a specific response.raise_for_status(), which does all the heavy lifting for you (example from the link):If you aren't using requests directly, you can from requests import exceptions and then throw your own.
