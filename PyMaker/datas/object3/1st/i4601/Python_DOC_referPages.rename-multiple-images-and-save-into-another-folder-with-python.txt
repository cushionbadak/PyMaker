I have 100 images in a folder and I want to rename all of them. For example, Car.1.jpg, Car.2.jpg,Car.3.jpg so on and save them into another folder. I wrote the code which renames all the images as I want but it saves in the same folder which images exist. I want to rename all images and keep the original image name in the directory and copy renamed images into another directory.   
You should try using shutil.move()
Add a variable output_path pointing to the folder to which you want to export the files, then use this variable in the seconde argument of os.rename(), like this :Make sure to create the output folder in your system (by using mkdir, for example).
