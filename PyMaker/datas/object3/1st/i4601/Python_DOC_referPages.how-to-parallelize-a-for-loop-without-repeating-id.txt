I'm kind of new to Python. I am indexing through a website and scraping values off of it, but since there's like 100k pages to index through, it takes a lot of time. I was wondering how I could speed it up. I read that multithreading could be conflicting / not work for this and that multiprocessing would be the best way to start. Here is an example of my code:If I do something like this:It does run the function in parallel but I only want each process to scrape an ID that is not already being scraped by another process. if I do p.join() it doesn't seem to increase the speed at all than without multiprocessing so I'm not sure what to do.
Here's an example based on the concurrent.futures module.
