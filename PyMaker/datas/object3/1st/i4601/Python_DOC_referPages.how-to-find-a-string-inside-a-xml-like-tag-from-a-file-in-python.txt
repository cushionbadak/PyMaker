Natural Text
I have a RDF document, which looks like as follows:From the above texts, I need to extract the target (i.e. only the value inside the opening and closing "cd:target" tag). The desired output should be 'Diagnosis'. I tried with XML parser but it does not work because of the tree contains ':'. Any better solution, please? Update: This is the I tried, sorry for naive coding style. 
The cd: part is a namespace.  They're pretty common in XML, and just about any XML parser has a way to handle them.Otherwise, if you are just looking for a single item and you don't care about structure, you could just do a simple string search and grab everything between <cd:target> and </cd:target>, like so:
You can use the BeautifulSoup module with its XML parser.As you can see, it's pretty easy to use.
The rdf: and cd: are namespace tags. They need to be replaced in your search with the actual namespace identifiers, like so:
You could use the following regex: this will get all the data from within all of the 'cd' tags in your file..And this outputs:Explaination of the pattern variable:the first .* tells the script that we want ANY characters that are in this space(.*) tells the script that this is the section we want to captureAnd the last .* does pretty much the same as before, searches for ANY character.Note: I have involved a if statement to check if the output (which is in list form) contains any elements, if not, it excludes it from the output. (for example your heading RDF elements will be excluded).
You can create a dictionary holding the namespace mappings seen at the top:This would display:This approach is described in the Python xml.etree.ElementTree documentation.
