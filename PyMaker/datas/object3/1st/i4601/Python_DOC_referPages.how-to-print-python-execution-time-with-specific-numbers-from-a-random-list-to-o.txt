I have been trying to calculate Python's execution time with this code, I've got the time but I don't know which number is being used from the list to be measured any help with how to print it would be helpful and much appreciated
I believe your code is fine you just need to restructure the code a bit.this will give you the desired results.This is a sample output :I hope i understood correctly .
You could leverage the timeit module:Output:This will execute the given function number times and print your time in seconds for it. You can use the setup to provide "data" or "imports" to your test that only has to be executed once and not on each run.
