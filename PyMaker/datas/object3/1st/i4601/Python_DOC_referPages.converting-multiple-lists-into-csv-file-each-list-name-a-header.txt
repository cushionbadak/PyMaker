I'm using Python 3.6. I have three lists with about 11,000 elements that I am converting to a csv file, but because there is no writecolumn() function like there is a writerow(), my lists are displayed near infinitely rightward. Here is a sample code with sample lists of only three elements each. How do I get the elements from the lists 'number', 'session', and 'stage' under their own column and header? To clarify, I want all three 'number' elements under one column, and the same for 'session' and 'stage'.The question here comes close to answering but not quite, so please don't duplicate: Write multiple lists into csv. file in PythonI've tried converting to a dictionary but dictionaries don't take variables in the values section. I've tried iterating but that only makes each element iterable going rightward. I've tried using the zip() function but that only groups each list by index under one column.
You can use the zip functionor you could use the pandas moduleYou should also stop using global variables

Since you have same number of elements in each list you can use zip.
