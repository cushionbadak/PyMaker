I'm currently working with an enum of the following type:Now I'd like to be able to do the following:where the url for the enumeration members FIRST and SECOND are different of course. I could create a dictionary with the enumeration members as keys and the urls as values, but this won't assure that if I later add an enumeration member I'll remember to add corresponding the dictionary entry.Is there a clean way to have an enumeration with multiple values for the enumeration members? And to name these different values?Something like this: 
There is an example like this in the documentation. If the class defines an __init__ method, the enum values will be passed to it as arguments. This means you can define your enum like so:(Note that value is a special attribute reserved by enums, so I named the attribute value_ to avoid a name clash.)You can now access these attributes on each enum member:
Both the stdlib Enum and aenum1 easily support your use case (although more work is required for the stdlib version).stdlib enum 3.4+  (See the docs for __new__ and __init__ explanations.)aenum -- Usable for both Python 2 and 3 code.  aenum also makes a few things easier -- the above code would be:And in use:1 Disclosure:  I am the author of the Python stdlib Enum, the enum34 backport, and the Advanced Enumeration (aenum)  library.
Make the values a namedtuple.
Have you tried the code you wrote? It already just works! Of course you don't really have multiple values, you have a single tuple valueâ€”but that isn't a problem:There are things you can do to make this a little nicer, like using a namedtuple instead of a plain tuple so you can write a.value.url instead of a.value[1], but you've already written something that works.
