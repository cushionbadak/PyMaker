I've got to format with a %.02f style my floats.  I've tried :  but it fails, so I tried :It fails too, I found this one on the net :  It gives me a list of strings, so that I succeded to format with two commands :OK it finally works but I shall miss something easier, no ? Is it possible to use list comprhensions syntax ?
You are missing a % in your original code, which is why it doesnt work. Use float("%.02f" % x) instead of float(".02f" % x):Alternatively, use round:
you should use round(x,2) for rounding to desired level  hope this helps
