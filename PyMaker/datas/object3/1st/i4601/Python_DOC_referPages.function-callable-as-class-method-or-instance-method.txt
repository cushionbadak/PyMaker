This question already has an answer here:can a function be static and non-static in python 2                    1 answer                I have a Python class that I created previously, it looks something like this:Now I would like to retrofit this interface with some state, so that the caller can create a Foo object, give it some properties, and then call its bar() method, which has access to self and its properties:Unfortunately, this breaks the previous interface - Foo.bar(7) will now give TypeError: bar() missing 1 required positional argument: 'x', because Foo.bar(...) is a simple function reference.I can add a @classmethod decorator to get part way there:Is it possible to create a @flexmethod decorator that converts the other direction?  Specifically - if called as an instance method like Foo(20).bar(...), then do nothing; if called as a class method like Foo.bar(...) then create a new Foo object (using no-arg constructor) and pass that as the self argument.I was going to try this myself by looking at the source for @classmethod, but it looks like it's implemented at the C level.
The Descriptor HOWTO has entire section on how @classmethod and @staticmethod work, and how to implement variations on them, including this pure-Python equivalent to classmethod:If it isn't obvious to you how that works, you probably need to read the whole HOWTO. I've got a blog post that tries to provide an introduction to the method-related stuff first, which may help get over the abstraction hump of the first part of the HOWTO.
