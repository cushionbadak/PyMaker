This is the Python Code:Can somebody explain me the step-by-step process of getting the nearest vector? The whole process of function "find_nearest_vector()". Can someone show me the tracing process of this function? Thank you.
From Wikipedia; the L2 (Euclidean) norm is defined asnp.linalg.norm simply implements this formula in numpy, but only works for two points at a time. Additionally, it appears your implementation is incorrect, as @unutbu pointed out, it only happens to work by chance in some cases.If you want to vectorize this, I'd recommend implementing the L2 norm yourself with vectorised numpy.This works when pt is a 1D array:Note, the closest point will have the smallest L2 norm as well as the smallest squared L2 norm, so this is, in a sense, even more efficient than np.linalg.norm which additionally computes the square root.
