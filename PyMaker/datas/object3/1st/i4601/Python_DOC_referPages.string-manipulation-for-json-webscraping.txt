I am trying to scrape a website and have all the data needed in very long matrices which were obtained through requests and json imports.I am having issues getting any output.Is it because of the merge of two strings in requests.get()?Here is the part with the problem, all things used were declared at the start of the code.Example of DepositMatrix - list of lists with 4 elements, [[string , float, int, int]]I think the error is in this part:This change doesnt help either:
Like I said in my comment, I tried your code and it worked for me. But I wanted to highlight some things that could help your code be clearer:For your loop, instead of creating a range of the length of your list (q) and then using this q to get the information back from your list, it's simpler to get each element directly (for deposit in DepositMatrix:)I've used the pprint module to ease the visualization of your data.
