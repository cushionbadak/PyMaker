I am taking a beginner Python class and the instructor has asked us to countdown to zero without using recursion.  I am trying to use a for loop and range to do so, but he says we must include the zero.  I searched on the internet and on this website extensively but cannot find the answer to my question.  Is there a way I can get range to count down and include the zero at the end when it prints?Edit:
The range() function in Python has 3 parameters: range([start], stop[, step]).  If you want to count down instead of up, you can set the step to a negative number:Output:
As another option to @chrisz's answer, Python has a built-in reversed() function which produces an iterator in the reversed order.outputsThis can be sometimes easier to read, and for a well-written iterator (e.g. built-in range function), the performance should be the same.
