I create two python files named "test.py" and __main__.py.in test.py:in __main__.py:but when I run test.py, it outputs nothing.then, I change __main__.py to:and test.py:When I run test.py, it appears an error:who can tell me why? Thanks a lot!
As indicated by the underscores, __main__ is a magic module name. It refers to the module first executed by the Python interpreter. If you run python test.py, __main__ will be the module formed by test.py.Instead, rename your __main__.py to main.py and use import main and main.main().
You are never importing anything.  Since your own file is given the name __main__ (this is true because __name__ returns '__main__'), whatever name you give your file.You are never actually importing anything but the file you are running:Run this throught the interpreter to see what I mean.You can quite clearly see that __main__ is an inbuilt command, and __main__.py and is never imported, only the original script.A module’s __name__ is set equal to '__main__' when read from standard input, a script, or from an interactive prompt.See 29.4. main — Top-level script environmentTo fix the problem rename __main__.py to something that does not conflict with inbuilt commands.
