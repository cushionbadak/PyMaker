QuestionI'm pretty new at Python and Pygame so I figured I'd jump right it head first and work on making a little rpg style game. I keep getting the error message below. I keep checking the code and re-watching the tutorial I'm following and I can't seem to find the problem.I'm sure it's pretty obvious but I don't see the problem. I'm pretty sure I formatted the code in this post right but I don't know.Error MessageMain.pyTextures.py
You have to create an instance of your Tiles class.Your Tiles class cannot be directly blitted without creating an instance first.Implemented into your code:You should change your Tile class as well.I suggest you really take a look at the the pygame documentation and the python documentation.You should also look at SO if your question was already posted. For example, I found this example.
