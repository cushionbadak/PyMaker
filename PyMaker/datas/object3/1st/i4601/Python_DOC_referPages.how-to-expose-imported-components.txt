I'm very new to python, and am using Python 3.5I have a file structure like this:In some script I would like to be able to use MyModule.component.subcomponent.myfunc() using either of these two approaches:or I tried making my ./MyModule/component.py have the following, but it didn't work:What's the right way to do this?
You have a name conflict. You can't have both component.py and a component package. When Python imports MyModule.component it'll either find the component.py module or the component/__init__.py package. You can't have both.On my Python 3.7 setup on OS X, packages win:which would mean your component.py file is never even executed.Move the component.py contents into component/__init__.py and import your submodules there. When you import a submodule of a package, that module automatically becomes an attribute.So all you need to do is remove component.py, and then you can useanywhere, at which point import MyModule.component will suffice to be able to reach MyModule.component.subcomponent.myfunc().See the Submodules section of the Python reference documentation on the import system:When a submodule is loaded [...] a binding is placed in the parent moduleâ€™s namespace to the submodule object. For example, if package spam has a submodule foo, after importing spam.foo, spam will have an attribute foo which is bound to the submodule.I'd use package-relative imports at the top of your MyModule/component/__init__.py file:to ensure that the submodule is loaded when you import MyModule.component.
