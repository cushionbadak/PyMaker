Natural Text
I have a textfile with alot of lines and each line has a date at the start of it.So I'm trying to get the entries for each date and count them (or sum them) and give the output "Date has X entries."I did it with a specific date. I can give the date to the variable "search", but I want to get it for every date without changing it for every day.Notice: The date is always in the format "dd.mm.yy".Output would be:27.03.18: 428.03.18: 229.03.18: 3Heres my code:
output:Counter({'27.03.18': 4, '29.03.18': 3, '28.03.18': 2})
You can do that using Counter like:Code:Test Code:Results:
Just use the first 8 characters (the date) of the line as the key which you store in a dictionary and increment whenever the same date is encountered.
You could also use pandas
