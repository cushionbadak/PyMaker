This question already has an answer here:AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'reader' [duplicate]                    1 answer                When I run this code I get the following error:What should I change?
You are importing your own file (csv.py). You need to rename your csv.py file and try again. This is duplicate of AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'reader'
Your own script is called "csv.py" so it's trying to import iteself.Since you do not have the attribute "reader" inside your own script, it's not found.Try renaming the script you are running and you should be fine.
