I have a folder with files that are named from 0.txt to 100.txt.They are created in order from a list L.I want to rename the files in that folder with the name from the list, however, they are renamed in "wrong" order, meaning they are not renamed as the list.My code is like:where L is the list with names for the files.How do I keep the order of files in the directory to match my names in the L list, so the files are renamed according to my list?
As per the Python documentation:os.listdir(path='.')Return a list containing the names of the entries  in the directory given by path. The list is in arbitrary order, and  does not include the special entries '.' and '..' even if they are  present in the directory.Therefore, you need to sort your files before you use zip:With sorted, the parameter key=lambda x: int(x.split('.')[0]) will ensure the ordering is correct.
