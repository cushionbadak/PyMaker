Natural Text
I need to append a column/value to the below insert. The value is the same for every row.I can append the column name to the cols tuple, but cannot seem to append the value to the data.I am reading from hundreds of text files of varying format, and the target is sql server table Any help very grateful. THANKS!!!
Since the way you are using csv returns lists, you can simply append the extra column name to the cols list ...... and append the extra value to the end of the data list inside the loop
