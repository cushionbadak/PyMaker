This is my code:And my main:I want that my input will be: first line - {'cd': ['ab', 'bb'], 'dd': ['cc']}second line - {'d': ['a', 'b', 'c']} But instead I get error and if I delete the line that i sort my list my input looks like: first line - {'dd': ['cc'], 'cd': ['bb', ['ab']]}second line - {'d': ['a', ['c', ['b']]]}what can I do?
You should use collections.defaultdict for this problem.The problem with your code is that, to add the elements of a list to another list, you need list.extend instead of list.append. This answer provides more detail:  Difference between append vs. extend list methods in PythonExplanation for above solutioncollections.defaultdict allows you to specify a default value for arbitrary keys.In this implementation, the default value is an empty list.Therefore, we simply loop through the input dictionary and use list.append to add keys from the original dictionary to values set as keys of your new dictionary.
The values of new_dict are lists. When you append a list to another list, you get nested lists. You want to extend the list by another list:
You're appending a list to a list, which nests it inside. You should concatenate them:But even simpler would be to not create a new list, just append to the list that's in the key.This is also a good use for a defaultdict.
Below function gives correct result:
