I am trying tensorflow in Google Colaboratory from this codelab, I need to download 'http://download.tensorflow.org/example_images/flower_photos.tgz' this file to complete the lab.How I can download the file. Is there anyway to upload the tar file without downloading it on my machine. I tried this methodThis doesn't work, wget is not found also. Anyone please tell me how to do this.
Read the manual, they have good examples and explanations: urllib.request To download:To just check the content:
Possibly simpler: use !wget, e.g., executing a cell with the command:will save the file to the local filesystem of the VM. (Note the leading !. This is a signal to execute the line as a shell command.)
