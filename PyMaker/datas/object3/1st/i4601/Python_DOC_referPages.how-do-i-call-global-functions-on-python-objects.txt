I've seen this page: https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/object.html but there doesn't seem to be any way to call functions like long_lshift or long_or.It's not essential to me to call these functions, I could also live with the more generic versions, although I'd prefer to call these.  Anyways, is there any way to use these?  What do I need to include?  Below is some example code, where I'd like to use them (simplified):
I couldn't find these functions in documentation, but they appear to be exported in Python.h header:PyNumber_Lshift is the replacement for long_shift in my code.Similarly, PyNumber_Or is the replacement for long_or in my code.
