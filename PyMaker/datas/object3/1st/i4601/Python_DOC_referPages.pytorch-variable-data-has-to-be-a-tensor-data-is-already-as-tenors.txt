I am trying to load data using pytorch's Dataset and DataLoader classes. I use torch.from_numpyto convert each array to a tensor in the torch Dataset and from looking into the data, each X and y is indeed a tensorHowever on features = Variable(X) i get:An example of an X and y in the dataset are:which is why it is very confusing for me that torch thinks X is an int. Any help would be much appreciated - thanks!
There is error in your use of enumerate which caused the error because the first return value of enumerate is the batch index, not the actual data. There are two ways you can make your script work. First waySince your X and y is do not need special process. You can just return a sample of X and y. Change your __getitem__ method to Also, change your training loop a little bit:Second wayYou can return a dict in the __getitem__ method and extract the actual data in the training loop. In this case, you do not need to change the __getitem__ method. Just change your training loop:
Notice that you are using enumerate in the for-loop. So, what you are doing is the following
