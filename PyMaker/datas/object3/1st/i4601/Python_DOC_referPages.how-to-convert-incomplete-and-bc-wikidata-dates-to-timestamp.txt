The Wikidata date format looks like this:+2018-03-26T00:00:00ZSo if Douglas Adams was born on +1952-03-11T00:00:00ZThen I can use Python to get the timestamp like this:>>> -562032000.0 As you can see here I cannot use the + - value, which indicates that the date in AD or BC.Moreover, I cannot work with an incomplete date: For example Genghis Khan +1162-00-00T00:00:00Z(day and month missing)And dates in BC that are also incomplete: Plato -0427-00-00T00:00:00Z
The standard datetime module cannot handle negative (BC) dates, but NumPy can. It allows you to parse both positive and negative dates, although for some reason it only allows no sign symbol (assumes positive) or negative symbol; maybe it's worth raising an issue, as the ISO 8601 standard is supposed to support it. The missing months and days, though, are not (afaik) part of the standard; you can split by '-00' as a kinda-hacky-but-effective solution. A complete function could look like this:
