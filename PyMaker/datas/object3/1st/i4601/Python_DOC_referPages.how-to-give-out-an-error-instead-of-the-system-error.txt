You could use a try-except loop.  With continue (as below) the user can keep guessing.  You could also put your own exception in place of the print and continue if you want the script to break with a more informative message.
A similar question to yours already exists, but I'll answer your question anyway.As you already know, the reason you're getting a traceback response is because you're trying to convert a non-integer into an integer when you call int(guess). You can catch this exception using a try/except block. For example, you could replace the offending line of code with the following:This code will cause the program to require input from the user until that input is valid. Have a look at this Python3 handling errors and exceptions documentation for more information.
