If I understand correctly, the python syntax from ... import ... can be used in two waysfrom package-name import module-namefrom module-name import function-nameI would like to know a bit of how Python internally treats the two different forms. Imagine, for example,  that the interpreter gets "from A import B", does the interpreter actually try to determine whether A is a package-name/ module-name, or does it internally treat packages and modules as the same class of objects (something like Linux treats files and directories very similarly)?
First of all, a module is a python file that contains classes and functions. when you say From A Import B python searches for A(a module) in the standard python library and then imports B(the function or class) which is the module if it finds A. If it doesn't it goes out and starts searching in the directory were packages are stored and searches for the package name( A ) and then if it finds it, it imports the Module name(B). If it fails in the past 2 processes it returns an error.Hope this helps.
