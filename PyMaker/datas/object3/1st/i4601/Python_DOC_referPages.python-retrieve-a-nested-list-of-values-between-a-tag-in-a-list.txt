I have a list that is:I want to return a list containing nested sublists of values that are in between the "TAG"s. So the resulting list would look like:I created a method below that attempts to accomplish this but does not work:This prints out:Can anyone please help me understand what I am doing wrong, and some suggestions to fix it?
This is reasonably straight forward when using a generator like:Code:Test Code:Results:
Here's a way to accomplish this with itertools.groupby.This can also be implemented as a comprehension:
This is really not a good way to do it, but you can make it work.First, you never do the k = lst.index(tag) again after the first time.So, with your list, k turns out to be 3 forever. But you keep taking the first three elements off the list, so first k[0:3] is [2, 3, 5], then it's [6, 7, 3], then it's 3, [6, 'TAG', 9], and so on. You need to keep calling it each time.Second, what happens when there are no more 'TAG's left in the list? That lst.index will raise an exception. So you need to handle that.
Logic is just tracking the 'TAG' keyword and when it found just empty the temp list and start adding from index 0 again. This will work for you:output:
