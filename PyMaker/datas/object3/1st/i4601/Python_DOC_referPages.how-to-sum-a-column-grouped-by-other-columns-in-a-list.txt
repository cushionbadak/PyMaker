I have a list as follows.I would like sum up the last column grouped by the other columns.The result is like thiswhich is still a list.In real practice, I would always like to sum up the last column grouped by many other columns. Is there a way I can do this in Python? Much appreciated.
dynamically grouping by all columns except the last one:
This is an O(n) solution via collections.defaultdict, adaptable to any number of keys.If your desired output is a list, then this may be preferable to a solution via Pandas, which requires conversion to and from a non-standard type.ResultExplanationCycle through your list of lists, define keys / value and add to your defaultdict of lists.Use a list comprehension to convert dictionary to desired output.
Op1You can pass a index sum  and add tolist convert back to list Op2For list of list you can using groupby from itertools 
Create to DataFrame and aggregate third column converted to integers by first and second columns, last convert back to lists:And solution with defaultdict, python 3.x only:
pd.factorize and np.bincount
