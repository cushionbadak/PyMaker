I'm trying to create a program that loops through a list of xml-files and extracts certain elements from the files: The above code returns a list with var1, var2 (from the last file) if I call the function. The reason I have defined this function is that there are different types of xml-files with different element names, so I'm going to create a function for each file type.Now I want to create a table where the output from each file is a row i.e.:And ideally export the table to a csv-file. How do I go about that?
The easiest way to write a CSV file is using the Standard CSV.To write a CSV file, is as simple as opening the file and using the default writer:Note that csf.writer receives a list as parameter.
