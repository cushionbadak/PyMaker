I want to extract numbers from a string and store them in different variables.for eg:- "92+23i" is a complex number. I want to store 92 in variable num_real and 23 in num_imagin.
Python has predefined type as complex however it expects the string to be of type "a+bj" (note the j instead of i, and it should be without space). In your case you may replace "i" with "j" in your string and get your desired values as:From this complex number, you need to extract the desired values using my_num.imag for imaginary part and my_num.real for the real part of the complex number. For example:
Your string is very close to parsing as a Python literal:Access the real and imaginary parts with num.real and num.imag.
