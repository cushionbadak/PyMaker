I have a class that I use as a container for parameters:Can I specify what values can be written to a parameter?For example color can be only blue and red, and if I do this:it should fail.In C++ I can create an enum and use it as a type, I guess similar functionality should be possible in Python too.
You could subclass dict and add your controls there. Then define param1 = ControlDict({...}).
You could use a descriptor.  The descriptor would be an attribute of the class accesible with dot notation.Usage:If you need Parameters instances to be subscriptable:Usage
