Getting input from the user and convert it into the float, while getting the entry from the user and then I want to check if user press enter without giving any input or value then it will bring the user to again enter the marks.
i'd go with a try/except clause:In this way, anything that raise an error when converted to float (including '', or Enter without giving any input) will result in he repetition of the question.
Use try/except to handle the exception. Please find below code. Hope it helps.
