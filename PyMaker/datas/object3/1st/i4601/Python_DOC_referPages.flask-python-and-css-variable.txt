I currently trying to build an online random color generator with python and flask. I have created my function which generate a random hex color code and I struggle to pass it into the css background color.BREdouard
You could try to genrate the random hex values as you did (or the way I did, by just just slightly improving code with random.sample and range) in your code example and pass that value into the template context, where you would put it somewhere in <style> tag. This will render template and substitute dynamic value every time you visit the page.
