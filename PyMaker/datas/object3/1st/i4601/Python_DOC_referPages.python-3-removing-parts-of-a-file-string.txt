I have a list of sound files like belowAnd What I want to do is remove everything before the song name and display just the song name on my PiFace Controll & Display 2 with the code `cad.lcd.write(Song_Name).I think I have a slight understanding on how to do it by creating a separate string with what I want to be removed like belowHowever the issue with this is that every song has a separate number like 1-20 and 1-21 and then different albums that I will be adding after will have a different album location so I'm not sure how to implement this idea.Any help would be greatly appreciated.If I have confussed anyone I have a music file eg;And I want to removeSo that I'm left with
You can try this approach:output:Regex info:
The standard module os.path has everything you need to manipulate filepath. os.path.basename(filename) does what you need.
There are two common solutions for the problem you are trying to solve.1. regexIn a more general case, if either what you are looking for or the string you are dealing with shows regularity, you can use python's regular expressions library, re.Here is an example of using regex to extract everything after the last forward slash.To learn more about regular expressions in python, try the documentation for re in Python 3.2. os.pathIn this particular case, the easiest option is to use os.path since you are dealing with a filename.
Python package os provides the function [split], to split the path (or we can say string) and [join], to join the path.First you need to split the path, joint by the "/" separator and store the last element of the returned output.Here, the headName would consist of 02 She Bangs The Drums.mp3Now you need to split the headName in the same manner, joint by a space ( ). Store all the elements except the 0th one.Here, splittedHeadName would contain ["She", "Bangs", "The", "Drums.mp3"].Now all you need to do is to just join the splittedHeadName by the space separator.That's it. Now the fileName contains She Bangs The Drums.mp3 which is required the output you want.Now, just iterate the filePath and get the respected fileName. You can use snippet I mentioned on the top.
