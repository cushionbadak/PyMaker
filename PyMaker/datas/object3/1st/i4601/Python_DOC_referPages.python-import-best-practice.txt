I have a python module with several functions (say 10-20 functions). About 50% of those functions use an imported module (that is potentially 'heavy'). Is it 'better practice' to:1- Call the 'import' function inside each of the 5 functions that require it.or2- Make that import in the module header - even though 50% of the functions in that module do NOT use the imported module.I guess the larger question is what's the more 'pythonic' to decide whether imports are done within the module, within specific classes or within methods (functions) in those classes.
An import is only a name binding. It is better to import the whole module at once because it will search the module in your files only one time.You can find more information here:https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html
