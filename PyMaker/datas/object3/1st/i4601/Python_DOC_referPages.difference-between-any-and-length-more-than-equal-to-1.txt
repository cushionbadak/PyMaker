I am trying to evaluate whether there is any elements in an object (series in the following example). I used any and I couldn't understand it's behavior. I am wondering why len(s)>=1 returns True while any(s) return False?
The Python any function is a short-circuiting boolean test of all elements of inside a sequence or iterable:The sequence itself is True unless it is empty or has 0 length:The Python function len returns the length of a sequence and is completely unrelated to any. Although you could force len to be like any I suppose:(An iterable, such as a generator, may not support len but any can still be used on these iterables.)To answer your question of I am wondering why len(s)>=1 returns True while any(s) return False? you need to understand Truth Value Testing in PythonAll objects are True in Python except:None;0 in a numeric object;Empty containers, mappings or sequences (those where len(obj)==0);A user written object that has defined its own notion of true or false.So any(s) is False because all the elements of the sequence s are False while len(s)>1 indicates that s contains objects and therefor bool(s) would be True.This is way simpler, once understood, than other languages sense of 'truthiness', such as Perl'sPandas any and len methods mirror the Python built-in functions.
