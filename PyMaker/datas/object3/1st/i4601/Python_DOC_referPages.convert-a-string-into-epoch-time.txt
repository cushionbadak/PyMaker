This question already has an answer here:Convert python datetime to epoch with strftime                    8 answers                I tried to convert a string into epoch time but failed.Here is error:
You only need to use your datetime instance:From the docs:Return POSIX timestamp corresponding to the datetime instance.What you are currently doing is passing the parsed datetime object to the datetime constructor (datetime(dt))which expects integers.
