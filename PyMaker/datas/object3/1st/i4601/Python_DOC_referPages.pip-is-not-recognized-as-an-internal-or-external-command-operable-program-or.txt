I have tried to install libraries using pip but my console doesnt recognize as a command. I checked the python/scripts folder and there was no ppip.exe in the folder. I reinstalled Python 3.6 a couple of times but I havent been able to use it. I tried it on another computer and pip installed itself with python 3.6. I've seen answers that say to open a Python shell, then insert python -m pip install 'packagename' but i tried this and the shell marked invalid syntax at the end of writing pip
if pip is installed the following will work for sureopen a python shell thenimport pippip.main(['install', 'packagename'])replace the packagename with the package you want to installbecause of the path problem try to use absolute paths ( in windows beginning with drive letter i.e. C:/.../.../pip.exe). in batch script it is generally  good idea to use absolute paths. Alternatively check if your path has to be fixed : https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html( http://jelly.codes/articles/python-pip-module/ )Operating systems search for executables in the system path. I.e. windows knows by default where its own executables are located because the directory is in the system path, however when new software is installed that contains executables like pip the system path has to be edited to inform windows ( or linux ) where the new executables are located. The path is an environment variable. This is also valid for other languages and programs like java ( Environment variables for java installation ) ,...Now your problem very likely is that the directory where the pip.exe executable is stored is not part of your windows path. This has to be fixed like in https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html, chapter 3.3. Configuring PythonHow to run Pip commands from CMD
on linux(ubuntu)for windows
