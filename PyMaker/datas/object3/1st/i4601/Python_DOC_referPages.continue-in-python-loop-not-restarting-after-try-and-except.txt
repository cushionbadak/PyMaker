The loop does not restart after an exception occurs in a python loop. I have tried both continue and pass. When i use continue the loop does not proceed forward it is stuck at the exception. when i use pass it captures on the the id that has the error and the the ones before that even if there is no error when i print it shows as error.This is my code that i am using.Any suggestions how do i restart the loop with the next id. The exceptions occur either above or below the search bar.Regards,Ren.

Thanks @Jinglesting. I solved it by breaking the code into sub parts by using if and then in except i redirected it to the home page.Thanks for all the help i learned something new about generators.
