I am trying to make a template filter to show who liked a post. Each comment contains a ManyToManyField with the users who upvoted a post. I am trying to use the join method to simplify my code instead of using a for loop. This does not work and I get the error ManyToManyField is not iterable.
You will need to do that like:See (Docs)
Maybe something likeupvote = [ user.link for user in queryset ]
