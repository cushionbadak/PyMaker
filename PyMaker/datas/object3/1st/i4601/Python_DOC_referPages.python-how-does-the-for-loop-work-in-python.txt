I have the following code in Python and I am an unsure about how the for loop here is working.How does this for work ?What is desc[0]?
Based on the code you've given us it seems like desc is an array itself and thus colnames is an array of all the desc[0] you get from each desc in cur.descriptiondesc[0] is the first item in desc as arrays in Python are zero-indexed.
It use iterable objects especially next methode it will consume the value inside the objects till get stop iteration, it works like a generator objects....
When in doubt of something, try to recreate the thing. Althought, it could be anything iterable, we could assume it's just a list, then:in the output you'll have:['first', 'second', x, ... ]
