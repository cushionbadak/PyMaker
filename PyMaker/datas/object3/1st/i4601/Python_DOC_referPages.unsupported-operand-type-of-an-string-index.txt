I tried to run the code down below, but I couldn't because it launched the following error:  unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'str' and 'int'.  I've been searching and I found that it has something to do with the input, but not in this case.
The problematic part is st[j] = st[j - 1], more specifically j - 1 where you are subtracting 'str' and 'int' types. This is not supported in Python.
You have several errors. Here is a code which I believe does what you want:The comments should explain the changes. Main points:You cannot assign to a str (the st variable), because strs are immutable. Use lists instead, with each element being a single character (str of length 1).When you loop over a str, what you get are its characters, not the indices j you are looking for. I've used enumerate() which gives you both characters and indices.The last index in st is not len(st), but len(st) - 1, because Python's indexing is 0-based. Also, because Python supports negative periodic indexing, your whole if statement is not actually needed. Try leaving it out.
The first problem you are encountering is that j is a string and you cannot substract an integer from a string.The next problem you will encounter is that strings are immutable so you cannot set a given character of a string.Since a string is immutable, you will need to create a new one if you want to change even one character. In that case, it seems what you want to do is rotate your string by n. This can be achieved like this.
