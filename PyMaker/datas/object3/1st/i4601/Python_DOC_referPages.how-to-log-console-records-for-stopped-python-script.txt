I have the following code inside my script to create a log of console records every time the scrip is run:It works fine when the script's run finishes by itself, but if you interrupt it, no records that you see in the console get saved in a log file. How can I save records in a log file every time the script is run regardless if it was interrupted or not?
I think what you are looking for is the signal module.Let's say you're interrupting your code by pressing CTRL+C. What you need to do to perform anything after the interuption signal is received is the following:Basically, what happens is, as soon as CTRL+C is received (= the SIGINT signal), your callback is called and does whatever you want it to do.For more details, as always, the signal doc is really clear and helpful.Hope this helps!
