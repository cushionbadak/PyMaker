I have a csv file. I want to split the data by the trips taken that day. I tried creating a List of list of dictionaries. I am hoping maybe there is a better approach? My end goal is to use the get a distance summary from google distance api for the distance traveled that day.For example, for the below follow input:Input csv file:Expected data structure?:Attempt (not working):
Use itertools.groupby to group the rows using the date string. csv.DictReader allows to you return the csv rows as dicts with keys as the csv header: This returns a list of lists of dicts grouped by the dates. You may skip sorting step if the rows are already sorted by date.
I have never used the google api, but my suggestion for a simpler approach would be to use pandas.OutputsFrom this point I think it is much easier to get whatever formats you prefer. But the data frame seems very useful for your use case. I would add another column for distance traveled from last point and plug the result from the google api in. But that is just me.
