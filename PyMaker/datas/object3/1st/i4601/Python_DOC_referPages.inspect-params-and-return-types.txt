Is it possible using Python 3 syntax for declaring input parameters and return value types determine those types? Similarly to determining the number of parameters of a function?I would like to get str and int respectively.
The typing module has a convenience function for that:(the documentation)This is different from foo.__annotations__ in that get_type_hints can resolve forward references and other annotations stored in string, for instanceIt will be especially useful in Python 4.0, because then all annotations will be stored in string form.

inspect can be used:@vaultah's method looks even more convenient, though.
