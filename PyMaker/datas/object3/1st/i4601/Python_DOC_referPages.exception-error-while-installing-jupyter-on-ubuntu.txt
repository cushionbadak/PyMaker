While installing Jupyter I was almost done until at last something called exception appeared. I am very new to Ubuntu and Python so can't understand these things.While installing jupyter everything worked fine but finally I got some exceptions. I can't understand what are these.
You are receiving the error IOError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pandocfilters.py' because you are running pip install under a normal user.You can either run this same command with sudo pip install jupyter. This will give you root privileges when installing, or you can check out running this in a virtualenv. You can read up more on virtualenv at https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html.
