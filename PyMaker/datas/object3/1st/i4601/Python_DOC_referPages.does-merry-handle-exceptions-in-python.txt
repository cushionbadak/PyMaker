i was looking for more pythonic ways to handle errors in python and i found merryif you never heard of it here is the documentation : https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/merryso i wrote a little code using merry note that i changed path to raise FileNotFoundErrori thought merry would handle the error but instead i got this output:[merry] Exception caughtTraceback (most recent call last):   File  "C:\python36\lib\site-packages\merry.py", line 26, in wrapper      ret = f(*args, **kwargs)   File "C:/Users/User/Desktop/merrymerry.py", line 7, in  write_to_file      with open(filename,'w') as file_obj: FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory:  'C:/Users/j.sinjaradze/Desktop1/dataHere.txt'   File not foundis there anything i did wrong or its just merry does not work as i expected?
I think you misunderstood your output/how merry works. In your output you have:which indicates that merry caught the exception. Then comes the traceback of the exception, which merry outputs by default, followed bywhich is the result of yourso it all works just fineAppendix. Why does merry output the exception?In the source code of merry (see github you linked), there is this line (merry.py:46):self.logger is previously created from a logging.getLogger(logger_name) call and the exception function prints the message provided additionally to the traceback of a previously occured exception(see python logging documentation for details).From the source code I cannot see a way to change that behaviour without touching the source of merry.py
