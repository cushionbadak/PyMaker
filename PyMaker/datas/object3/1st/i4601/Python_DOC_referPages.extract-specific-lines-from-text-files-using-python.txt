Natural Text
Hello please see link below of previous solved post.Copy specific lines from text files into excelThis VBA code allowed me to open all the text files in a folders and load specific lines into an excel spreadsheet.However, I am now working with bigger files and more of them. Using VBA is no longer an option has it takes too long and how a data limit.I'm wondering if I there is any existing python code that can extract and specific lines from each data file and either save as a new document or save itself as its current file name.Sample code:Any tips on this would be higher appreciated. Thanks,Jon
May try this: Code above creates a sample file, then parse it:You may want to assemble data to a pandas dataframe for further numeric operations with it. 
try this:this part finds the line you should start retrive data from. then you can do whatever you like with the data. for exmaple:and to save the data somewhere just use python option to write to excel or any other file.Good luck!
