I am working on a signal processing application in python. I want call the same function using multiple threads in python, to achieve concurrent execution is it possible to do it? If so how?
Long story short : No, because of the Global Interpreter Lock.But you might want to consider using processes instead of threads, which appear to be your real need on your application (as far as one can understand from your explanations), since it seems you do not need to make use of a shared memory space.A (very) simple example:This example will give you the following output:To make good use of multiples processes, I recommend you learn a little about the documentation of the module, the GIL, the differences between threads and processes and, especially, how it can speed up or limit what you want to do and how.For example, going multiprocessing will not help you if your bottleneck is I/O, but will help if your processing is limited by your CPU.
