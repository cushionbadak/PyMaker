I've encountered an issue with my writing CSV program for a web-scraping project.I got a data formatted like this : Which I get from a loop that analyze a html page and return me this table.Basically, this table is ok, it changes every time I've done a loop.The thing now, is when I want to write every table I get from that loop into my  CSV file, it is just gonna write the same thing over and over again.The only element written is the first one I get with my loop and write it about 10 millions times instead of about 45 times (articles per page)I tried to do it vanilla with the library 'csv' and then with pandas.So here's my loop :and here my method to write into a csv file :I'm pretty new on writing CSV files and Python in general but I can't find why this isn't working. I've followed many guide and got more or less the same code for writing csv file.edit: Here's an output in an img of my csv fileyou can see that every element is exactly the same, even if my table changeEDIT: I fixed my problems by making a file for each article I scrap. That's a lot of files but apparently it is fine for my project.
