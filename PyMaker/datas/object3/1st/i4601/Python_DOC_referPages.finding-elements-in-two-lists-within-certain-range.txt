So I have two lists L1 is fomatted like this:I am trying to find pairs in both list that start with the same 4 characters i.e. xx:x and then return the indexes of the pairs for each list So far I have:This doesn't seem to return the correct indexes and it obviously doesn't return the index of the second list. Any help would be greatly appreciated. 
Here's how to make your code work. Keep in mind this is a naive solution, there are faster way to solve this if your lists are big. Runtime here is O(n^2) but this could be solved in linear time.Update: for future visitors here's an average linear time solution:
Because OP lists seem to have lots of repeated "firsts 4 characters", I would do something like the following:Then you can access your repeated entries as:This is better than O(n^2).edit: as someone pointed out in the comments this is assuming that the lists do share the same length.In case they don't, assume L2 is larger than L1, then after doing the above you can do:If L2 is shorter than L1 just change the variables names in the code shown.
You can use itertools.product to loop the Cartesian product.
Use the range() or enumerate() function in the for-loops to provide you loop index.For example, using the range() function:
enumerate is great for things like this.
I think the enumerate function is what you're looking for!Output
