Natural Text
I am reading some utf-8 encoded data from a file like so:You can recreate this with a simple line like As you can see, the trailing nul characters are not stripped - I assume this has something to do with '\x00' not being recognized by .strip() but everywhere I look seems to think it should be. What gives? How can I remove these characters without having to do something very clunky?I couldn't find a post which addressed this issue.
NULs are not whitespace, so strip() with no arguments will not strip them.  You should instead use strip('\0'):
