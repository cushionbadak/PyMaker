Should I use a loop to accomplish what I am looking for? 
If by "one-line" you just want everything on one line, then remove the slice operation.However, if you know that all your items have the same length and you want them on different lines:The above uses the step parameter of the range() function to skip over 8 elements. And the slice only uses that section to print them on separate lines.The following makes use of list comprehension to get your chunks and accomplish the same as above:
You don't have to use a for-loop, you can just make two print calls:
