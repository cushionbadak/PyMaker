Just a beginner in Python. I am trying to find the transpose of matrix without using numpy. My code is as shown:It says IndexError: list index out of range, from my understanding the loop terminates while index is incremented to 9 but I am not accessing arr_input[9], then why the error? Any help would be appreciated. Thank you.
This is what happens on the first iteration of your loop:Try it out in the REPL.So what happened?arr[0][0] = 1 means "set the first item of list arr[0] to be 1."arr[0] means "the first item of list arr."arr is an empty list; it does not have a first item. So the expression arr[0] for that program state is erroneous.How do we fix it? We need to make sure we create a list for each row.
You have to modify your code a bit for it to work properly.I can explain why you are getting IndexError: list index out of rangethrough this line of code you are trying to access jth row and ith column of the array arr but arr is just an empty array.so first you have to do this p.s: while assigning values in an empty array always use append() method to avoid "list index out of range error".Hope this will help you
