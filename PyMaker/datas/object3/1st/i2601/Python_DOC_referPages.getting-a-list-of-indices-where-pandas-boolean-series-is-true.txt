I have a pandas series with boolean entries.  I would like to get a list of indices where the values are True.For example the input pd.Series([True, False, True, True, False, False, False, True])should yield the output [0,2,3,7].I can do it with a list comprehension, but is there something cleaner or faster?
Using Boolean IndexingIf need a np.array object, get the .valuesUsing np.nonzeroUsing np.flatnonzeroUsing np.whereUsing np.argwhereUsing pd.Series.indexUsing python's built-in filterUsing list comprehension
