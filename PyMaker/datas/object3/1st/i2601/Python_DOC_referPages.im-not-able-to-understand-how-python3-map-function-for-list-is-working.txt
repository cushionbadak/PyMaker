I am trying to understand the map function on Python3. I wrote the below code:And I'm getting the below Output:Can anyone explain this in detail?
map yields the result of the transform function on a single element of the provided input iterable each time you pull a value from it. So on the first pull, it's yielding the result of list("66"); since str are iterables composed of len 1 strs (the individual characters of the string), list("66") produces a list of '6' and '6'. The next time, list("67") produces ['6', '7'], and so on.
Map receives as params a function and an iterable. So, it will iterate over the iterable and run the function for each element. That means it will run in order: list("66"); list("67"); list("68")list() is a pretty versatile function in Python, it will convert your string into an array of characters that create the string. That means "66" will get ["6", "6"]. Finally, your initial list will become a generator for the above mentioned lists, thanks to ShadowRanger for pointing this out.Additionally, you can check the official documentation for the map function
