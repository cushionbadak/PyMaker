I've read through the documentation on creating exceptions with pytest but am unsure on how to define the exception in my code. It is saying that OutOfRangeError is not defined. Any help is appreciated. my_roman_module.py:test_my_roman_module.py:
pytest doesn't create exception. If you have to define your custom exception then subclasss Exception likeand then you case raise OutOfRangeError exception, remember to import OutOfRangeError in your test_my_roman_module.py as well.
