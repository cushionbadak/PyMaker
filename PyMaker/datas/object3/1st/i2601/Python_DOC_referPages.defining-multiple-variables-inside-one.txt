Sorry I am new to python and I think I have seen someone, somewhere do something that resembled the following:There is a syntax error at the = of units=64,Can I do that? And if yes, do you know whats wrong?Thank you for any helpI am using Jupyter notebooks running python 3 
In your case hiddenLayerinput is a dictionary,you can use it as :Then you can acces it as : hiddenLayerinput["units"] , and you will get value of "units" : 64 
Python's dictionaries use {} and hence is identified as a dictionary, = is SyntaxError you get. You need to change all the =s to :sEdit - units, activation, input_dim are keys. If you have units, activation, input_dim as variables, you can remove the quotes and the values from those variables will be used as keys.Read more about dictionaries
