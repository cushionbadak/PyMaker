I have a list of strings like this:I want to sort the items, case-insensitive.So I want to get:But I get the opposite with sorted() or list.sort(), because uppercase appears before lowercase.How can I ignore the case? I've seen solutions which involves lowercasing all list items, but I don't want to change the case of the list items.
The following works in Python 2:It works for both normal and unicode strings, since they both have a lower method.In Python 2 it works for a mix of normal and unicode strings, since values of the two types can be compared with each other. Python 3 doesn't work like that, though: you can't compare a byte string and a unicode string, so in Python 3 you should do the sane thing and only sort lists of one type of string.Since python 3.3, there is also the str.casefold method that's specifically designed for caseless matching and can be used in place of str.lower:
In Python 3 str is unicode but in Python 2 you can use this more general approach which works for both str and unicode:
You can also try this:
In python3 you can use
I did it this way for Python 3.3:Then you just can call this function:
Try thisOutput['abel', 'Aden']
