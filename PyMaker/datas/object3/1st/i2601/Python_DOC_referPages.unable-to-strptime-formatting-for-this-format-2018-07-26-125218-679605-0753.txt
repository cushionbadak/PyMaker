Natural Text
I am using Python version 3.5. I am formatting the string 2018-07-26 12:52:18.679605-07:53 using this But it keeps on giving this errorPlease help.
why the tzinfo's delta can be 07:53?I think it should be 08:00 or any whole hours. Maybe you should check the time of the system which generated this time string.Or just abandon it if you know the timezone.
