Natural Text
After pressing enter the input stays there.For example:and output would be:But I want to display only the latter.I tried using getpass but it it necessary to show the text while typing and getpass hides it.What can I do ?

Depending on platform, you can move the cursor up a line before printing:The middle line moves thw cursor up and clears that line in POSIX terminals.On Windows, it's getting more complicated and you need some libraries to call Windows APIs to achieve this.
put both statements into one!This way, "My name is Alex" will be printed for Alex input. Also, Alex is assigned to "myName".EDIT: Obviously, this is only a workaround and does not answer your question specifically.
