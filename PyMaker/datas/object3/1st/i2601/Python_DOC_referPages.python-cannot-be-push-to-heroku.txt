I try to deploy a Django app to Heroku and the push get rejected. The result shows that : Push rejected, failed to compile Python app. From the error script, it seems that the model "ConfigParser' is not found.I google this problem and it seems that the other guy also have this problem (https://github.com/hashedin/squealy/issues/229). Is it true that Python 3.7 could not work in Heroku? How could I deal with it? Some part of the detailed command result scripts are as followed:The requirements.txt is as:
Any chance this could be a python3 import error on the import for the module ConfigParser?I hope this helps.This is Abe Karplus's answer: In Python 3, ConfigParser has been renamed to configparser for PEP 8 compliance. It looks like the package you are installing does not support Python 3.
