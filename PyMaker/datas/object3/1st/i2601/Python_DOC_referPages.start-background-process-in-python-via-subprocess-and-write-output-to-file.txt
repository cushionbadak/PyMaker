Dear stackoverflow users,I'm looking for a solution for a probably quite easy problem. I want to automate some quantum chemical calculations and ran into a small problem.Normally you start your quantum chemical programm (in my case it's called orca) with your input file (*.inp) on a remote server as a background process and pipe the output into an outputfile (*.out) viaor something similar.Now I wanted to use a python script (with some templating) to write the input file automatically. At the end the script should start the calculation in a way that I could log out of the server without stopping orca. I tried that withbut so far it did not work. How do I "emulate" the command given at the top with the subprocess module?RegardsUpdateI have one file that is called H2.xyz. The script reads and splits the filename by the point and creates an input file name H2.inp and the output should be written into the file H2.out.Update 2The input file is derived from the *xyz file viaand is created within the script via templating. In the end I want to run the script in the following way:
Why not simply:More info:Run Process and Don't Wait
Is the usage of subprocess important? If not, you could use os.system.The Python call would get really short, in your caseshould do the trick.
I had the same problem not long ago.Here is my solution:The OSError exception is pretty important since you never now what your OS might do wrong.For more on the communicate() command which actually starts the process read: https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.Popen.communicate
For me (Windows, Python 2.7) the method call works very fine like this:On Linux you maybe do not need shell=True for a list of arguments.
