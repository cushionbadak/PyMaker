Assume lastVariable holds "1\n 2\n 3\n". You can reassign 
Or use sys.stdout:
You're outputting a newline at the end of every iteration. Instead, you can output a newline at the beginning of every iteration, but only starting on the second iteration, when the mat list is not empty:
Just keep an if condition at the end of the loop to avoid newline for the last iteration.
OUTPUT
