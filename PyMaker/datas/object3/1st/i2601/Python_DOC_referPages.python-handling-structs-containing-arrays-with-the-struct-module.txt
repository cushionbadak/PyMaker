While the struct module makes handling C-like structures containing scalar values very simple, I donâ€™t see how to sensibly handle structs which contain arrays.For example, if I have the following C struct:and want to unpack its values and use the same variables (a1, a2, a3, d1, d2, i1, i2, i3) in Python, I run into the problem that struct just gives me every value in a tuple individually. All information about which values are supposed to be grouped in an array is lost:Instead, I have to slice and pull apart the tuple manually, which is a very tedious and error-prone procedure:Is there any better way of handling arrays with struct?
You can use construct library, which is pretty much wraps struct module and makes parsing and building binary data more convenient.Here is a basic example:
