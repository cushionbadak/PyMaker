Consider parsing the CSV file using the csv library -- real world CSVs can be surprisingly complicated.https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.htmlIf you're going down the manual path, consider running each line throughline.strip('"') to remove the trailing/leading quotes and splitting with line.split('","') or similar to not include the quotes in the centre, assuming your CSV is nicely formatted (if not, use the library).You can convert strings to numbers with int(x) and float(x): something like b2 = [int(b[0]), int(b[1]), float(b[2]) ought to help.You can convert date-text to datetime objects with datetime.strptime(date_string, format) -- see https://docs.python.org/2/library/datetime.html#strftime-strptime-behavior for more documentation, but you'll need %Y-%m-%d as your format string, I think.
Better to use CSV module to handle csv file.But this should help...
You can use a list comprehension with datetime.strptime, int and float. You can remove the double quotes in your strings via string slicing.Result
