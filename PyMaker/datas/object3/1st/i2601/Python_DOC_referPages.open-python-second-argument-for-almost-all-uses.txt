Natural Text
I'm new in Python and I'm creating a bot for a service called Discord, which maybe you know about.I'd like to store configurations for users who use the bot in files and I'm quite not understanding how does the second argument of the read() function work.I've read that depending on the letter you write, you will write the file, read it, etc.The thing is that I'm quite not understanding how does this work.If I have read properly, I think it is that mixing letters allows doing different actions.Can anybody help me out? What string should I need or should I make more than one .read() for that?I'd like to:If the file doesn't exist, create itAbility to read the fileAbility to overwrite the file, setting the entire file to what I insert, not appending it.If someone could help me out, I'd really like it! Thanks!
AFAIK there is no way to do this without opening the file in write mode, then closing the file after the writes are complete, then re-opening in read mode.In response to the section about opening in a specific mode where it overwrites the file, not append, but also creates the file if it doesn't exist, you're looking to open in wt+.I would expect that if you wanted to "trace" what was written previously, for logging lets says, we could create a new function as written above which handles the writing for us.Please let me know if there is anything unanswered and I will do my best to amend this for you.Expected output is below:I really disagree with storing the information in a text file, purely for overhead's sake. I believe it would be far more suitable to use a pre-existing storage system that is tried and tested. Like, MongoDB or go the whole-hog and set up a database in SQL and the relevant functions you need to store and write to it.
