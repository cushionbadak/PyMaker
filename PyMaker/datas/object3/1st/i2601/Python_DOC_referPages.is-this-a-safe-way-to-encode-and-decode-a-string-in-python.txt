I created a VERY simple password manager--not GUI. Basically my Python program generates a string of characters and I encode that password and then store the encoded form into an encrypted txt file. Now the catch is that I can take that encoded form and put it into my python program and it returns the original password. How safe is this? Also for whatever reason after encoding the password this is added to the password: “b’<--Password here-->’.” Now I am asking how difficult it would be for a malicious hacker to take the encoded form of the original password and get the original.Here is my encoding code:Now all I have to do to return the original password is make the following:And if this is not safe how can I encrypt a string using a specific keyword--almost like a master password.Thank you!Note** Below are some examples of the before encoding and after:
And if this is not safe how can I encrypt a string using a specific keyword--almost like a master password.Below snippet extracted from Python's hashlib.Is this what you are looking for?
