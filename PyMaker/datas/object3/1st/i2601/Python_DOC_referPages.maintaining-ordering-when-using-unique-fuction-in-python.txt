I have some code, where the following, say, are the columns of my df. I am trying to get the unique values of the letters, and numbers, but in the correct order. My code doesn't maintain the ordering and I cant figure out how to do so. Thank youexpected output:
You can use toolz.unique instead. This is identical to the unique_everseen recipe found in the itertools docs. Internally, it iterates while maintaining a set of seen items.A more Pandorable solution would be to convert the Index object to pd.Series and use drop_duplicates. This, again, uses hashing:
Assuming your example is representative, you can use a neat little trick that I got from Raymond Hettinger. In python 3.6 and later, dicts are ordered so you can use their keys as efficient ordered sets.
This one uses regex and would continue working in case you have multiple characters/numbers in your column names:
