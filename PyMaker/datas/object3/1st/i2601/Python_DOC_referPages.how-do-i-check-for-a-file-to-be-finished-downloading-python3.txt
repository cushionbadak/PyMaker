I am trying to figure out how to check if a download has been completed. Basically I want it to wait until the file is finished downloading then print: Download completed.Here is my current code and what I am trying to do with it:
When urlretrieve returns, the file has already finished downloading.See the usage example from the docs:As can be seen, the file is opened immediately after the call to urlretrieve, as it was already created and the content was already written there.
If you use the  urllib.request.urlretrieve reporthook option, you can monitor the progress of the download, especially useful with large files, like so:You can achieve something similar with the requests package as well.
