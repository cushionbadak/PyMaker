I have two INI files a , b like belowFile a.iniFile b.iniI want to compare the un commented keys of a.ini with un commented keys of b.ini. So If keys are matched then I want copy the values of matched keys of a.ini to b.ini without disturbing the comments because this is well structured file. If the new keys are present in a.ini then that key, values blindly copy to b.ini. and when we write the matched keys of values to b.ini the position of keys should not change.so the final output will be like belowI have followed the below way but it worked until read data of two INI files and print matched dictionary key-pairs.
Your last loop isn't quite right.  for x in y & z doesn't work the way you think it does.  Also, you have to use and instead of &.Try this instead:
You can use the following codeUpdateIn case you want union of all keys from both files, you can first create a union of both key sets and then iterate over that to form the file. See code below. Here, val2 or val1 is used to make sure that we prefer the second file's value over the first file's one. You shall use val1 or val2 if you need to prefer first file's value over the second one.
