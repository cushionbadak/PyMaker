Natural Text
I have been searching for a way that could read gz file in python, and I did something likeHowever, it seems like the read-in data is byte-like and I cannot do something like for l in infile. Is there a way to solve this?
Pass mode='rt' (text mode) to the gzip.open call.From the documentation (linked above):The mode argument can be any of 'r', 'rb', 'a', 'ab', 'w', 'wb', 'x' or 'xb' for binary mode, or 'rt', 'at', 'wt', or 'xt' for text mode. The default is 'rb'.
