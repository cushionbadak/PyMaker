This question already has an answer here:How to properly overload the __add__ method?                    1 answer                This is showing me:What's the problem?  I am not getting it.
The purpose of overloading magic methods like __add__ in python is to define custom functionality in your __add__ method, but not to change it's basic purpose. The __add__ method corresponds to the + operator, which is used as an operator between two variables. In other words 2 + 2 is basically saying 2.__add__(2). You defined your method as:So you're adding a third variable to the magic method therefore 2 + 2 is basically 2.__add__(2, missing_var), which is why it's telling you that a parameter is missing. I would recommend changing this definition to: If you really want to overload your method, and then your print method will work as expected. If you really need a method to add three variables then define another method in the class, but overloading __add__ typically isn't a good solution. 
The signature of __add__ must be __add__(self, other), not __add__(self,one,two).  The left-hand argument to + is the self argument, and the right-hand argument is the other argument to __add__.
