Say I want to implement a metaclass that should serve as a class factory. But unlike the type constructor, which takes 3 arguments, my metaclass should be callable without any arguments:For this purpose I defined a custom __new__ method with no parameters:But the problem is that python automatically calls the __init__ method with the same arguments as the __new__ method, so trying to call MyMeta() ends up throwing an exception:Which makes sense, since type can be called with 1 or 3 arguments. But what's the correct way to fix this? I see 3 (4?) options:I could add an empty __init__ method to my metaclass, but since I'm not sure if type.__init__ does anything important, this might not be a good idea.I could implement an __init__ method that calls super().__init__(cls.__name__, cls.__bases__, vars(cls)).I could use a meta-metaclass and override its __call__ method, rather than messing with __new__ and __init__.Bonus option: Maybe I shouldn't try to change the signature?So my question is: Are the 3 solutions I listed correct or are there any subtle bugs hidden in them? Which solution is best (i.e. the most correct)?
An interface deviating from the parent signature is a questionable design in regular classes too.  You don't need the extra complexity of metaclasses to get into this kind of mess - you can cause the same new/init jumble by subclassing a datetime or whatever. I want to have a metaclass and an easy way to create instances of that metaclass. The usual pattern in Python is to write a factory using a from_something classmethod.  To take the example of creating datetime instances from a different init signature, there is for example datetime.fromtimestamp, but you have many other examples too (dict.fromkeys, int.from_bytes, bytes.fromhex...)There is nothing specific to metaclasses here, so use the same pattern:Usage:
