How should I debug such exceptions within exceptions? What about exceptions within exceptions within exceptions ...?
As I see it, you have a few options then. You can either move your try-except into f(x), print a descriptive error in your g() try-except and drop into pdb, or re-raise your exception after logging your friendly error message. I'm not a fan of relying on uncaught exceptions to debug (option 3), so here's what option 1 and 2 look like:Output:or:Output:
Actually re-raising the exception (option 3 in wholevinski's answer) solves my problem, since it does not require me to modify function f. Here is the code:Pdb output of the stack:
