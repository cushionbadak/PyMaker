I'm making an analog clock program with pygame, datetime, and math, but the angles that the hands are at are all off, and the second hand goes way too quickly. Here's the code:
There are two problems:The angles that you pass to math.cos and math.sin have to be in radians not degrees, so you have to convert them with math.radians.x = clock_radius * (3 / 5) * math.cos(math.radians(90 - now_hour * 30)) + 200Pygame's y-axis is inverted, so pass the negative angle to math.sin.y = clock_radius * (3 / 5) * math.sin(-math.radians(90 - now_hour * 30)) + 200You can also simplify the code by filling the screen with white each frame and redrawing the circles and hands, then you don't have to calculate the previous hands to erase them. Also, a while loop was missing. Here's the updated main function:
