Natural Text
I want to capitalize the first letter of the string and the letter after every space.This seems like it should work:It returns 'hello world' every time.If I just use  ^(.)  or \s(.)  it works fine but combining the two with the or pipe causes issues.How can I harness the sub function to allow use of or statements?
Your regex r'^(.) | \s(.)' does not work because of the literal spaces contained within it. You can delete those spaces:Or, you can use the re.X flag to ignore those spaces:In such a case, you should replace (.) with a ([a-z]) so you are actually capturing a word-like lower-case character rather than just any character such as the second space of multiple spaces:Or, use a \b word boundary zero-width assertion:Or, (simpler and faster) use .title():
You have too many extra spaces in your regex, you can just use this:Spaces in regex matters. If you have a space, that means you want to match literal one space characterOnline DemoDepending on your situation, str.title() might be a better solution to your problem.
You don't need regex for this if you're triggering after spaces - just use the .title() function of the string class and a list comprehension to keep it one line if you need to.  You can alternatively break this into a for loop if you're not comfortable with list comprehensions.And the result is:'Hello World'In a for loop it's similar:
