I have a python script which dump yaml file every second while running. However, I found sometimes the yaml file is not completed. My guess is it is coincidence that at the same time I am closing the progress (the script is running in Windows commend line), while the file is saving. Sample code as following:How to avoid this problem? or is there a method like destructor function in python, so that we can do something when the program is being closed? (It seems that 'with' does not fully work here)
The atexit module is made just for this purpose.https://docs.python.org/3/library/atexit.html Just beware that it only works for normal termination of the script (ctrl + c is considered normal), and it won't work if you app suddenly crashes or you have to force close it.
