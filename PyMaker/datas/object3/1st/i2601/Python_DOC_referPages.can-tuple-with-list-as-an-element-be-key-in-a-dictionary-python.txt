Can tuple with list as an element which can be modified at any stage be key in a dictionary?
Tuples are hashable, and therefore usable as dict keys, if and only if all of their elements are hashable.This is what you're intuitively expect, and it's easy to test:But if you want to know where it's documented, it's in the Immutable Sequence Types section of the Sequence Types â€” list, tuple, range docs:The only operation that immutable sequence types generally implement that is not also implemented by mutable sequence types is support for the hash() built-in.This support allows immutable sequences, such as tuple instances, to be used as dict keys and stored in set and frozenset instances.Attempting to hash an immutable sequence that contains unhashable values will result in TypeError.
