This question already has an answer here:My regex is matching too much. How do I make it stop?                    5 answers                I'm using Python 3 and working with title strings that have a bracketed tag with a pair of names separated by a +. Like this: [John+Alice] A title here.I've been using the regex expression re.search('\[(.+)\]', title) to get the tag [John+Alice], which is fine, but it's a problem when encountering a title with more than one bracketed tag:That gives me [John+Alice] [Hayley + Serene], when I would prefer [John+Alice] and [Hayley + Serene]. How can I modify the regex to give me all bracketed tags that have + between [ and ]? Thanks.
You need to make your regex non-greedy, like this:OutputIf you must include the brackets use finditer:OutputThe non-greedy qualifiers such as *?, +?, ?? match as little text as possible. You can find more about greedy vs non-greedy in here.ObservationIn the question you mentioned that you are using '\[(.+)\]' to match all bracketed tags that have + between [ and ], but actually it does a little more than that. For instance, for the following example:returns:consequently, my modification (using finditer) gives:Therefore [No plus text] is incorrect, to fix that you should use something like:Output
