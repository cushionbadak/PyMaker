I created an AI in python/pygame but even after spending hours of debugging, I could not find why the individuals(dots) are not getting mutated. After few generations, all the individuals just overlap each other and follow the same exact path. But after mutation they should move a little bit differently.Here is what a population size of 10 looks like after every 2-3 generations..Image 1 Image 2 Image 3As you can see, just after few generations they just overlap and all the individuals in the population move together, following exact same path! We need mutations!!!I would be really grateful to you if you could find any mistake. Thank!I saw the code from: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOZfhUcNiqk&tand tried to make it in python. Here's my codeThanks for any help!
I didn't go through the whole code, but over hereyou are trying to assign a new value to i (which is an iterater), so it won't change anything, which explains why you'r having trouble with the mutations.You should have something like this:or you can use list comprehensions https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions
