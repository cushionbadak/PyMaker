I have the following code. I am pulling files from a directory and trying to check if they were created in the past 24hrs but I can't seem to figure out the right time or datetime functions to use to be able to compare the create time against the from and to dates:  
There are two problems with this:First, you're constructing a time object, which represents a:time of day, independent of any particular dayIn other words, it represents something like "10:30:00.000", not "2018-Aug-29 10:30:00.000". So, that isn't much use if you want to find files that are "newer than yesterday". What you want is a datetime object.Second, you can't just throw some random value at the constructor and hope it's the right thing.The getctime function is:a number giving the number of seconds since the epochThe time constructor takes:And the datetime constructor takes:So, you have a number of seconds, and you're trying to use that as an hour or a year.The function you want to use is fromtimestamp:Return the local date and time corresponding to the POSIX timestampSo, what you want is:Also, be aware that what getctime returns is:the systemâ€™s ctime which, on some systems (like Unix) is the time of the last metadata change, and, on others (like Windows), is the creation timeSo, using that for something named create_time is at best non-portable and Windows-specific, and at worst (if you're not actually on Windows) wrong.Also:You're subtracting -1 days, which is the same as adding 1 day.So, instead of looking for files less than 24 hours old, you're looking for files more than 24 hours in the future. Either use +, or use days=1.While we're at it:Instead of creating the timestamp object twice and doing two separate comparisons, why not just use a chained comparison?Or, maybe better, move the construction out of the test:
