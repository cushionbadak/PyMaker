Let's suppose I have the following list of dicts:I need to retrieve from this list two dicts where the key a = 1How I can reach the desired result?
You can use itertools.islice to avoid iterating through the whole input list after you've already found the two dicts you need
I'd go for a clear solution:Assuming there are two dicts you can unpack them:Otherwise just take as many as there are:Each step does one thing and is very readable.If you want this step for more keys and values you can use a closure:And then:And the rest is the same.
