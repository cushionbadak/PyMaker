AttributeError: 'ZipFile' object has no attribute 'tell' errorWhat is wrong here? (zipf is my zipfile)if I modify the code like this;I get TypeError: coercing to Unicode: need string or buffer, ZipFile foundI created zip file like;
Your zipfile is created with zipf = zipfile.ZipFile(zipfilename, mode='w'). Following the zipfile documentation, the tell() attribute is only defined for mode='r'.There is no reason to use a zipfile object, moreover in write mode, to upload a file (be it zip or whatever) that we want read, in order to upload it to S3.Just use open(zipfilename, 'r') before calling send_file() on the key.
