Im using Networkx pyhton library. Im tried to test a project which define the following fucntion:The above code generates an exception:in fact the following two lines:we get the following error:So when i call the function _set_up_p0 i get the above exception. Where is my error if you have detected it please
When you ask a list for the index of a particular element it performs a linear search from the beginning to find the first matching element. This is slow. It's also error prone as identical nodes will be missed as only the first would be found.Instead of converting to a list you could enumerate the nodes. This will generate a sequence of indices and nodes.You can also convert source to a set if it isn't already, to make lookup more efficient:edit: alternatively, you can create p_0 in one line using a list comprehension, so you don't need the index as there is an implicit one to one correlation with node position:
It depends on the networkx version you are using. More info here.networkx 1.xnetworkx 2.xAs you can see in networkx2.x you don't have a list but a NodeView.You can convert to a list with list(G.nodes()).
