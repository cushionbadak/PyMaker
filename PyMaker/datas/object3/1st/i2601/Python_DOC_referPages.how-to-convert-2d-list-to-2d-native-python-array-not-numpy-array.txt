I want to convert python 2d list,topython3 array.array type,The most important challenge is I wont import numpy. So I cant use np.asarray(). I have also used array.fromlist() and array.extend(). Both methods are creating an array of single dimension.But I want to convert multi dimension list to multi dimension array.Is there any way?
What you're asking is not possible.  From the array docs:This module defines an object type which can compactly represent an array of basic values: characters, integers, floating point numbers ...  The type is specified at object creation time by using a type codeThe only supported types are as follows (notice the absence of list):It seems like you might be confusing the array module, with a native implementation of numpy arrays.  This is not the case.
