I have the following python code:Now I want to pass two values value1 and value2 to the cost function.The networkx documentation says the weight can be a callable that accepts exactly 3 arguments. But i need value1 and value2 for calculations. How can this be done?EditThe solution using functools works well. However, my function is in a class as follows:Using this approach, nx.dijkstra_path insists upon assigning src to self. Thus the interpreter complains that self is assigned multiple values.I need self for calculating the cost.
You just need a function that wraps cost. A quick way is to use functools.partial.
This depends largely on the meaning on the meaning of value1 and value2. I would suggest adding a wrapper callable by networkx:And provide it to networkx:Or simply make them global variables, not arguments.
