Natural Text
I would like to convert every other letter of a string into uppercase. For example provided the input is 'ahdjeryu', the result should be 'AhDjErYu'.I was trying this:The error thrown as:     if i%2==0:TypeError: not all arguments converted during string formatting
Several issues with your code:You only need to use str.split to remove whitespace. Here, not necessary.To extract the index of a letter as well as the letter, use enumerate.return will return just one letter. You can instead yield letters and then use str.join on the generator.Here's a working example:The above logic can be equivalently implemented via a generator comprehension:
Your i is a string of one character, not an index. So you can't do i%2. Use enumerate to get both the index and the value.
Yes, it error, cause i now is letter not a number, so it can't mod for 2.Im not sure syntax about looping by for in Python but may you can try:Hope it can help you!Fix me if I have any wrong. Thanks
@Abhi, this is inline with your original logic. You need r to get the index of the letters in the string.
