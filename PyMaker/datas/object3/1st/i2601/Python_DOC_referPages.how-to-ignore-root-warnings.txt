I generate monochromatic images and save them using imageio.imwrite. Every time I save a file I get a following warning:I don't care for this "lossy conversion". Everything looks well and works fine. However, every ~100 generated images I got different warning which I want to catch. Thus I want to ignore the above one.I tried to ignore it, but even if I callbeforehand I still get this warning.
The library doesn't use the warnings module. Instead, it logs a message using the logging framework, by calling the top-level logging.warning() function. See the imageio.core.util._precision_warn() function:This is... unfortunate, as you can't easily disable this using the logging API. Best practice is to use a dedicated named logger for libraries.As such, it is probably best to patch the library no make the above function a no-op:You could also silence all logging, adjusting configurion on the root logger. This is not ideal, as you may want to use logging yourself or use third-party libraries that are better behaved.I've filed an issue with the project to ask them to fix their logging story.
