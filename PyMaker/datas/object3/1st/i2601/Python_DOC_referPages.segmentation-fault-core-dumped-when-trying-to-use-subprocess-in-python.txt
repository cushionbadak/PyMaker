I am trying to run a program many times in parallel (with different arguments). I searched online and found that subprocess in python is a good way to do that. My code is the following:I am getting Segmentation Fault(core dumped) if I am trying to run more than 56 subprocesses. My machine has 56 CPU's and and each CPU has 12 cores. How can I run more than 56 subprocesses, or maybe use threads?Thanks.
1) As @danielpryden already suggested don't invoke a shell:2) When reaching the maximum number of threads, it waits until all threads have finished, quite inefficent. What you seemingly try to achieve is exactly what multiprocessing.pool.Pool does:3) The segmentation fault isn't caused by your Python application, but rather from whatever program you try to execute. If it's C++ have a look at std::thread::hardware_concurrency; You need to change the program code not your python script.
