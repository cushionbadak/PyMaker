I would like to mock a method which is in the init.py, but actually it is not working. There is an example to demonstrate the issue and how I tried to write the unit test:The code under test: src.main.myfile:The a_plus_b is in the __init__.py in the src.main.utils module:The unittest:The unit test prints the "a + b", and not the side effect. Could anyone help me out what I did wrong?
The name you need to patch isn't src.main.utils.a_plus_b, but src.main.myfile.a_plus_b, since that is what method_under_test uses.
