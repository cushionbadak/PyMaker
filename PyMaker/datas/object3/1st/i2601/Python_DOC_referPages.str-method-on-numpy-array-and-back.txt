Is there any built-in method to get back numpy array after applying str() method, for example,Following two methods don't work:Update 1:Unfortunatelly i have very big data already converted with str() method so I connot reconvert it with some other method.
The main issues seem to be separators and newlines characters. You can use np.array2string and str.splitlines to resolve them:Note that without any arguments np.array2string behaves like str.If your string is given and unavoidable, you can use this hacky method:As per @hpaulj's comment, one benefit of np.array2string is ability to specify threshold. For example, consider a string representation of x = np.arange(10000).str(x) will return ellipsis, e.g. '[   0    1    2 ..., 9997 9998 9999]'np.array2string(x, threshold=11e3) will return the complete string
You can do that with repr:
