Let's say I have a stringand I want to run a re-search on it...To my knowledge, I should be searching any character (including newline characters) until hitting a } in the string and grouping everything between the = and it.Why am I getting None as the result?
Inside a character class the dot matches a literal dot so your regex would match one or more times a dot or a whitespace character ([.\s]+) in a capturing group.You could match not a } using a negated character class:some_var =([^}]+)}Regex demoExplanationsome_var = Match literally( Capturing group[^}]+ Match not a } one or more times using a negated character class (including newlines)) Close capturing group} Match }Demo
Because . doesn't match any character including newline -- in fact it matches any character except newline. See:https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.htmlYou have to use DOTALL mode.I'm not sure what your intention is with [.\s]. It looks like "any character plus whitespace". But whitespace is a character, so you can just say "any character". I think this probably suffices:P.S. str is a built-in. Don't call variables str.
