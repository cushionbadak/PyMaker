The requirement is to pass the parameters in a list to the sql query present in python code  I did the following:  But it seems that the parmist.yr_range[3] is just taking 2018. Instead of taking whole list of yr_range = [2015,2016,2017,2018]It's just taking the last value i.e. 2018  How can I pass the whole list as a variable in the query?Update_1:I tried the following:The above is not working when I tried to execute it through the python code. But executing when using pandas as:Any hint why it's not working?
I think the error is just somewhere in how you were formatting your query string. It seems wrong in both cases but maybe the pandas query is handling it. This makes the query a bit easier to follow.  And you need to specify what the parameters are if you use the ? for the b.range values in the WHERE clause. I took them out because I am not sure how you were intending to use them. The .format() function replaces what is {} in the string to be the years as a comma separated string value.
