Natural Text
I am trying to create a random order generator. I have a list of ten names and want to write a program that returns the same list in a random order. Here is my code which I'm told has invalid syntax in line 11 .I am trying to complete the problem using filtering and recursion to further my understanding of these tools.
random.shuffle() is what you are looking for.
