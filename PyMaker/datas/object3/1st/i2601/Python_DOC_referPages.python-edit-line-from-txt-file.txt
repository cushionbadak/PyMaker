Natural Text
I'm making program that open txt file and replace first 0 with 1 of given line. Now it only print the edited line, but I want that it prints all the lines. I'm using python 3.1.Text file:
You need to write each unchanged line to the savefile:
Did you try something like this:Output(./test.txt):You can read the file and save it to a list. Then you can then perform a certain action for each item(or for a specific element) in the list and save the result in the same file. You don't need of .tmp file or to remove and rename a file. Edit:There is an another approach with fileinput (thanks to @PeterWood)
