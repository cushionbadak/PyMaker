I have the following code that creates a csv file (sw_mac_addr.csv).  Right now it writes each line that I want.  I need it to separate the values with a comma (,).a single line from the infile looks like this:* 51       0000.0c9f.f033    static    0          F    F  sup-eth2I want it to appear in the csv file like this:51,0000.0c9f.f033,sup-eth2
Pandas can do this well
output (both on console and csv file):output with uncommented line of code (line = line.replace("*";"").replace("+","")
