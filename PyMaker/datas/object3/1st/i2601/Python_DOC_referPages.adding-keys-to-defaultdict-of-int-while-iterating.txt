Natural Text
The script needs to read input from a text/csv file but as soon as I try and implement the functionality, everything breaks. Here is my code:Also, the expected output that I need to have is:I just can't seem to figure out how to get to this step. I checked most parts of my code with print statements and it seems the dictionary is working correctly but it is not printing the last team and it's score (Grouches, 0 pts).I am currently getting this output:Any help would be greatly appreciated!
Well done for getting this far. You have managed to implement the logic, but have got stuck with a specific behaviour of defaultdict. There are 2 main points to note:If a key is not initialized with defaultdict, it won't be added to the dictionary. You can do this simply by adding 0 to a non-initialized key.For the specific formatting you require, you can use enumerate in a loop after sorting.Putting these together, amend your loop as below:Then use enumerate in a loop. You can use operator.itemgetter and f-strings (the latter in Python 3.6+) to make your logic cleaner:
have you tried the CSV python lib? Extracted from the doc (https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html): 
To the code breaking on adding CSV. CSV reader does the split(',') for you. So your left_team = row[0] and right_team = row[1] So your code changes to something likeYou can go for plaintext reading if you want to manually split(',').
