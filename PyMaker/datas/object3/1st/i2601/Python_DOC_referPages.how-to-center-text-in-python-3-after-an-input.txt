Natural Text
I can't really find anything that really helps online so I thought I'd ask myself.  I have the following code:I want the print statement to be centered on whatever console it is being ran on.  Thanks for the help!
There are two parts to this.First, you need to get the console width. You do that with shutil.get_terminal_size.Since it isn't always possible to get the console widthâ€”for that matter, there might not even be one (e.g., if your program's standard output is redirected to a file and doesn't even have a terminal), it will fall back to 80 columns (although you can override that if you want):Now you just center the string in that width. The fact that the string includes user input doesn't matter. Once you concatenate "Hello " and username, you've got a str that works the same as any other string object. So:If it's possible that the user's input will be too long to fit on one line, you want to wrap it first, then center the lines. You can use the textwrap module for that:
You can use os.get_terminal_size().columns to get the number of columns in the terminal and then print the necessary spaces to centralise your text:Some improvements (as pointed out by abarnert):shutil.get_terminal_size is more reliable than os.get_terminal_size.You can use s.center(...) for more readability.Which gives a neater solution:
