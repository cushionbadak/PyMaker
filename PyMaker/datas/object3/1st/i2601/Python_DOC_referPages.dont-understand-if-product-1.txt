I am doing python exercises from 'w3resource'. The exercise is 'Write a Python function to find a distinct pair of numbers whose product is odd from a sequence of integer values.'.The code is shown as followed. I don't understand the whole block of "if product & 1". The sign '&' seems set.intersection but not sure. Meanwhile, why do both 'return True' and 'return False' appear? Can anyone explain? Thanks.
product & 1 means check whether product is odd, because the last digit of binary representation of an odd number always is 1 while for an even number is 0. Seems like you don't really know the meaning of &. & is a bitwise operator. Here's how to calculate 5 & 9:1) transform 5 to binary representation (5)10 = (101)22) transform 9 to binary representation (9)10 = (1001)23) for every binary digit, & with two 1 is 1 otherwise 0. So
