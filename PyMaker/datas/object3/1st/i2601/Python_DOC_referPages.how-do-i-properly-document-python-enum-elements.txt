This question already has an answer here:How do I put docstrings on Enums?                    2 answers                I understand that I can add a Python docstring to an enum type as I would any other class. But how do I add documentation to an element of that type?As far as I can see there are three possibilities:But none of them really work consistently.If I call print(inspect.getdoc(MyEnum.a)) in any of the variants, the docstring of the MyEnum type is returned ('This is my enum type'). Pycharm can show variant 3 in its Quick Documentation preview, but includes the quotes and longer comments that exceed the column wrap will not be shown correctly.Is there a preferred way or convention on how to document Python enum elements?
If the values themselves are not important, see How do I put docstrings on Enums?.  If the values are important you can either customize that answer or use the aenum1 library:which results in:However, I do not know which, if any, IDEs support using Enum member doc strings.1 Disclosure:  I am the author of the Python stdlib Enum, the enum34 backport, and the Advanced Enumeration (aenum)  library.
