Natural Text
I'm trying to check input for a few conditions then converting the string into an integer, after this I want to make sure the integer is not negative otherwise prompt the user to input again.it works with the string conditions , but when I type in a negative number input throws an error "input expected at most 1 arguments, got 2" any ideas on how to evaluate this ?
sh4dowb already identified your error - you are giving 2 parameters to to input([prompt]) - which only accepts 1 text input as prompt. Beside that, there is lots of room for improvement:You could use error handling with validation. Also string formating comes in handy: Derive two custom errors from ValueError - we raise them if validation does not work out.Code:Output (lines spaced):Suggested read:Asking the user for input until they give a valid response
input function does not take 2 parameters, while print does. You can do it like this;
