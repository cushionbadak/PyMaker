I would like to pass default argument in my class, but somehow I am having problem:if I type.I get following error:--------------------------------------------------------------------------- AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call  last)  in ()  ----> 1 Pizza.ingredientsAttributeError: type object 'Pizza' has no attribute 'ingredients'edit:with class instance I got following error:--------------------------------------------------------------------------- TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call  last)  in ()  ----> 1 my_order = Pizza() in init(self, ingredients, meat)TypeError: 'list' object is not callableedit 2: quick check with dir yields following:there is meat but not ingredients
From the dataclasses.field docs:The parameters to field() are:default_factory: If provided, it must be a zero-argument callable that  will be called when a default value is needed for this field. Among  other purposes, this can be used to specify fields with mutable  default values, as discussed below. It is an error to specify both  default and default_factory.Your default_factory is not a 0-argument callable but a list, which is the reason for the error:Use a lambda function instead:
For complex datatypes i tend to abbreviate like so:
This approach doesn't use the typing or dataclasses module, but you may want to try something like the following:I could have set the arguments in __init__ to their defaults, but I think this may cause conflict in referencing the same list.
