I'm currently on Ubuntu 16.04 that I created through Digitalocean Droplet.I'm trying to run a simple flask application. I'm following this GUIDEHowever, I'm stuck on this step You can run the Flask app simply by running the following command: when I try running python app.py, I get the following...Also, flask is already installed.While the environment is active, I get the below stack trace when I run python app.py
@Abhilash looks like the problem isn't the code, it's about the setup. By default, Python will look for flask environment configurations in the home directory, which generally is stored in the .env file. In your case that is the virtual environment. Hence the error.Follow the steps below:Go to your user's document directory, e.g.Create a separate folder for your flask application:Go into the above directory:Create Virtual Environment here:Activate this virtual environment:It should show the something like below:Install Flask:Put the flask app file created in the current folder, i.e., app.py file.Run the application:This will start the flask app on flask's default port 5000, and will display something like below in the terminal:NOTE: Try to avoid creating a virtual environment in the home directory, if you have to then use some other name like .venv or venv. So that it won't conflict with the default configurations.
