everybody.I am currently working to merge the csv files.For example, you have files from filename1 to filename100.I used the following code to combine 100 files and the following error occurred:I'll put the code up first.    import csvAnd the following error occurred when the above file was executed:I've been working on it for a few days, and I don't know what to do.
The file object doesn't have next method. Instead use next(f) to skip the first line
The method "next()" in csv library is updated to next() in python 3. you can see the details in this link : https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html
