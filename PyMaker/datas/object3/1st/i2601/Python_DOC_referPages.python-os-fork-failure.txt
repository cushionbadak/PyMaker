In python, I am using os.fork() within a for condition. I am doing something like this:How do I simulate a failure of os.fork() so that I can be sure that "In parent process" is not printed? How to simulate OSError for os.fork() function? 
You can just replace os.fork() with your own implementation:If this is part of a test, have a look at the unittest.mock module.
