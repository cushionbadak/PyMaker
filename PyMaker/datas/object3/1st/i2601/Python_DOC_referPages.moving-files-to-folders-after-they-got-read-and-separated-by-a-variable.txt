I have created a python script that reads a variable FILTER from files in a folder and puts the result on screen. However, there are 4 types of variables and I would like this script to separate them all to the corresponding folders. Like move all of the files to a folder named "V" if they have variable FILTER = V, if they have FILTER = B, then move all of the B ones to folder named "B" The script below works to see which files have which filter on screen.Result on screen:now with shutil the code i run;Now this code works without problem but it moves all the files in Desktop/old/ to Desktop/new/B/ however, some files have b = V and other variables so what is the problem here? How can I specify the names of which files have the filters I desired so that it can automatically move?so it is like from the code above, if c= FILTERNAME1 move to SOMEFOLDER1 if c = FILTERNAME2 move to SOMEFOLDER2 and so on.. I could not write a working code line for this so any help would be appreciated a lot.Solution;
You can use the shutil module to move files.Define the source file and the destination files as strings, then pass them to shutil.move() like so:I would also recommend that you learn how if statements work.
