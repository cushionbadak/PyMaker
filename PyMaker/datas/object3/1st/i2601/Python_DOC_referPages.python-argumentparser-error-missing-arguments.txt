I'm trying to run this code :And I get this error : I've tried to look into the ArgumentParser documentation (here), but couldn't find my answer. Could someone help me ?
You must launch the application providing the arguments indicated in the error message. In your code, both arguments are required. Hence, you must supply them to run the application.Here is what it may be expectingNote, the <query> and <dir> above are fillers. You must provide a query inline with applications definition of a query. The -o flag indicates a requirement to pass a directory. Hence, it could be as simple as ./output or something between these lines.
You set the required option to true:(** added for visibility)writinginstead, should fix the problem. Unless of course you want them to be required, then you have to call the script with the arguments.
