I would like to have several scripts running on PythonAnywhere. In order to make sure that the scripts are not killed I would like to check for their status in an interval of five minutes (based on https://help.pythonanywhere.com/pages/LongRunningTasks/). Two questions arise:1. In the script which runs every five minutes I would like to check whether the other scripts (script2, script3) are still alive or not. If not, I would obviously like to run them. But how do I run several scripts from one script (script1) without script1 getting "stuck"? I.e. how do I start two scripts at the same time from one script?If I just try to run the script using "import script2" I get an errorImportError: No module named script2How do I tell Python that the script is in a different folder (because that has to be the issue)?Thanks in advance!
