Im making this game that you guess the number, and it gives you hints to what that number is. I made this for the hint system.How would I make it so if there was a duplicate hint was chosen with g = randint(1,3), it would go to another unused hint? Thanks :) . 
Your mistake is in using separate variables for your hints. Put them in a list instead, so you can use random.shuffle():random.shuffle() puts the hints list in random order, and repeated hints.pop() calls will pick the next available hint, in random order. Note that now there is no need to keep separate hint flags anymore either, when the hints list is empty, the user is out of hints.As a side note: there is no point in using == True in boolean tests. if already tests for boolean truth, adding == True is redundant (and when you must test for a boolean object only you'd use is True as True and False are singletons).
You could put the hints in a list and then select a random entry in the list and then remove it from the list.Or as Martijn suggested in the comments, shuffle it once and then pop from it.
