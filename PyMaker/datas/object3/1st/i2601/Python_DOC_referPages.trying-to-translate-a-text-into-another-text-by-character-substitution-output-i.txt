Natural Text
I am writing a code and i am not getting the desired output.It would be great if anyone can help me by pointing out what i am doing wrong.My code is:Here according to me i am supposed to be getting the corrected_word but instead it is giving its length to be 0 ,i.e, it is just what i had defined it initially,i.e, empty string
Your problem is that your loop operates on for i in range(len(shift)-1): where you ment to use for i in range(len(word_original )-1):.Iterating by index over a string is not needed here, you could simply go for But this will get you out of bounds error if your text contains '/' as your index is now outside of  keyboard_characters length. Also you do not handle non-existent mappings (f.e. space) for which find will return a value thats probably not correct.Fix of your code: Strings are immutables. by using s = s + "..." you are creating lots of throw-away strings wich takes perfomance. Use a list instead and ''.join(mylist) afterwards to get the string. Better way to solve this task:What you try to code already has a solution using python - for replacing something, dicts are great as you mapp a key to a value. For strings there are even convenience functions that build the dict for you:Readup:str.translate()str.maketrans()If a character is not present in the lookup, it is used as is (space f.e.)Output:
