I am learning subprocess to open multimedia ".mkv" files,Firstly, I test:All that happened was the prompt usage message.Then, I tried:It worked and opened the target file immediately,I noticed that the first option of [] is preferable than the latter "string" option.What's the problem with the [] option failing to open a file?
From the subprocess.Popen Constructor (Docs):The shell argument (which defaults to False) specifies whether to use the shell as the program to execute. If shell is True, it is recommended to pass args as a string rather than as a sequence.
