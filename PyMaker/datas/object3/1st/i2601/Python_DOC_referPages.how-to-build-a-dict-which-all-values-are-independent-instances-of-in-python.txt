This question already has an answer here:List of lists changes reflected across sublists unexpectedly                    12 answers                even copied [] not works:dict(zip(keys, [[][:]]*len(keys)))dict(zip(keys, [copy.deepcopy([])]*len(keys)))the {1: [100], 2: [], 3: []} is what I wanted exactly.
Try a list comprehension:As per abarnert's comment, you could make your code even simpler by using a dictionary comprehension:Calling d with both options gives the following output:{1: [100], 2: [], 3: []}
