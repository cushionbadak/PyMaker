Natural Text
for the function f defined as above, if I call f(1, *(2,3)) it prints 1, (2,3) as expected.However calling f(a=1, *(2,3)) causes an error:     TypeError: f() got multiple values for argument 'a'Any positional argument can also be supplied as an explicit keyword argument.There should be only one interpretation for f(a=1, *(2,3)) without ambiguity.
consider the example above both will call the same function in the same waynow if you specify a =1 then it has an ambiguity to whether to consider a=1 or a=2 since 2 is the first positional argument and a=1 is an explicit keyword argument .
