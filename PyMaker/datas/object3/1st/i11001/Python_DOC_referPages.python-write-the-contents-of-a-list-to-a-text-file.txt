Natural Text
I created a program in python that is used to create/edit user generated lists. I tried to create a save function that will save a list to a text file, but I'm having a problem. It will create the text file but not write the content of the list to the text file.
Your problem is in this line:for i in user_list:     i.write(user_list, '\n')Change it to this:EDIT: And remove user_list parameter from all of your functions because it is a global variable and you can access it from within your any function. This may also be a reason why your list not getting saved.
