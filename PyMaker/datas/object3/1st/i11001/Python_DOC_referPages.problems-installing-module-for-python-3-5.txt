Here is a possible duplicate of: How to use pip with python3.5 after upgrade from 3.4?I'm a newbie to the Python world. I was hoping someone might point me in the right direction.My current setupI am running on Ubuntu 14.04 which already had python 2.7 and 3.4 installed.I've downloaded Python 3.5.1 and executed ./Configure, make, make install and installation seems fine.I've also installed pip3 sudo apt-get install python3-pipMy problempip3 installs my new libraries for Python 3.4, not Python 3.5. Looking at a solutionAs per the other post, I've executed the following:$ python3.4 -m pip --versionpip 1.5.4 from /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages (python 3.4)$ python3.5 -m pip --version/usr/local/bin/python3.5: No module named pipThe other post also mentions that it could be a bug and that I could 'run pip through python' which I have no idea how to do. Any guidance would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!
sudo apt-get install python3-pip can only ever install pip into the system-provided Python version.You'll need to get pip for Python 3.5. Python 3.5 comes with a module for this, called ensurepip:This will locate and install pip for that specific Python installation.
