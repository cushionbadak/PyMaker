This is a question for python language, and the terminal/console applies to Unix-like systems. It would be great if the solution is platform independent but that is not required.The scenario is when the program keeps printing lines to terminal. However, among the many lines to print, some of them are special, like progress bar or status indicator: they have to be placed only at the bottom of the console, while all other lines can still be printed where they normally are, one after another and the screen scrolls as normal too.An example code solution would be much better than a theoretic one. For this purpose here is an example:Could you help me implement the print_status function so that the msg passed to it will always be printed at the bottom of terminal?Please note that this is very different from another similar question that, when multiple lines are printed consecutively to the terminal, how can we make sure they are printed at the same line. Using \r can be useful in that scenario but it cannot solve this problem, because (1) these special lines may more likely not be printed consecutively and (2) there will be other lines printed after these special lines but these special lines should be kept at the bottom of terminal, still.Thanks!
For a Windows terminal try the console module For unix the curses module would do.This is how you do it on Windows.By specifying -1 for the second argument, string goes at bottom line.For Linux, a working code which prints at last line.
It sounds like you want to use a curses library, which handles text based UIs on Unix systems. There's a module for it in python's standard library:https://docs.python.org/2/library/curses.html#module-cursesHow to use it is beyond the scope of an answer here I'm afraid.
