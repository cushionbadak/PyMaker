I have a Tkinter-based GUI with a series of buttons. I want one of these buttons to execute a command from another script - testExecute.py -  when pressed (code for both scripts included below). Right now, when I start the GUI, the external script function appears to be executing on import rather than when I press the button (pressing the button doesn't appear to execute the function either). I did some research and included the if __name__ == "__main__": bit in testExecute.py, but it still executes on import in my main script. Any thoughts? EXTRA QUESTION IN RESPONSE TO ANSWERS BELOW: What do I do if I want to pass an argument to the function? Because if I include the argument, the function again executes on import.  But if I don't include the argument, I get an error when I press the button.Main Script: testExecute.py:
