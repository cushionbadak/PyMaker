The iter() function is pointing to an element which i removed from etree during the previous iteration,why iter () is not updated with new value? is there anything wrong with the code? heres the codeMy XMl input:After going through all elements in 1st record of "book id=bk101",my etree is updated asthat is i deleted the "book id=bk102" record completely,but during next iter it is pointing to book id="bk102" element which is not in etree and the program ends without going through "book id=bk103" why it is behaving like that? 
iter() documentation explicitly states that behavior is undefined in when tree is modified:Creates a tree iterator with the current element as the root. The iterator iterates over this element and all elements below it, in document (depth first) order. If tag is not None or '*', only elements whose tag equals tag are returned from the iterator. If the tree structure is modified during iteration, the result is undefined.
