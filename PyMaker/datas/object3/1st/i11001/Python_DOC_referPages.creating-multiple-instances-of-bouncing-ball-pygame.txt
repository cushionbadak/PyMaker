So I am new to pygame and I made a program that will make a ball bounce according to gravity, and it works perfectly but now I want to be able to make infinite of them by creating one wherever I click. I know how to get the coordinates of the click, but I don't know how to create multiple circles. Would I somehow use a function or a class? Here's my code, sorry if it's a little messy.   
I would encourage you to experiment with classes and methods. Once you have a class Ball, you can make a list of the Ball objects and process them all at once. You could then use the .append() list method to add a new Ball on mouse click.I would suggest you use variables such as:pos_x,pos_y,vel_x,vel_y,This will make things much easier to understand if you wanted to implement collisions. Dont forget to comment your code :)
