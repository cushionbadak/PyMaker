So I'm running test cases with Selenium and python, and I want to generate HTML Test reports for these tests. I found this resource that should do it for me, http://tungwaiyip.info/software/HTMLTestRunner.html in case anybody is interested it seems really good, but I keep getting this error.The code for the test report generator is here https://github.com/tungwaiyip/HTMLTestRunner/blob/master/HTMLTestRunner.py the creator's github page. How do I fix this? ps I'm running python version 3.5 if that helps.
HTMLTestRunner is a python2 module. Python3 distinguishes between str and bytes object, whereas python2 had unicode and str.As the error message says, line 688 requires a str, not bytes object. As the documentation clarifies, str.encode converts a str object to a bytes object. Instead of self.stream.write(output.encode('UTF-16')), you need to modify line 688 to self.stream.write(output).Note that there will very likely be more errors due to python2/3 incompatibilities.
