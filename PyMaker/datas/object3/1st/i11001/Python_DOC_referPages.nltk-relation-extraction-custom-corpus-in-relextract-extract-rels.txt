Natural Text
I learnt that there is a built-in function in NLTK which could extract relations from NER-tagged sentences according the following:It seems me very promising for general purpose, but I understood that relextract.extract_rels accepts only 'ieer' or 'conll2002' for the parameter corpus. But in this case, its usage is restricted only to these two corpora, isn't it? How could one utilize it for his own corpus (presuming, of course, that it is NER-tagged).
This should be more of a comment but I don't have enough reputation.You can pass your custom corpus as the doc argument after it's been pos-tagged and converted to a list of chunked trees. For a custom corpus, you should use the corpus='ace'.For example, in this answer, they use extract_rels to tag a custom corpus.  
What does the r'.*\bin\b(?!\b.+ing\b)' regular expression stands here for exactly? I cannot dechiper.
