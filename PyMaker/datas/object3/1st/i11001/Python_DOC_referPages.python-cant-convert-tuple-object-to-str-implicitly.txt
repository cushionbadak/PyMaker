In your exception handler, you're adding exc.args to a string. The args attribute is a tuple, which can't be converted to a string implicitly. You could...However, this being a problem in the exception handler, the root cause of the problem is something else, and your current exception handler isn't that great at handling it:without your exception handler, Python would show a complete traceback of the root cause of the exception, and halt your program.with your exception handler, only your message is printed and the program continues. This might not be what you want.It would perhaps be better to only catch the specific exceptions you know you can recover from.
