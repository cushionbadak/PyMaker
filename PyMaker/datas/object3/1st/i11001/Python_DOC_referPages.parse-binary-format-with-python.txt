I have a binary file with the following header: 4 byte string, 1 byte number then 4 byte uint32 number.Do I understand this correctly? The sbet_data[0:3] is the string, sbet_data[4:5] is the 1 byte number, then how long is the 4 byte uint32 number? Where can I find a good chart for corresponding byte size vs format, for example I would also like to know the size for 8 byte (uint64).
You need to open your file in binary mode and read only 12 bytes from your file:You will get a byte string. Assuming it is ASCII, you can decode like this:The documentation of the struct contains tables of format strings.According to one of these tables a uint64 would be L.
I believe you are trying to extract information from the binary. Well this will workIn this case unpacked_data[0] will be the string, unpacked_data[1] will be the 1 byte number and the 4 byte integer will be unpacked_data[2].Keep in mind you can also use numpy to unpack the data using the np.ndarray constructor if you would like to improve the speed.
