I have programmed in C++ earlier but I am new to Python. I searched for this but i was not able to find the appropriate answer. In C++, I can do:The values of i would be 5 and 11. But in python if i do:The value of i does update for that iteration of loop, but in the next iteration, it will become 1.While I do understand that in python, after each iteration, i will contain the next value in the tuple/list generated by range, but is there any way I can make it skip iterations like in C++? I really don`t want to use the next() function 5 timesEDIT: I can use the third parameter of range function for general use, but what if I want to skip some iterations for say if only a certain condition is true. eg
If you want to skip iterations when a condition is true, then use continue:
I know what you were thinking, but there's something built-in for python that allows you to set the iteration step within the range() function. Here is the official Python Documentation on range().In essence, to skip x after each iteration, you would do:Hope this helped.
You can use a regular while loop. it will look less nice but it does the job.for example:
