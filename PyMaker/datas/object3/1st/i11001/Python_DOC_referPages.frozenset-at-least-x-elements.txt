I currently have this code, it checks if all elements in the array are the same. If this is the case, return trueBut what I do want to check is if there are atleast 5 elements of the same.So thatWill return True aswell. Since there are 5 times 1
Instead of using a set, use a bag or multiset type. A multiset counts how many times unique values occur.In Python that's the collections.Counter() object:
Use collections.Counter():
Short answer using Counter:Counter is a "set" counting occurences of its elements. Counter.keys() returns the elements, and Counter().values() returns numbers of their occurences. Thus this max ensures there is an element which occures more than 5 times.
You could also check as you go, short circuiting as you iterate if any value is 5:You could use a Counter but to just count the defaultdict is as fast and sometimes actually faster.
