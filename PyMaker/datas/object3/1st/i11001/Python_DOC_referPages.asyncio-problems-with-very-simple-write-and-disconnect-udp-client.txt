I wanted to try out the new asyncio module from Python 3.5.1. Here's my test code:When I run this, the interpreter gives me:I think this is caused by the sequence of self.transport.sendto(self.message.encode()) and self.transport.close(). If I understand correctly, the sendto method is asynchronous and it actually gets invoked after I close the socket by calling the close method. Is there any way to solve this?
The DatagramTransport (actually _SelectorDatagramTransport) schedules two actions on connection, the first one is connection_made from given protocol, the second is _read_ready (recvfrom) - in that order (https://github.com/python/asyncio/blob/master/asyncio/selector_events.py#L996).Since you close transport on connection_made, the following action (_read_ready) fails. Remove self.transport.close() from there.You might find interesting the asyncio udp examples.
