I have an example .csv, imported as df.csv, as follows:I'd like to check the pandas test1['Description'] for strings in  test1['Ethnicity']. This should return rows 0, 3, 4, and 5 as the description strings contain strings in the ethnicity column.So far I've tried: This returns any specific string, but I'd like to iterate through without searching for each specific ethnicity value. I've also tried converting the columns to lists and iterating through but can't seem to find a way to return the row, as it is no long a DataFrame().Thank you in advance!
You can use str.contains with values in column Ethnicity converted tolist and then join by | what is in regex or:It looks like you can omit tolist():
