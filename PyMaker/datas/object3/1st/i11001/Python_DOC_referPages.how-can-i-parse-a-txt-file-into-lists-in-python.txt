I am not far from a new bee in Python and i would like to parse a fileas is :The file contains : City, Street number, Street Type and Street NameThis order is always the same and the City is followed by a comma.I had done this for now:And i get this output:Seems to be the thing to do but now i have 2 questions:How can I make some lists for each one of the type (City, number, streetType, streetName) ?Is there a librairy in Python that parses adresses in a list ? One that you would recommend ?
There are various data structures that you could store this data in. You could store the data from each line in a tuple containing (city_name, street_number, street_type, street_name), and then store each of those tuples into a list. A slightly nicer option is to store the data into a list of dictionaries. Here's a short demo.output
(EDIT)Actually you don't need any extra libs. It is simple operation which could be done with list comprehension or generator or map function and split , strip str object methods if you could split by the single characterIf you have more complex condition to split - use re module to parse a pattern you need. Definitely you need split function from re module.
