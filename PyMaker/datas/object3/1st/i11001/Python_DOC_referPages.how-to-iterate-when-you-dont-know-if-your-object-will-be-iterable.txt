Sometimes I have multiple axes in axes[0], and sometimes just one. So to iterate over it/them, I use the following:for ax,_x in [(axes[0], X[0])] if len(X)==1 else zip(axes[0],X):What is the idiomatic way to do this?
In general, the best way is to just iterate. Don't ask for permission (with if checks, rather wrap it in a try-except block for handling the "forgiveness" cases.As others have commented though, you shouldn't create different cases if X is a list of size 1, that still is iterable. If you use zip it will stop at the shortest iterable: If you need to work with all values of the longer iterable and provide defaults for the missing values of the shorted one, use zip_longest from itertools with an appropriate fillvalue:
