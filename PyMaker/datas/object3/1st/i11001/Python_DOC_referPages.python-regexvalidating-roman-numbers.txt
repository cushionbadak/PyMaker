in the following code that which check if a given roman numerical is valid or not why is a different answer printed when ^ and $ are not included in the print statement, etc.,. theoretically the ^ and $ are just to show the matching pattern in the beginning and end.
Short answer: Because re.search() and re.match() are not the same.re.search() searches for a match to the given pattern in the entire input, while re.match() requires the pattern to match at the beginning of the input.Independent of that, you can force the pattern to match only at the beginning/end of the input with ^/$. See docs for a detailed explanation. In your case re.search(your_pattern_without_^) would match "QQQQXII" because nothing enforces a match over the entire input. On the other hand re.search(your_pattern_with_^) or re.match(your_pattern_without_^) would not match "QQQQXII" because either the pattern or re.match() requires a match at the start of the input.
