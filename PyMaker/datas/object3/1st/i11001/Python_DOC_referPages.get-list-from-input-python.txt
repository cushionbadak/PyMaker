I need to form a list of Strings from an input. I've tried other answers, but they only work for numbers and only when there are no spaces in it. For example:or something similar. ( Enter input: "Test 1", "Test 2", etc.. could also work)
For a case like this, you want ast.literal_eval; as long as they enter a legitimate Python literal, it will work. json.loads can also work, though it's less expressive than full Python literal syntax. Either way, you'd need to verify that it actually made a list, e.g.
This way might be a bit more convenient: By the way: getting an answer does not mean it is a good question. There is a reason you are getting downvoted.
