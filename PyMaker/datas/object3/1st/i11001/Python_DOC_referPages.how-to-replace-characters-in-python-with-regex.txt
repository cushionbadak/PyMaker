I have been tring to replace german letters into English way of writing:I tried this way: but looks like it does not work, so I need to do it with one re.sub()what is the regex way of doing it?and if it's ok, what is a general way of using regex?
I guess you have already got the solution, but here's it if you want to do with regex re module:
You don't need regular expressions, str.translate() would be a better choice:Prints:
The issue is that re.sub doesn't modify the string in place, it returns a new string. Try:
re.sub returns a new string with the replacement. So you need something like wordLineElements = re.sub("รถ","oe",wordLineElements). There is also a great answer here that does multiple replacements with some clever code
