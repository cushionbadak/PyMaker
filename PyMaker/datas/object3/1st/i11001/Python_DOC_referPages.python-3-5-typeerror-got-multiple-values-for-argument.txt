This question already has an answer here:TypeError: got multiple values for argument                    6 answers                whereas:  Why it behaves like this?Any particular reason?
In the documentation for calls:If the syntax *expression appears in the function call, expression must evaluate to an iterable. Elements from these iterables are treated as if they were additional positional arguments. For the call f(x1, x2, *y, x3, x4), if y evaluates to a sequence y1, ..., yM, this is equivalent to a call with M+4 positional arguments x1, x2, y1, ..., yM, x3, x4.And, this is followed by:A consequence of this is that although the *expression syntax may appear after explicit keyword arguments, it is processed before the keyword arguments (and any **expression arguments â€“ see below).(emphasis mine)So Python will first process the *args as positional arguments, assign a value to b and re-assign it with b=5 resulting in an error for the keyword argument having multiple values. 
The problem is the keywords.  You are not allowed positional arguments after keyword arguments.works fine, in that it passes a tuple with the values 1,2,3.  The same as:Keywords must always come after positional arguments, so it is your function declaration which is incorrect:Gives:
