I have the following Python code:The output is:filter() is supposed to remove the elements from the provided sequence which translate into false, and return only those elements which translate into true. I expected the output to be:since these are the only integers in my list.Am I missing something essential? 
Use isinstance instead:int will convert each object to integer and since all numbers/strings on the list are non-zero filter picks them all since they evaluate True in boolean context. Instead of that it seems that your goal is to pick objects that are already ints and that can be done with isinstance.
filter() calls the callable that it is given (int) with each item in the iterable and returns those that are Truthy.  Since int('56') results in 56, it is Truthy and is included in the results.  You may want something like this:or better:
I agree with @niemmi's and @zondo's solution i.e.Now the question is why filter(int, a) didn't work ?Filter ultimately call function(val) and if this returns false then it filtered it out.But if you call this,
Try this:or
