I am making a project all in python 2.7 but it started to give some errors to me on the final parts since the documentation is in python 3.5. So i am changing everything to python 3.5, but it is giving me a error because of bytesIO. Can you help me to understand why, and what should i do? The error is coming from def repr on string_dinamica.write('P3\n'). I left all the code in case that itÂ´s needed. Thanks for the help. NOTE: Just to confirm this works on python 2.7 but not in 3.5
For Python 3, just change BytesIO to StringIO.  Python 3 strings are Unicode strings instead of byte strings, and __repr__ should return a Unicode string in Python 3.If you try to return a bytes object like some other answers suggest, you will get:
As I mentioned on my comment, BytesIO requires byte-like object.Demo:So add to the beginning of your the param. in you pass to write method, b(for binary).
