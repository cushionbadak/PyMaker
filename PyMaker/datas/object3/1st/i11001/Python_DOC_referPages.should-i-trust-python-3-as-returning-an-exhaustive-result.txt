As you can read in "man python" :-3     Warn about Python 3.x incompatibilities that 2to3 cannot trivially fix.This command allready help me in the past to avoid incompatibility betweencode for Python 2.x & 3.x. However, i don't have any warning for this code.Should I trust "python -3" as returning an exhaustive result ?NB : Surprinsigly, there is no mention of this option here.
No, you should not treat that warning as exhaustive.  The following code behaves differently on python2.x and python3.x but emits no warnings:(at least not as of python2.7.10 on OSX).  Ok, perhaps this code can be handled by 2to3 (it is) -- though I would still expect a warning based on the official documentation.Warn about Python 3.x possible incompatibilities by emitting a DeprecationWarning for features that are removed or significantly changed in Python 3.Here's an example of some code that isn't handled by 2to3 but still no warning is emitted using the -3 option:The problem with this code is that in python3, my pipe expects a bytes object but it's getting a str (python2.x's unicode).
