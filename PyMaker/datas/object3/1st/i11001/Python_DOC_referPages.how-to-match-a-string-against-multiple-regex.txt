At the moment I am using the below filter to increment elements in arr, given a list of strings as an argument, is there an efficient way to do this in python.I got millions of such lists to validate upon.
For the regular expressions given in the question, you can use following regular expression using character class:[admut] will match any of a, d, m, u, t^ can be omitted because re.match matches only at the beginning of the string.removed -* because it's pointless; only one - is enough to check - appear after the a/d/m/u/t.And instead of using array, you can use a dictionary; no need to remember indexes:Instead of dict.fromkeys, you can use collections.Counter.
Don't use regex for this. You are checking for a very specific, fixed condition. Namely, each[1] == '-'  and each[0] in 'admut'. Both of these are much faster than regex. The later can also be used as a mapping.
In your simple case, go for falsetru's answerIn general case, you can combine your patterns into one regex (provided that your regexes doesn't contain capturing groups), and check which wart of regex matched:
