I have created this small python program to automate some processes I want to run. Long story short I use python to pass some information and parameters to a outside program. The outside program does its thing and zips up the results. What I am trying to do is add a "licence.txt" file to the already zipped results. This is what I have:This runs and it inserts the .txt into the zip files, but it is also copying all the other individual .zip files into each zipped directory. So I end up with the 9 separate zipped files zipped into each directory. There should only be one file type in each .zip. I feel as though I made a real simple mistake but I can't find it... Any ideas?
I don't see why yours would do that but try this, it is a bit simpler:
