Please go easy, I am a student!I am unable to export the results of the following code into a CSV. For each loop (coin flip), I need to export the result to a CSV called RESULTS.CSV as a new ROW.I have tried about four different approaches posted on StackOverflow but been unsuccessful thus far. I am having a difficult time understanding the syntax/logic. I hate asking this and always try to avoid it, but would anyone mind showing me a simple solution so that I can dissect the logic? (rather than referencing to an article, as I have already tried to understand them but am having trouble)Version: Python 3.5Here is a failed attempt... I believe that I have saturated my research on the topic and have greatly confused myself...

This will work. Now instead of just printing your results you append them to the list 'data'. Each line of 'data' will contain one of your results. Then you write the list 'data' to a csv file, which will look like you have requested.
