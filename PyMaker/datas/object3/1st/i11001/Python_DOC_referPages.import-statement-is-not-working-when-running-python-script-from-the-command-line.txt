I need to run a python script from the command line (OS = Debian wheezy, python -version 3.5).I used PyCharm (community edition) to write the script and it is working from inside the IDE.I used sys.path.append command to add the directory containing the package I want, then followed it with this import line:from package_name,file_name import ClassNameThe Error message in the command line:ImportError: No module named 'package_name'
I found the answer for my question above, and the problem was much easier than I thought.Addressing the Problemhaving many python packages in different directoriesyour script needs some/all packages, that are not in the standard lib-directory for your python installation (e.g.:prefix/lib/pythonVersion).SolutionShort term solutionAs long you are using an IDE (e.g. PyCharm), it is sufficient within the code to add:import syssys.path.append("path/to/package")As soon as you have to run your script from the command line, you will get an ImportError as mentioned in the Question above.Better solutionAdd the directories of your packages and of your python installation to your shell-profile(e.g.: .bashrc) using the command:export PYTHONPATH=prefix/lib/pythonVersion:/path/to/packagesTo get more info about PYTHONPATH, check this linkIn this case you will not need to append the path of your packages within your code :)
