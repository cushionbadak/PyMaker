Natural Text
I am matching an empty value with an array element which has one value in it and the array does not have any empty values. However, still this script works.How come it is working when b is empty and the array element is 'Arunsdsdds' (which has no empty value in it)?
An empty string is always considered to be part of any string:
The empty string is a substring of every string in Python. This is because the substring of length 0 of any string s[0:0] is equal to the empty string.A proper way to check if a string s is not empty is simply if not s:, as empty strings are "falsey".To check if something is equal to the empty string, just use == as opposed to in. 
tristan gives a detailed answer in the post Why Python returns True when checking if an empty string is in another?. The important sentence is there: Empty strings are always considered to be a substring of any other  string, so "" in "abc" will return True.You find this sentence in the Python 2.7. reference, article Expressions in the chapter Comparisons. Or for Python 3 in Expressions, chapter Membership test operations.
