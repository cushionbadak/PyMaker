So I've been trying to make a simple program that will dynamically import modules in a folder with a certain name. I cd with os to the directory and I run module = __import__(module_name) as I'm in a for loop with all of the files names described being iterated into the variable module_name.My only problem is I get hit with a: (saying the name of the variable I've given as a string). The file exists, it's in the directory mentioned and import works fine in the same directory. But normal even import doesn't work for modules in the cd directory. The code looks as follows. I'm sorry if this is an obvious question. 
I don't think the interpreter dynamically alters sys.path if you simply change the current directory with os.chdir. You'll manually have to insert the path variable into the sys.path list for this to work, i.e:Python generally searches sys.path when looking for modules, so it will find it if you specify it there. An additional note; don't use __import__, rather use importlib.import_module. The interface is exactly the same but the second is generally advised in the documentation.
You should use the try-except concept, e.g.:If I did understand you correct then
