I'm building a Kivy application for Android. When it is run on my Linux machine from terminal it works as expected. When it is built and deployed to Android it fails with the following error:The first_screen.py (and the accompanying first_screen.kv) does exist in the ui package, but it appears the import path is different from what I am expecting. How do I need to structure my imports to properly load on Android?
