I am trying to pack two integer variables and write them to the serial port using struct.pack in Python. The variables are defined as integer variables but I keep getting the following error: 'struct.error: required argument is not an integer'I have been successful at packing actual numbers, just not variables.my code is I assign integer values using a series of sliders I built in Tkinter and than call the command:I'm sure I am missing something simple, but I can't seem to even force the variables to become integers with Int() or the equivalent.Any help would be greatly appreciated.Thank you
IntVar() is not an integer - is a Tkinter object used to notifying observers when it's value changes.To use it in struct pack you need to retrieve underlying primitive.    struct.pack('!BB', var1.get(), var2.get()) .get() method in docs (emphasis mine):The get method returns the current value of the variable, as a Python  object. For BooleanVar variables, the returned value is 0 for false,  and 1 for true. For DoubleVar variables, the returned value is a  Python float. For IntVar, it’s an integer. For StringVar, it’s either  an ASCII string or a Unicode string, depending on the contents.
I think at least ... maybe its just var1(),var2() ... its been a while since i messed with tkinter
