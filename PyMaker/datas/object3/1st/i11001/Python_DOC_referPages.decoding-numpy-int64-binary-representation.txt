Natural Text
So I did a stupid thing, and forgot to explicitly type-convert some values I was putting into an SQLite database (using Python's SQLalchemy). The column was set up to store an INT, whereas the input was actually a numpy.int64 dtype.The values I am getting back out of the database look like:b'\x15\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00'It seems that SQLite has gone and stored the binary representation for these values, rather than the integer itself.Is there a way to decode these values in Python, or am I stuck with loading all my data again (not a trivial exercise at this point)?
You can use struct.unpack():That assumes that the data was stored little endian as specified by the < in the unpack() format string, and that it is a signed "long long" (8 bytes) as specified by the q. If the data is big endian:I imagine that little endian is more likely to be correct in this case.P.S. I have just confirmed that when a numpy.int64 is inserted into a SQLite int field it can be retrieved using struct.unpack() as shown above.
