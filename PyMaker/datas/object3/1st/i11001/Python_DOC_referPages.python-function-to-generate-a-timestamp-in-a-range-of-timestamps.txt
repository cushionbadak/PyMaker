What is the most efficient or most readable or shortest way to generate a timestamp in a range on timestamps. Basically a function that will return a timestamp.Lets say timestamp has to be later than 1999-04-01T07:00:00Z and earlier than 2016-06-03T15:18:07Z in this exact format. This timestamp will be then used as a url param to GET some entities created either earlier or later than this. Also, is this some certain standard of a format? Does it have name? 
as a url param to GET some entitiesIt seems that you need a string of a certain format.is this some certain standard of a format? Does it have name?Take a look at ISO_8601. You can use .isoformat() from here to get exactly that.Lets say timestamp has to be later than 1999-04-01T07:00:00Z and earlier than 2016-06-03T15:18:07Z in this exact format. Shortest and most efficient way would be to simply return "1999-04-01T07:00:01Z", for example. Technically, that does the job.However, I suppose you need something more, like returning a random new one each time or incrementing date with some step or whatnot.EDIT: question about generating random timestamps in a given range was answered here
