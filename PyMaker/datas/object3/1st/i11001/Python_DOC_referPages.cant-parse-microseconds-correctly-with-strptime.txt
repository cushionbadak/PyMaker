I have a string 19:04:01:94891.When I pass this to datetime.datetime.strptime() as:I get the following result:However I expect the result to be:The difference is in microseconds.How can I get the expected result without modifying the string as I am reading the string from a file?
The problem is that your input isn't zero-padded, so the problem would be even worse if we were at, say, 11 microseconds. Let's fix the problem at it's source, and clean up the input first:Now it will be zero-padded to 6 digits as Python prefers.Here's an example of this working:You really need to clean up the input before the call to strptime(), because that's what strptime() expects (6 digits).
From the documentation on strptime():When used with the strptime() method, the %f directive accepts from  one to six digits and zero pads on the right.If your string always contains a 5-digits microseconds number, you could truncate the resulting number after parsing the string:A "proper" solution would be to zero-pad the number of microseconds though. Since you already have an example for python2, here's one using python3's extended unpacking:
