I have the following class:I get the error: TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'MyInt' and 'int'Shouldn't i.__add__(1) be called? And shouldn't __getattr__ be called when no such method is found in the MyInt class?
__getattr__ cannot be used to generate other magic methods. You'll need to implement all of them individually.When the Python language internals look up magic methods like __add__, they completely bypass __getattr__, __getattribute__, and the instance dict. The lookup goes roughly likeIf you want to see the exact lookup procedure, it's _PyObject_LookupSpecial in Objects/typeobject.c.If you're wondering why Python does this, there are a lot of magic methods for which it would be really awkward or impossible to do what you were expecting. For example, Python couldn't possibly use __getattribute__ to look up __getattribute__, as that would cause infinite recursion with no base case.
