I'm trying to print a multiline string in a "for" loop. The problem is I'd like to have the output printed all on the same lines. Example:The output looks like:Instead I'd like it to be:â€‹But I can't get how to do it. Thanks for the help.
Try with list concaternation:
You need sys.stdout.write to write without \n. And this code will not work if you have range more than 9 (10+ has 2+ chars, so you need special rules for spaces before |).
Just to throw in a fun (but bad, don't do this) answer:This uses terminal control codes to print column by column rather than row by row. Not useful here but something that's good to know about for when you want to do weirder terminal manipulation.
You can only print one line at a time. So first you'll have to print the line with all the a elements, then the line with all the bars, and finally the line with all the b elements.This can be made easier by first preparing every line before printing it:There are of course many ways with the same basic idea. I picked the one that is (IMHO) easiest to understand for a beginner.I didn't take spacing into account and once you do, it gets beneficial to use lists:
Similar to Tim's solution, just using map instead of the genrators, which I think is even more readable in this case:or alternatively, less readable and trickier, a heavily zip-based approach:
What's your goal here? If, for example, you print up to n>9, your formatting will be messed up because of double digit numbers.Regardless, I'd do it like this. You only want to iterate once, and this is pretty flexible, so you can easily change your formatting.
