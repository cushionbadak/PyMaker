I want to read a file line by line and check for each line whether one string of the line is allowed by my dictionary to be with another string in the same line. I have come up with this code But it gives me:So this is not working. Strangely replacing dic[resi] to something like dic['ALA'] works just fine. What am I doing wrong here?
The problem is you're getting the value of 3.2 for resi for one of the lines and since 3.2 is not a valid key in dic, you're getting an exception.EDIT:The first method using the n keyword is the best way to know the existence of a key in a dictionary. It runs in O(1)(uses hashing) while the second method does a linear search after getting the keys of the dictionary.In both the methods, since short-circuiting is used, if the first condition fails, the second condition would never get evaluated. Alternatively you can rescue the exception using try..except block.For reference, see here.
It says Keyerror when you use dic[resi] because 'resi' is not a key in the dic but 'ALA'  is a key in your dictionary. If you try something like print (dic['ALA']) it will print everything under the 'ALA' key. 
You don't have a key named '3.2' in dic. I think you should check the key name first.
