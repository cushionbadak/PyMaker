I got this error while trying to compile test.py that contains these two commands -This is the error I gotThe strange thing is, that these same two commands when executed on the command line work perfectly fine.What could be the reason for this to happen? And more importantly, how do I fix this?EDIT:This is what i got when i executed print(sys.path)EDIT2:I realised that I had a file called tempfile.py in my working directory. Upon deletion everything works fine
Make sure you don't have tempfile.py somewhere in python path; which prevents import of standard library tempfile module.Also make sure deleting tempfile.pyc if there it is.
