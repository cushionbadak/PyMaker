Here is all of my codeWhen this is ran you get an error at  board[guess_row][guess_col] = "X" so the question is how do I insert the string X at those two indexes?
board is a list of five 5-character strings. You are trying to assign to a specific character in an existing string, i.e. to mutate a string object. This is not possible, because strings in Python are immutable (the Tutorial also mentions this).You can, however, organize board as a list of lists of characters, in which case your assignment will work.
