Say I'd like to create an introspection stanza, that displays available details of a function. Something like the bottom of the following code:What I'm failing to achieve is changing the XXX to something that would print the attribute name, e.g., instead ofI'd like to haveWhat would you suggest should replace XXX?
If, as in your example, you know the names of the attributes you want, this would work:If you are asking how to get the name when all you have is the function, then I believe you are out of luck; the name isn't a property of the function, but rather how it is referenced, much as you can't ask what the name of the variable containing the number 3 is just from the number.  (Thought exercise: what would the name be for a function that is part of 3 distinct objects, each under a different name?)I suppose, if you wanted the name of a function in a particular object, you could iterate over the attributes of that object, searching for your function; when you find it, the name you used to reference it would be the one you want.
Since you already have a list of the attributes, you could use getattr :
