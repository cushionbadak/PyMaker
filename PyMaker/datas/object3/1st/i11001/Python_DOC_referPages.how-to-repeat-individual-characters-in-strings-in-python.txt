I know that evaluates as "123abc123abc", but is there an easy way to repeat individual letters N times, e.g. convert "123abc" to "112233aabbcc" or "111222333aaabbbccc"?
What about:(changed to a list comp from a generator expression as using a list comp inside join is faster)
An alternative itertools-problem-overcomplicating-style option with repeat(), izip() and chain():Or, "I know regexes and I'll use it for everything"-style option:Of course, don't use these solutions in practice.
Or another way to do it would be using map: 
And since I use numpy for everything, here we go:
If you want to repeat individual letters you can just replace the letter with n letters e.g.
@Bahrom's answer is probably clearer than mine, but just to say that there are many solutions to this problem:Note that reduce is not a built-in in python 3, and you have to use functools.reduce instead.
Or using regular expressions:
Another way:
