I was working on code that printed out the surface area of a cylinder:All of the code worked... Except the surface_areaThis block printed out:    769.69020012955, which is correct.This is where the error occurred:â€‹^This is the error, I was working in Python 2 and I can't figure out what the problem is. What is wrong with the code?- I also would like to know why it is saying 'float' is not callable when I didn't call it. 
You are calling a float value here:Note that there is nothing between the float and the (...). You probably wanted to multiply, so you are missing a * there:You may want to use the math.pi constant rather than typing it out each time:
Replace 3.14159265359 (self.radius **2) with 3.14159265359 * (self.radius **2). Or even better, import math and replace 3.14159265359 by math.pi. See reference for math module.
