Suppose I have an object of the structure:For example, check_match could check for overlap or for equality or for "is friend".Now I'll have a list of those objects:Now, for each element which matches other elements, I d like to keep only one of those mutually matching elements.Remark and clarification:So far, the task is ambiguous: If A and B match, and B and C match, but A and C do not match, then we could keep A and C or we could keep B. It's not important, which decision the algorithm will take. The important thing is, that there are no matching elements in the final list. Two questions:What is the pythonic way to do so?Does this problem have a name?
Regarding: What is the pythonic way to do so?The pythonic way is to rename your match method to __eq__.Then you can do things like element in list with your custom object.A very pythonic way to make a list contain unique items is then:Edit: __ne__ is not needed and will default to not __eq__()Does this problem have a name?One could look for "equivalence classes". Some references:implementing __eq__ in your own class: Elegant ways to support equivalence ("equality") in Python classes stdlib docs on __eq__: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.eqhow element in list works behind the scenes: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#membership-test-details
Python has a type of contains method that works with the following syntax: if x in y: Use it to determine if a list contains an objShould result in c = ["c", "d"]
