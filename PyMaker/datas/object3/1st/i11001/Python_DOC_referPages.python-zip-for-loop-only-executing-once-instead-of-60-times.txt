I have many python lists, from which I am transferring the data to the MySQL database.Technically, each list variable has 60 values each. But at the time of executing the for loop, only 1 record gets updated instead of 60. I am using python zip form a long time and never faced a problem.In order to check whether each list variable has 60 values within it, I insterted a loop inside the above loop and printed. It prints out all 60 values.Where am I going wrong? any suggestions?
Most likely you have list with only one element in it, so zip returns only one tuple of items, using itertools.zip_longest instead of zip should fix your issue ( you would get padded zip of items...):
