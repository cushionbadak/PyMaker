I want to put a python script with module script PIL on a server. The server might not have PIL installed. (This is why I want to load the file myself)If possible, how can I have the python script import Image Library from the current directory of the script without having it installed on the machine?Using python virtual machineI am using v2.7 of python locally, as on server.
One option is to import modules from a relative path as described here.It is also possible to use virtual environments where you pack everything you need and donÂ´t mess with python installations on the server. Look it here and hereOther references:Loading all modules in a folder in PythonHow to do relative imports in Python?
