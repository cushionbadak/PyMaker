I have a project program,and I want to have the possibility to execute it in 3 different ways, per executable / script.If it would only be on my system, it wouldn't be an issue, but it has to be executed on a system that usesinstead ofThus even if I build an easy workaround for my system, I still had to build a second workaround for my university or permanently copy stuff, if I made a slight change to it.Is there anyway to have 3 different scripts, that start main.py in different ways. Maybe with some tricky python arg that will always start main.py in pyw.
for a scrip that execute other scrip, look at the subprocess module to help you processing command-line arguments you can check argparse module if you don't alreadyIn any case, I see 3 case here1) make 3 scrip, one for each case and make 4° one to select between them according to the command-line options for exampleand the 4°2) have your main scrip, and make 3 other which only job is calling the main one with the needed options or import the main and executed it as neededand the cases3) add extra command-line options to select between cases with a suitable default values
