Natural Text
I've written the following in order to get number of search results per word in my wordlist:It works well and I get accurate results, except for words containing special characters, for example the word: "número".If I call bingSearch("número") I get an accurate result. If I call bingSearch(match[0]) (where printing match[0] yields "número") I get an inaccurate result. I've tried stuff like str(match[0]), match[0].encode(encoding="UTF-8"), but with no success.Any ideas?
try giving the encoding directly when you open your file, it can make the differencewith open ("C:\wordslist.txt", encoding="utf-8") as f:https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open
