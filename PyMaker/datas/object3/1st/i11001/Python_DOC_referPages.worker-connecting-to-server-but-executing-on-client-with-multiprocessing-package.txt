First post here, hello everyone.I have a problem with the multiprocessing package with python 2.7.I wish to have some processes run in parallel on a server; they do connect but they are executed locally instead.This is the code I use on the server (Ubuntu 14.04):while this is the code that runs on the client (Mac OS 10.11):The for loopthat's inside the worker function is just to let the workers process a lot, so I can monitor their activity into Activity Monitor or with top.The problem is that the processes connect (as a matter of fact if I put a wrong address they do not) but they are executed on the local machine, as I see the server CPUs staying idle while the local CPUs going all towards 100%.Am I getting something wrong?
You are starting your Process locally on your client. p and for each in p: each.start() is executed on your client, where it is run and starts the workers.While each Process "connects" to the Manager via mgr.connect() it never interacts with it. The local Processes don't magically transfer to your server just because you opened a connection. Furthermore, a Manager isn't meant to run workers, it is meant to share data.You'd have to start workers on the server, then send work to there.
