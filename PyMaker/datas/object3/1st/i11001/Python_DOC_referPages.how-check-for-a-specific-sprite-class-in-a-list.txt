This is my current inventory system and I am working on having it register when an item has been picked up, but I am having trouble getting the program to register when the sprite class has been added to the list.
Your if j == item_sys.Item1 check will fail because it is not checking the type of j equals class type. Rather, it is checking if the value/object j equals class type.So, what you need to do is get js type. To do that, assuming Item1 class is not a subclass (if it is, you will need to make use of isinstance()), you can use if type(j) is Item1. You can read this as: 'if j is a type of Item1'. To avoid runtime type checking (which is what you are doing here), I'd recommend implementing a method in your Item1 class that returns the item type e.g. weapon, armour, consumable, et cetera as that will come in handy as you develop your game. You could go one step further and implement a method in your Item1 class that gets the item's sub type e.g. weapon -> gun, sword, stave, et cetera.
