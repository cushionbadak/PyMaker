I have a data acquisition program written in Python that I distribute to my collaboration as an executable (using cx_freeze), as I don't want to bother them with installing Python and installing all the software dependencies. The program has been working well for a year now. Recently, the program started to crash (crash, not give a scripting error, i.e., the Python virtual machine itself is crashing). So I would like to know what library is causing this problem. This problem is happening randomly, so it's difficult to systematically pinpoint the cause.I learned about faulthandler, and I would like to use it with my cx_freeze, because I can't be sure the problem is happening due to cx_freeze itself or due to some other library. The question: How can I produce a cx_freeze executable that will use faulthandler?What I tried:My current cx_freeze setup script is the following:I tried replacing my Executable part Main.py by Main.py -q -X faulthandler, but that didn't work. Importing faulthandler in my cx_freeze setup file with import faulthandler or from faulthandler import * didn't help.Please advise.Additional info: Dependencies that I'm using (in case you may know a possible cause of the problem): PySide, Sympy, Numpy, H5py, PySerial, Matplotlib
I learned that I could use procdump. It can be downloaded from here. It's a very simple program that can log stack trace. You can use it with:and this will dump the stack trace of any program that crashes to that folder.
