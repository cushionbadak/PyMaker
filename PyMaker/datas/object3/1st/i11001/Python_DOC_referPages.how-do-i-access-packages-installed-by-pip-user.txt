I realized I had an outdated numpy version:I sought to update it, but I couldn't install on the entire machine for some reason:Ok, I'll just install to --user then:But the version is not updated!Where did the installed version go?

You can see your USER_BASE value like this:I found that on my machine, this was on sys.path, but it came after the global install directories.I solved it by adding this to my ~/.bash_profile:Now the latest version is indeed loaded:
I installed packages with sudo pip install --user option and I had to do sudo python to get it working.With sudo:Without sudo:PS: I am running these on Mac OS High Sierra and my issue was with rasa_core and dependent packages.
