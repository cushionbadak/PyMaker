I am using the win32Com module to write data to an excel sheet on a Windows 7 machine with Python 3.5. While it is running I get thrown an error. I tried making a "try/except" block but the error type I attempted is apparently not an actual error type. Here is my code : The traceback I get is this :During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:I am used to seeing things like here ( https://docs.python.org/2/library/exceptions.html#exception-hierarchy ) and have been basing my method of writing the try/except off of here ( https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html ) My question is how do I determine the error type that I am trying to catch based on the top portion of the traceback? 
You need to add an import, more specificallythen use the following
By importing "pywintypes" my error try/except functions properly.
