I'm not a python expert,and I'm trying to implement the functionality in subject.I know how to use a functionality which executes methods in parallel.E.g.but I can't figure out how can I execute method A in 10 / 20 / 100 / ... parallel sub processes.Assistance will be appreciated.

Python has that built in. Instead of opening a new process you can just use pool.apply_async.For example:
