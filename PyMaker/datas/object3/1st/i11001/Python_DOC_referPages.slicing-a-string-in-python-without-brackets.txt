Let's say I have a string like num = "12345"; how do I print it as one character like 1 or 2 without using brackets (print(num[0]))?
The brackets are probably the correct way to do this, why do not want you to use it?Anyway, you can unpack your string (only work with Python 3 as @DeepSpace precised), like this:It works also for multiple variables anywhere:There is also operator.getitem(a, b), which behaves like the brackets but as a function:Finally, as @EliKorvigo pointed it out, there is operator.itemgetter(item) which creates a function acting just like the brackets:
Another abuse of Python functions. You could iterate over the string and only print values which are in a certain position.
Using iterators:
You could use itertools.islice():Other ways to do it include looping over the input string the required number of times:Or popping items off a list copy of the string:Or looping over an iterator version of the string:And another way is to use a collections.deque:although you would want to length check it in case you rotated beyond the length of the string.
