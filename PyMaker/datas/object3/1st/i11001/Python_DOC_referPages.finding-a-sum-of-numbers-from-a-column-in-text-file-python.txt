This question already has an answer here:Python find sum of column in table in text file                    4 answers                I want to know how to find the total sum of number from a column in a text file in python.My file:I want to add the 4th column in the text file. That is the column that starts with 36. The function should return the sum of the column that is 66.I don't have any code yet as I am still stuck in this problem and thinking of a way to solve it.I am having error in some places i think it is due to my code. I need assistance in it.The error is receive
This should work:line.split() will turn "123  Hammer  20  36" into ["123", "Hammer", "20", "36"]. We take the fourth value  36 using the index [3]. This is still a string, and can be converted to an integer using int or a decimal (floating-point) number using float.EDIT:to check for empty lines add the condition if line: in the for loop. In your particular case you might do something like:
you can use Panda for that:http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/io.htmlhttp://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.sum.html
This is python that opens a file, maps each line to the integer at the end, and then sums the integers:first open the file:Next we have to write a function that returns the last column of any given line as an integer.the .split() method will by default split on spaces, giving you a list of each column in this line.[-1] tells python to get the last element of the list.map takes a function and a list and calls the function once for each item of the list. The return value for map is a list of the results of each of these calls. In this case, the return value of map is a list of integers which are in the last column of the file.finally, sum adds all these integers together.That's it!If you're curious, you can do the same thing with awk in one line:
