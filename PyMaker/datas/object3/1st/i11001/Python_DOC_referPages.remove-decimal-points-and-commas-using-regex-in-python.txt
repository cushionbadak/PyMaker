I have the following string:i want to remove the commas and points ONLY FOR NUMBERS. I am using the following codeThe result is:'19.00020000'I am newbie in regex. How do I preserve the new line and remove the dot Can anyone help?
^\d matches everything that is not a digit.Instead, you should use (?<=\d)[,\.].(?<=\d) ensures that there are digits before the comma or the point.
[^\d\.], since it starts with a ^, matches everything that isn't a digit (\d) or point (\.).  If you want to remove commas and points, you want to match , or \., which can be written [,\.] or [\.,].  In re.sub, that's written r'[,\.].  You replace those with the empty string ('') and everything else should be left as is.Edit Per the change to your question, to remove commas and points between digits, one way is to usewhich will match commas or points preceded by a digit ((?<=\d)) and followed by a digit ((?=\d)).  These are called "lookbehind" and "lookahead" assertions.
