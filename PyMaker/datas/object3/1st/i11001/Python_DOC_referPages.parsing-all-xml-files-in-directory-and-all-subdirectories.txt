Natural Text
I am new to Python, yet I have some experience with Delphi. I am trying to make a script that would be able to search all xml files in directory (including all subdirectories in that directory), then parse those XML and save some data (numbers) from there to a simple txt file. After that I work through that txt file to create another txt file with only unique set of numbers from previously created txt file.I created this script:It works as intented just until there is a subdirectory, in that case I get error:That is caused by the fact that file is in subdirectory, not in a directory with python script. I tried to make it work via path to get absolute path of the file to work with, but I am getting more error, see the script:The error I am getting now I don't really understand and google is not helping either - whole log:Can you please help me out?
The pattern you are looking for is like:In each iteration of your for loop, root refers to the directory in which the files and dirs exist.
Your issue as already explained in Rob's answer is because you are not joining the path so once you leave the cwd you are finding files outside of the directory but looking for them in the cwd.Since you are using oythin3 you have a couple of other options to find the files, if your python3 version is 3.5 can find all the xml files using glob  searching recursively: Or if you are using python 3.4, you can use pathlib  to do a recursive search:
