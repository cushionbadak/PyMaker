First of all, I should tell I'm totally newbie in Python!So, I may be trying to do something impossible, or something that should be done in a different way. I can't find on the Internet any example about it.I have two modules in .py. The server.py and the delay_simulator.py. I want to pass a tuple as an argument when I call from server to delay_simulator. But I can't receive the tuple argument in the delay_simulator module.I will put the code below. Note that the tuple is pkt_recv.server.py (just part of the code)delay_simulator.py (just part of the code)When I run the program server.py, the module delay_simulator.py cannot recognize the second argument, it behaves as if it does not exist!Is the sys.argv the wrong function to use? Is there another way to pass these arguments, including a tuple?Thanks all in advance :)
If you want to pass the variable from one module to the next you need to encapsulate it in a function. Try this:server.py (just part of the code)delay_simulator.py (just part of the code)
