I want to convert this time '23:59:05.823Z' to this format like '10:00  AM'looks like you are using ISO date time format. You could do something like this.
If you are using the Python datetime module then you can use the .strftime() method to convert you datetime into a string of your desired format. For example:%I gives you the hour in a 12-hour clock as a zero-padded number, %M gives you the minute as a zero-padded number, and %p gives you AM or PM. You can read more about this in the official documentation: https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#strftime-and-strptime-behavior
