I'm having a hard time understanding why my function is not returning the reversed version of my list. I've spent a long time trying to understand why and i hit a wall: ---it only returns my list in ascending order.
You are using sort function in an invalid way.Here is the definition of sort function (from builtins.py):key argument has to be used if there is 'ambiguity' on how items have to be sorted e.g. items are tuples, dictionaries, etc.Example:Not quite sure what you want with this part though:Seems like you want a list of all numbers and letters but you are doing it an odd way.Edit: I have updated answer.
The key function passed to list.sort has a very specific purpose:key specifies a function of one argument that is used to extract a comparison key from each list element (for example, key=str.lower). The key corresponding to each item in the list is calculated once and then used for the entire sorting process. The default value of None means that list items are sorted directly without calculating a separate key value.So the function is supposed to take in a single list element, and then return a key that determines its sorting compared to the other elements.For example, if you wanted to sort a list by the length of their contents, you could do it like this:Since the function only takes a single item, it makes it unsuitable for sorting behaviors where you actually need to compare two elements in order to make a relation. But those sortings are very inefficient, so you should avoid them.In your case, it seems like you want to reverse your list. In that case you can just use list.reverse().
