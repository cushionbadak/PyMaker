This is a training version of Calculator, for some reason I am getting the error:The interesting part is that I am not using the iterator here, even though I wanted to. I executed the code before and run just fine the added some code for looping and it gave this error. Now the looping part is in comments so it should not affect the code although it is still giving me the same error!!Here I tried to add a loop that you can keep adding stuff but this error made my code stop working completely and can't see why?
The reason why you get this error:Is because you are using Pythons built-in sum(iterable[, start]) method. And the first parameter it takes expects an iterable. Instead you will want to use your defined method self.sum that belongs to your Calculator class.
Replace sum() with self.sum() where you get your error.You want to do this because python's version is different from yours and needs an iterable as first argument to work. Everything in your calculator is using the self function instead of the python too so thats another reason.
