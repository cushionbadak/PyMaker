I'm a new programmer and I'm trying to make a rudimentary password generator. But I keep getting this problem where my while loop never breaks.Can someone tell me what I'm doign wrong? Thanks.
Can this help? :p
You never change n or x here:So if the condition was True initially it will always stay True and loop infinitely. Need to do x = x + 1Incidentally this is the exact sort of bug that Pylint would catch for you.
Please consider the following:1) Obvious conditionYou define x = 0, and then checks if x equals 0. It is invariably True.Hence, you can change it this way:2) While loop never endsBefore you had: Consider these two ways you can add 1 to the variable x:orBoth mean the same thing.For further enlightment:https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#augmented-assignment-statements

You made quite a few errors in your code. What is x+1? It will be x=x+1. Please go through the basics first. Why are you checking if x==0, right after assigning x=0? Don't you think the if will always be yes? Your code in a cleaned format. Hope this works.
You can try this, I've upgraded a little to generate more complex password.
