I'm trying to get this to workscript.py command onesubcommand mabyanotherone [something] [--optional stuff]This currenlty works with script.py command -h and it shows that command got a set of subcommands, and etc command subcommand -h shows it got a set of required options and optional.Then I'm trying to get this to workbut throwsSo I tried to add this to the parser partthe function gets triggered but I don't see how I can get the subcommand out and it's parameters, etc args.command throws namespace.How do I solve this or how do I do this the correct way?I just want nested commands with options.
The problem isn't with the nesting.  It's with basic subparsers definition.Look at the namespace, the args object created by parse_args:A command like: mainsubparsers = parser.add_subparsers() doesn't save any indication of what the command was.  Out[5] has an attribute because of the parser_subcommand.add_argument..., and value is the default.In[4] is possible with Py3.  In Py2 is will raise an error, because subparsers are required (that's a bug in Py3 version).If I add a dest parameter to each add_subparsers (as discussed in the docs) I getWith this then args.cmd and args.subcmd can be referenced.The docs also show how set_defaults can be used to define other attributes selectively, including ones with object values.https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html#sub-commands
