I have a file type with many rows containing information as follows:I'm reading this file line by line using I'd like to see how to split each line to give lists as follows:I tried splitting using python's regular .split() method but it doesn't split the lines consistently, yielding varying list lengths for each line. I also investigated re.split() using stuff like re.split([ = ( ]|,) but that didn't work either. I'm also not a big regular expression user (though I know they are very powerful) which explains why I'm having a hard time finding the right one.I guess I need to delimit the lines by  ' = ( ' and ',' though I'm really not sure how to do it such that the resulting lists are consistent. Any help would be much appreciated. Thanks
This should do it:The re.match is used to extract the important parts, then each is parsed to the appropriate type to be printed.
Using ast.literal_eval() for parsing the tuple string:
A solution without regex:
The following regular expression will extract all the lines from your file:where x is the string that is your file content.
It's not always a good idea to use it, but eval can be ideal in these situations:
Regex:  [-0-9.]+[-E+0-9]* or [-\d.]+[-E+\d]*Details:[] Match a single character present in the list+ Matches between one and unlimited times* Matches between zero and unlimited timesPython code:Output:
