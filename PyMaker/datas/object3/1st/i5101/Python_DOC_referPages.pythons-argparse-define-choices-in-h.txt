I'm building a command line argparser for my program and I try to give much detail in the -h optionI have the following code:python prog.py cmd -h will result the following prints in the command lineEvery action requires a different number of arguments, so I want to add something that will describe the actions (from the list of actions) like:And I want it to have any link with the above "optional arguments", so it'll be easy to see the "acts" are under the -a option
If you want to add more information, you can use the epilog-parameter:This will print out At the end of help output. The epilog-parameter can also be included in the add_parser() when using add_subparsers():This object has a single method, add_parser(), which takes a command name and any ArgumentParser constructor arguments, and returns an ArgumentParser object that can be modified as usual.NOTE: the default formatter will ignore newlines, so take a look at Python argparse: How to insert newline in the help text? where this is addressed, which describe how to replace the formatter รก la:Read more about the epilog-parameter in docs.
