Natural Text
Okay, so that might be a bit cryptic.I have a list of food, which I randomly select items from. I use this in another list to talk about the selected food, but those strings can have the food-name both at the beginning of the sentence, and the end of the sentence.Example:I'm displaying these like this:Now, I could just slap .captialize() on the end there, but that will make it capitalized even when it's at the end or middle of the sentence.So, I'm looking for a solution where it gets capitalized when it's the first word in the sentence and only the first word...
EDIT: I've updated answer from input in comments on the question (and this answer). //EDITYou could try something like this:
If you're on Python3.6, you might be able to do some rearranging and use f-strings. Likebreakfast_choice = breakfast_food_list[breakfast_select]breakfast_reply = f"{breakfast_choice.capitalize()} is fine"
