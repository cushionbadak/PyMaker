So I've tried the code below and after running this code it simply prints " ". Can someone point out what I'm doing wrong, or what I could do to fix this
After the write operation, your position in the file is still positioned at the end of the bytes you've just written.  So when you call read immediately, you read from the end of the file until, err.. the end of file.  Ergo, you read (and print) an empty string.
