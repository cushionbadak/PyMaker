I am trying to use argparse to parse command line arguments. Here is my code:When the script is executed like this, argparse complains about unrecognized arguments.But when the script is executed like this, argparse is satisfied.How should I change my code so '=' can be used in the argument list?
According to the argparse documentation, passing * in the nargs argument meansAll command-line arguments present are gathered into a list.When you invoke your program without the equal sign, all three IP addresses are considered part of the --allow_ips argument; they will be available to your program in a list.When you invoke your program with the equal sign, only the first IP address is considered part of the --allow_ips argument. argparse then tries to parse the second and third IP addresses. But it cannot because your program does not take any positional arguments. So argparse raises an exception.
