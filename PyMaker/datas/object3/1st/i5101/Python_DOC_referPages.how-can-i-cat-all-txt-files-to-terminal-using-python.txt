Natural Text
I want to cat txt files from a folder and cat results should be shown in terminal (Obviously). I have tried using listdir() it but it doesn't work. Required some help!
a simple implementation uses glob to generate absolute paths to files with .txt extension, in a loop which reads the file and prints it on standard output:using fileinput allows to read all the files, and line by line, probably less memory intensive and shorter:note that sorted is better to ensure that the files are processed in deterministic order (some filesystems don't respect that order)sys.stdout.write(f) still writes line by line, but as suggested by comments you could improve performance and not use so much memory by using shutil.copyfileobj(f,sys.stdout)
Just use the command in terminal "cat *"Or if you want to do it in python:You can also do other things with the contents since its stored as a variable!
