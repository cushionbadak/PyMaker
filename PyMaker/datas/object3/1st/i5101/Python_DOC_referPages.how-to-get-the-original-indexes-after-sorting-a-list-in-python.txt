I have a list as follows.I want to get the indexes of the top 4 elements of the list (i.e [5, 9, 3, 8]) and remove the indexes that have a value lesser than or equal to 1 (<=1).Therefore my final output should be [5, 9]My current code is as follows:However, it returns [5, 5], which is incorrect.Please let me know how I can fix this in python?
