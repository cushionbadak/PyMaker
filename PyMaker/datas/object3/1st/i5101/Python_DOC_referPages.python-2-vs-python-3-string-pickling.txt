I'm getting different outputs pickling a string when using Python 2 and Python 3 (due to different str types I suppose).Python 2:Python 3:How can I modify the code to get the same results when pickling a string?EDIT:When using protocol=2 still getting different pickles:
Python can use different stream versions when pickling. Default versions differ between Python 2 and Python 3.Pass the protocol version explicitly. Use pickle.dumps('test', protocol=2) to get consistent results across versions. Note: The exact output may change, but the unpickling result remains the same, modulo "unicode" vs "ascii" in Python 2:
