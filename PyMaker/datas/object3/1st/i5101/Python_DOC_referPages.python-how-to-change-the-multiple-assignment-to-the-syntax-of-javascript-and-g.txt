I've got a little problem searching about backtracking. First of all, in  the code I'll link below I found a quite strange syntax to me as a JavaScript programmer:Using information in this page I figured it out it means: "assign a[i] to the a[l] variable and a[l] to the a[i] variable". I can't understand the use of this. I thought it would be the same values. If you first assign the value to a[l] and then try to get a[l], it's going to be a[i], for both variables.It's a Python code, however, I'd like to convert it to the JavaScript using the same principle.You can follow this link to the IDE: https://ide.geeksforgeeks.org/ASvO8MoGQr.What this code does, is getting the permutation values of the string "aab".For example, using "aab" as the first string, we should get the following result: aababaaabababaabaa.I tried using "JavaScript" and came up with this:The result I get is ["aab", "aab", "aab", "aab", "aab", "aab"].Link to the JSFiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/xrfkt9qj/1/.EDIT1 I've tried the @jp_data_analysis answer, but it still returns bad results: https://jsfiddle.net/zurvm0xy/.EDIT2 ES6 Version of the script: https://jsfiddle.net/zurvm0xy/4/.It's not a duplicate, the variable swapping is only a first part of this problem. Please read the full article.
The following code 2 pieces of code have the same result, assuming values are immutable.Python syntaxRegular syntaxWhy it worksPython evaluates the right hand side first. See Evaluation order for more details.
Finally, I figured everything out. The most immportant part was to convert the string to the array using split() function.
