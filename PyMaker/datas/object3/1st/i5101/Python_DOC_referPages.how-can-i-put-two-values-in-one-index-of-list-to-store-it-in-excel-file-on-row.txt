I want to add two values in one index of list likeand then put this value in excel sheet like  18th row put value 'PASS'.
If you want to have multiple values in "one index of a list" you can simply use a list of tuples:If you want to store something as excel table (which is in and of itself 2 dimensional), you would need at least 3 things: to enable arbitary placement inside a excel workboot sheet.Lets create some demo data:And then write the data into workbooks:Writing old excel files (*.xls):Writing new excel files (*.xlsx):To write your data you would supply:Links: openpyxlxlwtDisclaimer: I took a peek at this answer for the old style excel writing  and heavily adapted it.
You can make a list of tuplesFor exampleYou can access the values asPlease Note: Tuples are immutable, so cannot add new elementsMerging of tuples with the + operator you can add an element and it will create a new tupleYou can read more about this over here
Possible options are1. One string with seperator>>> list = ['18 PASS', '19 FAIL', '20 PASS']Here you store the information as 1 string with a separator, usually space. And whenever needed you parse it.Caution: Though the separator can e any character or string,  you should be extra careful that you separator should not appear in the information string.For example,lets go out of your example and take age and nameOuch!! you missed the last name Booch.2. List of lists or list of tuplesAs explained in previous answer by https://stackoverflow.com/users/3287355/user3287355Remember tuples are immutable, once created you cannot alter the contents.3. Recommended to use Python DictionaryFor key-value pairs Python has a built-in structure called Dictionary which analogous to Map, JSON etc.Caution: Beware of duplicate keys. Also you can't expect the dictionary to preserve the order of elements as you entered. However its completely based on key-value, we don't get values by index.
