I'm looking for a python script that would took for example first 5000 files and copy them to another folder. Then after another run, it would took next 5000 files and copy them.I tried using shutil but couldn't make it work, no matter what I tried. Can you please help, or guide me on the right direction?
What you may be looking for is a combination of  os.walk() HERE and shutil.copy() HEREBuilding a script based on sample provided on those two links looks pretty straight forward.Good luck.
