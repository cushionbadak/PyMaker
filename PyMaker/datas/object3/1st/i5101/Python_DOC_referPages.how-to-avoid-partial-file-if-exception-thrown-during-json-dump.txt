The following code throwsTypeError: Object of type 'datetime' is not JSON serializablewhich I know how to resolve.  However my real question is how to cleanly structure the code to avoid a partial file if any exception occurs in json.dump.The above code throws an exception and results in a partial file like:Should I dumps to a string first in a try/except?  If so are there any memory implications to be aware of? Or delete the file in an except block?
Use a try/except block like:Code:and if you want to preserve the exception:Test Code:
That depends on whether your JSON data is under your control or from unknown source. If it’s from somewhere you can’t predict, use  try...except... block. Otherwise, fix your program to make it always available to serialize.
