I am asking for help in last resort, I have a problem with my code that is driving me crazy. I work with both Python 2.7.6 and Python 3.4.3 on Ubuntu 14.04 with the following very simple part of code that I took from there password generator urandomThis part of code works with python 3.4.3. but randomly give the following error every 2 or 3 run:And with Python 2.7.6, it doesn't work at all and give the following error :I understand how lambda and map works but I just can't find a solution and I can't switch to python 3.4.3 because I coded my main program with 2.7. What can I do to make it works under python 2.7 and avoid the "string index out of range" error seen in 3.4.3?Thanks, PGriffin.

Use SystemRandom instead:Compare how often each character appears in a password before:and after:
