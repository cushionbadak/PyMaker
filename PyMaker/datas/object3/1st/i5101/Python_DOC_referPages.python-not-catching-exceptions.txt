I have this script:No matter what I do, no exceptions are caught.  I changed the read_until looking for "User Name:" to just some garbage characters and it still just gets to the end of the code.  I'm hoping I'm just doing something very stupid and not an issue with telnetlib.Thanks!
Per the docs:Read until a given string, expected, is encountered or until timeout  seconds have passed.When no match is found, return whatever is available instead, possibly  the empty string. Raise EOFError if the connection is closed and no  cooked data is available.Check the return value in the try block, and if this value does not match your expectations, raise on your own to trigger the except case.
