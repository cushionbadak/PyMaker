I have the following MySQL error message which is very standard with some section changing depending on the situation:I would like to extract each of its variable parts.

The way your regex is written confines you to only this particular error.  If in general you just wanted to capture the quoted values:For the last one, you'll need to do another search:
This should work:Adding a "prefix" to filter on more lines should now be nice enough. I did include the backticks as is would be easy enough to remove them with str.replaceTake not of the re.VERBOSE to make this more readable
