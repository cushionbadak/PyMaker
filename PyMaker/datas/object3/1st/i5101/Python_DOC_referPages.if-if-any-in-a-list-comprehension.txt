What is the difference between if / if any in a list comprehension?The code:gives me the expected result. However, if I use "if" instead of "if any", then the result is wrong. 
(set(word.upper()) <= set(row) for row in ('QWERTYUIOP', 'ASDFGHJKL', 'ZXCVBNM')) is a generator expression. if will always see this as a True valueany is a function. It iterates over the generator expression and returns a boolThere is no "if any" it's "if [some expression]" the any is part of the expression
Think of it this way. The any method will return True the moment it meets the condition you are looking for as it iterates over the collection. In other words it 'short circuits' once it meets your condition. So, inside your any you are determining this True condition. Once you move outside of it, the if in the overall comprehension is simply checking for whether the any did in fact return True. In the event it is True (aka the if passed the True check), you take the word in to the list you are crafting.
