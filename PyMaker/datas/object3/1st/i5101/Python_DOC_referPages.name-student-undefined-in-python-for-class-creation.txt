New to python. While running this script in python, I am getting an undefined name: student error. Below is my code. I tried solving this but failed.
Before I answer, I would recommend looking for a Python OOP tutorial. This one (not my website) looks okay.You are trying all of your operations in the scope of Student.You should try something like this:
Try this:
Class is basically a blueprint for the objects and you have to define a class for student before creating objects for it.__init__(self) is function that acts as constructor and holds the attributes or member variable of the class. Above is right way to use class. For further reference you can read about class and objects here.
It seems like you are trying to use class properties.
This below code is a class definition, you define the attributes and behavior of the class Student. The function __init__ is the function that will be called just after you create an object of Student, for example..After this, you can use the attributes: first_name and last_name. You can also use the defined method: show_full_name to show the object's full name.Output of the above 4 lines code :
