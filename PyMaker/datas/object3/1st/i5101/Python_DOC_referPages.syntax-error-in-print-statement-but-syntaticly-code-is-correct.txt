If I run this code:I am getting syntax error in print statement(2nd line), but if I run this code:it is running without error.
You need to correctly balance parenthesis and square brackets in your first line (the "offending" example):This is a list comprehension, so you need to put it inside []. Also, since you want integer values in x, y, z and n, you are correctly using the int() constructor, but failing to close the parenthesis after input().With that corrected, it works without a glitch.Hope this helps.
