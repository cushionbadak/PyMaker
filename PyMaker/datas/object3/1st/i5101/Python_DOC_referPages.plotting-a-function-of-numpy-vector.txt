I want to plot a function of a numpy matrixbut I'm not sure how to proceed. I'm familiar with the method for multivariable functions, and the equivalent function with multivariable functions (along with plotting) would beso f(np.matrix((x,y))) == g(x,y), but I don't know how to extend this to my vector function. So how can this be achieved?
The issue here is arranging dimensions. Your f seem to expect X and Y to be cast as a collection of vectors. But X and Y are two 101x101 matrices. So some rearranging and massaging is required. The good news is that using the map command below can be done to any function. The bad news - efficiency is elegance are probably not optimal.This is what I would try:And then
Assuming that what is meant by X.T @ X is numpy.dot(X.T,X), you may directly plot the result just as with any other function.However, in order to get the desired output from the question, the function depends on both x and y, so what is wanted is probably
