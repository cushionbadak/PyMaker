When using the python shell, how can I change to lets say, C:\etc.? I have a batch file that changes to the shell, and I want a way to change it back.
The Python interpreter has a file path pointing to the location where Python is installed unless you launch it from another location (i.e. from terminal/batch-file/file explorer/application) then it will take the location of that instead.  If you want to go to a file location you must program it.  The os module can do what you want.  It provides extensive file/folder manipulation including changing dictionary using os.chdir().  Both full paths and relative paths are supported.For example:You can delete and rename files using this module as well.
