Natural Text
I have been trying to figure out how to include certain word groups and exclude others.I have this string for exampleI want to find HI:MYDLKJL:ajkld? and  app? but not :JKLJBLKJD:DKJL? because it begins with a : I have made this code but it still includes the :JKLJBLKJD:DKJL? just ignoring the : in the front
The actual pattern is pretty simple to specify. But, you'll also need to specify a look-behind to handle the second term appropriately.The regex means "any expression that does not start with a colon but ends with a question mark".A simple word boundary does not work because \b will also match the boundary between : and JKLJBLKJD... no bueno, hence the lookbehind.
Alternate approachOr, using the regex module(?:^|\s):\S+(*SKIP)(*F) will effectively ignore strings starting with :(?: means non-capturing group
