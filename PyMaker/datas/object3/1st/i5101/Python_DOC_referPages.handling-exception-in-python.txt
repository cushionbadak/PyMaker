I have written Python code which does some calculation. During this it converts string to float. However sometimes numeric string value may be empty that time its giving me valueError. I tried to keep that in try catch block however its going to another exception block as shown below.Its going to os error block instead of ValueError block
That's not how you capture exceptions.(Note, though, there's no instance when calling float would raise an OSError.)
