I have the following class for opening my websockets:Followed by some async handling methods for incoming messages. The loop function for getting the messages runs in its own thread, just for information.I am able to terminate the program, however I was not able to close the sockets properly, cause it causes the following error on the restart of the scriptSince the port is already in use. Usually I would use some .close() function, however the websocket package does not provide such function, so I am wondering if I can get this done with the os package or the websocket package?
The proper shutdown process is discussed here. The basic idea is to use the serve() method as an async context manager.For example, stop can be a Future. The await "returns" when you call stop.set_result(). The context manager will then shutdown the server gracefully.Usually, you would use a signal handler to trigger the stop condition (an example is also included in the docs).You also might get the error, when the socket is not opened with socket.SO_REUSEADDR by the framework. See this question for details.
