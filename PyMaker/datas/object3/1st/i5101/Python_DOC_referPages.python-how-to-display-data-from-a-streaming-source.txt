I'm new to Python (and computer programming) but for my employer I have set up a Python script updates 30 different variables as new data comes in from a streaming source.What is the best or easiest way to display these 30 variables in a table that updates as the variables change?Currently I have the script printing a new table to the console every time one of the variables changes and it leaves me with a giant collections of tables and I assume there is a better way to do this.Thanks.
Assuming you want a terminal display, you could try the built in curses library for an updating, not constantly pinning table of data.
