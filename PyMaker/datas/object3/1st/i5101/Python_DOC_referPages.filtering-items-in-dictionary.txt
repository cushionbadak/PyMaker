I would like to filter items out of one dictionary where that dictionary contains items of another dictionary.  So, say that I have two dictionary's dict1 and dict2 where I would like to match on account_id, case and date and have the output be a third dictionary with matched entries from dict2 being 1 and 3.How would I accomplish this?  I am using Python 3.5
Well then, I believe this is what you are looking for:For more info about count() and itemgetter(), see their respective docs.Using a set and generator comprehensions ensures efficiency at the highest level.
