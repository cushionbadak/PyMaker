I've got a Flask app module (app.py) which looks like thisI've got unit tests for the Flask app defined in a module AppTests in the tests subpackage.The test for the healthcheck endpoint passes but the test for the  get_keys endpoint fails.It looks like the reference to the logger object in the get_keys endpoint in the app is null when I make the call to self.app.post('/get_keys, headers=headers.items(), data=data). Every call to logger.info is generating an exception in the endpoint, which is caught and logged, and that's what I am seeing when I run the endpoint test.Is there a way to mock this, or some how bypass the use of logger from the tests module itself? I would rather not modify the endpoint method itself.
You could potentially mock out the logging import when you run test_get_keys__csv().If you're using Python 2, mock is a separate install.and then import withMore info on mock: https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html
