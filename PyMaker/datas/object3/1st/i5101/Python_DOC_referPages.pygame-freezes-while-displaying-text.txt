Natural Text
I'm creating the base of a game that will have scrolling text and text wrapping when a line of text goes to far on the screen.Everything works (so far) but at a certain point when using my default_display_text function pygame stops responding. It always stops around the "broke, slap some fancy words" part when I use my default_display_text function with greeting as the variable.I've been able to solve all my other problems with google but this one has got me really stuck! I'll be glad to give any other information and I hope you understand what my code does with help from the comments.
The Python Debugger is your friend. Start your program using the syntaxEnter "c" for continue into the cliAs soon as your program seems to freeze, press CTRL+CYou should then be able to analyze the current state of the program using the debugger. For instance entering "where" into the cli, you should see the current callstack and line number.
