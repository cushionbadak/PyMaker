Natural Text
Also, why won't it write the data I input into the the text file, anytime I open the actual text file, It's empty.What does the syntax error actually mean? It is a password re-setter for school that I have no idea how to fix.
The real problem which you are facing currently is because once you wrote data inside file you never closed it. Means when you again open it in read mode there won't be any committed data inside it. Sure the file is created but you need to close the connection to commit the data. Just take the look at updated code snippet I fixed it with few minor issues too so you can move ahead.Let me know if you face any issue here while trying to make sense of it.
