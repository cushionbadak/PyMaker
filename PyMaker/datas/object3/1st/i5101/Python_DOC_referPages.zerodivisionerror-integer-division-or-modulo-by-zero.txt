I am building a simple algorithm to find common divisors between two given numbers: Why is my programm having this ZeroDivisionError?
Start your range() at 1, not 0 with:Code:Test Code:Results:
I actually just wanted to indent the code in your question, but I ended up accidentally repairing it. So, here is a working solution:Output:The range starts with 2, because 1 is a unit, and therefore not interesting as divisor (it divides everything anyway). The 0 should not be checked, because it does not divide anything, and because it caused Div-by-zero errors.Whatever... Refreshed some python...
Your loop starts with 0 so this ZeroDivisionError occurs.exception ZeroDivisionError  Raised when the second argument of a division or modulo operation is zero. The associated value is a string indicating the type of the operands and the operation.[source]You have to start your for loop from 1like this: for n in range(1,i+1):and you don't have to do while loop this will go infinite.your code will be:or you can also write your code in try-except block, like this which will give the same output:output
Function range() can have up to 3 arguments:range(initial limit included, final limit not included, step)If you use for x in range(y) with only one argument, and such case isequal to: for y in range(0, x, 1) # including: [0, 1, ..., x - 1]If you need to start your range with 1, you need to define it: for yin range(1, y)If you need to change range step, you also need to define it: for yin range(0, -50, -1)
