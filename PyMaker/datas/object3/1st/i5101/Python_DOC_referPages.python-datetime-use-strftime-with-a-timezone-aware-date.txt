Suppose I have date d like this : As you can see, it is "timezone aware", there is an offset of 2 Hour, utctime is So, real UTC date is 19th March 2009 23:12:00, right ? Now I need to format my date in string, I use Which doesn't seems to take this offset into account. How to fix that ? 
In addition to what @Slam has already answered:If you want to output the UTC time without any offset, you can doSee datetime.astimezone in the Python docs.
The reason is python actually formatting your datetime object, not some "UTC at this point of time"To show timezone in formatting, use %z or %Z.Look for strf docs for details
This will convert your local time to UTC and print it:(http://pytz.sourceforge.net/)
