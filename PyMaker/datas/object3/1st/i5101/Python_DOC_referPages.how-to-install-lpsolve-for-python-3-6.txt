So I am creating a Docker container with python 3.6 runtime. I need a UX64 version of lp_solver (http://lpsolve.sourceforge.net/5.5/index.htm) for python. The one linked is python 2.7. I have found the following: https://github.com/chandu-atina/lp_solve_python_3x but it does not work either. Tried both approaches. I have really no idea how to get this lp_solver to work on Ubuntu Python 3.6. Is there something like the following: https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#lp_solve but for Ubuntu?Also found this, which worked: https://anaconda.org/snorfalorpagus/lpsolvebut I cannot import lpsolve. (here is the question linked for importing lpsolve: Conda installation of lpsolve)EDIT 1:Here are the steps that I take://Creates Python directory! Just make sure that origin is extra/Pythonon sh ccc I get tons of syntax errors in .h files. Here:sorry for the snippet, when I enclose in code, it gives me the errors here. 
How I got lpsolve working with python 3.5.3 on raspbian:Install from repositoryGet Python source code from sourceforge (https://sourceforge.net/projects/lpsolve/files/lpsolve/5.5.2.5/lp_solve_5.5.2.5_Python_source.tar.gz/download).Extract the tar fileStart the installation by runningThe source files had some non-python3 related issues in my case.lp_lib.h could not be found. Solved by adding '/usr/include/lpsolve' to the include_dirs in setup.pymultiple defined error for functions defined in hash.c. Solved by removing the "hash.c" file from the files to be compiled and linked in setup.py.Undefined reference symamd. Solved by adding "colamd" to the libraries in setup.pyPython3 related issues:print ... has changed to print(...). Updated in setup.pyPyString has changed to PyUnicode/PyBytes and PyInt to PyLong (https://docs.python.org/3/howto/cporting.html). Updated in pythonmod.cInit module function changed (https://docs.python.org/2.3/whatsnew/node20.html, Difference between PyMODINIT_FUNC and PyModule_Create and https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/module.html). Updated in pythonmod.csetup.py diffpythonmod.c diffVerify that the install works as indicated in the documentation of lpsolve (http://lpsolve.sourceforge.net/5.5/Python.htm#Installation)
