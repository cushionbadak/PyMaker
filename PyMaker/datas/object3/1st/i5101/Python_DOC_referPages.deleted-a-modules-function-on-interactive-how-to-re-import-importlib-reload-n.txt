I've deleted a (package builtin) function on ipython:OK. But how do I reload the function? This didn't help:
The above code works for me in Python 3.4 on Windows but the documentation for 3.6 states:Beware though, as if you keep a reference to the module object, invalidate its cache entry in sys.modules, and then re-import the named module, the two module objects will not be the same. By contrast, importlib.reload() will reuse the same module object, and simply reinitialise the module contents by rerunning the moduleâ€™s code.(so maybe I was only "lucky")so what is pretty sure to work is:It still works, and you don't even need reload. Just remove from cache & import again.As noted in comments, using reload also works, but you need to update the module reference given by reload, not just reuse the same old one with the cos entry missing:
OK people, I wrote a little module to solve this confusion.I sincerely doubt that it is buggless. So improvements are welcome.This module works nicely both on Py 2 and 3. Tried on Python 2.7 and Python 3.5.
