I have this code for my alarm clock program, which checks if the input is of the form HH:MM:SS.It works fine unless, for example, the input is "00:00:00", in which case the output is "0:0:0" instead of the expected output with each unit padded to two digits. Why is this happening?
Consider the line hour = int(alarm[0:2]) when alarm is "00:00:00":alarm[0:2] will be "00" and int("00") is the integer 0.The same happens for minute and second. When you interpolate the values of hour, minute, and second, then the result is "0:0:0".You can pad the hour, minute, and second values to two digits by changing your print statement to
Change print(("\nsets to %s:%s:%s\n" % (hour, minute, second)))toprint(("\nsets to %02d:%02d:%02d\n" % (hour, minute, second)))This will make it so that instead of printing 2:0:0 or 0:0:0 you will print 02:00:00 or 00:00:00
Since you are formatting the values into strings, you could do without the conversion from strings to integers:Also, instead of the % operator, I would use str.format() which is a more powerful string formatting method:
