I need to find all the elements in an array that are >0 and then replace each one with a random number between 0 and 5 in Python 3.I have made an array (called L) of 20 elements that each equal 0 or 1, but am struggling to replace elements individually. (However in future this may equal a range of numbers, so I need >0 and not just =1)I do not want as this changed all the elements >0 to the same random number.Any ideas?
Perhaps this will help you. 
Perhaps this?I instantiate L with a special pattern, so that it should be easy to discern if the code does what's intended.I should mention that this code does not replace individual elements in L. It creates a new list. However, unless the list is especially large this would make no difference, in fact might be slightly faster. (This might be why someone down-voted. You just can't please everyone.)
