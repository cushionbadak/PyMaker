I have a java program that I have to run from python, get the output and store the result in 3 variables (if it works as expected, should print 3 values, each one on a different line).This is the code that I'm using:If the path1 is not found by the test.jar program it will output a message to check the path.Is there a way to check if the program executed correctly, and only then store the output?
You should use https://docs.python.org/2/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.check_output
You could check the returned code of the subprocess explicitly:Note: this code runs java executable without starting a new shell.The code uses the explicit utf-8 encoding to avoid depending on the default locale encoding that might not support all necessary characters.A minimal code change in your case would be to replace getoutput() with getstatusoutput() which returns (exitcode, output) tuple and check whether exitcode is zero to determine success. getstatusoutput() starts a new shell    even if it is unnecessary and therefore it is not recommended. Also, passing path unescaped opens you to the shell command injection vulnerability if you start the shell.getstatusoutput() calls check_output() internally and catches the exception (it is equivalent to the previous answer).
