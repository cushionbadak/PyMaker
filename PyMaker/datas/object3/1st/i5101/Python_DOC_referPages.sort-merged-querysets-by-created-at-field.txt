I try to sorted two merged QuerySets by created_at field and DESC (from max to min):But this way not working: QuerySet still sorting by ID and ASC (from min to max). How to solve that with my case?
Okay, I founded solution in Python Docs:Both list.sort() and sorted() accept a reverse parameter with a boolean value. This is used to flag descending sorts. For example, to get the student data in reverse age order:See: https://docs.python.org/3/howto/sorting.html#ascending-and-descending
