Natural Text
I have a list of tuples. I want to get rid of first 2 chars and last char of all first tuple elements.it should return as below (b' and ' has been removed from every first tuple element)tried below but got TypeError: 'tuple' object is not callable
Just a little bit of list comprehension:
I agree with @juanpa.arrivillaga's comment, you should fix a bad output of a function if you can modify it. But if you can't, this solution would work.Basically, this solutions takes the entry, reads it as a bytes object (using ast.literal_eval()). Then converts it to a string object (using bytes.decode()). I think this is a more natural solution than just removing the first two, and the last character.
You are using map incorrectly. The first parameter has to be a function or a lambda. i[2:len(i[0])-1] is neither. So you can either define a function that does the same thing, i.e.:Or just use an inline lambda:
