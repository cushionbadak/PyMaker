This question already has an answer here:Why should __all__ only contain string objects?                    2 answers                I found myself using the following pattern in the __init__.py files:The code like that works will all python versions that I have ever tried, but it seems that this is an accident. I have not seen it mentioned anywhere that __all__ can be a list of objects (rather than strings), and also, this is reported as an error when running mypy:Type of __all__ must be "Sequence[str]", not "List[object]"Is there any reason why __all__ should be list of strings? Or are objects ok too?
You will break from mymod import * by doing this. __all__ isn't used otherwise.
