On an embedded device running a C application, I have defined this struct:On request, I send this struct via sockets: and read it from a Python script on my desktop:This is the data printed to console on my desktop:How can i reassemble the data into a YourStruct?Note that the embedded device uses little endian, so I have had to use struct.unpack("<" + "f" * 2048, data) to reassemble an array of floats.
[Python]: struct â€” Interpret bytes as packed binary data contains all the needed intel.code.py:Notes:Starting from the point where the data (data) was received from the socketThe format passed to struct.unpack (fmt arg) tells it how the data is organized: in our case it's "<fic": float, int, char (preceded by the little endian marker)Also calculating the size (in bytes) of data that the format requires: it's 9 (4 + 4 + 1). data has 12 bytes, so ignoring the last 3, otherwise struct.unpack will spit struct.errorCheck [SO]: Python struct.pack() behavior for more details on struct.packOutput:
