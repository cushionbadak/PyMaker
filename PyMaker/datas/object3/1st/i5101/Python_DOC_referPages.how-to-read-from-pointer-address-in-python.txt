I want to read in a Python script a number of bytes starting from a specific address. E.g., I want to read 40000 bytes starting from 0x561124456.The pointer is given from a C# app. I want to use this method to pass data between the app and script. I've used a TCP socket via localhost, but I want to try this method also.How can I do this?
If you really want to, enjoy:Looks like segfault fun. There are good socket-connection libraries on both languages (sockets, RPC etc...), so I would think about this again if this is for some large project.
I happened to work on the similar issue. My python script load .so library to get an image buffer address from c++ .so. After I got the buffer address, I need to be able to read each byte in the buffer. I used "from_address" to create a list object:The following shows the details how to get memory address passed from c++ to pyth and how to access the memory data on python side too. In c++ code frameprovider.cpp:My python:
Once I got a pointer of memory location from C, I found "list(listSize * listDataType).from_address(memoryPointer)" created a internal copy of C memeory. If the data in memory is huge, Python takes a long time to create a list object by using internal copy. To avoid internal copy, I used the ctypelib.as_array in python:
