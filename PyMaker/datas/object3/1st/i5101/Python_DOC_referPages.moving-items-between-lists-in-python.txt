So I have recently began programming in earnest with Automate the Boring the Stuff, and after reading the chapters on basic syntax decided to start working on a Blackjack game. However, I ran into a problem when dealing out the cards. I have the main deckand have a separate empty list called playerHand. I understand that I can use .append and random.choice to pick a card at random and add it to playerHand[], but this doesn't remove the cards from deck[].The only way I could think of would be to randomly generate a number between one and the amount of cards left in deck, set a variable to that number, set another variable to the card at that index, add that card to playerHand[], and then finally delete the card at that index in deck[]. Is there a way to do it that doesn't involve 2 temporary variables?
Yes, use list.pop.list.pop will remove the value at the given index and return it:Note that, by default pop will pop the value at the last index (l[-1]).So, in your case, you can do a random.shuffle-ing of the list and pop:
Instead of randomly choosing an element, randomly choose an index. You can then remove the element at that index and append it to another list in one single line with pop:
