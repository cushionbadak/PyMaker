Environment :UnixPython version : 2.7I have a scenario where I am fetching some amount of data from an API and then storing it in a text file.I am running the python script with scheduled cron jobs of interval 30 minutes.while running it if the value of count is increased by 1 the previous value is changed to recent increased/decreased count if not then it runs same.what I am trying to implement is if the count is increased on first run it I will store the value temporarily then again on next run after 30 minutes comparison should happen with the previous value not the recent increased/decreased count, and then if the count is still increased/decreased then store it permanently and proceed further.codeI am new to python can anybody help to acheive this ,what should I use in order to achieve this.
Your json file will look something like thisBasically, I am storing the recent node counts value as latest and maintaining the history (recent ones get appended at the end of it).
