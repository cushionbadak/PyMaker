I am writing code for an assignment based on given pseudocode, but I keep getting this error message:'int' object is not subscriptableI'm not sure what it means or where I went wrong even after searching what the error means.My assignment: In a class with students n >= 2, a bully is a student who is afraid of no one in the class but every other person in the class is afraid of the bully. You are asked to determine if there is a bully in a class. In your task, you are allowed to consider any pair of students (i, j) and ask student i if they are afraid of student j. Although you are allowed to ask as many (possibly intersecting) pairs of students as you wish, your objective is to minimize the number of such questions you need to ask, since the interrogation process can be rather traumatic for bullied students. Assume that all students are truthful when asked.We will represent the class as an n-by-n matrix A, where the entry A[i][j] is 1 if student i is afraid of student j and 0 otherwise. We will set A[i][i] as 0.Note: "student is afraid of student" does not imply that student is a bully.Given pseudocode:--What I wrote so far:Please help me identify the error in my code so I can correct it!
In your second for ... in loop, i is an integer for every iteration of the loop. When you attempt to subscript the integer with i[1] in the line if i[1] > i[2], you should expect to get the error youâ€™re seeing.range() returns an immutable sequence of integers, as you can see in the documentation.You should not be subscripting an integer. Instead, it looks like you want to append the integers to your list newC.
