I am going through Flask source. I see a lot of statements likeI am not Python novice so I understand what from and  import keywords do. But what is from . ? Could someone explain with an example?Edit1:My question is about just import . not import .moduleEdit2:how is from . import x different from from import x
from . import xWill import locally to that script.Python includes a json library so Is used to avoid importing the standard library json and instead import a local python module
It is an example of Intra-package references in python. (Check out section 6.4.2 on https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html)When writing packages in python, from . import X is used to import sub-packages from the parent class, i.e. importing a sibling class. The . is only used to refer to the parent package in the relative path. However, you can always import parent package without using the . in import statement, by using the name of the parent package name/path. Using . is just a handy shortcut.
