I have a file that contains .odt files and I would like to convert them to pdf. My current function works fine, the problem is that even if the file is already converted, the function converts it again, and I do not want to convert a file if it is already converted.Is there a way to check if the name.odt and name.pdf files already exist?
There are a few things that are not right with your code. Here's the minimal modifications I made to make it work:Here are my comments about my modifications:For some reason I couldn't understand, I wasn't able to install the comtypes module. So I used the win32com module that comes with Python for Win32 (pywin32) extensions. I think it pretty similar.I opened the Word connector object outside of the loop. You don't really need to open and close it every time you want to open a document. I couldn't make your code work without doing that and it should speedup the execution.I changed your variable name from file to input_file because at one time the name was already assigned to something in Python and that could spell disaster, if I remember correctly. I think this isn't as relevant today, but it's always a good habit to have descriptive name for your variables.Your code seemed to print that all the file are converted when it find an already existant PDF file. I couldn't understand why you would want to do that. So I have put a message when the PDF file has already been created and put your message outside the loop.Since you seem to be working with files in the local directory. I added a command to change the working directory.But we can go further and simplify your code:I used the pathlib module which has a lot of provisions to simplify your code
