TLDR; PyString_FromString doesn't work in Python3.5 so I need an alternative.I am following an example for including python 3 within a C++ project from this python documentation:https://docs.python.org/3/extending/embedding.htmlEverything is working fine but now I want to change the line that reads:pValue = PyLong_FromLong(atoi(argv[i + 3]));to the following (I also no longer use i, that was from a loop):pValue = PyString_FromString("A string instead of a number");It seems the PyString_FromString function is no longer an option Python3.5 and I get the following error when I compile the code with g++:Any idea on how I get around this? No matter what I look for I can't seem to find a solution that doesn't throw an error. I need to pass a string to my Python file and I have a string to start with already.
PyUnicode_FromString()
