Natural Text
I have two folders. FolderA contains dozens of executables, FolderB contains an initial input file and a subsequent input file (both text files). I would like to write a script that will do the following:Create folder for each of the executablesCopy corresponding executable and a copy of the initial input file into this new folderRun executable for this input fileOnce process is complete, copy subsequent input file and run executable againEnd when this second process is doneThis could easily be a for loop and I could accomplish this using the os package, unfortunately I'd like to see if there is a way to run this process in parallel for all the executables, or some strategic number of executables at a given iteration.I've never done parallel processing before and I also have no idea how it can be accomplished for such a two-step execution process. Any help would be most appreciated. Thanks.
You can easily use multiprocessing for that.Write a function which runs the entire process for a given executable:Then feed it into map:
