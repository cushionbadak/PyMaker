I am trying to convert an integer into its binary value and then print out the sum of its digits. my code is as follows:but when I try to phrase the logic in another way it gives an error and I cannot figure why:thank you in advance for your help!regards,Andy
This expression gives an interable which is why sum(int(item) for item in binary_number) works.These linesset item successively to "1" "1" "1" "1" "0" and inside the loop your code does sum(int(item)) which resolves to either sum(1) or sum(0). Now do you see why sum() doesn't do what you expect? As the error message says, an 'int' object is not iterable. Since you don't have an iterable, you need to do your own summing:
Your rephrasing changed the semantics fromto
Mapping the binary number to integers and summing them will give the desired result.
