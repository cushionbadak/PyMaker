You have a couple of lists of variable lengths, each starting where the previous one finished:These lists should be transformed so that their range is from their start number to +233, but keeping the same number of elements: list_a 100 elements, list_b 50 elements etc.So in the end the lists should look like:I can't just change the first and last members of the list, because the difference must be spread evenly between members of the list.So list_a must look like this because it's last member is lower than 233:list_d has more than 233 members so we should subtract:Any idea how to calculate the some_value for all lists?Thanks!
If you want to evenly space X points between two endpoints you can use numpy.linspace:
