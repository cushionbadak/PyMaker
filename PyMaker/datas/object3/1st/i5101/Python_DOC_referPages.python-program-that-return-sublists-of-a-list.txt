Please I want to design a function that return all possible subset of a list.  Here is the code I tried 
Just using iterative method for doing this as i looped from 0 to 2^(length of list) and select each element based on the value of the loop counterThat is if the loop counter is 5 we select the first and third element as 5 in binary is represented as 101 the we select the index elements with 1 in binary likewise for 7 we need first three elements 111 OUTPUTalso you might want convert this function to a generator as the returned list will be huge if the inputlist contains large number of values 
If what you're looking for is the powerset, itertools' recipe page has a nice, concise, memory-safe way to do that:Worth pointing out that finding a powerset is exponential O(2^n). Also, this question had been previously answered here.
