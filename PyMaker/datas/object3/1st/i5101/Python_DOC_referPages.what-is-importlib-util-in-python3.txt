I am trying to pip install importlib with python 3.6, but I get an Import Error saying: 'NO Module named "importlib.util"'. This also comes up when I try to pip install imagescanner, which is my real intention. Building an App that connects to Image Scanner Devices, but that's another problem...Thanks for any help!
importlib is builtin with Python 3 (at least for me), you can import it directly without installing anything.The error from pip install is possibly due to importlib is builtin and there's no distribution that's publicly available.
