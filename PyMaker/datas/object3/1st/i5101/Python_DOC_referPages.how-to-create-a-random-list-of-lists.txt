How can you create a random list of lists. The random.sample(range(80), 10) produces a list of 10 items up to 80. Example Output:But can can you add more data so it is a list of lists? Desired Output:
Encapsulate the results of random.sample in a list and apply the * operator:
You can use itertools.repeatThe idea behind itertools recipes is to consume it lazily. So its a better to use it like:
Maybe the solution to give a better explanation is to think about what kind of list you need to generate. A list can represent a lot of data like items in a table, a market list and lots of other good representations.Following some quality patterns of production all in relation of code you can made each item be generate by a factor and the list presented on the stack pile or collection of data be generated in a right portable way.Get arguments based on the program input:First of all utilize that can be made a shot a-top from a horse:The ceil function to work with a calculation of the seed factor a prediction generation be a machine round not a human like sequences:The sample function generation offered on the box:A seed function utilize to limit random generation or increase without a default value offered by the implementation:A better usage of iterations can be made using the following function:Now you can have this with the following behavior attached round ups with correction:One first anonymous lambda function for a small generation:Another to work for a nice process of the list:In a world who cats can be predict or read the list this can not made a damage on the brain of the animal by example. On the another running a lot have an damage, thinking on the cat like your processor... this can be extend the computer life time.All of that can be used on a large context not explained on the description but you need to think on your implementation.A little observation the pattern used on the native function for a iteration can made an argument specific allocation without call up on the variable with an addressable content this avoid the usage on context just for debug.I think this can help in equality with another answers because is need a good explanation for a small or big implementation.After that you can call the function on the specific condition.
