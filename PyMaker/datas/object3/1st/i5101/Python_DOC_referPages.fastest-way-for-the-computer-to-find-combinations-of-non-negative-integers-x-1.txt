I want to find an efficient way for computer to handle LARGE NUMBER OF VARIABLES (say 50: x1, ... , x50) that do something like this:find ALL combinations [x1,x2,x3]satisfying:0 <= x1 <= x2 <= x3x1 + x2 + x3 = 100Here is an example of finding all combinations with sum = 100 but [1,99] and [99,1] are considered to be different here:I want to find a way to reduce the number of loops and give only things like:[0,100], [1,99], [2,98], .........., [50,50]And nothing from [51,49].The main goal is doing this with 50 variables (x_1,...x_50) which sums up to 100.It is not likely to do it with normal loop
For 3 variables of form i+j+k==100 we need two for loops and for n variables we need n-1 for loops to produce the result Result Edit 1or if you dont want to write the code for n-1 loops use this recurisive function and it will be faster as i did some optimization to reduce its runtimehere the n is 3 (number of variables)and sum is 100 produces the same output as above  
what about combinaison  ??output
