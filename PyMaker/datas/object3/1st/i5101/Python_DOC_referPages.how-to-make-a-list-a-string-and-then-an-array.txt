Natural Text
Right now I'm trying to convert a .txt file with two columns of data into an array with two columns of data. At this point I've extracted the data and have this:I'm trying to get that data into something usable (I think I need to get rid of the commas but I'm new to Python and don't even know how to do this). Any help would be appreciated on getting these numbers into a usable form for operations(multiply, add, divide, etc.)!
I believe this is the best you can do. The commas are fine, they just indicate separate elements of a python list. Notice the quotation marks disappear to indicate you are no longer dealing with text strings.
