Here the code I'm using; I run it with Python 3.6 in Anaconda:and I get an error of:
You are running a command-line script in your IDE, with the runfile() command and no command-line arguments.argparse is working correctly. A required argument is missing (because sys.argv is not set when using runfile()), and so raises the SystemExit exception with the correct error code to exit the command-line script.You appear to be using Spyder, in which case you'd have to set the command-line options with the Run > Configuration per file option and add your command line options to the Command line options box. See Not sure how to use argv with Spyder.
