If I print out a dataframe directly, I get the correct output with correct datatypes. However, when I try to iterate the same dataframe, the datatypes are changing.Here is my program:As you can see from the screenshot below, the data types of df_between, df_within and df_total have not been preserved while iterating. They are changing from int to float data type. What is the way I can preserve the data types while iterating a dataframe?
From the docs:Because iterrows returns a Series for each row, it does not preserve dtypes across the rows (dtypes are preserved across columns for DataFrames).You could use DataFrame.itertuples() and get namedtuples for each row.Changing your column names to valid Python identifiers might make more sense:I haven't found, in the docs, an explicit statement that Series datatype is homogeneous, but it is inferred,it acts like a Numpy ndarray, and the constructor has a dtype parameter which applies to all the values in the Series:One-dimensional ndarray with axis labels (including time series).Looks like even if only one value in the Series is a float, the series dtype will be float:
Thank you so much wwii. Yeah that worked out very well. The code below is what I needed. Thanks again for your help.I get this output:
