I have some data that I'm trying to group together:So simply, for each unique Serial_Num, I want the coordinates. I'm expecting something similar to:And then I can loop through the GPS coordinates for each Serial_Num and plot.I have some scripts that I have used elsewhere, but mainly relies on the .csv data being used to set up a dictionary, with the Serial_Num as the key.However, the data in the csv is sequential, and the sequence is important.  What's a way to output, for each Serial_Num, the list of coordinates, in order as they are in the CSV?Edit: I'm looking at Pandas right now, as it has a groupBy method that may help.
This is one way. Breakdown of each step below.Read the dataMake tuple columnCreate dictionary
GivenA file named foo.csv:And some code to parse the data as a tuples of (serial, coordinates):CodeWe build a nesting of defaultdicts:Output
