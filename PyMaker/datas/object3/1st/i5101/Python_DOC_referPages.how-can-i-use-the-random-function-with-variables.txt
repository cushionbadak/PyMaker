I want creating a random number generator which allows to define the min and max.How can i fix this code :
You forgot to change the string input to integer. See the below code snippet :Also your code might not gonna run if minimum is greater than maximum. So better handle it.
Whenever an Exception (an error) is raised in your code, the program stops runnning and displays an error message. In this case it might have shown the following message on your screen:This is the way Python tells you that you did something wrong. In fact, you already got a hint of what to do to solve it: the function randrange() only accepts integer arguments.First you might take a look at Exceptions in The Python Standard Library, and understand what the exception ValueError (the one raised in this case) actually means. Also, take a look at the definition of the input() function, and what it really does to whatever the user sent through the prompt.Then, try running your code again, but assigning your variables like this:
