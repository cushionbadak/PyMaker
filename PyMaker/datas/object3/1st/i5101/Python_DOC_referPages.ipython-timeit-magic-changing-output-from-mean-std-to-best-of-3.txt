I am using an IPython 6.2.1 integration with Eclipse/PyDev on Ubuntu. Python version is 3.5.2.I often see people timing a script like When I perform the same operation, my output isImho, "best of 3" is the better measure, so I would like to change my output. I read both, the IPython and the Python timeit documentation. They both don't even mention, that the output could differ from "best of 3". Is this a question of Linux/Eclipse/PyDev implementation or is there a way to change the output of the timeit module?P.S.: The same happens in the Eclipse console, when I use timeit, so IPython is probably irrelevant here. Unutbu pointed out that you can achieve the desired behaviour from within a program. Running the first script calling timeit.main() here indeed returns the best of 3. But I would prefer a version that I can run interactively in the Eclipse console.
The display is generated by a TimeitResult object (see the timeit?? code listing).  With the -o option I get that object which I can examine:It looks like the information to generate the best of 3 display is still there, but the formatter is gone.  It might be found in an older version.Code is in IPython/core/magics/execution.py
This syntax std/mean/dev was added to IPython in 5 Oct 2016. See the issue #9984 https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/9984 about this improvement. And the implementation is here:"Added mean + stdv to the %timeit magic - New tests pending - "https://github.com/ipython/ipython/commit/509d8539c555ede6222d13cf1693388429213853#diff-ee52fbe4422737ccaa3d6d0b15ea5189but syntax "best of 3" comes from python timeit module in main() function and this is generally the same in python2 and 3.
