I have a list of 30 integers (GRADES[30]) from 0-100.I need to create a new list of 30 integers (NEW[30]) in a function, that has the same integers of GRADES[30] + 3 except those that have the value of 97(because it would exceed 0-100).Can someone help me on how to do it?For example if GRADES[5]=57, NEW[5] must be 60. 
You can use a list comprehension for that like:Code:To drop grades > 97:To clip grades to 100:
This is an in place solution. If your list is not a numpy array you can convert it to one using x = np.array(lst).
