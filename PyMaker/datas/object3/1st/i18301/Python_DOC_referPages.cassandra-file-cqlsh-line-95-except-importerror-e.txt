I am having trouble getting Cassandra up and running.I have downloaded Cassandra 2.0.1 and Python 3.3.2.Upon starting the CLI for cassandra I get an error:Any suggestions? I am going to downgrade python to 2.7 and see if that fixes my issue.Thanks!
The version of Cassandra that you are using is only compatible with Python 2.x.  The following syntax:was deprecated in Python 2.7 and removed in Python 3.x.  Nowadays, you use the as keyword:This means that you need to either downgrade to Python 2.x or get a version of Cassandra that is compatible with Python 3.x.
