How can I import an arbitrary python source file (whose filename could contain any characters, and does not always ends with .py) in Python 3.3+?I used imp.load_module as follows:It still works in Python 3.3, but according to imp.load_module documentation, it is deprecated:Deprecated since version 3.3: Unneeded as loaders should be used to  load modules and find_module() is deprecated.and imp module documentation recommends to use importlib:Note New programs should use importlib rather than this module.What is the proper way to load an arbitrary python source file in Python 3.3+ without using the deprecated imp.load_module function?
Found a solution from importlib test code.Using importlib.machinery.SourceFileLoader:NOTE: only works in Python 3.3+.UPDATE Loader.load_module is deprecated since Python 3.4. Use Loader.exec_module instead:
Shorter version of @falsetrue 's solution:I tested it with Python 3.5 and 3.6.  According to the comments, it does not work with arbitrary file extensions.
Similar to @falsetru but for Python 3.5+ and accounting for what the importlib doc states on using importlib.util.module_from_spec over types.ModuleType:This function [importlib.util.module_from_spec] is preferred over using types.ModuleType to create a new  module as spec is used to set as many import-controlled attributes on  the module as possible.We are able to import any file with importlib alone by modifying the importlib.machinery.SOURCE_SUFFIXES list.
