When I am using in curses under Python, I can capture the enter key which wnd.getch returns 10. However it does not work when I replaced getch by get_wch. Is there any problems with get_wch?
The functions getch and get_wch have different interfaces:getch returns a characterget_wch returns a status code, and sets a wide character via the pointer passed as a parameter.They use different interfaces because special keys (such as KEY_HOME) can be handled with getch as "extra" characters beyond the range of "normal" (8-bit) characters.  You cannot do that with wide characters (not as easily, since the end of the wide character range is less definite), so get_wch uses a status code to tell if the value that it sets via the pointer is a wide character or a special key.Although the manual page is clear enough, the python developers did not notice this distinction when adding the feature to the curses wrapper.  The description in the Python documentation corresponds to getch rather than get_wch:Issues #15785: curses.get_wch() returns keypad codes incorrectlyThe bug report indicates that a fix was applied to python 3.4.16.10. curses â€” Terminal handling for character-cell displayswindow.get_wch([y, x])Get a wide character.
