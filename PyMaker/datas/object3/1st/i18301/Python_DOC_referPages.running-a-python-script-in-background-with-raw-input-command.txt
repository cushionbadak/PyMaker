I have a python script that has a raw input command, but I would like to run it in the background after the user inputs the raw_input part. The problem I have is if I try running the script in the background using &, the raw input pops up as a linux command and the python script doesn't recognize it.Any tips?
You can use fork to create a child process and then exit the parent.
You probably want to run the script in the foreground, but then call os.fork() after the user has input the value.
