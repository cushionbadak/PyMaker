Natural Text
If I have a text file like this:How would I read it into a multidimensional array like this:I have tried:But it just returns:How do I read the file into a multidimensional array?
Use a list comprehension and str.split:Demo:with statement:It is good practice to use the with keyword when dealing with file  objects. This has the advantage that the file is properly closed after  its suite finishes, even if an exception is raised on the way. It is  also much shorter than writing equivalent try-finally blocks.
You can use map with the unbound method str.split:In Python 3.x, you have to use list(map(str.split, ...)) to get a list because map in Python 3.x return an iterator instead of a list.
Also don't forget to use strip to remove the \n:
Adding to the accepted answer:This will remove '\n' if it is appended to the end of each line.
A good answer would be :Which is optimized for readability.But python syntax let's us use less code:And also python let's us do it only in one line!!
