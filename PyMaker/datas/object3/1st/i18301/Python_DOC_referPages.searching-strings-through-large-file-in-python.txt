I am currently working on my first Python project and I need to parse through a 2GB file.I've found out that if I went line by line it would be very very slow...However the buffering method, using:Here the print line doesn't print a "line", it only prints a character at a time per line. So I am having problem doing substring find on it...Please Help!
print line prints a character because buf is a string, and iterating over a string yields the characters of the string as 1-character strings.When you say that reading line-by-line was slow, how did you implement the read? If you were using readlines(), that would explain the slowness (see  http://stupidpythonideas.blogspot.com/2013/06/readlines-considered-silly.html).Files are iterable over their lines, and Python will pick a buffer size when iterating, so this might suit your needs:If you want to specify the buffer size manually, you could also do this:Though, the first of the two is usually better.
The problem is that buf is a string...Say buf = "abcd"That means, buf[0] = a, buf[1]=b and so on.would result in abcdThat means in your for-loop, you do not loop over "lines", but over all elements of the buf-string. You may use readlines or split your buffer to single lines by looking for "\n".
