I have an issue with my python code to make beeping noises.It just does an infinite loop of beeps even though it should stop.Thanks for any help
If you are using Python 3.x, input() returns a string object.Comparing string object with int always return False.You should convert string object to int before compare them:BTW, it's better to use following instead of while loop:
Your problem is that input() on Python 3 returns a string, so b will be a string, and therefore y == b will never be True.Use 
Changeto You are reading b as string and comparing it against an int inwhich will never be True. Thats why your code is infinitely looping.
