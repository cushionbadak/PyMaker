I'm trying to implement a subclass and it throws the error: TypeError: worker() takes 0 positional arguments but 1 was given
Your worker method needs 'self' as a parameter, since it is a class method and not a function. Adding that should make it work fine.
If the method doesn't require self as an argument, you can use the @staticmethod decorator to avoid the error:See https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#staticmethod
You forgot to add self as a parameter to the function worker() in the class KeyStatisticCollection.
