I wanted to change current user for script execution. I did thisI am still getting root. Is there better way than this? I want switch user once and then continue rest of the commands execution in the script with that new user.  
getpass.getuser() doesn't use getuid() or geteuid() to get the current user.http://docs.python.org/3/library/getpass.html#getpass.getuserThis function checks the environment variables LOGNAME, USER, LNAME and USERNAME, in order, and returns the value of the first one which is set to a non-empty string. If none are set, the login name from the password database is returned on systems which support the pwd module, otherwise, an exception is raised.
After trying modules os, subprocess, getpass, I realised that the problem is not whether the user is set. The user gets set or gets changed using os.setuid, however, the methods from modules to get username like os.getlogin(), getpass.getuser(), actually does not get username properly. If you run a shell command whoami or idusing subprocess.Popen() or os.system(), you will get the changed user. These are little puzzled outputs for me. Below is script which shows all these weird behaviours.
