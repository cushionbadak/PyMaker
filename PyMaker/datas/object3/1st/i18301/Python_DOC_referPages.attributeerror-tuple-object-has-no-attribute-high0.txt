I am trying to write a list of data to an excel spreadsheet. Something is going wrong when I try to iterate over my entire list in parallel. I get the following error: I am importing a separate script that successfully returns all the variables (high0, low0, etc.). This is the script I am running when I receive the error:EDIT:Here is the script I import into this one:Any ideas? Thanks!
I also don't understand why you need to use zip(), but if you are positive you need it, try it like this:This way you are acessing the first (and only) element of the tuple created by zip(cities).Again, I dont see why you can't use for c in cities:, which looks way better, but this might solve your problem.
The error is on the expression c.high0.If you look at what c is, it's one of the elements of a zip:And that means it's a tuple. That's what zip does: it takes an iterable of sequences, and turns it into an iterable of tuples, where each tuple has one member of each sequence.If you can explain what you expected each c to be, or why you're calling zip, we could probably explain how to do it properly.
