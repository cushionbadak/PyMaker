This question already has an answer here:Don't understand why UnboundLocalError occurs [duplicate]                    8 answers                So basically I have no idea what is wrong with this small piece of code, and it seems like I can't find a way to make it work.The error I get is:Note: I can't place the "points = 0" inside the function, because I will repeat it many times, so it would always set the points back to 0 first.I am completely stuck, any help would be appreciated!

You could also pass points to the function:Small example:
Move points into test:or use global statement, but it is bad practice.But better way it move points to parameters:
