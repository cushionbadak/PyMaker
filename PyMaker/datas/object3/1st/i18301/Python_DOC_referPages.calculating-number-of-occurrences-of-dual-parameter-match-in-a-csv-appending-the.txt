What I need to do is calculate the following:The number of times a person appears in the list (column 8) on dates prior to the date specified in the row with the same t data in column 10 and a 1 occurs in column 7.The number of times a person (column 8) appears in the list on dates prior to the date specified in the row and with the same t data in column 10 (note they are sorted chronologically.)It might be easier to demonstrate this with an example, raw data from csv.What I need the csv to look like as a result of following the described instructions:So you can see that on the last row Tom Phillips with 15t had occurred 1 times on days previous to this one (column 10) and of those 1 occurrences there had been zero occurrences of column 7 being "1".My csv data is obviously much larger than this, so efficient techniques and suggestions would also be appreciated. If more clarification is required please say so, its hard to tell if this example is understandable.Kind regards AEA
