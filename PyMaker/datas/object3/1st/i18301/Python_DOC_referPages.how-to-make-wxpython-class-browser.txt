How do I implement a class browser in wxPython? Should I scan the whole code, or there is a function for this in wxPython?
Your question isn't entirely clear about what you want, but I'll make some assumptions and show you how to do one of the possible interpretations of what you're asking.I'll assume you have a string with the contents of a Python script, or a fragment from your cut-and-paste repository, or whatever, and you just want to know the top-level classes defined in that string of source code.You probably don't want to execute that code. For one thing, who knows what arbitrary strange code can do to your environment? For another, if you're building a class browser, you probably want it to work on code that's depends on other code you may not have access to, so you can't execute it.So, you want to parse it. The easiest way to do that is to get Python to do it for you, using the ast module:When I run this against, say, the ast.py from Python 3.3's stdlib, I get this:If that's not what you wanted, you'll have to explain what you do want. If, for example, you want all class definitions, even local ones within functions and methodsâ€¦ well, the names of those two classes just dumped out above should help.
