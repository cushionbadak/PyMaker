Is there a more pythonic way to do the following?
On Python 2.x you can use a generator function(Note that this returns a new list):On Python 3.x use itertools.accumulate.
For Python 3, use itertools.accumulate:Your code is probably as Pythonic as it can get. One can easily understand what it does.
I don't see anything un-pythonic with what you wrote.  An alternative might be numpy.cumsum().
This is an inplace version and this is what exactly you are looking for, if you are using python 2.x.Output
