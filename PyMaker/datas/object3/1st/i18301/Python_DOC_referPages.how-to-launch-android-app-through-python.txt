I want to run any app (say Settings) after rebooting tablet. Can I use os.system or do I have to use other methods.
Yes, you can use os.system to execute ADB commands. If you want to validate the command executed successfully, take a look at the check_output(...) function which is apart of the subprocess library. This code snipet is how I choose to implement the check_output function. For the full code look here.To launch an application you can use the command am start -n yourpackagename/.activityname. To launch the Settings App, run adb shell am start -n com.android.settings/com.android.settings.Settings. This stackoverflow question shows you in detail the options you can use to start the application via a command line intent. Other tips: I created an ADB wrapper written in python along with a few other python utilities that may aid in what you are trying to accomplish. For example, instead of calling time.sleep(60) to wait for the reboot, you use adb to poll the status of the property sys.boot_completed and once the property is set the device has finished booting and you can launch any application. Below is a reference implementation you can use.
