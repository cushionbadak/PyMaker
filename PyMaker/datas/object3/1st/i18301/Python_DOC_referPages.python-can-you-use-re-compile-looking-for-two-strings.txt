I am using python 2.7 and have a this in my code: regexp = re.compile('ttp_ws_sm_(\d)_')That searches in my loop for different characters as in my sample (after the third underscore). I need to also do the same for strings like 'ttpv1_(\d+)_'The two things I have tried are:andHere's some example data:complete code is:If I don't use name and just put either of both strings in the compile statement I only return one set of totals. I need to have both sets combine and print for "001", '045'
If I understand you correctly, you want a regex that matches either 'ttp_ws_sm_(\d+)_' or 'ttpv1_(\d+)_'?You can use the pipe character |:?: makes the first group non-capturing.'ttp_ws_sm_(\d+)_' or 'ttpv1_(\d+)_' doesn't work because it is actually the same as 'ttp_ws_sm_(\d+)_'.  See Max's answer for an explanation.
You should read a Python book. You have some severe misunderstandings of the language.is a Boolean expression. Python interprets nonempty strings as truthy so it interprets this as (true thing or true thing). When the first part of a Boolean or is true, Python doesn't even look at the second part and just returns the first. Look:That's why it (accidentally) works inside re.compile. Passing a Boolean expression to re.compile doesn't really make sense.Secondly it's not clear what you're even trying to accomplish here. A single regexp might not be appropriate or could require different capture groups.

Read the doc:'|'  A|B, where A and B can be arbitrary REs, creates a regular  expression that will match either A or B.http://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntaxRead the doc:csv.reader(csvfile, dialect='excel', **fmtparams)   (...)  If csvfile is  a file object, it must be opened with the ‘b’ flag on platforms where  that makes a difference.http://docs.python.org/2/library/csv.html#module-csv
