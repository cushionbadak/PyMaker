I am new to Python, and keep running into the same problem: I can't find up-to-date examples of common Python solutions.For example, googling "python html parser" gives me this as first result:http://docs.python.org/2/library/htmlparser.htmlThe problem is that the code in this official doc is not working on Python 3.3.2 on windows, which is the latest download.For example:is not working. Instead, one should use:This is just one example. Also a significant number of Stackoverflow Python codes answers do not work straight; for example:is now:So my question is: how can I find up-to-date documentation and code examples that work for Python 3.3 on windows?
You tell Google the version of Python: python 3.3 html parserFirst result: http://docs.python.org/3/library/html.parser.htmlNote that a lot of support libraries don't fully support Python 3.x at this time. Which is why Python 2 still is the default for many projects.If you plan to stay on 3.3, you may want to read "What's New in Python", especially "What's New In Python 3.0".
If you see on the top left of the documentation page, there's 2.7.5, the latest version for Python under version 3. You can click it and choose your version for the most up to date documentation.On the example you gave, the top mentions that the module has been renamed in Python 3. If we go to a module that works in both 2 and 3, such as  itertools, changing the number will redirect you to the updated documentation on itertools.
here you can find Python 3 documentation: http://docs.python.org/3/
