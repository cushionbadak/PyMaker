I'm trying to set a type hint in Python in a function, you can add more than one type hint with something: str|bool='default value', but, what are the type hinting for None? :/
From your example:I've noticed that your use case is "something or None".Since version 3.5, Python supports type annotations via typing module.And in your case, the recommended way of annotating is by using typing.Optional[something] hint. This has exact meaning you're looking for.Therefore the hint for another_string_or_None would be:
It's just None!Or at least, it can be.Since these annotations are meaningless to Python beyond being in/correct syntax, it's sort of up to the tools.If you use typecheck-decorator for example, then you'll need to use type(None):Typecheck also allows you to somewhat more clearly "add more than one type hint with" with tc.any() (OR), tc.all() (AND), and far more besides. Beware that tc.none() is a NAND-like predicate; not what you are looking for - with no arguments it will accept any type, equivalent to tc.all() or the more apt tc.anything.
