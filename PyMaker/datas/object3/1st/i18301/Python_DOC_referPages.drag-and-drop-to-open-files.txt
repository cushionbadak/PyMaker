What I'm referring to is how, say, an image editor can automatically open a file if that file is dropped onto the program's icon. Now, I'm not developing an image editor, but I am reading input from a file.How can I do this?
There are two different things you could mean here.First, you could be dragging a file onto the program's executable file. For example, I open my home directory in one window, and /usr/local/bin in another, and drag spam.txt from the left window and drop it on myprogram in the right.In theory, what happens here is entirely up to the file manager. However, most file managers—including Windows Explorer and OS X Finder and the default things that come with most of the popular linux distros—will do the exact same thing: just run the program, as if you had typed this at a shell:So, from inside myprogram, you just need to look at sys.argv[1:] for the list of files, and it will work the same way whether they were supplied on the command line or by drag and drop.If you drag a file to a symlink, Windows shortcut, or Mac alias to the program's executable file stored somewhere else, like on your desktop, effectively the same thing happens, and you don't have to worry about the differences.If you've built an application bundle for OS X instead of just a flat script, things are more complicated. However, all of the simpler wrappers that would have let you build such a bundle without knowing what you're doing should automatically take care of the magic that makes it look the same as a flat script, so you shouldn't have to worry about that.Alternatively, you could be asking about dropping a file on some kind of representation of your already-running program on a dock or taskbar or the like.That's more complicated. And it's different for each platform. But fortunately, that's not what you're doing.
