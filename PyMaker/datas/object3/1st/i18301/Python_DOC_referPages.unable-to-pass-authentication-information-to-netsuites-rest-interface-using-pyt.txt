I've been trying to get a NetSuite Restlet to work with Python 3.3 using urllib, but I can't seem to get the authorization to take and continually return a urllib.error.HTTPError: HTTP Error 401: Authorization Required error. Where am I going wrong with authentication? My test code is as follows:For reference, NetSuite's REST help was used to build the authorization string as well as the Python docs on urllib located here--EDIT--The header that is passed (and works) via REST Console appears as follows: headers output from Python appear as: still not sure why it's not working....
Issue was NetSuite related (an issue with roles): Code below yeilds a proper response: In my case, the original role did not have access to the record. The confusion was I was expecting an error of  to be returned, not an authentication required which made me suspect the header was missing data.
