Natural Text
My objective is to use Python to send an e-mail to a Gmail user that has an inline image. It is not possible to host this image online and then link to it through a href, due to the sensitive nature of the images (data from my work). I've tried encoding the base64 version into a HTML then sending th is HTML, but this is well known to not work. I then noticed that in Gmail you can drag and drop an image into the send box and it will show up inline in the receiving end. Given this I then tried to send an e-mail from Python with the image as an attachment. This is seen in the below code, but unfortunately the image doesn't show up inline. My question is then: How to send the image such that it shows up inline? When I send the inline image to myself manually this is what the "original email" looks like:When I send it to myself through Python as an attachment it is very different:
It seems that following the gmail email template works:Based on the example from email  module docs:To send msg via gmail:Python 2/3 compatible versionBased on Send an HTML email with embedded image and plain text alternate:To send msg via gmail:SMTP_SSL is optional, you could use starttls method from your question instead:
I think you need to add the following lines:testimage should be replaced with a unique identifier
