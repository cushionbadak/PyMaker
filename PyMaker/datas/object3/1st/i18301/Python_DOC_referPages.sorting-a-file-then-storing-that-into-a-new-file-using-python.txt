Natural Text
so I have to sort a file in alphabetical order which isn't my problem. I can do that, but my problem is writing that sorted list into a new file. Here is what I have.Ok, so my info.txt is what needs to be alphabetized and it is just a list of colors. So my last 4 lines is where I'm struggling. I'm trying to take each item in the file_string and write those into a new file, but print(end) gives me how many characters they are. What am I doing wrong?Thanks
Try doing it this way instead. Yes, this is the full solution.
The write() method returns the number of bytes written, so it's working as designed.You want to write newlines to your file, though (since you removed them from the original file when splitting on newlines), and you mustn't forget to close it, sowould work correctly.A better solution, though, would be:or even
In Python 3.x file.write returns the number of characters written to the file, you don't need to worry about that.The only problem I can think of is that you're not adding any '\n' after words, so all items wind up writing on the same line.
