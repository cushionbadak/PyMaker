as I'm still learning python I came up to a problem.Why does this work:but this doesn't:Both times I include a class, but in the second example it says: NameError: global name 'Tkinter' is not definedWhere's the difference between those examples and how can I solve this, so I'm able to use tkinter in my class?Thanks for your help.
Perhaps you meant Tk()? the tkinter module on Python 3.x does not seem to contain a class Tkinter.As to the meaning of your question and example... well, the examples are absolutely irrelevant, and the question should simply be "why can't I create an instance of Tkinter" or something.Python Lesson: This is also a good example of why it's a bad idea to use star imports (i.e from <module> import *, because * looks like a star). This imports everything from tkinter, but doesn't let you know if something you thought was there actually isn'twhereas thiswould have immediately pointed out that (the class) Tkinter does not exist in tkinter. Another option that some seem to prefer (incl. myself in some cases), is import tkinter followed by tkinter.Tk(), which has the advantage that it's obvious where a class comes from. Futhermore, PEP8 also discourages the use of star imports (referring to them as "wildcard imports").
