I am new to Python and trying to do something I do often in Ruby. Namely, iterating over a set of indices, using them as argument to function and comparing its results with an array of fixture outputs. So I wrote it up like I normally do in Ruby, but this resulted in just one test case. I'm trying to get the test for every item in the range. How can I do that?
Using unittest you can show the difference between two sequences all in one test case.If that's not flexible enough, using unittest, it is possible to generate multiple tests, but it's a bit tricky.Nose makes the above easier through test generators.Similar questions:Python unittest: Generate multiple tests programmatically?How to generate dynamic (parametrized) unit tests in python?
In python world two most popular options to write tests are:UnittestpytestIn pytest you parametrize tests very easly:This will produce nice output also while running tests:I am using pytest for two years now and it's very nice tool. You have many features there. Besides parametrization there are fixtures also, very very nice assertions (you do not need to write assertEqual, just assert a==b and pytest can generate very nice and helpful output for it.)
Starting from python 3.4, you can do it like this:https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/unittest.html?highlight=subtest#distinguishing-test-iterations-using-subtests
If Your question is regarding, when you are solving the problem on competitive places like hackerrank or anywhere else. If they have not provided their environment to run test cases in a loop.And locally if You are running code for python compiler It would be useful.you can simply use a while loop or range function of python.e.g:
