I've been trying to write code for this function, but I can't get asin to work in python 2.7. any ideas why?
Dividing integer by integer (as you do with n/H inside math.asin(n/H)) returns an integer (which is the floor value of the division result) in Python before 3.0. You must either convert at least one operand to float or declare at the beginning of the Python source filefrom __future__ import divisionRead http://python.org/dev/peps/pep-0238 for details
Code CorrectionsThere are a few problems:There is no built-in sin, it needs to be used from math as math.sinThere is zero division. This originates from n/H integer division as @MichaelButscher states.There is no sqrt built-in, also use math.sqrtIf the inputs are floats they are truncated to ints, this seem unnecessary.Final corrected code:
