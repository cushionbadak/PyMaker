Suppose I want to create a function that takes an iterable. That iterable may contain other iterables to any level. I want to create a function that goes over these in order. So for example:This produces the following output (as expected):12345678910No supposed I want to do this with a generator. Why doesn't the following work as I would expect it to (essentially replacing the print statement with a yield) :Thanks!
because when you recurse, you return a new generator -- But that generator never yields anything because you don't iterate over it.  Instead, do something like:Or, in python3.3, you can use the yield from keyword.
