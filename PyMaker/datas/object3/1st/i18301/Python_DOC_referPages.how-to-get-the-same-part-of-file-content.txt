I have two files , and I want to display the content exist in file 1 and file 2 in the screen. But it seems nothing display ( but it should display オレンジ) . What is the problem?thanksHere is my codeOutput
You probably have more whitespace in one of the files than just a newline. You could loop over either F1_Content and F2_Content, printing the representation of that line with print(repr(line)) or print(line.encode('unicode_escape')) to make it easier to spot how the lines differ.I'd strip the lines entirely. Also, use a set for the lines of one file, testing will be much more efficient:Looping directly over the file itself reads the file line by line, letting you handle file lines without having to read the whole file into memory.Note also the use of with statements here; file objects are context managers, and when the context closes (the with block ends) the file object is automatically closed for you.With Katakana, there is also the possibility that one of your files uses decomposition for the  ZI character while the other does not; you can either express it as \u30B8 or as \u30B7\u3099; (SI + COMBINING KATAKANA-HIRAGANA VOICED SOUND MARK):You can use unicodedata.normalize() to normalize all your lines to either composed or decomposed forms. Here I force all data to use composed forms:
