I have a program that works on a logfile to narrow it down to two items. That is as far as I have gotten and that is where my program stops, shown below. But I need to put the first of the two items into an equation and put the second item into a different equation. How can I do that?When I run above program it will print something like  [1685, 1650] So I now need to add onto above program so that it automatically puts the first number, 1685, into an equation and then put the second number, 1650, into a different equation and print the results.
You can't pick out a value from something you printed. Once you print it, it's forgotten.You have to store the thing in a variable. Then you can pick it out easily.For example, instead of this:Do this:You're using a Counter to build your results. A Counter, like a dict, has no order.* If you add a, then b, then c, you might get back a, then c, then b, or any of the other 5 permutations.If you need to preserve the original order, you have to take care of that manually. You can do that by using a separate "key list", iterating k in keylist instead of k, v in counter.items(), and using counter[k] in place of v. Or, more simply, just build an OrderedCounter out of OrderedDict and Counter (as shown in the recipes in the docs), and use that:On the other hand, if you need the end results in some sorted order, you can just sort them after the fact:In your case, you want "the higher value number is [0]", which sounds like you want them sorted, but in reverse order. So:* Of course this isn't really true; they do have some order. But the order is generally not useful, and not worth knowing about, beyond the fact that iterating the same dict repeatedly with no changes in between will always get the same order.
