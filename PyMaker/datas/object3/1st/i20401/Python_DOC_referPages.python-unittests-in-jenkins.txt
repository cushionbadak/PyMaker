How do you get Jenkins to execute python unittest cases?Is it possible to JUnit style XML output from the builtin unittest package?
sample tests:tests.py:JUnit with pytestrun the tests with:results.xml:JUnit with noserun the tests with:nosetests.xml:JUnit with nose2You would need to use the nose2.plugins.junitxml plugin. You can configure nose2 with a config file like you would normally do, or with the --plugin command-line option.run the tests with:nose2-junit.xml:JUnit with unittest-xml-reportingAppend the following to tests.pyrun the tests with:test-reports/TEST-SimpleTest-20131001140629.xml:
I would second using nose.  Basic XML reporting is now built in.  Just use the --with-xunit command line option and it will produce a nosetests.xml file.  For example:nosetests --with-xunitThen add a "Publish JUnit test result report" post build action, and fill in the "Test report XMLs" field with nosetests.xml (assuming that you ran nosetests in $WORKSPACE).
You can install the unittest-xml-reporting package to add a test runner that generates XML to the built-in unittest. We use pytest, which has XML output built in (it's a command line option). Either way, executing the unit tests can be done by running a shell command. 
I used nosetests. There are addons to output the XML for Jenkins
When using buildout we use collective.xmltestreport to produce JUnit-style XML output, perhaps it's source code or the module itself could be of help.
Run this as shell from jenkins , you can get the report in pytest_unit.xml as artifact.
