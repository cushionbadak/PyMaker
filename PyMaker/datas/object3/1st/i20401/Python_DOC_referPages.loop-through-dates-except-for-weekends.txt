So I have a script that has date arguments for different functions and I want it to loop through 01-01-2012 to 06-09-2012 not including weekends. Im trying to figure out a way I can use time delta because my script outputs files with the date used in the name of the file for example:I want timedelta(1) to cycle through each date so that the output file would have the format of total2012-01-01 for the first day and cycle through until it created the file total2012-06-09. Also the date argument for items has the format of MM-DD-YYYYI thought that I could do this: So essentially I'm just trying to figure out how can I loop through having the function start with 01-01-2012 and ending with 06-10-2012 excluding weekends. I'm having trouble figuring out how to exclude weekends and how to get it to loop in the proper orderThanks 
Use the datetime.weekday() method. It returns values between zero and six, related to the weekdays. Saturday value is 5 and Sunday value is 6; so, if you skip the operation when these values appear, you skip weekdends:

There is easier way to do this using  freq = 'B' for business day frequency. which gives you :you check name of day also by:
