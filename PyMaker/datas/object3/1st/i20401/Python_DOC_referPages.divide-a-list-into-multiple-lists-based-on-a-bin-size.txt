I have a list containing more than 100,000 values in it. I need to divide the list into multiple smaller lists based on a specific bin width say 0.1. Can anyone help me how to write a python program to do this?my list looks like thisI would like to have an output like this
Here is a simple and nice way using numpys digitize:digitize, returns an array with the index value for the bin that each element falls into.
This will create a dict where each value is a list of elements that fit in a bin.
Is this what you want? (Sample output would have been helpful :)yields:This SO question assigning points to bins might be helpful.
This works:Prints:How it works:I suggest a Python tutorial on these statements. 
Binning can be done with itertools.groupby:Note: this simple key function assumes the values in the iterable are between -0.0 and -10.0. Consider lambda x: "{:.1f}".format(float(x)) for general cases.See also this post for details on how groupby works.
We can make bins with more_itertools, a third-party library.GivenCodeDetailsWe can bin by the key function, which we define to format numbers to a single precision, i.e. -0.213 to -0.2.These bins are accessed by the keys defined by the key function:Access all bins by iterating keys:OutputList comprehension and unpacking is another option (see Code example).See also more_itertools docs for more details.
