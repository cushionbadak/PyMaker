In python, is there a function to check if a given file/directory is a symlink ? For example, for the below files, my wrapper function should return True.
To determine if a directory entry is a symlink use this:os.path.islink(path)Return True if path refers to a directory entry that is a symbolic  link. Always False if symbolic links are not supported.For instance, given:
For python 3.4 and up, you can use the Path classYou have to be careful when using the is_symlink() method.  It will return True even the target of the link is non-existent as long as the the named object is a symlink.  For example (Linux/Unix):Then, in your current directory fire up pythonThe programmer has to decide what he/she realy wants.  Python 3 seems to have renamed a lots of classes. It might be worthwhile to read the manual page for the Path class: https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html
Without the intention to bloat this topic, but I was redirected to this page as I was looking for symlink's to find them and convert them to real files and found this script within the python tools library.
