I get this error:when running my code, I don't really see what I'm doing wrong here though:
You are calling the wrong class name in your super() call:Essentially what you are resolving to is the __init__ of the object base class which takes no params.Its a bit redundant, I know, to have to specify the class that you are already inside of, which is why in python3 you can just do:  super().__init__()
