Here is my code:Why is this happening?The 1st and the 3rd object have same content and same hash but len() tells about 3 unique objects?
You also need to define __eq__() in a compatible way with __hash__() â€“ otherwise, equality will be based on object identity.On Python 2, it is recommended you also define __ne__ to make != consistent with ==. On Python 3, the default __ne__ implementation will delegate to __eq__ for you.
Here  is the the entire code :The function recognises the __eq__ and as such the len is 2.
The Python documentation might be helpful:If a class does not define a __cmp__() or __eq__() method it should not define a __hash__() operation either;
