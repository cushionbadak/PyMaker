I know Jython converts Python code into Java byte code, but are there any syntax changes between the two? and as a side question is Jython 3.x usable yet or is it still being ported?
Jython is an implementation of the Python language.  It is not a different language at all.According to the Jython website, the latest stable version is currently 2.5.3b1, and the latest development version is 2.7a2.  As far as I know, no one is currently working on an 3.x-compatible version of Jython.

There are 3 major implementations available for Python language. Jython is a java implementation, Cython is C implementation and IronPython is c# implementation. As far as Python language syntax is concerned, it remains consistent in all implementations. Regarding the last part of your question, I dont think Jython version 3.x is released or in use yet, probably you meant python 3.x - if so, yes it is.
