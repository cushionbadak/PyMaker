I'm new to python, I study it by myself, and I just want to make sure I understand something about find() function...If I want to find a specific string, it will find the first index of the first letter/number of the string or the the first time this strings?for exaple, there's the next given string:"I$want$moeny$and$food"If I type find('$')it will give me the first time '$' showed up in this string, which is 1.However, if I want to find "$moeny", I will get the the number 6, means python serched where the full "$moeny" string is showed in the first time?and If I type find('$mommy') it will give me an Error, and not index 1.Am I right? Did I understand it clearly?Thanks a lot :)
The best answer is to try it yourself and see what happens.A good practice is to enter the CMD or shell and type "python" and try various commands.
