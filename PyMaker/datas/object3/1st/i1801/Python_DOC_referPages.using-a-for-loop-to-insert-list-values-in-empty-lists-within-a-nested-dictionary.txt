I have a nested dictionary:Suppose I have a listHow would I make a for loop statement that inserts my new list into all the empty lists with the key 'gyms_visited'?the new dictionary should look like this 
Just iterate over the values of my_dict and assign new_list to the key 'gyms_visited'If you were to simply assign new_list then you will come into trouble as soon as you change any value in new_list
You can use a dictionary comprehension:Output:
Try this:Nested dictionary comprehension would work.Output:I actually like @aydow's solution, In addition to it, you can do it like:Or:
You can also just extend() the list:and as you can see here, all the lists have a different id() and not referencing the same object:In terms of performance, list.extend() is O(N), where N = 3 is the length of list you want to extend. This most likely is a series of list.append() calls, which are O(1) each. This will be the same for copying using [:] or .copy(), which is O(N).
