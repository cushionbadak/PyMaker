I'm trying to make a test for this function from my code:Where time is a string created from datetime.datetime.today():The problem is I cannot assert equality between the result of name_of_file and a string because everytime my test (using the unittest framework) calls the name_of_file function, the time variable changes so the strings aren't equal.How can I pass or set up a particular datetime inside my test so when the name_of_file function is called, I can know the final string I'll get (and so pass the test)?
The fact that the name_of_file() function is getting the value from a global variable named time in the code is what's making this difficult to solve. You ought to be able to avoid the issue by redefining the function to accept an additional parameter with this value and then passing it to it as an argument whenever it's called.If you can't change the name_of_file() function and/or how it's used, then the value of the datetime.today function returns could be turned into a constant by using the unittest.mock library, as @wowserx suggested in a comment.
