I`m trying to append an list of the indexes of another list.I have one list with random numbers, and need to create another list, with the indexes of the first list.My code is just like this:But I get the error below:What am i doing wrong?
you are using enumerate to fill g2 with tuples, enumarate will give you the index and the value as a tuple, so whenever you call g2[v], you won't get the index only, you will get a tuple of (index, value). If you want the index only in g2, you should use something like the following the create g2.
Like Sandeep Kadapa said, g2 gets turned into a tuple, so try to do something like,after the enumerate and before the print functions are called.
Maybe you need to add only indexes to the second list?Btw I would replace that function with something like that:Let me know if it works for you
g2 is set as a list of tuples in your program, not integers. If you use print(g2[0]) to see what's inside you'll get something like g2[0]:(0, 69) which is a tuple. So that's the problem. You can use any of the following to resolve the issue:ororHelpful resource:https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#enumerate
Enumerate in your code sets v as a tuple. You produce the index and the element with the following format:where count will be the index of g1, and v will be the element at that index.
