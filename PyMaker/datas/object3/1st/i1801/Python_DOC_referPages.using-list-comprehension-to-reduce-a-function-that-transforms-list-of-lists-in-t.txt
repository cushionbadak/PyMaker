i want  to change this function using a list comprehension in order that it will have 1 or to lines. the function transfor a list containing list  in a tuple containing tupples inside
I think this should do it.
If you want it in a functional form, this is one way. You do not need an index here because lst in lista iterates over the elements directly.

This should work:A more explicit explanation of the above list comprehension would be create a tuple of all elements in lista converted to tuple.
