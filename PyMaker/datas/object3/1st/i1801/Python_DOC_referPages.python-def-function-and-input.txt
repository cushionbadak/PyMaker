I am trying to set up a function using input , Is this possible ?So if the function input is x**2 it should print the num 4 . I know this syntax is not right because functions is an alphanumeric object , but I need your help to understand how to make it right
Disclaimer: see comments, and no, you should not put this in a web page/service which people seem to assume you are writing. However for creating your toy calculator which you run locally at home, this built-in function is enough.For safety, refer ast, ast.literal_eval for really simple cases. simpleeval has some nice wrapping for ast, which you may prefer to use as it is and/or learn from it (https://github.com/danthedeckie/simpleeval/blob/master/simpleeval.py) /disclaimerAssuming you mean the user can enter a function:Then enter x+2 for the first input, 2 for the second, and see the result becoming 4:For making it more versatile, you may want to import everything from math:then you can input cos(x) for example:
I assume that you mean letting a user enter code (the function) as the input. If this is the case this might be a duplicate from: In Python: How do I convert a user input into a piece of code?
