I have created two list.I want to find relationship between this two list based on index position  i.e In list1 a is repeated 2 times index 0,3 .in list2  index 0,3  values are 1 ,4  the relation is a one  to many is a:{1,4}next b  not repeated  in list 1 and it index is 1 and list2 index 1 value is 2 ,the relation is one to one b:{2}my expected output will be {a:{1,4},b:{2},c:{3},d:{5}} 
I'd use a defaultdict:outputs
You can use a combination of dictionary and list comprehension to do this:{x: [list2[i] for i, j in enumerate(list1) if j == x] for x in list1}output:{'a': [1, 4], 'b': [2], 'c': [3], 'd': [5]}
And ret will be the output
Option is to zip the two lists:Result:Use it to create a dictionary with sets as values:
I would not do it this way in real code, but this approach is mildly entertaining and perhaps educational.
It's not from pure python, as this question tagged with pandas I tried this way.Option-1Option-2 Output:
