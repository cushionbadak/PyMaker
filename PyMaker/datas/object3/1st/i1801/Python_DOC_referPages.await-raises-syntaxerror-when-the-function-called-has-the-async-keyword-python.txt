I have a function with the async keyword in a separate script, which is this:However, when I try calling it with an await, it raises a SintaxError.(search_gifs is a function inside the Client class)Am I doing something wrong? I'm using Python 3.6
await is only valid inside an async def, so it doesn't work at top-level. This is because the contract of await is that it must be able to suspend the current coroutine, and at top-level there is no coroutine to suspend.To test a coroutine from the interpreter, use asyncio.run or, in Python 3.6, run_until_complete:The other problem with your code is that await requests.get(...) won't work, since requests is not an async library. Instead, use an asyncio-aware library such as aiohttp.
