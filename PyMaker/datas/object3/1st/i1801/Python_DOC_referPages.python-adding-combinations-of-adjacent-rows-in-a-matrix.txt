This is my first post here and I'm a python beginner - all help is appreciated!I'm trying to add all combinations of adjacent rows in a numpy matrix. i.e. row 1 + row 2, row 2 + row 3, row 3 + row 4, etc... with output to a listI will then look for the smallest of these outputs and select that item in the list to be printedI believe I need to use a for loop of some sort but I really am a novice...
Just iterate over the length of the array - 1 and add the pairs as you go into a new list. Then, select the one you want.  For example:
Suppose you have this You can first calculate the sum of each row by using np.sum(arr, axis=1) the argument axis=1 allows to sum each column entries for each line.In this case, sums = np.sum(arr, axis=1) = array([ 6, 15, 24]).  Then you can iterate over this tab to add the different sums :Then you can sorted or getting the np.min(sums) If you need more details you can look at numpy function docs, same for the lists
