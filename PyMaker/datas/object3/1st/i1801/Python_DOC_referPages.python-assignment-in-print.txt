I need to code in python in order to select or not select some employees for a pension program. I will be selecting on the basis of age and nationalitySo I don't want to select an employee whose age and nationality don't meet some criteria.I can create a simple if statement and then print out qualified or disqualified, based on my data.The catch is that I need to print a line which states that the person was disqualified because of being too young or old. How do I assign the criteria the employee has missed in my if statement?If I want to write a statement like this: The employee is not selected because the person doesn't fulfil the criteria: for example, too tall and underweight.How do I insert those in that statement?
You can simply chain if: elif: - you would have to get creative if multiple "why not's" come together - or you can leverage some functions and list-comprehensions to deal with it.You can create a check-function for each value thats returns you True if its ok, else False and a error message if its out of bounds:Apply function to some test data:Output:Readup:string format()python ternary operator
