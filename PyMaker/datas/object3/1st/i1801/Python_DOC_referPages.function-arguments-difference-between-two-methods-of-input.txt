Fairly simple question but I'm relatively new to Python and working through the book Think Python. I'm on the chapter about tuples and have an exercise where I'm told to write a function which takes any number of arguments and returns their sum.Writing this isn't a problem:My question is why does the above work but the below doesn't?I understand that sum() takes a maximum of 2 arguments, but what is the difference between that and assigning those arguments from the arguments put into the sumall() function?
sum takes an iterable and optional start position, but you're passing in multiple integer arguments, which fails.When you call sum(args) you're passing in the args list. When you call sum(1, 2, 3, 4) you're passing in 4 different integer arguments.
