Natural Text
I am learning coroutineWhen reading the task = self.ready.get() in schedule, I suddenly realize that the nature of data structure is about control, to control the next step, while the nature of algorithm is also about control, to control all the steps.Does the understanding make sense?
The Queue object defines control of what step is next, yes. It's FIFO, as described here.Here, it looks like you're just trying to keep track of tasks, whether there are any remaining, which are executing, and so on. This is "controlling all the steps." Yes.What's unclear is the purpose. The data structure and algorithm should be suited to your purpose. asyncio can help you implement parallelism and event-driven designs, for example. Sometimes the goal is to quickly and efficiently render data from a source into a data structure. What you're getting at is more meaningful (to me, at least) in the context of an end goal.
