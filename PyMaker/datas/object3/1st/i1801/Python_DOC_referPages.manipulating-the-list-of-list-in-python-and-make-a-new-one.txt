I have 2 big list of lists like these 2 example (big and small):I want to make a list of lists from big and small. in fact if the 1st item in the inner list of small is equal to the 18th item in the inner list of big, i want to make a new list of lists in which the inner list would have 1st and 2nd items of inner list from small and 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th and 18th items of inner list from big.here is the expected output:expected output:for this goal I wrote the following code but it does not return the expected output. do you know how to fix it?
You need to use in, given that the two strings are different, but the one from small is a substring of the one from big. For selecting the items on each list I suggest you use itemgetter:OutputA more pythonic way of writing the code above will be to use the following list comprehension:
Using a list comprehension that iterates over big and small
