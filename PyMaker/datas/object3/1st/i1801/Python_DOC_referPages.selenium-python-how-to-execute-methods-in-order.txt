I have a Selenium Class with a  few methods:As I add more methods, the one that is called first when I execute the entire MyTest class changes. Sometimes method test3 will get called first, but if I add another method, maybe test2 will be called first. How can I make sure test_1 is always called first? 
According to documentation of unittest library : Note that the order in which the various test cases will be run is  determined by sorting the test function names with respect to the  built-in ordering for stringsSo you just need to define method names in alphabetical order to run them in order. Just change method name test3() to test_3().
