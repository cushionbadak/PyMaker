Natural Text
I'm new here and also new to python so I'm struggling with a simple task that i hope you can help me with.I have a text file that contains data in the following format:What I want to do is to read and print the lines that contain certain keys, for example DateFormat and dbDateFormat and print their values. I am reading files using:It reads the whole file as expected, but I don't know how to make it search and print with the conditions described above.I will highly appreciate any help.
First you need to check if the document is a proper XML file or not. Your example content will raise parse error if I read using lxml library. So it is needed to be fixed at first. The following nodes must be children of a root node. Let's assume the root node is <body>. You can use or xpath expression to get values from the keys you want . 
Thanks for an answer, i handled it with a simple for / if loop and parsed text strings, thanks anyway!
