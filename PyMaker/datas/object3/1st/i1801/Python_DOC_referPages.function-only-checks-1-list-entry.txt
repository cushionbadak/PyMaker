This function searches if int or floats between 1 and 50 are in the list. But it only searches the first list entry. How can i expand the search on the whole list? Also if i write 1.1 in the list, the result will be False.Edited:This results in [6], which i dont want to.
You return "false" too early, as you always return from the first iteration. Also, your type check is not a type check at all and will raise errors for most arbitrary inputs. Use isinstance instead. Moreover, Python allows chained comparisons. You can do e.g.Or shorter, using any:For compiling a new list of matching values, do:Or shorter, using a list comprehension:
Because of the name of your function, I will suggest another approach: using reduce.Basically, you have to implement a function, returning boolean on one single item. Afterwards, use reduce to apply this function to each element of your list.Then apply to your list:Applied to your problem, you should ensure that the size of the filtered list is the same than the original list (or modify the oracle function to do the opposite, and ensure the result is empty).Also, "True" and "False" are typed string, whereas you want them to be booleans. Hence True or False.
