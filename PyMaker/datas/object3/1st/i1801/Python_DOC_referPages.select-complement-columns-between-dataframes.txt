Say I have a pandas.DataFrame x, x was fed to function filter and returned y, a DataFrame with some columns from x removed. The function is a blackbox and the column number is large. How could I find the columns in 'x' that are removed?Or, y.columns is a subset of x.columns, how could I find the columns in x that are not in y?Example:And I'd like to have column c returned.My solution now:Is there a way to get the result without extracting column names?I thought this was some sort of basic operations but I couldn't find an easy answer online.Thanks.
Use sets:x_col.difference(y_col) will return elements that only exist in x_col but not in y_col
Use sets or pandas difference as:Or:This will give the column values which are in x dataframe but not in y dataframe.or:
You can use numpy for this:ORBut, it's always good to use native methods:
