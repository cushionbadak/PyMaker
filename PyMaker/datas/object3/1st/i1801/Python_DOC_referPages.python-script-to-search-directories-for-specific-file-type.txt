Hi guys in the script below I tried to first, list every file and directory in my home directory then check if there is any file with specific extension e.g(.py, .mkv).It works well with files located in home directory but when I want it to check other directories to see if there is any file there or not, it cant work.Here it is my code:
You can use the standard library pathlib module and glob to search for files by file extension.The glob dialect is less powerful than in bash, but you can use ** for recursive subdirectory matching. You can't use bash-style brace expansion *.{mp3,mkv}. Instead you can chain the results from multiple glob searches.Note that Path objects overload the / operator so Path.home() / 'Videos' will produce a path object representing /home/username/Videos/
This seems overly complicated. See this aproach with os.walk and list-comprehensions to filter the files:Create files:Find files:Output:
