I'm sorry if the title is a little bit vague; I am not sure how to put my concern into words. I am a beginner in Python and I am making a Boggle/Word Search game.  I would like the board to stay in the same place/not get pushed back by the user inputs. Is that possible?I tried opening a .txt file in Python via Notepad but the code stops once the txt file is open; any help with this will do.I wonder if it is also possible to make python open a new window/console to display the board while the other console goes on and executes the original code.Finally, is there a way kind of 'refresh' the user inputs here? I would like the line to be empty once the user submits their answer. I've tried making a GUI with tkinter but it was too difficult for me due to the number of pages that I made and that I really have no idea how to use it.Thank you!
You have three possible solutions: reprint the whole screen as you want it displayed after user inputcreate a GUI, where you have a lot more control over what is displayedif on Unix you can try using curses Since, you've already tried tkinter, then the GUI route seems a no-go route for you currently. So you may have similar problems with curses as well. As such, I'd recommend sticking to just reprinting your screen as you want it. You'll end up with a history of previous boards and guesses, but it's an easy way to control what the screen looks like.eg.You'll end up with something like:If you want to try curses here is a basic script to get you started:
One approach you may use with python built-in means is to refresh all the data on the screen (clear and print again) when it is necessary. Try the sample code (should work in linux terminal and windows console):
