I have the structure:There is a string in run_app.py:And pylint alerts thatWhen I rename tasks to taskss, the error disappears. Whats this? How to fix this strange behavior if I want to name the folder exactly 'tasks'?
Try to include an __init__.py file in the folder.Reason:The __init__.py files are required to make Python treat the directories as containing packages.More info and examples here:https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#packages
