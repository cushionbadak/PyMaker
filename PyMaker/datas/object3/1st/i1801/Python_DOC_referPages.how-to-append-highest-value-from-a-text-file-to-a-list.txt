Natural Text
I'm having trouble trying to figure out the code for a program I'm writing. I'm given a file with the format:Here is a sample:  I'm trying to find a way to return the highest and lowest final_mark from all students. What I've done so far is:When the program is run using one of the text files, I get:Any help is much appreciated!
Every time you read a new student, you 'reset' the highestGrade and lowestGrade to their initial values (0 and 99, respectively).Fix this easily by initializing those values outside of your loop.In addition, your lowGrade method is unnecessarily complex and redundant. Instead of removing items from the list and then adding new items, just create a new list. And in fact, a tuple would be more appropriate than a list, although both will work.You don't need to return the tuple/list from this method, as you don't use the returned value at all.
Everytime you find a lowest grade you are removing 2 values from the list and adding 3. This means that the first value is never removed. Can you check if this works for you?
