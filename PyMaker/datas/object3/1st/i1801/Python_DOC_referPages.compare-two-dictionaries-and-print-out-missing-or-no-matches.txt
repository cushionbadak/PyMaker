I'm new to python and would really like to get some direction here.I have two almost identical dictionaries - First_Dict and Second_DictGoal: I need to compare them in the following flow:My code isn't much so far :) Sorry, still learning. 
I imagine that you want to know differences not only for the first dictionary from second, but also vice versa. For me a good way is to separate the control in the following steps:Find common keys to both dictionary.Using the common keys compute values differences in both dictionaries.Indicate the missing keys with relative values.Possible code:
First declare two empty lists one for storing missing keys and second for missing values of that keys.  Try this code.  Output is Mark the answer if helpful.  
You could do something like this:OutputThe line diff = [value for value in values if value not in Second_Dict[key]] is a list comprehension and computes the difference between the values in First_Dict and Second_Dict when the keys are match.UPDATEIf you need both differences, you could do something like this:OutputThe second loop is for iterating over the keys in Second_Dict that are missing from First_Dict.
One option more using sets:So, printing out the results:Iterate over the results to format the print as you will.
