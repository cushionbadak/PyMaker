I have a bunch of PIL images that I'd like to get the binary representation of. Currently I'm doing this by saving it to a file, and opening the file using python's open(X,"rb") function. What's the best way for  me to skip writing to the hard drive so that I can just open the bytes object into memory?Would like it to be:Another function I'm using expects a filename as an input, to which they use the open function. The library doesn't contain a method for reading files from objects in memory (e.g. base64 string methods). So I'd like to replace the part with the "filename input" function with whatever is equivalent to the open function to get rid of these hard drive writes.
In python3 BytesIO module provides a way to interface with a file-like object. It reads and writes the same as a file but the object is in-memory. For your usecase,image_in_buf can be read and write like a normal file. getvalue() method returns bytes containing the entire contents of the buffer.
Try using the getdata function of Image.To get a bytes object try data = bytes(im.getdata())
