I would like to write a python script that does 3 things : build a virtual environment  with python3activate this new virtual env. ( bash: source myvirtenv/bin/acticate)install packages with  a requirements.txt (bash:  pip install -r )In my project I use  the normal virtualenviroment package . and  I have to do it   on   a Debian machine. I tried to mimic the bash command with os.system()  but didn't make it with the code below.Problem the virtualenv  will not activated and the requirements not installed. Is there a easy trick to script in python this 3 stepy nicely ?
