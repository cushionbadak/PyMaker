Out:
This uses the search regular expression operation.In words, it is essentially taking each rev, finding all sub-pieces that begin with a-b (downcased) or A-B (uppercase), hence the | operator. The + signifies to also extract whatever follows. This will allow the search to also extract the numbers that follow the letter. Output:
You are trying to split using a regex on either ab or AB and therefore could use re.splitThe regex that you use [a-b][A-B] will not give the expected output because it matches 2 ranges, a-b lowercase and A-B uppercase which does not find a match in your example data because it contains only a single a or bIf you are trying to split on a lower or uppercase alphabet a-z, you could make use of the flag re.IGNORECASE. As a regex, you could use a capturing group as the capturing group is returned. ([a-z][0-9]+)That will match( Capturing group[a-z] Match single character a-z[0-9]+ Match 1+ times a digit (omit the + to match a single digit)) Close capturing groupFrom the result take the second field. For example:ResultDemo
