My csv file looks like this: I have been trying to figure out how to write a code that ignores the header + first column and focuses on scores because the assignment was to find the averages of the test scores and print out a float(for those particular numbers the output should be 77.5). I've looked online and found pieces that I think would work but I'm getting errors every time. Were learning about read, realines, split, rstrip and \n if that helps! I'm sure the answer is so simple, but I'm new to coding and I have no idea what I'm doing. Thank you!def calculateTestAverage(fileName):    myFile = open(fileName, "r")    column = myFile.readline().rstrip("\n")    for column in myFile:        scoreColumn = column.split(",")        (scoreColumn[1])This is my code so far my professor wanted us to define a function and go from there using the stuff we learned in lecture. I'm stuck because it's printing out all the scores I need on separate returned lines, yet I am not able to sum those without getting an error. Thanks for all your help, I don't think I would be able to use any of the suggestions because we never went over them. If anyone has an idea of how to take those test scores that printed out vertically as a column and sum them that would help me a ton! 
You can use csv library. This code should do the work:The output should look like this:Average score for row #1 is: 77.5
I always approach this with a pandas data frame.  Specifically the read_csv() function. You donâ€™t need to ignore the header, just state that it is in row 0 (for example) and then also the same with the row labels.So for example:
I will break it down for you. Since you're dealing with .csv files, I recommend using the csv library. You can import it with:Now we need to open() the file. One common way is to use with:Which is a context manager that avoids having to close the file at the end. The other option is to open and close normally:Now you need to wrap the opened file with csv.reader(), which allows you to read .csv files and do things with them:To skip the headers, you can use next():Now for the average calculation part. One simple way is to have two variables, score_sum and total. The aim is to increment the scores and totals to these two variables respectively. Here is an example snippet :Here's how to do it with indexing also:Now that we have our score and totals calculated, getting the average is simply:The above code combined will then result in an average of 77.5. Off course, this all assumes that your .csv file is actually in this format:
