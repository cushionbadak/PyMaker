this code works perfect with movie Id that has plot keyword .bur for movies that haven't plot keyword like this id(5950092) it returns exception.any idea for handle exception?
Since imdb.Movie.Movie is a subclass of imdb.utils._Container with a get method similar to that of a dict, and which docstring reads:That means you can do this to never throw an exception if there are no keywords:You can also work with an Exception if you want to:
In IMDbPY, Movie instances behave like dictionaries, so you handle exceptions in the usual way (with a try/except clause).  See https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#handling-exceptionsBeing dictionary-like objects, you can also test for the presence of a key with 'keywords' in black_panther and get the value without raising n exception, but returning None if the key is missing, with black_panther.get('keywords').
