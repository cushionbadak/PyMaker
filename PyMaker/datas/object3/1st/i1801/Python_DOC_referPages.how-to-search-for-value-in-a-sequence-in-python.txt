I am very new to coding so please bear with me.  Basically I am writing a program that will ask for either a last name or id number, then search a .csv file for the word and return the entire column to which it belongs.  Below is what I have written if the user opts to search by the id.This is the csv file:This is how it prints out after readlines():Since invoice ID is the first column, I thought it would be found by using if term ==newRow[0], but that's not working. Any tips? Thanks so much.
The simplest way to do this is using the csv module:If you're allowing the user to search by ID or last name only, it's possible to simplify your input even further by asking them to enter 1 for ID and 2 for Last Name. This approach is inflexible but the advantage is that users are less likely to enter the method in wrong case. For example, you're comparing method == 'id' but the user might enter Id or ID. Might make your life a bit simpler.
If you don't want to use the csv module for this problem, then you should split your string on ",", not on "\n":This way, the first element of newRow will be the invoice id.
