Trying to implement an easier form of this example I have and error while insert data to BigQueryThis is the codeAnd this is the error:I'm new with python and maybe the solutions is quite simple, but how I could do it?It would be possible to pass a single string in String To BigQuery Row instead of This would be the easier way to start better than using csv files and have to translate the file
I understand you have an input CSV file with a single column, of the form:If my understanding was correct, you do not need to have the parse_method() method, because as explained in the sample you shared, this is just a helper method that maps the CSV values to dictionaries (which are accepted by beam.io.BigQuerySink).Then, you can simply do something like:Note that the only relevant difference is that the "String to BigQuery Row" mapping does not need a complex method anymore, and all it does is create a Python dictionary like {Message: "This is a message"}, where Message is the name of the column in your BQ table. In this mapping, s is each of the String elements read in the beam.io.ReadFromText transform, and we apply a lambda function.
To solve using a CSV file with only one value per row I have to use this:I dont know why I have to put the "," after the 'Name' but if I don't do it, the dict(zip(... doesnt work properly
