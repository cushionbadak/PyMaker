I am attempting to make a python a "buzzer" application which will function like the buzzers in jeopardy. It will (hopefully) work by linking several computers to a main computer. When a user taps the screen of their computer, if they are the first, it will change the color of their screen and alert the main computer. Now for my question: when module would be best to like together these two computer. I would need to send the name of the computer and a timestamp and the main computer would need to respond. I was reading that something like socket might work, but i am unsure. Also, could you please give me a link to documentation on whatever module you suggest. Thanks!
You mentioned socket in your question.https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.htmlThis might be appropriate for your needs, however with multiple clients it can get quite complicated. Also, you may want to try using email for easier connections (if you don't mind the send time of a few seconds). I know it sounds stupid, but it has worked for me in the past, with significantly less difficulty than a multi-threaded socket connection.https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.htmlhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/smtplib.html
