I'm pretty new, so I'm gonna try to be explicit and pertinent enough with my question.I'm trying to parse my xml file with Python, and I would like to get the "PlayerRef", the "Position" of the player, and the "Statistic". When I run my code, there is no error returned into the Python Shell, but nothing happened, when (I think) I should get the parsing of my code (with the ID, the Position and the Stat of the player)Here is my code :I tried a lot of differents codes, and I got the same thing, no error into the shell but, no results as well.Here my xml: I have probably done something wrong inside my "for" codehow to solve this issue?Thanks in advance for your time ad your answer
The '+' and '-' preceding each tag appears to be an artifact of copying from some interactive XML browsing tool. They look like common expand/collapse UI components.  It would be more helpful to have just the actual XML that is in your file.The sample you posted can not be parsed, as-is, without making assumptions about the actual structure of your document.  So I assumed that the start tags shown with a preceding '+' are in fact incomplete and converted them to self-closing tags.  I then added in the necessary close tags at the end in order to be able to try your code.I will show you how I approached your problem and solved it, rather than simply giving a working result.  First I reduced your program to the simplest piece that should produce expected results:This showed me that the file was parsed, and the root is an element named SoccerFeed.  It also shows that the findall() returned no elements.Then I tried this:This printed a list of SoccerDocument elements.  Reading the documentation for findall() confirms that it starts at the root element and searches for subelements.  Since SoccerFeed is not a subelement of SoccerFeed, it is not found.Then I proceeded:This didn't match anything, so I looked more carefully at the XML document.  Unless the assumptions I made (noted earlier) to make the XMl well-formed are incorrect, SoccerDocument contains MatchData, not TeamData.The correct path to find the MatchPlayer elements is this:Then the program crashed trying to process the MatchPlayer elements because PlayerRef (and Position) are attributes, not subelements, of MatchPlayer.  According to the documentation for Element objects, you want to call get() to get the value of an attribute.The solution, then is:
