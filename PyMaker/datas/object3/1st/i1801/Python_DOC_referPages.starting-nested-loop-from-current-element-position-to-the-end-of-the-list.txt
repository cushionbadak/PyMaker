Natural Text
I have a text file with the following structure:EDIT Input sample:EDIT 2 Input sample:Each item (name or sentence(s) is an Unicode string. I put this data into list, and want to form a dictionary:EDIT 3 The dictionary I am building intended to be written into a file and it is bunch of Unicode strings.What I am trying to do is this:E.g. I need to make a nested loop from the found 'name:' sentence until the next one, while extending the list of sentences for the same key (which is name). The thing is range() don't work here for me, because it expects integers. Looking for "pythonic" way to make nested loop from the current element to the end of the list. (feels like making slice of the list each iteration will be inefficient)
You could use groupby:OutputThe idea is to group the input into name line, not name line so you use as key lambda x: x.endswith(':').
