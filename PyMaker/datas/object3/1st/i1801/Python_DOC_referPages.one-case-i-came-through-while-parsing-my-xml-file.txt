Natural Text
So my XML file goes somewhat like this:I want to extract (x=0) form this XML using ElementTree Library in pythonI am trying to access it using my below code:(say I read this XML from a file in a variable 'tree')Python 3.5 code:But this above code gives me the output 'None'I don't understand what is happening coz '(x=0)' is the text under the tag 'S_CellBody'. Can anyone explain this!!!!EDIT1: S_cellBody was just a typo! sorry I have corrected it to 'S_CellBody'
