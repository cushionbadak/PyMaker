I have a list (lst1) of numerical IDs (roughly 300K IDs) that I am passing into a API, and appending api results into another list (lst), like so:When I apply the future.concurrent library the code keeps looping over the same IDs. I can tell this because the counter number keeps repeating, how do I prevent this? Code to how I am applying the futures.concurrent library:edit:
Integers are immutable. So you could make your counter global usingyou could also define a global counter object (not integer) using itertools.countThis is my preferred method, because it avoids the use of global on an immutable object like integer, which always leads to mistakes and misunderstandings.now:becomes:And the values won't be the same between worker threads.This relies on the fact that CPython has a global interpreter lock which makes the operation safe. If you're not using CPython, you have to use threading lock mechanisms to protect the object from concurrent modifications.the other issue is that get_data should not return a list but an item. Let executor.map create the list (and your loop is useless/harmful since it multiplies the number of computations)so to sum it up:finally, executor.map is made to be iterated upon. To create a list, you have to force iteration on it:
