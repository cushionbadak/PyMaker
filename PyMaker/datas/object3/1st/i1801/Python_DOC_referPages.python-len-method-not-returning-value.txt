This question already has an answer here:Why does Python code use len() function instead of a length method?                    8 answers                I have started learning python programming language and learning string in python. i am using following code to find the length of string.but code is not working. I know i am using method len after variable. But why other method works after variable? E.G print(a.lower()) to lower sting, print(a.upper()) to upper string 
You are doing it wrong. a.len() doesn't exist. You should doRead more about it here.
dot notations such us .upper(), .lower() are methods and len(), abs() etc are functionsUse len(a) instead
It should work across all the Version starting 2.6, reason its not working as mentioned you are trying it wrong as a.len() !Python 2.6Python 3Python 2.7
