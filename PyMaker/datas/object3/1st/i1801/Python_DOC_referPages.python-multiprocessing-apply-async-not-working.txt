I am trying to parallelize a code with a ThreadPool. I am currently working on windows. Basically, the behavior that I am getting is that when I call apply_async nothing happens. My program just print START and END.Below there is an example:There are many questions on stack that suggest calling other methods, like imap_unordered, map, apply. However, none of them solve the problem.Edit:returns an error about the number of parameters:However, the documentation states that I can use a list of tuples for passing parameters, otherwise how can I pass them?Edit2:processes_args look likes the output below before calling apply_async:
Positional parameters in Pool.apply and Pool.apply_async are expanded using the * unpacking syntax.According to processed_args content, your ppp function would receive 10 tuples when scheduled via apply_async.If you want to process an iterable, I'd recommend you to use Pool.map or Pool.map_async. The map functions do not expand the arguments within the iterable. You need to take care of it yourself.If you want to keep the ppp function as is, you can use Pool.starmap which applies argument expansion on the iterator content.
