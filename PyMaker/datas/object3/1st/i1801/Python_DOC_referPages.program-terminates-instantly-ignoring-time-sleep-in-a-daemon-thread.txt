I have a class that is calling a thread like below.However, sleep is not working. The thread is executed since the first print in run() is being printed however the program terminates instantly after the print statement. For testing purposes I inserted another print statement after the sleep(100) and that does not print either. what is the problem here?This code should be completed and reproducable
The problem is this line:From the threading documentation:A thread can be flagged as a “daemon thread”. The significance of this  flag is that the entire Python program exits when only daemon threads  are left.Because you've made your thread a daemon thread, python doesn't wait for it to finish before exiting the program. As soon as the main thread is done executing your code, the daemon thread is killed and the program exits.There are two ways to solve this problem:Removing the thread.daemon = True assignment so that python will wait for your thread to exit.Explicitly waiting for the thread to finish by calling thread.join().
