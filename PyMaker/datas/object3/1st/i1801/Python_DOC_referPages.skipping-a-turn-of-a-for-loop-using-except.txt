So I am using a function which adds components to the system via:components is a python dictionary, which looks like this:What I am trying the achieve is that I want to run above mentioned for-loop with except, which will be able to not run the add() function if the components dictionary gives None.What I tried:Ofc it gives a syntax error. What is the syntax for it?EXAMPLE:Above is equal with:I want to write my for-loop in a way it adds only a1 and skips None.
I assume that it is like [components[i][1] for i in components.keys() if type(components[i][1]) != type(None)]so that below code can work fine
Use an if condition as except is of no use in this case. You can also make it shorter and more readable by iterating the dict.values() directly:
