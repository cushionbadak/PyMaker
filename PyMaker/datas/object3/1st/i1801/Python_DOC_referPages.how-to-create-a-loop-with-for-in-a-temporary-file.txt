I am working with an encrypted file, but I can't manage to create a loop with for in order to read it before it get closed and removed.My intention is to read the data given in the encrypted file and loop it to assign each line to a variable.Whenever I execute my code, Python just goes straight to finish, without working with the decrypted info; I believe it is because the with command close it before the loop starts.This is what I want, not working, no errors either:This is the working code (Sorry, tried to make it shorter but couldn't):Header for both examples (apart to make it shorter):List.txt content:Any hints?
@LarryLustig pretty much answered why your code wasn't working, but IMO if you eliminate the temp file altogether (which shouldn't be necessary) you don't even   need to worry about the cursor.  See below commented changes on your desired code.Alternatively, if you know for sure what is the line terminator used in the file (e.g. \r\n, or \n) then you can eliminate using os.linesep altogether.
The problem is that once you have written to the file, the "file pointer" is at the end of the file.  There's nothing to read.You can use the seek method to reposition the file pointer at the beginning.  Alternatively, closing and re-opening the file (as in your working code) will position the pointer at the beginning of the file.
