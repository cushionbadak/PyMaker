Why the expression 1>=2==5<=4 results in False?According to the documentation of python 3, the operators >=,==,<= have same precedence and left to right binding. As per the rule, the evaluation of the statement should be in the following manner (assuming True=1 and False=0):I am unable to understand why this expression evaluated as False. I am new to python. Can anyone please help me with the understanding of this operators precedence?
As per the documentation, it's not exactly evaluated left to right. The and's are implicit It's false because at least one (the first) condition is false, causing a short circuit evaluation 
Comparisons can be chained arbitrarily, e.g., x < y <= z is equivalent to x < y and y <= z.1>=2==5<=4 can be written as1>=2 and 2==5 and 5<=4You can learn more about the comparison operators in python here.
Comparisons can be chained arbitrarily, e.g., 1 >= 2 == 5 <= 4is equivalent to 1 >= 2 and 2 == 5 and 5 <= 4 except that 2 and 5 is evaluated only once (but in 1>=2==5 case 5 is not evaluated at all when 1 >= 2 is found to be false and same in case when 2==5<=4, 4 is not evaluated at all when 2 ==5 is fount to be false).Note that 1 >= 2 == 5 <= 4 doesnâ€™t imply any kind of comparison between 1 and 4, and also 2 and 4.
