For example - a left shift:Here is a grid of letters for exampleThis is the effect I want to have. The X symbol fills in the space created by the movement. The grid of letters would be a list where each row is an itemI do not know how long the list is going to beSolution should be pure pythonHow would I do a left shift and a right shift for grid?This is all I have got:

This function will do the job. To confirm backside spaces you can print the length of the string. input_grid is the list of a row as an element.
