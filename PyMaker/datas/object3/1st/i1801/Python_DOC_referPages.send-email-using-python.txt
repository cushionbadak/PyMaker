I want to send emails from my Gmail account using python. I followed steps given in this stackoverflow post: How to send an email with Python? But, my the mails that I sent do not reach the addresses. This is the error that I get:What should I be doing here?
What you've get is a DNS query error indicating that domain myserver does not exist.You have to replace the argument myserver in server = smtplib.SMTP('myserver') with the actual address of SMTP server, such as smtp.mail.yahoo.com.
This is how I do it.
