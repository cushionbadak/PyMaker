I'm looking to define a function that accepts two parameters: an int and a list.If the function finds the integer in the list it returns its coordinates.For example how would I do that for the number 4 in the following list, without using numpy?You can assume that the target will always show up only once and will always be contained in the list.
You can do something like this:Output:
The target will always show up only once and will always be contained in the listYou can use enumerate to enumerate the outer lists and the elements of the inner lists.Demo with your list l:In case you later want to adapt the function to work properly if the target is not in the list, remember that next takes an optional default argument.
I would used solution like this:where I defined a function search, which can be used to search for certain value from an input list.
Here is my approach: Sample usage:NotesTo search a simple list, use the .index() methodThe .index() method will either return the index of the element if found or throw a ValueError if not found. In our context, we just ignore this exception and move on to the next row.At the end of the loop, we will throw an exception because the element is not found
