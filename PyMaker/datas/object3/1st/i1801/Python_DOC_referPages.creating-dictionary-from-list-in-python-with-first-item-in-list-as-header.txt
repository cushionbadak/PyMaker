I am trying to create a list of dictionary with the lists below. I would like the output to be:I tried to use zip but could not get it to work. Please help! 
First we can pull the header entries out so we're left with just the values:Then we can zip together the values, then zip each of those triples with headers to form the dictionaries:

This returns:
Here is a simple solution that I would recommend:Another way to pull keys out of the a_zipped iterator is by using it in nested loops.  The first iteration of the outer loop grabs the keys, while the inerloop grabs each set of values. Unfortunately, this approach is not obvious on first glance:And yet another way to pull out keys from zip(*a) is to use iterable unpacking.  It's clear, but it does create an extra list (all_values):An then there's this silly one-liner:Original Answer:Sometimes a multiline solution can be really straight forward:
We can use pandas for this, which is more "declarative" in the sense that we specify what we do, and not much how we do that:for the given a this gives:
Kindof ugly oneliner:first triple the first element of each inner list and zip it with the remaining elements, then zip the unpacked innner tuples to feed it into a dict:Output:
You could use extended iterable unpacking:Output
