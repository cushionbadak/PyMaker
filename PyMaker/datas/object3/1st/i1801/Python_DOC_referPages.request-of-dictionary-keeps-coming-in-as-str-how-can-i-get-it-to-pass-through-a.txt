Hi I made an http POST and it keeps receiving as a string. I am trying to get it as a dictionary so I can pull each key, value.I have my $http.post('/route/', data).success({console.log("succes")}}My data:Then from my views:And would print as:{"company":"AkshaYagna","farmer":"Child.farm 06","number":"+14087729399"}Declaring that the whole thing is a string. I feel like I am missing something here.
request.body returns byte string. So you can use json.loads function, for example:
Since you are using Django RESTFramework, you could use request.data to get the parsed contents.
