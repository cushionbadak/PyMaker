I want to print a phrase at the end of my function, but my desired output is not printing. There are no errors popping up in python, it just isn't printing and acting like it is ignoring it. wordlist is the list of words the user entered to find how many times each word appears in the website they entered. sitewordlist is the entire list of words in the website.
You're using while-loops to act like for-loops, but you're using the same iterator x in both, and you're not resetting its value to 0 in between. So the second while-loop sees that x is already equal to len(wordlist), and so it doesn't execute the body of the loop.
Problem: in your first while you increase x until it is equal to  len(wordlist) - your second while is only entered if x is smaller then len(wordlist) - thats kind of contradictionary. You can use collections.Counter to count things easily and get a dict from it:Output:Full Counter:While is not really appropriate here. You can simulate Counter using a normal dict and while like so:Output:Or use for ... in conjunction with a normal / defaultdict:with identical output.
