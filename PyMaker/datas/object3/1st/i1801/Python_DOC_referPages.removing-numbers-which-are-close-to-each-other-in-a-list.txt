The below uses groupby to identify runs from the iterable that start with a value start and contain values that differ from start by no more than 4.  We then collect all of those start values into a list.This assumes that the input data is already sorted.  If it's not, you'll have to sort it: groupby(sorted(mylist), runs()).  
You can accomplish this using a set or list, you don't need a dict.This method stores all values within 4 of every value you've seen so far.  When you look at a new value from myList, you only need to check if you've seen something in it's ballpark before by checking usedValues.
