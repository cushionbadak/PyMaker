I want to make a list of all of my saved wifi files, with a number in front of each file but my output is not what I what from my code.Expected output: 1 wifi-test2 androidAP3 androidAPtestoutput now:0 wifi-test1 androidAP2 androidAPtest0 wifi-test1 androidAP2 androidAPtestand then it starts over 
How a Loop inside a Loop worksI think there you have a misunderstanding in what happens when you put a loop inside a loop, so let me explain that first. If you have, for examplethen your output would be:a1a2b1b2The code would start in the a loop first, and then it would go over both items in the inner loop. Once finished, the next item in the outer loop is b, and then it will go over both items in the inner loop again.If you want to keep track of how many items you've gone over in your loop, you could do so with this type of pattern:This results in1a2aBut there is a shortcut. You can use a nifty function called enumerate to get the count of each item in the for loop.Which will also give you1a2aSolution to your problemWith all this said, you can create your list of files like soAnd if you don't care about sub-directories, you can just do
It's not quite clear what you want with your code. What's that count for?Maybe this is what you want:
I'm not sure what count is supposed to do here, but if you want the files in the directory (not subdirectories) you just need os.listdir. 
This is exactly what a nested loop will do.Check the outputs of the loops independently:It says you have 2 files the directory.So this is the first thing you want to look at. Because if the output is supposed to be one, it's counting another thing inside dirs. What is it counting? Debug it by printing the loops separately.Also, for the next problem you can solve it by hardcoding an innocent +1
