I'm sorry if a similar problem has been asked, I could not find it.I need to check whether string_a contains all the characters from string_b including the non-unique ones.Example 1:Example 2 (returns True because now string_a has enough 'a's):I tried set() method but it only works if the characters of the strings are unique. So I have this:I want it to be False because string_b has three 'a's and string_a only two.
What you're doing is interpreting the strings as multisets and checking if one is a subset of the other. Python's multiset representation is collections.Counter:Unfortunately, Counter doesn't implement a is_subset method, so we have to write our own. Here are two ways to do it:
Using Counter as a solution seems best to me. First count all characters in string_a, then go through string_b char by char and substract from the counter or fail if counter=0. This allows us to get a solution in O(n), reading each string once.
