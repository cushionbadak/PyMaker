Natural Text
I want to loop through a string and find a character that is not a letter or number or _ . @. This my code:Unfortunately it doen't detect anthing while it should return the index of the space.
You forgot to add (): mystr[x].isalpha. To call function you should do mystr[x].isalpha(). mystr[x].isalpha is always evaluated to True, that's why your code doesn't print anything
Use enumerate() wich returns the pos and the character you iterate:Output:
Using a regex:OutputThe pattern '[^\d\w\.@]' matches everything that is not a digit, not a letter, nor _, . or @.
