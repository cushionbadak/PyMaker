I am making a program that calculates the sum of all even and odd numbers between two number which are user inputted. I'm new to Python and am not sure how to use the range in a loop to make my program work. Here is my code. I know its sloppy and not well put together and not finished but any help works thanks.
It's important to know if n is greater than m and invert situation if so. Other than that, you need to know if the smallest number is odd or even and begin the two ranges accordingly:
Input validation is a big part of good coding. A good overview can be found here:Asking the user for input until they give a valid responseTo make the validation it reusable I put the validation in a function that only accept integers and (if a minval is provided, makes sure that the input is bigger that the minval.I use it to get the first number, and the second number gets the first one as "constraint" so it will be bigger. For summation I just use the range starting once with n once with n+1 till m and a range step of 2. I check what even/oddness n has and print text accordingly:Output:Doku:sum(iterable)try: except: error handlingpython ternary operator (thats the thing @ "Odd sum:" if n % 2 == 1 else "Even sum:" in the print statement)
Here's a function I think fits into the description of what you asked above. It returns None if the user doesn't enter the type of query he or she wants.So query can either be odd or even and depending on this, it calculates the sum that you want. The function makes use of list comprehension which is super cool too.
