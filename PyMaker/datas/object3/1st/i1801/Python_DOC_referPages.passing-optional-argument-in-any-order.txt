I am trying to learn some new trick with my python code using *args and **kwargs.When calling my program, I want to pass or not two optional parameters which can come in any order. Obviously if no argument are given during the call, the variable should get some default value.in my usual code I would have something like this if i know the exact place of each parameters and that all parameters must be given:but this time, since i want to be able to give any of the two parameters and in any order, i am getting stuck at how i should write it.When doing:python mycode.py i want to have var1 = 10 and debug=False python mycode.py var1=4.3 i want to have var1 = 4.3 and debug=False python mycode.py debug='True' i want to have var1 = 10 and debug=True python mycode.py var1=-5 debug='True' i want to have var1 = -5 and debug=True python mycode.py debug='True' var1=-5 i want to have var1 = -5 and debug=Truelast thing, is there also a way that user can call using debug=true with all small letter and not triggering an error message?Thanks in advance for the help
*args and **kwargs refer to arguments for functions. Read about it in the docs: More on Defining FunctionsFor command-line arguments, have a look at the Python docs again:Common utility scripts often need to process command line arguments.  These arguments are stored in the sys moduleâ€™s argv attribute as a list. For instance the following output results from running python demo.py one two three at the command line:[...] More powerful and flexible command line processing is provided by the argparse module.Docs for argparseTutorial for argparse
