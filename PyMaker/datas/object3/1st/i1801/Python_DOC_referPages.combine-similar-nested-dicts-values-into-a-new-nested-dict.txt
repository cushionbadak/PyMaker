An example of a nested dict that I have to work with looks like this:I am trying to create a new nested dict d2 from it, having the new keys being the keys of the outermost dict of d1, and then the values of each of those keys to be the combination of the values of all the inner d1's keys. So, if 'anticipation' for example is showing in more than one key, the values of 'anticipation' should be added together.Desired output would look like this:So far, I have this code that somehow does not go through all the keys of the inner dict and just outputs the values of the last one:Current output:How do I iterate through all the keys of the inner dict and then compare values to add them together?I hope that my question is clear. Any kind of hints would be greatly appreciated!
You could use Counter on the values of the inner dictionaries:OutputThe statement sum(map(Counter, inner.values()), Counter()) transforms each inner dictionary into a Counter and then combine them together using sum. This can be done because Counter implements addition, for instance:returns:UPDATEIf you want the total for each key, just add these lines:Output
