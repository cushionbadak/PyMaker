I want controlling c++ class object in python.I'm expected example.Objected class in c++ and send object to python.Control object in python.if object is controlled in python, animal in c++ is also applied because animal is c++ object's reference in python.I already try SWIG and succeeded binding Animal class to python.But it only control created class object  in python.Sorry bad english.
I solved this problem by using static global variable.declare static global variable shared python variable in header file.Write function to set and get g_animal.You can set created animal object pointer in c++ to use in python.To set g_aniaml in python, use PyObject_CallFunction().And you must get your python module. To get python animal module, I use swig.Then, you should write control.py to control animal. Sure, You should Call control.py manually in c++.Now, if you control obj in control.py, animal in c++ change also.
