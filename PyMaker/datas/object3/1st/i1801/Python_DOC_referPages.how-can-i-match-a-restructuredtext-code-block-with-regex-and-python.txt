Natural Text
I am trying to extract a code block from a .rst document using Python and regex. The code blocks in the document are defined by adding a .. code-block:: python directive to the text and then indenting by a few spaces. Here is an example from my test document:So far I have this regex:(\.\. code-block:: python\s\s)(.*\s.+).*?\n\s+(.*\s.+)+The problem with this pattern is that it selects only the first part and last part of the test string. I need help in writing a pattern that can capture everything within the .. code-block:: python code block excluding the ..code-block:: python directive.You can see the progress I have made with this here.
If you insist on using regex, the following should do the trick, given provided example:The trick, I believe, is to use nested parenthesis and the MULTILINE or M flag.The resulting match object(s) will have 3 groups, as defined by the parenthesis:group 1: the '.. code-block:' headergroup 2: the contents of the code blockgroup 3: an empty group as a result of the extra grouping parenthesis.To retrieve group n, use match.group(n). Note that indexing of groups starts at 1 and passing 0 or no arguments will result in the entire matching string.
