when I run this program, it doesn't change the value in my database. Is it because something is wrong with the options section or is there the other problem? I don"t know what it is, I hope someone can help me with this.
After you make changes to the database, you must commit them. sqlite3 does not commit changes by default. Every time you do cursor.execute(...), follow it up with a cursor.commit()See here for more information https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html
