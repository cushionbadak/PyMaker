How do i sort the DataFrame by weekday names? I cannot use pd.to_datetime() method because my dates aren't numbers.
You can convert values of column to ordered categoricals, so possible use sort_values:Or create index by column Date by set_index, then reindex and last reset_index:Notice:Solution working only if unique values of column
Use calendar.day_name with categorical data:If in your culture Monday is not considered the first day of the week, you can rotate your days of the week by n days. For example:Then feed categories=days as an argument to pd.Categorical.
