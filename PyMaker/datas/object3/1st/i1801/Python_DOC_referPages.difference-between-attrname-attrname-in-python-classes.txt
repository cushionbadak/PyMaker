I am trying to understand the difference between the class attributes __value and value in below python class.Above code gives error "AttributeError: WithClass instance has no attribute '__value'". But below code does not give any error. What is the difference between the declaration of two attributes? Any resources to understanding the importance of "__" in python would be appreciated.
Adding two underscores in front of a class variable performs "name mangling", effectively making the variable private to the outside world (so it is not as easy for code outside the class to change it). More information about it is viewable in the python documentation.
