I have a question about change dictionary format. The dictionary is :I want to ask is there a way for me to change the format like below:
You can do the following:Try it online!There are a few moving parts that interact to create this solution:Dict comprehensionsPython has a neat trick where it allows you to embed for in loops in iterable and dict declarations to efficiently cycle and modify a set of elements. Here, the outer iterator is range(0, len(dict1), col_width): this goes through a sequence of integers starting from 0, and progressively increases by col_width until it is greater than or equal to the size of the list, which functions to choose the start index of each col_width-sized dict segment. Tuple unpackingdict1.items() is convenient because it returns a dict view of 2-tuples of each dictionary key and its value. Later, we utilize tuple unpacking k: v for k, v in d1_items[ ... ], where a tuple of variables is flattened into two variables that can then easily form a key-value pair of the currrent dictionary comprehension. (This is only in newer versions of Python.)List slicingd1_items[col_num:col_num + col_width] is basically a way of getting a sublist. The syntax in relatively straightforward: starting from position col_num, get a sublist up to and excluding the element col_num + col_width (i.e. a sublist of size col_width).Formatted string literalsPreceding a string with f makes it a formatted string literal. Anything within { } is interpreted as literal Python syntax (with the exception of ', {, and }, which may vary behavior by context.) Here, in f'column{col_num // col_width + 1}', it allows us to label each column with a bit of division and a +1 offset to start counting from 1 instead of 0. (This is new to Python 3.6)
