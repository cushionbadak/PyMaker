This question already has an answer here:Difference between append vs. extend list methods in Python                    27 answers                Why does += behave unexpectedly on lists?                    7 answers                For Python list, is append() the same as +=?I know that + will lead to the creation of a new list, while append() just append new stuff to the old list.But will += be optimized to be more similar to append()? since they do the same thing.
It's an __iadd__ operator. Docs.Importantly, this means that it only tries to append. "For instance, if x is an instance of a class with an __iadd__() method, x += y is equivalent to x = x.__iadd__(y) . Otherwise, x.__add__(y) and y.__radd__(x) are considered, as with the evaluation of x + y."This thread specifically deals with lists and their iadd behavior
