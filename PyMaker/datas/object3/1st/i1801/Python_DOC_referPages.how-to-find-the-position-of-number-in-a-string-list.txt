Natural Text
I want to convert it into a list of all numbers. In other words, remove all non-digit characters from all the strings from the list. The result should be a list of integers not strings.Any help is much appreciated! Thanks
You can use re.subHere re.sub('[^0-9]','',x) will replace all the characters other than numbers(0-9) from the string. 
Something simple and easy to understand like this will do the trick...It loops through every item in the list a and loops through each character of a. It checks if the character is a number and if so, adds it to the string to add to the output (b)Hope that helps!
Without regex, you can use str.isdigit with a list comprehension:
