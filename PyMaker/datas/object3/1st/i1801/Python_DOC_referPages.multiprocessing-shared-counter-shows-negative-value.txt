I'm trying to implement multiprocessing counter in my script, but not sure if I'm doing things right, since results does not making any sense.Now after stopping the script I've got those weird results:I suspect that I can't sum multiprocessing shared var with local method's var, but I can't find anything about this topic, and how to workaround the issue.Thanks
It seems that your problem is from overflow: Value('i', 0) is a signed 32 bit integer, which can count up to 2147483647 (roughly 2GiB for byte counting).The largest data type for Value is 'Q' for unsigned long long (at least 64bit). This can handle the range [0, 18_446_744_073_709_551_615] or up to 16EiB for byte counting. If you care about proper sign handling, the signed long long type 'q' can still count up to 8EiB.
