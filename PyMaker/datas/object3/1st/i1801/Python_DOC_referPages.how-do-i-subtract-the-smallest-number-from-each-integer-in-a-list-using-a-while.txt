input:5 is how many numbers follow after.My code:I'm suppose to subtract the smallest number from the 5 integers.The correct output:204006055My output:02006055I understand why my output is wrong since the smallest number is 20 until 10 is inputed, but I don't know how to correct it. I tried different ways, but none of them work. How do I subtract the smallest number from each integer?
Collect all the input first, then find the minimum value and print the numbers.

Get the inputs to a list. Take minimum of this list using min() and then subtract minimum value from each of the list elements:
This looks like a default puzzle for sites like Hackerrank ... take all the inputs , then perform your operations on all inputs. Do not meddle with data while still gathering inputs (unless it makes sense to do so).A nice way of getting all the data is:Output:Read the doku for map(), int(), min() and look at Built in functions: do not use those as names for your variables, neither use list,dict,set,tuple.
Try this:Output:
