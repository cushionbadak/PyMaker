The beginning and the ending is marked by clear beginning / ending expressions (letter_beg / letter_end).

Here is my sample text and my code so far:
I am not entirely sure what is your expected output, but it is quite simple to do this without regular expressions (an thus get rid of one problem).The solution below assumes sample_text contains \n (line breakes) and will not work if sample_text is a one long line (i.e. without any \n).The output isEDITBased on your last comment I can think of two ways to do this. Hopefully one of them will solve your problem.Option 1OutputOption 2Output
If you insist on using a monolithic regex, add a positive lookahead for a line containing more than 20 characters at the end:You may also need to add the re.DOTALL flag:
