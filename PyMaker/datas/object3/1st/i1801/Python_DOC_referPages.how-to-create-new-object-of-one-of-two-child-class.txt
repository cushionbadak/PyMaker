I have class Animal and two Child classes Fish and BearIn code i have array of Animal type objects named FieldI have function create_actor_child with input actor (Animal object). This function should creates new Animal with same child class. I am using if - watching is Parent Bear - spawn Bear, else spawn Fish. But if i will have 10 child it will be hard. I think there should be solution to create new copy of parent class. I need something like self.field.append(parent_class(actor)).Is there an easy way to do so in Python or do I need to create my own method?
from a semantical POV, inheritance describes a "is a" relationship, so (as long as your child classes respect liskov's substitution principle) a fish or bear IS an animal already. Also, creating "new copy of parent class" will actually create new distinct objects which is certainly not what you want.A better solution is to keep a registery (dict) of child classes (using  type as key) and provide a factory function or method, ie:Note that at this point if don't have any other use for Animal.type you could as well just use the child class itself directly (and get rid of the registry):You may also want to check the abc module for some more evolved features wrt/ subclasses etc.
