I would like to read through a file and capitalize the first letters in a string using Python, but some of the strings may contain numbers first. Specifically the file might look like this:I would like this to be:I have tried the following, but this only capitalizes if the letter is in the first position.Any suggestions? :-)
Using regular expressions:
You can use regular expression to find the position of the first alphabet and then use upper() on that index to capitalize that character. Something like this should work:
You can write a function with a for loop:
How about this?The result is: 1234Hello
May be worth trying ...
You can find the first alpha character and capitalize it like this:Which Outputs:
Like this, for example:
try this:Execution result:
You can use regular expression for that:output: 66645World
There is probably a one-line REGEX approach, but using title() should also work:Producing:
Okay, there is already a lot of answers, that should work.I find them overly complicated or complex though...Here is a simpler solution:
The title() method will capitalize the first alpha character of the string, and ignore the digits before it. It also works well for non-ASCII characters, contrary to the regex methods using [a-zA-Z].From the doc:str.title() Return a titlecased version of the string where words  start with an uppercase character and the remaining characters are  lowercase. [...] The algorithm uses a simple language-independent  definition of a word as groups of consecutive letters. The definition  works in many contexts but it means that apostrophes in contractions  and possessives form word boundaries, which may not be the desired  result:We can take advantage of it this way:A few tests:
With re.sub and repl as a function:If repl is a function, it is called for every non-overlapping  occurrence of pattern. The function takes a single match object  argument, and returns the replacement string.Output:
Using isdigit() and title() for strings:
