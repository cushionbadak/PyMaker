What is the most efficient ("pythonic") way to test/check if two numbers are co-primes (relatively prime) in Python.For the moment I have this code:Can the code for checking/testing if two numbers are relatively prime be considered "Pythonic" or there is some better way?
The only suggestion for improvement might be with your function gcd. Namely, you could use gcd that's defined in math (for Python 3.5) for a speed boost.Defining coprime2 that uses the built-in version of gcd:You almost cut down execution speed by half due to the fact that math.gcd is implemented in C (see math_gcd in mathmodule.c):For Python <= 3.4 you could use fractions.gcd but, as noted in a comment by @user2357112, it is not implemented in C. Actually, there's really no incentive to actually use it, its implementation is exactly the same as yours.
