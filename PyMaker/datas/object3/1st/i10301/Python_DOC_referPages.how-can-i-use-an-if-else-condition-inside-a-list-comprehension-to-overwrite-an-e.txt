I'm trying to multiply numbers greater than 3 by two, and subtract one from everything else. However, nothing happens to the list.This is my code:Why aren't the contents of the lst variable modified by the list comprehension?
You didnt re-assigned it to the variable name.
List Comprehensions and AssignmentYou're missing an assignment. List comprehensions like yours don't do in-place modifications to the list elements. Instead, the expression returns a new list, so you must assign the result of the list comprehension expression back to a variable. For example:In Ruby, there are certainly methods for performing self-mutating operations, but I'm not personally aware of a Python equivalent that retains the semantics that you're trying to use here.
