Here I have a dataset:Desired result:My code:I know the itertools module can solve this problem, but want to write a function to transfer the data into a tuple without importing any modules. I reviewed some past questions posted on the forum, but am still confused about doing this.
Here is how you could do it without import of itertools:
Below is the simplified solution to achieve it using re.compile() and itertools.combinations() functions. In order to flatten the list, I am using operator.add() with reduce() function:
The "Roughly equivalent to" code from the docs of the itertools function you have been wisely advised to use shows a correct version that is actually written in Python:https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.combinations
This works, but gives out put in a different order.  If you care about that, you have to start at the end of the list of nodes and build towards it.
