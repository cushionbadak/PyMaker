I have installed Python 3.5 through Anaconda on the OSX system. After installing and activating the virtual environment, The Python version is Python 2.7.10. And while we are allowed to load the interpreter of our choice in virtualenv, "/usr/bin/" only has folders for Python 2.6 and 2.7. After finding out the Anaconda python 3.5 path (   /Users/Username/anaconda/lib/python3.5)and trying to load it,for: virtualenv -p /Users/Username/anaconda/lib/python3.5 venvthe code returns a [Errno 13] Permission Deniedfor: virtualenv -p /Users/Username/anaconda/bin/python3.5 venvthere seems to be another type of error...
This error results from trying to combine incompatible versions of Python and the virtualenv tool.  I'm not sure precisely where the incompatibility comes from, but I do know how to work around it.Assuming your Python is reasonably functional and recent (read: 3.3 or later), this should always work:The first venv is the venv module.  The second is the name of the directory where you want to create a virtualenv.  This command asks Python to create a virtualenv itself, rather than shelling out to a third-party tool.  Thus, we can be reasonably confident Python will do it correctly, and in particular that it will not be incompatible with itself.Unfortunately, the version of Python installed with Anaconda cannot be described as "reasonably functional" because it lacks ensurepip.  That makes it impossible for the venv module to bootstrap pip into your virtualenv.  So you will need to build your venv without pip, and then install it manually:Then download and run get-pip.py from within the virtualenv.
