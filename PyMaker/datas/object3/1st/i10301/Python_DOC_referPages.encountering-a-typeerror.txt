Natural Text
This is my original code, which runs fine on Python:I then attempted to clean up the repetition:For some reason the new code does not completely run, it gets to line 27 and then returns TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for %: 'NoneType' and 'str'Any idea on how I can correct this issue?I am very new to coding in general and I am learning to code in Python 2.6, using Zed Shaw's "Learning Code the Hard Way", so any help with this would be much appreciated.
It looks like your line target.write("%s \n%s \n%s \n") % (line1, line2, line3) is the problem. You've closed off the write function call before doing the variable substitutions. So the variables line1, line2, and line3 are not being inserted into the %s's. Therefore you've got a bunch of None's getting written instead which is causing the error.Change it to look like this:
% is a string operator; you are trying to use it with the return value of target.write().If you are just starting, I encourage you to switch to Python 3.5 and the str.format syntax. This way, you won't have problems with the premature closure of parentheses:Version 3.6 is currently in development and starting beta testing, and it will have a much more natural syntax for building this kind of string called f strings:
