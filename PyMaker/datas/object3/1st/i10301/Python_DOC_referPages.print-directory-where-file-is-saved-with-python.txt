Convert the relative path to absolute path:Then take just the directory from the absolute path:That will work regardless of what filename is. It could by just a filename, a relative path or absolute path.See os.path documentation for other useful functions.
If no path is given then the file is opened in the current working directory. This is returned by os.getcwd().
You can use os.getcwd() for getting the current working directory:Otherwise, you could also specify the full path for the file when opening it, e.g.
Using f.name provides the file name if you didn't supply it as a separate variable.Using os.path.abspath() provides the full file name including it's directory path i.e. in this case "/home/rolf/def"Using os.path.dirname() strips the file name from the path, as that you already know.
