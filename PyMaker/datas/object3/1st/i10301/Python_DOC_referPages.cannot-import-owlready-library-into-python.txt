I am a beginner in Python. I am working on an ontology using owlready. I've installed owlready library on my PyCharm IDE, but there is an issue with importing owlready in my python code. I've tried from owlready import * just like in the documentation, but it always give me:
It looks like Owlready is for Python 3 while you're using Python 2. Change your python version for it to work.The invalid syntax error is because of the new Python 3 argument lists, see: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#arbitrary-argument-lists
