Natural Text
Do you know a simpler way to achieve the same result as this?I have this code:I also tried with this:
You can use sets for comparison.Two sets are equal if and only if every element of each set is contained in the other
Don't miss the bigger picture. Here is a better way to approach the problem in general.What if you would define the "mixes" dictionary where you would have mixes of colors as keys and the resulting colors as values.One idea for implementation is to use immutable by nature frozensets as mapping keys:This way you may easily scale the solution up, add different mixes without having multiple if/else nested conditions.
