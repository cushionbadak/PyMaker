Natural Text
I am a beginner at python and I am trying to figure out how I can randomly display text. For example, 60% chance of "Hello", 40% chance of saying "Goodbye", etc. Right now, for fun, I am trying to create sort of a bottle flip game. If you don't know what it is, its basically when you flip a half empty water bottle and try to land it. This is what I have: (This is more than likely completely wrong.)
You have the right idea, basically, but you can greatly simplify your code.You can change the values in your call to randrange and in the if statements above to get just about any weighting you'd like.Note that in your original question you were comparing numbers to strings. I changed that here. Comparing numbers to strings (i.e. 3 == "3") will always be False.
You could also use a list of the possible solutions.
