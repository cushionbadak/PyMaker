Natural Text
I don't have a lot of Python experience and can't figure out how to use a list of strings with the SearchVector functionality described here. I'm using Django 1.10 with PostgreSQL 9.6 and have verified that this works if I write the fields in manually. This function is from a class based view and its purpose is to receive a string from a form, then do a full text search against all CharFields in all Models within MyApp, then return the results (planning on using itertools to combine multiple QuerySets once I get this working). I don't want to hardcode the fields because we will be adding new objects and new fields regularly - its a sort of corporate middleware app where I am not able to master the data. I've tried ','.join(MyList) but of course that just makes one big string. 
Expand the list using * and SearchVector will happily search multiple fields.
