Natural Text
I have some text files in Persian. each file contains a lot of sentences, each in a new line. And in front of each sentence there is a tab, then a word, then a tab and then an English word. These English words in some files are 2, in some are 3, in some are 5 and in some other, are more or less. Actually, they show the sentences classes. I have to count each class's total words separately (just count the words of sentences not the words after them). For that I have to change the file to a list, so that I can achieve the sentences. Now the problem is that, how should I write the code that it returns each class's total words separately. Below is the sample sentences. Now I don't know how to continue. I appreciate a lot if someone can help. (I have no background in programming).
If I get you correctly then the next code might work. Please note, that I use Python 3.x.
Try to formulate your algorithm on paper then convert it to Python: I'm sure you'll find your solution by yourself.If you encounter problems or errors, post your question here, we will be happy to help.An advice: You can use ˋcsv` module to read your file. Look for some tutorial with this keyword.You can use ˋcollection.Counter` to count the number of occurrences of words. This can be useful.
