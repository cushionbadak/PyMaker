I'm a bit new to Spark and I am trying to do a simple mapping.My data is like the following:What I want to do is grabbing the first item in each tuple, so ultimately something like this: Can someone help me out with how to map this?I'll appreciate that!

Something like this? kv here meaning "key-value" and mapping itemgetter over the values. So, map within a map :-)Output
