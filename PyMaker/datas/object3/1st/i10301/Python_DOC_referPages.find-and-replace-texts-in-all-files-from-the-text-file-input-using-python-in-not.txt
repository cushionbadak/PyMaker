Natural Text
I'm using Notepad ++ to do a find and replacement function. Currently I have a a huge numbers of text files. I need to do a replacement for different string in different file. I want do it in batch. For example.I have a folder that has the huge number of text file. I have another text file that has the strings for find and replace in orderText1 Text1-correctedText2 Text2-correctedI have a small script that do this replacement only for the opened files in Notepad++. For achieving this I'm using python script in Notepad++. The code is as follows.In simple words, the find and replace function should fetch the input from a file.Thanks in advance. 
Read replacements into a list of tuples, then go through each file, and read the contents into memory, do the replacements, then write it back.  I think the files get overwritten properly, but you might want to double check.
