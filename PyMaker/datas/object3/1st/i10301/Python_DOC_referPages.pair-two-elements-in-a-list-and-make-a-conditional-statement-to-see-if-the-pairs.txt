I have this homework assignment and seem to be stuck on this question.Write a function that takes, as an argument, a list called aList. It returns a Boolean True if the list contains three pairs of integers, and False otherwise.Example:I've tried using indexes and I don't really know how to slice so I'm stuck in figuring out how I make those pairs equal to each other in the condition so it is True.This is what I had previous to deleting it and trying again.
You don't need to slice, you need index access (as a side note, you should ask your teacher if they've ever heard of pep8, three_pairs(mylist) would be far better):But if you're ever returning True and False like this, you can just return the result of the comparison:Though as other answers allude - your examples are not well defined. What if you have:Should that return True, or False?
How about making a Counter() and check how many "pairs" you've got:Works for a list with any length and any input number of pairs.Instead of using a sum() to count all the pairs, you can iterate over the counter one value at a time and have an early exit if number of pairs reaches or exceeds the input number of pairs.
You could zip the a sliced list with itself one position ahead, with steps equal to 2 to get adjacent elements. Then feed that to all with the condition you need:zip simply takes an element from each of the iterables supplied and returns it as a tuple until one of the sequences is exhausted. So, for example, if l = [5, 6, 3, 2, 1, 4] and zip is used with zip(l[::2], l[1::2]) you'd have:
