I have to write a program that shows a column of kilograms and a column of pounds, starting at 1 kilogram and ending 99, increasing every step with 2.I have the following code, and the range() works for the pounds part, but not for the kilograms part. It stays always 1 for the kilograms.Also, why can't I use floats in the range, because officially it is 2.2 pounds.Thanks in advance!
Because you use break with in a loop.In python you don't end a loop with anything but a decreased indentation. Remove your break statements and try again.The break statements ends the current loop unconditionally. For example,will make s equal to 5050. However, if you break it some where, likes will stop increasing on 15.As commentors say, you should learn the basics of python from some tutorial. There are pretty many free tutorials on the internet. Don't haste.Besides, if you wanna use float steps in ranges, take a look at this answer; or rather, see comments below for a simple answer.
First off, remove the breaks, as those will prematurely end the loops iterations. Secondly, why are you using nested forloops?For what you described, nested loops are not even required. You simply need to use one forloop. Use range() once, to step through the values 1 to 99 in increments of 2.From you description, something such as this should suffice:You seem to be confused about loops in python and he builtin range() function. I recommend looking at the official Python documentation for both:Python documentation for for loopsPython documentation for break statementPython documentation for range() function
Try thisyou may have to change the printout to the format you like.
