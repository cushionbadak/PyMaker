I use the following to see if the data is an integer, if not it tells me. Is there a way to determine which one is incorrect so can change it or would i have to create the same loop for every item?Thanks for any help :)
Instead of trying to convert to int (btw int(1.23) works, returning 1) you can also use numbers likeif you want to check if you have a number which can loslessy be converted to an integral number (like int) you can do
To know the type of a variable you can use isinstance(variable_name, int), this will return the Boolean value.
