I am trying to compare two tables (table_a and table_b) and subtract the last column of table_a from the last column of table_b. However, table_a includes an extra row and is causing me to get a NoneType Error. Is there a away I can still include the "Plums" row from table_a and just output 'NULL' for the delta cell? Below is my testable code.Current Code:Output with Error:If I add a if statement to remove NoneType it prints the table without an error but excludes the "Plums" row.Output with If Statement:I would like to have the below output. Where the "Plums" row still prints but has the string 'NULL" for the delta cell.Desired Output:
itertools.zip_longest accepts an optional fillvalue parameter. If it's provided, it is used instead of None:You can provide empty row (a list of NULL values) as the fillvalue:
zip_longest returns a singular None type when it runs out of values. You want a list of Nones or you get a TypeError when you try and use the subscript [] operator. Use the optional fillvalue to get a list of Nones and then test for None when you format for output so you don't get another TypeError when you try and do p-q when q is None:
