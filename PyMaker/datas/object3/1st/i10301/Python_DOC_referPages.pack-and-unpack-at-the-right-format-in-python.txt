I'm looking to unpack from a buffer a string and its length.For example to obtain (4, 'Gégé') from this buffer :b'\x00\x04G\xE9g\xe9'Does someone know how to do ?
The length data looks like a big-endian unsigned 16 bit integer, and the string data looks like it's using the Latin1 encoding. If that's correct, you can extract it like this:outputAnother possibility for the encoding is the old Windows code page 1252, which can be decoded using .decode('cp1252').The above code works in both Python 2 & Python 3. But in Python 3 there's an easier way: we don't need struct.unpack, we can use the int.from_bytes method.
