This question already has an answer here:Function returns None without return statement                    6 answers                I'm an absolute beginner to Python and programming in general and I have just had my first exposure to functions. I have define two simple functions below:Having saved the above to a script called function.py, I then use the windows power shell to run the script, and it prints the following as you would expect:However when I amend the script to:It prints:Out of curiosity why does it do this when I prefix output1 and output2 with print?
It works like this, because:    means that you want to print the RESULT of the function (ie. the value of return).And because there is no return in your function, by default it's None.Would result in:
A function can have a return value: you call the function and it returns something back to where it was called.A function returns None by default in Python.You're now also printing the return value of output1 and output2.You can read more about this in this section of the Python language tutorial.
