so I'm new to working with JSON and I'm trying to work with the openrecipe database from here.  The db dump you get looks like this...I tried the following code to read in the databaseWith this I received the following TracebackThe only way I could find around this error was to only have one entry in the json file.  Is the db formatted incorrectly or am I reading in the data wrong?Thanks for any help!
The file is not a json array. Each line of the file is a json document, but the whole file is not in json format.Read the file by lines, and use json.loads:You may also need to pass the encoding parameter to open(). See here.
