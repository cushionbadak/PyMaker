Here is the question, I'm  trying to deﬁne a function sample_mean that takes in a list of numbers as a parameter and returns the sample mean of the the numbers in that list. Here is what I have so far, but I'm not sure it is totally right. 
Firstly, don't use list as a name because it shadows/hides the builtin list class for the scope in which it is declared. Use a name that describes the values in the list, in this case samples might be a good name. The function could be implemented with something like this:Or a shorter version which avoids writing your own loop by making use of Python's sum() function :Call the function like this:Note the use of float() to ensure that the division operation does not lose the fractional part. This is only an issue in Python 2 which uses integer division by default. Alternatively you could add this to the top of your script:If you are sure that you only need to support Python 3 you can remove the float() and ignore the above.
As stated above by @idjaw, don't use list as a parameter instead use listr (for example). Your values = [list] is erroneous (also stated by @idjaw) and should be removed.Also, according to PEP257, you should not use "(list) -> number" in your docstrings as that should only be used for builtins.Finally, your loop should look like for l in listr: and then you add values to your mean variable. divide it by the number of values in the list and print the result.
