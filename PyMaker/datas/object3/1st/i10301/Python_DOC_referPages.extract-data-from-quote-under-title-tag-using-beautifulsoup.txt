Natural Text
I want to extract title of a link after getting its HTML via BeautifulSoup library in python.Basically, the whole title tag is I want to extract data that is in &quot tags that is only this Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib, financial and military support to dictators in Latin America during the cold war. REALLY, AMERICA? (3)I tried as I also tried as and But no one is working.
Just split the text on the colon:Actually looking at the page you don't need to split at all, the text is in the p tag inside the div.js-tweet-text-container, th:So you can do it either way for the same result.
Once you have parsed the html:Find the title this way:Now find two quotes (") in the string. There are many ways to do that. I would use regex:You never search for &quot; or any other &NAME; sequences because BeautifulSoup converts them to the actual characters they represent.EDIT:Regex which does not capture the quotes would be:
Here is a simple complete example using regex to extract the text within quotes:What happen's here is that after getting pages's source and finding the title we use a regular expression against the title to extract the text within the quotes.We tell the regular expression to look for an arbitrary number of symbols at the beginning of the string (^.*) before the opening quote (\"), then capture the text between it and the closing quote (second \").Then we print the captured text by telling Python to print the first captured group (the part between parenthesis in regex).Here's more on matching with regex in python - https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#match-objects
