I have a function which will recursively execute another function inside and I want to share variable for all execution of that function.Something like that:However, I'm getting error NameError: name 'x' is not definedThere is hacky solution to make list and use first value of that list as x. But this is so ugly.So how can I share x with incx function ? Or should I use completely different approach ?
You want to use the nonlocal statement to access x, which is not global but local to testglobal.The closest you can come to doing this in Python 2 is to replace x with a mutable value, similar to the argument hack you mentioned in your question.Here's an example using a function attribute instead of a list, an alternative that you might find more attractive.
This will work unless you are still using Python 2.x:Possible a cleaner solution though would be to define a class to store your state between method calls.
Use the nonlocal statement, so incx will use the x variable from testglobal:
