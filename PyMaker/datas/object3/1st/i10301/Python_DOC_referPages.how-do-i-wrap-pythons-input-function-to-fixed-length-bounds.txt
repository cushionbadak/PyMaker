Natural Text
The title can be a little misleading, so let me explain what I'm trying to do:Python 3.5's input() function reads plaintext keyboard input. It does not stay on one line, or wrap to a specific width.Say I have this "textbox":And then enter "some text":How would I do this?Edit: My intentions are keeping the text inside the box while typing, not after it.
Unfortunately I do not think this is possible with input(). Something like prompt_toolkit might work, but definitely not from input() (which actually lets the terminal echo entered characters).
