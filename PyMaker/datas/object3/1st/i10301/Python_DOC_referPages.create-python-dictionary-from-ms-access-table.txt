I have an MS-Access table that has 6 columns. I want to extract the first column and use it as the key and then extract the 2nd and 3rd columns and use them as values in a Python dictionary. There are multiple values for one key.This is what I have so far but I can't figure out what to do next:When I print fieldDomains I get this:I want need to merge these separate dictionaries into one large dictionary - but i'm not sure how to do this in my current script? This is what I want my output to be this:
You can use defaultdict to do thatUPDATE Since you are getting data in another format, like data2 bellow it's better to So basically data2 is your rows = cursor.fetchall() and you can replace data2 with rows variable
