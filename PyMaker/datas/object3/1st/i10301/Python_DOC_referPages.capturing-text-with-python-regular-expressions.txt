I've been having a bit of trouble with capturing strings between html tags using Python regular expressions. I've been trying to capture the string "example link 2" from the string below:I've got this so far:However the regular expression above returns "example link 1" and "example link 2". Could anyone please help with selecting only "example link 2"? EDIT: Unfortunately I'm required to use regular expressions for this question so i can't use a parser etc. Thanks for the recommendation though.
You need to add 'g' modifier at the end. For example the regex should look like:  The 'g' modifier tells the engine not to stop after the first match has been found, but rather to continue until no more matches can be found.Demo here
