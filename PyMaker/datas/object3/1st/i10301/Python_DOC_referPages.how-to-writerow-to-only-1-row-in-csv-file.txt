Currently in my code it changes the 3rd row but for all rows, I want it to only change the row with the entered GTIN by the user.Current code:Output in file (it changes all numbers in 3rd column):How can I only change the row with the GTIN the user enters?
use the csv module:https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.htmlIt has a csv.reader() and csv.writer().  Read the file into memory, iterate over it doing calcs/replacements, then write each row to a new list.  Finally, generate a new data file to replace the old one.
I answered one of your other questions before you were using csvreader but it looks like it got deleted. But the principle is the same. As I stated in one of the comments, I don't think you should keep reopening/rereading stock.txt. Just read it line by line then write line by line to an output file:Edit: here it is with csv module instead. This makes it a little more straightforward because the csv module gives you a list of strings for each line, then you can add to or modify them as desired. Then you can just write the list back line by line, without worrying about newlines or delimiters. Also you shouldn't really import anything in the middle of the code like that. Imports generally go at the top of your file.
