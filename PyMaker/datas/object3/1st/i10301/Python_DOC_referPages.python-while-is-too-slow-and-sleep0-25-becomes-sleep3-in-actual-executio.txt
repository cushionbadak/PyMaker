I am running a Python Program on a Raspberry Pi 3 which I want to log the temperature from a DS18B20 sensor once every 0.25 seconds.Earlier, when the program was simple and displaying the temperature on shell, it was quite fast and not having issues. Unfortunately due to the program itself now which includes logging to a file, I am getting a log every 2 seconds or 3 seconds only.How do I ensure the 0.25 second logging interval.I have shared the code below:I have commented out sections that I thought to be resource heavy, but still I can't manage anything less than 2 seconds. I am getting results as below:Output:
Only open the logfile once (and close it on program exit)Don't always re-read the temperature from the sensor. You call read() way too often.Reduce general overhead and simplify your calls.I am not able to completely test this, but something like this sould work:
