This code tries to use __lt__() to sort the cities by how far they are west and the longitudes are based west of the prime meridian. I wrote an __lt__() method in the class but the citystrings won't sort to the correct order.
You are comparing your longitude and latitude as strings, not numbers. They are therefor compared lexicographically, not numerically, so '104' will sort before '80' because '1' comes before '8' in the ASCII table (it doesn't matter what other characters follow).Convert your values to floating point numbers:Your comparison has a small bug; if both longitude and latitude match, you return None instead of False. You may want to test for equality and apply the @functools.total_ordering() decorator rather than assume that only __lt__() is called.Cleaning up the code a little (and removing the name() and location() methods, just use name and location attributes):Note that __lt__() really only needs to compare self.location; tuple ordering takes care of the rest:Note the reverse=True; you want the larger values (further west from Greenwich) to be listed first.
