I am asked to binary search a list of names and if these names start with a particular letter, for example A, then I am to print that name.I can complete this task by doing much more simple code such asbut instead I am asked to use a binary search and I'm struggling to understand the process behind it. We are given base code which can output the position a given string. My problem is not knowing what to edit so that I can achieve the desired outcomeDesired outcomePrints all the names starting with A (Adolphus of HelBorne, Aldric Foxe .... etc)EDIT:I was just doing some guess and check and found out how to do it. This is the solution code
Not too sure if this is what you want as it seems inefficient... as you mention it seems a lot more intuitive to just iterate over the entire list but using binary search i found here i have:Output i get:
You just need to found one item starting with the letter, then you need to identify the range. This approach should be fast and memory efficient.the output is
