Is there any way to execute python with pyside on a computer that has only python installed?I need to distribute a simple tool on a lot of computers and we can't install pyside everywhere.
PySide is a set of bindings for Qt, which is a library written in C++. And it is not part of the Python core.If you want a GUI that is portable and that can be used with a default Python installation, consider tkinter.
