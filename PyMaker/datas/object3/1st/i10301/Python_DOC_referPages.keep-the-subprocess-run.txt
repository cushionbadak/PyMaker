I have an exe file build from C++ to get the mouse shape in two states: hand or arrow. But in code it only detects one current time (run in only time and close), the output is state.I call it in python to get the output in the Windows shell:It runs 1 time, gives me the state and stops.I tried to make it run forever with:Every second it checks once, but when called once is the one time the Windows shell appears. How can I call it only once and run as long as I want with only one Windows shell appearing?P.S.: I can't edit my C++ function because I lost the source.
Yes you can. Instead of using the convenient function check_output, you would construct a Popen object. This will start the process and let you control it while running. One possibility is to capture the output into a file object (usually known as "pipe" the output):stdout=subprocess.PIPE ⇒ Pipe the stdout into the file object p.stdoutuniversal_newlines=True ⇒ Make the file be read as a text instead of binaryThe inner for loop will wait until there is output available from the program. So you don't need that time.sleep(1).
