I read that you can execute a file using import like thisfile.py:file2.py:And file.py will print Hello World. How would I execute this file with arguments, using import?
Program arguments are available in sys.argv and can be used by any module. You could change file2.py toYou can use the argparse module for more complex parsing.
Import is not meant for execution of scripts. It is used in order to fetch or "import" functions, classes and attributes it contains.If you wish to execute the script using a different interpreter, and give it arguments, you should use subprocess.run().In Python 2 you may use subprocess.call() or subprocess.check_output() if you need the programs output.
