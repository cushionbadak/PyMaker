The title doesn't really explain it well, so I'll try to explain it better here. I'm not expecting to be spoon-fed, but I'd like to be pointed in the right direction as to how I would do this.I have one folder, let's call it A.A has 100 other folders in, that have the folder name as just a completely random number.Inside each of these folders, there is a png file, a txt file, and a bsp file.I have to put the folder directory to the bsp files, into a text file, so that another program can read them (but I think that is irrelevant)I'd expect to be able to find the file directories for each file, e.g. it would print \A\<random number for the folder>\<bsp file name>\A\<another random number for another folder>\<the bsp file name for the file in that folder>I'm aware its quite vague, but how would I approach this?
What you require can be achieved with the 'find' command on the shell.After changing into the main directory with all the subdirectories, to get the relative path, execute:And for absolute path, execute:You can execute this in python using os.system()
