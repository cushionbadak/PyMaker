In the following snippet what is -> operator ,does it indicate the return type of the function also is it mandatory to use it in python 3.x ? Please point me to few docs for the same
-> is an annotation, attached to the function return value. Annotations are optional, but you can use the syntax to attach arbitrary objects to a function. You can attach more annotations by using name : annotation on the parameters too.In the sample you gave, it is being used to create a type hint. Type hinting is a new Python 3 extension. It is not mandatory, but using type hints can make development in an IDE like PyCharm easier, as well as enable static typechecking by tools like mypy.See the typing module for a set of objects to help create type hints, and the PEP 484 Type Hints proposal.
This is type of return value: https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html :) It's not mandatory, but might be usefull.
