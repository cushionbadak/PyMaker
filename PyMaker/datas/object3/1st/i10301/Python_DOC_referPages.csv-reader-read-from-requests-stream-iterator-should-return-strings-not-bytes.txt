I'm trying to stream response to csv.reader using requests.get(url, stream=True)  to handle quite big data feeds. My code worked fine with python2.7. Here's code:Unfortunately after migration to python3.6 I got an following error: I was trying to find some wrapper/decorator that would covert result of response.iter_lines() iterator from bytes to string, but no luck with that.I already tried to use io package and also codecs. Using codecs.iterdecode doesn't split data in lines, it's just split probably by chunk_size,and in this case csv.reader is complaining in following way:
I'm guessing you could wrap this in a genexp and feed decoded lines to it:Using some sample data in 3.5 this shuts up csv.reader, every line fed to it is first decoded in the genexp. Also, I'm using closing from contextlib as is generally suggested to automatically close the responce.
