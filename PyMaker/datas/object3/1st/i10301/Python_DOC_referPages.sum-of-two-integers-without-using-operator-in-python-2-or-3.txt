But when one of a, b < 0 or both, how the script should be like?
+ operator internally makes a call to __add__(). So, you may directly call a.__add__(b) to get sum. Below is the modified code:OR, you may use operator.add(a, b) as:
I enjoy solving other people's problems.Edit: If you are in for some fantasy. You can do operator overloading.This maybe a little hard for you now. But it is fun.
You can also use operator packageAnd if you want to hassle with binary bitwise operations. Here is first method:And here is the another one with recursion:Edit: methods with bitwise operations are working only in Python 3
My old highschool program that I found on my usb stick. Yes it's crude but it works.Or I would have see if I could cheat with sum.
This was kinda fun :) I'm not sure if this is what you're after, but these all should work so long as you're using integersnegation by two's compliment is used to get a function where a and b are both greater than 0 and the correct operation (addition or subtraction) is selected. further with subtraction, care is taken to not yield a negative result. This is done because the recursive definitions of add and subtract hate crossing 0. Also in this case the recursive add and subtract do the exact same thing as your loop.
