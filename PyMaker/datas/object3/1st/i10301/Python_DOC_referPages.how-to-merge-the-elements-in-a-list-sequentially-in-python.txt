Natural Text
I have a list [ 'a' , 'b' , 'c' , 'd']. How do I get the list which joins two letters sequentially i.e the ouptut should be [  'ab', 'bc' , 'cd'] in python easily instead of manually looping and joining
Use zip within a list comprehension:Or since you just want to concatenate two character you can also use add operator, by using itertools.starmap in order to apply the add function on character pairs:
Just one line of code is enough :
