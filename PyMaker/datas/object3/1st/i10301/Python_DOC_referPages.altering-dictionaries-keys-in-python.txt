Natural Text
I have ran the code below in Python to generate a list of words and their count from a text file. How would I go about filtering out words from my "frequency_list" variable that only have a count of 1? In addition, how would I export the print statement loop at the bottom to a CSVThanks in advance for any help provided.
To filter out words, an alternative way would be:To export the print statement loop at the bottom to a CSV, you could do that:This will generate an 'output.csv' file with the words from your frequency_list in one row. To get a row for each word try, the following:UpdateTo get a csv with the counters, keep your initial dictionary and do the following:
For the first part - you can use dict comprehension:frequency = {k:v for k,v in frequency.items() if v>1}
