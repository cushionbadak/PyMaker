I take the data from the database. From the database they come in the form of a tuple:And that's what I want:make combinations of these input... so the output I had a combination of 4 parameters (such as in example) and...1) most importantly, new combinations,the values were always in its place, i.e. if in the original combinations the values were index [1], this means that in the new combination, it should also be [1]...2) there are no duplicate combinationsAs example:I got tuple:And from this I got new combinations:Maybe it's possible to do using the method of pairwise or something else.Help.
