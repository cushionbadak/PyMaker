Is is possible to do something like this? I tested it and it doesn't work.I'd like to delete all ips from "ip" list that start with 256. 257. 258. ecc... to 310.
No, str.startswith() doesn't take a range.You'd have to parse out the first part and test it as an integer; filtering is also easier done with a list comprehension:The alternative would be to use the ipaddress library; it'll reject any invalid address with a ipaddress.AddressValueError exception, and since addresses that start with anything over 255 are invalid, you can easily co-opt that to filter out your invalid addresses:
