Here is a sample DB and program file to further help me explainI have created variables to hold the selection of the combobox and the dateEdit box.The next step (the one I'm struggling with) is to then use those variables in an SQL query that will first find the count of rows with the selected user name and having a date <= than the selected date.  That will populate the numrecord variable so that I can display a "This will delete 'x' rows, are you sure?"If the user selects yes then I will then use the variable in a delete query to delete the selected rows.I believe if I can figure out how to use the variables I have in a SQL query then the DELETE query should be rather simple.An example of a possible DELETE query to show what I'm trying to doI know that is wrong but maybe it will help clarify.I hope I have explained my question fully and I appreciate any help provided.Edit: Thanks so much!!Just before I saw that you had posted this I figured it out.What I came up with was the following:With this knowledge I can recreate my queries to include both variables.
As mentioned in a comment to another answer, you should be using a proper parameterized query, for example:
What I came up with was the following:With this knowledge I can now add both variables to the query as needed.Thanks everyone for their help, especially Gord Thompson!
You use the DELETE sql command.This assumes your DATE field is actually a date field and not a string field.Also, you may want to look into using an ORM framework (sqlalchemy is probably the most popular, but there are others).  It's best to avoid manually constructing sql queries if possible.
