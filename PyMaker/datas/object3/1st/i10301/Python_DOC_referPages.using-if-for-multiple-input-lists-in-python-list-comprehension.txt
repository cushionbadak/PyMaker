How do you use an if statement in a list comprehension when there are multiple input lists.  Here is the code that I'm using and the error that I'm getting: (I get that it's not able to apply modulus to a list, but not sure how to specifically reference the x in each of the lists as it iterates through them)
This isn't a cause with the if statement, the issue here is with x in (a, b). When that executes, x takes on a list value (first a, then b) and then Python will try try to execute your if condition on it, an expression of the form:is done, which obviously isn't allowed.Instead, use chain from itertools to chain both lists together and make x take values from them:If you're using Python >= 3.5 you could also unpack in the list literal []:
As Jim said, you are mod a list to a int.You can also use +, e.g., nums = [x**2 for x in a+b if x%2==0].
