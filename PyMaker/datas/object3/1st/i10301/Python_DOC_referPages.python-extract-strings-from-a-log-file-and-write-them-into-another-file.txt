You can of course use regex. I would read line by line, grab the lines the start with '/* BUG:', then parse those as needed.Python has a pretty powerful regex module built-in: re moduleYou can search for a given pattern, then print out the matched groups as needed.Note: raw strings (r'xxxx') let you use unescaped characters.
