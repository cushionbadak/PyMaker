Natural Text
I need to create (from Python code) a text file with in each line some 50 variables, separated by comm's. I take the canonical way to be    output.write ("{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{}, ... \n".format(v,v,v,v,...But that will be hard to read and difficult to maintain with such a lot of variables. Any other suggestions? I have thought of using the csv module, after all what I am writing is (kind of) a csv file, but thought I'd hear around for other suggestions first.
Using listsWhen reaching a handful of variables that are related to each other, it is common to use a list or a dict. If you create a list:This also allows for easier looping over each value. Once you have done that you can easily concatenate it to a string:In case your row might contain any commas (or whatever you use as a delimiter) you must ensure escaping. In this case a CSV modules helps:Using dictsSome people prefer to add additional structure, e.g.:
If you can sort of your variables, you could use locals().for example:I set three variables:and I can sort of them by sorted().Then, using for combination them.
