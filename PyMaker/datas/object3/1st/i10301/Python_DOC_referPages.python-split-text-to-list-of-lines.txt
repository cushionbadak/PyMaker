From all of your comments, it looks like the issue has to do with the actual text in the file, and not the ability to parse it.  It looks like everyone's solution in here is on the right track, you just need to force the encoding.The error you are describing is described in this other StackOverflow post.EDIT: The issue appears to be a nasty character that wasn't properly decoding. With open you can tell it to ignore characters it can't decode.
You will have to use decode. The following code will work:Call this function with filename as parameter:
Some problems with the code you posted:f.read doesn't read the whole line. It should be f.readline(). What is the function splitlines?Your question is pretty unclear in differnt aspects. Maybe this snippet could be of some help:Editted: I didn't know the function splitlines. Just looked it up. The way you used it in your code doesn't seem to be correct anyway.
I strongly suggest using csv module for this kind of task, as it seems like a csv-type file, using '|' as delimiter:
Please do this line by line. There is no need to read the entire file at once.Something like:If it is a unicode issue, most of the time it is automatic:(note the Ã© in the file)The program above works. If it does NOT work, use a codec:With Python3, just set the encoding when you open the file:
