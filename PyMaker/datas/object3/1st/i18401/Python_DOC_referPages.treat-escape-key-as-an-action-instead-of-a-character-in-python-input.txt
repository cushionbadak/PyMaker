In a command-line application, I'm using the following code (from Andreas Renberg) to ask the user a yes/no question (it just uses the standard input):If the user types yes (or an equivalent) the function returns True, and no returns False. If they just press Enter, the default value is chosen.However, if user presses ESC on their keyboard, it gets treated as a character. Is there instead a way to cause the function to return False if that key is pressed? The few results I have found in my own searches seem overly complicated or only work on some operating systems.
If you want to catch the Esc keyboard press you have to implement something like getch method which will get you one character at a time.Here is a simplistic implementation that works.Then you just have a while loop with getch until you get an Esc or Return.Note: I haven't specified a way to determine the platform since there are multiple ways to do that, and there are a lot answers on SO on that topic.
