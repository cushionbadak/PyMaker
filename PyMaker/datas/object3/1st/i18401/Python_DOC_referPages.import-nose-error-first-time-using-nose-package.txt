I am getting following error while mere importing nose using import nose : I am new to python.I have added path using sys.path.append("C:\\Python32\\Lib\\site-packages\\nose-master")
The problem is that you haven't installed nose properly.Like most packages, nose expects you to install it, not just use it out of the source in-place.The official Python docs include Installing Python Modules. However, that document may be a bit over-complicated for novices, especially Windows users, and it doesn't mention some of the newer, simpler options. But briefly:Download the source archive.Unzip it (or untar it, or whatever); often just double-clicking it on Windows will do this.Open a cmd (aka "DOS shell") window.cd to the source directory.C:\Python32\python.exe setup.py installHowever, you will probably find it a lot easier to just automatically install things using pip, or pre-made binary packages.Having done this, nose should end up in the right place in site-packages so you don't need to do any sys.path munging in your code, and you should also end up with the command-line scripts like nosetests somewhere useful, like C:\Python32\Scripts\.The specific problem in this case is that, as part of the installation process, nose figures out whether you're installing for Python 2.x or 3.x, and runs a tool called 2to3 to fix the code appropriately. Because you never did that step, you ended up with 2.x-specific code. As you guessed, it's the print statement vs. print function that bit you firstâ€”but if you got past that, there are dozens of other things that would fail similarly.
