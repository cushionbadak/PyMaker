First time Python user and I am lost.  I need to create a table from a list that displays the daily temperature and the running average of temperature up to that day.
A running average is just, for each value in a list, the average of all of the values up to that one. For a stripped-down version of your example:The running averages are 86/1, (86+87)/2, (86+87+84)/3, and (86+87+84+86)/4.So, at each index, the running average is the running total, dividing by (index + 1).You can get the running totals with accumulate:And you can get the (1-based) indexes with enumerate:So, just divide:Or using statistics in Python 3.4, or its backport/predecessor stats for 3.1-3.3:Of course you can always do it explicitly if you prefer:… or even:
I'd go with this:
Here's another way to do it:Using cumulative series is a very useful way of working with sums over parts of a series.
Here's a way to do it using itertools and operators
