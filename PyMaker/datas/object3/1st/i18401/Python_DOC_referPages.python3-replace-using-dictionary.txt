Natural Text
Could anyone please explain what is wrong here:I get proper results for 'T' and 'C', but 'A' and 'C' won't replace. Got really stuck. String looks like 'ACGTACG'.
You are first replacing all As with Ts before then replacing all Ts with As again (including those you just replaced As with!):Use a translation map instead, fed to str.translate():The str.translate() method requires a dictionary mapping codepoints (integers) to replacement characters (either a single character or a codepoint), or None (to delete the codepoint from the input string). The ord() function gives us those codepoints for the given 'from' letters.This looks up characters in string, one by one in C code, in the translation map, instead of replacing all As followed by all Ts.str.translate() has the added advantage of being much faster than a series of str.replace() calls.Demo:
Mutable data is your enemy :)See, you first replace all As with Ts, then, in another iteration, replace all Ts with As again.What works:It prints TCGAAGTC.
