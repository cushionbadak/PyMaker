How can I run a bunch of imports and path appends from the interpreter with one command/import? If I import another module that runs the commands for me the imports are not available in main namespace. Similar to running a bash script that modifies/adds commands and variables to the current session.ex.
If I understand you correctly, you're just looking for the from … import … statement. For example:lotsostuff.py:Now:However, you might want to consider a different alternative. If you're just trying to control the startup of your interpreter session, you can do this:Notice the difference in the last line. You're now running lotsostuff in the __main__ namespace, rather than running in a separate namespace and grabbing all of its members.Similarly:You'd normally use PYTHONSTARTUP if you want to do this every time in your session, -i if you want to do it just this once.If you want to do the same thing in the middle of a session instead of at startup… well, you can't do it directly, but you can come pretty close with exec (Python 3.x) (or execfile in Python 2.x).If you really want to do exactly what you described—importing a module, as a normal import, except merged into your namespace instead of in its own—you'll need to customize the import process. This isn't that hard with importlib; if you're not in Python 3.2 or later, you'll have a lot more work to do it with imp.That's pretty much the difference between . ./foo instead of just ./foo in a bash script that I think you were looking for.If you're using ipython, there are even cooler options. (And if you're not using ipython, you might want to check it out.)
