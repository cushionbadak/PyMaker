I am trying to express a list that express a binary number as a real binary number like (1,3,6) means 0b100101. First, I try to sum them as 2^1+2^3+2^6 and then convert to binarywhere I converted it to list like the a below soSoHow should I convert the power vector into a binary number i.e. how can I get from power-binary number presentation into real binary number presentation?Simple exampleInputIntended Output
Bakuriu explained what is going on very well, so Iâ€™ll make this short. The solution to your problem isNote that summation is equal to binary or, as long as only different bits are set, which I assume is the case here.
The value returned by the bin built-in is a simple string. It's not a "binary number". Binary numbers do not exist, there is only a binary representation of numbers. Python integers are internally represented as base-2, the bin function allow to "see" this(actually the modulus and sign representation, not two's complement) representation as a string.If you want to perform bitwise operations such as | on those strings  you must convert them to integers and then back to strings:If, given a list of binary strings, you want to obtain a number that combines those strings you can use the reduce function:
