Natural Text
So this is my code:This is the text file:It's supposed to get each letter used and print them before the amount of times they are used, in alphabetical order, but what I don't want is the letter 's' (or any letter that has a .count() of 2) will repeat twice, but i only want it to repeat once, how can I do this?This is what i'm getting:But this is what I want:
I'd use collections.Counter for this:This prints out
In order to get a count of the number of times each character appears in your text file, you should use the following code:Example:How you can use that:

The easy way to do this is with collections.Counter:To solve your problem, you can convert the list to a set, or use a defaultdict.  Here is the defaultdict implementation:The defaultdict implemenation is also handy if you are unable to use Counter (its for 2.7+)
You are looking for collections.Counter() instead:or, alternatively printing the letters in sorted order:Counter.most_common() sorts the results by counts, descending. sorted(new) on the other hand returns a sorted list of the keys of the Counter dictionary, so that version more closely matches your attempted output.Your code instead used f.count(i) to count each letter every time you encountered it. You'd normally use a dictionary to track counts and avoid using the full scan of str.count():
