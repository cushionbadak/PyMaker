Natural Text
I am trying to create a text file in csv format out of a PyQt4 QTableWidget. I want to write the text with a UTF-8 encoding because it contains special characters. I use following code:It works until the cell contains a special character. I tried also withBut it also stops when a special character appears. I have no idea what I am doing wrong.
From your shell run:And (unlike the original question) presuming you're using Python's built in csv module, turn import csv into import unicodecsv as csv in your code.
It's very simple for Python 3.x (docs).For Python 2.x, look here.
Use this package, it just works: https://github.com/jdunck/python-unicodecsv. 
The examples in the Python documentation show how to write Unicode CSV files: http://docs.python.org/2/library/csv.html#examples(can't copy the code here because it's protected by copyright)
For me the UnicodeWriter class from Python 2 CSV module documentation didn't really work as it breaks the csv.writer.write_row() interface.For example:works, while:will throw AttributeError: 'int' object has no attribute 'encode'.As UnicodeWriter obviously expects all column values to be strings, we can convert the values ourselves and just use the default CSV module:Or we can even monkey-patch csv_writer to add a write_utf8_row function - the exercise is left to the reader.
For python2 you can use this code before csv_writer.writerows(rows) This code will NOT convert integers to utf-8 strings
A very simple hack is to use the json import instead of csv.  For example instead of csv.writer just do the following:Basically, given the list of fields in correct order, the json formatted string is identical to a csv line except for [ and ] at the start and end respectively. And json seems to be robust to utf-8 in python 2.*
