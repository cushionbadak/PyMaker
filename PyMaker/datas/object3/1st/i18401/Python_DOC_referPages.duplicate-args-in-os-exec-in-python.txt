This question already has an answer here:When using os.execlp, why `python` needs `python` as argv[0]                    2 answers                I saw these code in a book Programming Python:Why there are two pythons in os.execlp? And it seems that the second one can be any string. What does the second argument do? Edit: I still don't understand after reading the possibly duplicated question. This is child.py:So argv[1] is str(parm), argv[0] is child.py, isn't it? 
The first python is the name of the executable to run, the second is the value of argv[0].
It's its name, that's why it can be any string. See http://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html?highlight=os.exec#process-managementThe document is not structured well, people could have ignored the second paragraph simply because they jump straight to os.exec* thinking contents above are not relevant.
