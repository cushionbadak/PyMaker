Assuming you got something like this (copied from here):There is no need to wait for each ping to finish before trying the next host. Could I put the loop interior each time into the background along the lines of the & in:
The first thing you should do is change your range to range(0, 256) so that it is inclusive of 0-255.Second, you're looking at Python's threading, which can be somewhat similar to Bash process daemonization at an abstract level.Import multiprocessing and create a pool:So take the ping lookup, which is everything inside of the for loop, and make it a function.Then in your for loop, pool.join() is what waits for all of your threads to return.
You can use threading or multiprocessing module to run aynchronous/non-blocking IO calls.Read about hte difference on SO:multiprocess or threading in python?
