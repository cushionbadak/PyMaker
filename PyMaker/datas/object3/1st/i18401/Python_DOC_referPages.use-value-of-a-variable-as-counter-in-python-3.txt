I want to take an input from the user and and store it in a variable, lets say k. Then use this k as a counter for a for loop.while i<k: doesn't work!code:Output:I also tried using range which gave me an error:Traceback (most recent call last):  File "/home/ramupradip/reflect.py", line 6, in     for i in range(1,k):TypeError: 'str' object cannot be interpreted as an integer 
Read the input like this:... I guess you forgot to convert the number to int, but it's impossible to tell if you don't show the relevant code. Other than that, the looping constructs shown in the question should work fine, but the first one is preferred in Python, just be careful with the indexes:Equivalently:
That does not make any sense.You could want this:Where k is the total number of iterations set by the user and i is a value that changes from 0 to k - 1.Or you could want this:Where k is a value from 0 to x - 1 and the user input doesn't mean anything. Or you could want this:Where k is the start value set by the user, x is a value set by the program and i is a value that starts from k and ends in x - 1See the documentation for more info http://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-range
