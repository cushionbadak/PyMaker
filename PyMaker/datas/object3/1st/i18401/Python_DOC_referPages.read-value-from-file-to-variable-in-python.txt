Natural Text
I have text file with text as shown below. I want to write the value in the first column of the 8th row i.e. 226 to a variable using a function in python. Could someone help to do this?
Your file is not quite a CSV/TSV file, so using the csv module will probably end up being as tricky as parsing it manually in this case. So let's just do that:This has the advantage that we're only reading and parsing the first 8 lines rather than the entire file.If you understand iterables, I find (which does the exact same thing) this much simpler:I used the third-party more-itertools module for simplicity. If you don't want to install it, nth is defined in the recipes in the documentation for the standard library itertools module, so you can just copy and paste it like any other recipe:Or you could just inline it into a single more complicated expression:(Personally, I find that a bit less readable; it's like saying "the first row of all the rows from #7 to the end" instead of just saying "row #7". But some people don't like to define lots of trivial functions.)I'd probably wrap this as a function (just return … instead of value = … and break, depending on which version you use):Another way to get line #7 from a file without reading the whole file is with the linecache module:This will be a lot more efficient if you're calling it lots of different times, for lots of different rows of the same filename.
