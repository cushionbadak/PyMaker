Python 2.73Why is it on my laptop when I hit CTRL+C, I can exit the interpreter and on my desktop hitting CTRL+C will make the interpreter shoot back at me a KeyboardInterrupt message. How can I get rid of this KeyboardInterrupt and go back to exiting with CTRL+C! On my desktop it's required to input CTRL+Z and hitting enter to exit.I am using PowerShell on both computer. Same 64bit, one is Win7 one is Win8
You could change the signal handler for CTRL-C to something that exits the interpreter:You could probably put that code in a file to be run automatically when an interactive session starts, then set the environment variable PYTHONSTARTUP to the name of that file:http://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html?highlight=startup#envvar-PYTHONSTARTUP
A slightly shorter version of the previous answer:SIG_DFL means default signal handling, so Python does not catch it toraise a KeyboardInterrupt exception.
