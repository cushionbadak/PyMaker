The following code is giving me error Python TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable:Code:How could I fix the error - Secondly how can I append both the values of i and j if the if condition is true? Here I'm trying to append i only.
You need to iterate over a range based on hosts, not hosts itself:You can append both numbers as a tuple:or simply append them individuallydepending on your needs.
Try this: 
You cannot iterate over integer (hosts):You should use range(n) to iterate n times:
probably you meant range(2) instead of hosts
hosts is an int, so for i in hosts will not work, as the error explains. Perhaps you meantThe same goes for the second for-loop.(See range(); in Python 2.x use xrange())By the way this whole thing can be a single list comprehension:
the for statement apply to the Python concept "iterable", like list, tuple, etc.. An int is not an iterable. so you should use range() or xrange(), which receive an int and produce an iterable. second, do you mean append a tuple: append((i,j)) or a list: append([i,j]) ? I'm not quite clear about the question.
