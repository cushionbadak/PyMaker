I'm following this tutorial trying to implement argparse into a python script I'm writing.When I run this snippet of code from the tutorial I receive the following error:I'm running Python 3.3.2 and have installed argparse 1.2.1 using easy_install so I know it's on the system but I cannot determine what is causing the error.Note: I've read this post and it is not related.
From the error message I am guessing your script is trying to import not from argparse package but from local /home/brian/Documents/Scripts/argparse.py module. Rename your file and try again.
