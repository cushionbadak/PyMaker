Answer for Python 3.xIf you're using Python3.x change from BaseHTTPServer to from http.server.If you wrote this code for Python 2.x and you are running it with Python3.x, The 2to3 tool will automatically adapt imports when converting your sources to Python 3.Answer for Python 2.xThe error is telling you that BaseHTTPServer needs to be in your PYTHONPATH.That is to say, Python cannot find the module BaseHTTPServer anywhere, you either need to install it, or if it is installed in a non-standard location, modify your PYTHONPATH environment variable to include it - however this would be a bit of a strange (though not impossible) situation since that module is normally included in Python2.x
If you're using Python 3.x, try following:BaseHTTPServer, SimpleHTTPServer modules in Python 2 have been merged into http.server module in Python 3.UPDATEBTW, port number seems wrong. HTTPS port is 443, not 4443.
