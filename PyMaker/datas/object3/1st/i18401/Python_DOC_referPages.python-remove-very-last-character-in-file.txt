Natural Text
After looking all over the Internet, I've come to this.Let's say I have already made a text file that reads:Hello WorldWell, I want to remove the very last character (in this case d) from this text file.So now the text file should look like this: Hello WorlBut I have no idea how to do this.All I want, more or less, is a single backspace function for text files on my HDD.This needs to work on Linux as that's what I'm using.
Use file.seek() to seek 1 position from the end, then use file.truncate() to remove the remainder of the file:
In case you are not reading the file in binary mode, where you have only 'w' permissions, I can suggest the following.In this code above, f.seek() will only accept f.tell() b/c you do not have 'b' access. then you can set the cursor to the starting of the last element. Then you can delete the last element by an empty string.
Accepted answer of Martijn is simple and kind of  works, but does not account for text files with:UTF-8 encoding containing non-English characters (which is the default encoding for text files in Python 3)one newline character at the end of the file (which is the default in Linux editors like vim or gedit)If the text file contains non-English characters, neither of the answers provided so far would work.What follows is an example, that solves both problems, which also allows removing more than one character from the end of the file:How it works:Reads only the last few bytes of a UTF-8 encoded text file in binary modeIterates the bytes backwards, looking for the start of a UTF-8 characterOnce a character (different from a newline) is found, return that as the last character in the text fileSample text file - bg.txt:How to use:Outputs:This works with both UTF-8 and ASCII encoded files.
Be sure to use binary mode on windows since Unix file line ending many return an illegal or incorrect character count.
here is a dirty way (erase & recreate)...i don't advice to use this, but, it's possible to do like this ..
