I wrote my own vector class:I want to define that V(0,0) is an empty vector, such that this would work: (The first case should return "Vector is empty")
Define __bool__, like this:
You can implement the special method __bool__:Note that in Python 2, the special method is named __nonzero__.Alternatively, because you have a vector, it might make even more sense to implement __len__ and provide the actual vector length instead. If __bool__ is not defined, Python will automatically try to use the __len__ method to get the length and evaluate if itâ€™s not zero.
If you're just concerned about the output. Just extend the __str__ method.Output will be:Vector is emptyV(1,2)
