I'm trying to figure out how to change this code.  Instead of counting the number of times that the target value appears, I want to be able to return the number of values in the list that are greater than the target value.Do I change the 5 line too?
The change is fairly trivial:Don't forget to properly indent the line that follows this.Note that the most Pythonic way to write this function would be to use sum():
You can use a list comprehension approach:UPD:This is actually a short form of:So, yes, there is an intermediate list - generator expression is a better choice.
You change line 4 to if element > target::or, you use the more functional (but probably hard to understand for a beginner):P.S. I've also changed counter = counter + 1 to the nicer looking counter += 1.
No, you would only change line 4Note that the if statement requires indentation on line 5
No in this case you are changing the equivalence test to a greater than test.You are currently testing element == target which will execute the (properly indented) counter = counter+1 line on every equivalence.To do a greater than test you'd need to change the test to element > target.The code would look like:
