I have following code sample in python:Output for this as following:So my question is why get_objects() called only once? Why it is not fetched data every time of itteration?
Because that is exactly how for-loops work in Python.  The expression on the right of the in operator (which must return an iterable when evaluated) is evaluated only once, before looping commences. Then, the for-loop loops over the iterable returned by that evaluation.Below is an excerpt from the docs*:The for statement is used to iterate over the elements of a sequence  (such as a string, tuple or list) or other iterable object:The expression list is evaluated once; it should yield an iterable  object.*Note:  I added the bold.
