In my code I am writing dict-objects on every LogRecord. One of the keys are called my_msg and I want to create a StreamHandler that just prints out the time and the value of the my_msg key.I have tried the following but I get an error message: AttributeError: type object 'LogRecord' has no attribute 'levelname'
You need to pass just the template to the Formatter() class. The template will then be used later on to format your message. You also need to use named slots:You don't call .format() on it when creating the Formatter() object; at that moment there is no log message yet and no level to be filled in.See the logrecord attributes section for what names are available by default; any %-style formatting in the second column of the table should be translated to new-style formats instead:%(asctime)s becomes {asctime} or {asctime!s}%(created)f becomes {created:f}%(lineno)d becomes {lineno:d}.etc.
