I want to redirect the stdout to a file. But This will affect the raw_input.  I need to redirect the output of raw_input to stderr instead of stdout.  How can I do that?
Redirect stdout to stderr temporarily, then restore.
The only problem with raw_input is that it prints the prompt to stdout. Instead of trying to intercept that, why not just print the prompt yourself, and call raw_input with no prompt, which prints nothing to stdout?And if you want to replace raw_input with this:(For more info, see the docs on __builtin__, the module that raw_input and other built-in functions are stored in. You usually don't have to import it, but there's nothing in the docs that guarantees that, so it's better to be safeâ€¦)In Python 3.2+, the module is named builtins instead of __builtin__. (Of course 3.x doesn't have raw_input in the first place, it's been renamed input, but the same idea could be used there.)
Use getpassThis will print the content value to stdout and Enter Name: to stderr.Tested and works with python 2.7 and 3.6.
