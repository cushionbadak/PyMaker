So I have made a small application that I typically want to package and share it with the world. I read the tutorials for packaging my app using setuptools. It was going well until I got stuck at one place.My directory structure is something like this:Given this directory structure, I have created the setup.py file with the packages option as the list containing myapp and myapp.utils. I have also created a MANIFEST.in file that will have all the files that I want to package but which are not included by default. Here is the content of the manifest file:The problem is that all these files are created as required in the distribution package (.zip), but when I try to use the distribution package to try the install the package myself, I don't see the images, sounds or the pickle file.i.e. when I run python setup.py install, I don't see these files in the build/lib folder. I am not sure what the reason is. Could anyone help me out with this?Thanks
The manifest is about distribution, not about installation.You need to specify in setup.py what to install and WHERE:See http://docs.python.org/3/distutils/setupscript.html#installing-additional-files
