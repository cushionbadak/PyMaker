The following code does not work and is also overly verbose and redundant. What is the best way to fix it?
I'd like to use glob:
os.remove, os.path.exists accept a file path, not a pattern.Using os.listdir, you don't need to check file existence.str.endswith accepts tuple; can be used to check extension:Using set:
You could use a regular expression to match the file names. The following generates the one needed given the names of the extensions and any specific file names. Once this is compiled, it's simply a matter of applying the compiled re's match() method to each candidate file name to determine whether to remove it or not.
