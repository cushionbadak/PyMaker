So there are a lot of pretty similar questions but none of the answers seems to satisfy what I'm looking for.  Essentially I am running a python script using an absolute directory in the command line.Within this file itself, I want to import a module/file,I currently use an absolute path to do this (sys.path.append(/....).But I would like to use a relative path, relative to the script itself.All I seem to be able to do is append a path relative to my present working directory.How do I do this?
The two below alternate possibilities apply to both Python versions 2 and 3. Choose the way you prefer. All use cases are covered.Example 1Add in foo.pyExample 2Add in foo.pyExplanationssys.path[0] is /some/path/foo in both examplesos.path.join('a','b','c') is more portable than 'a/b/c'os.path.dirname(mydir) is more portable than os.path.join(mydir,'..')See alsoDocumentation about importing modules:in Python 2in Python 3
Ok, so I've found how to do this.How can I find script's directory with Python?provides the answer
