so I have a list which has 6 dicts inside and I would like to write that to a csv file. I have tried a lot of ways to do it but i have been unsuccessful so far. when i try to write it as a list it give me an error when i try to write it as a dict it also give me an error. can anyone point me in the write direction please.or if there is easier way to get it as a dataframe I would like it to look like thisthank you!
Have you looked into Pandas? http://pandas.pydata.org/In pandas you can do this:and then you can do a:and you have saved your dictionary in both a dataframe in memory and a csv.If you want to use just native python, then you can do something like this:
"create a csv file from a list with dictionary elements in python" is exactly what csv.DictWriter does:(If your ultimate goal is to get some kind of data frame object, and you're just creating a CSV file because you think it's the best way to do that… then you don't have to; see Ryan G's answer for how easy pandas makes this.)After this:Of course you probably want it to include the headers and/or put the columns in some particular order rather than whatever order the dict happens to have. (You don't need to do both, but if you don't do either one or the other, the CSV isn't very useful, because you'll have no idea which column means what…) Here's both:Output:If you want a variation on the default CSV dialect, see Dialects and Formatting Parameters. To get exactly your desired output, just add , delimiter='\t' to the DictWriter constructor.
use tabulate
You can use string formatting to do what you want:Here the format specification is 0 for the first argument to format, [key] to select the appropriate value, then .nf to give n decimal places. 
http://docs.python.org/2/library/csv.html#csv.DictWriter should do that, it will also write a header row based on the column order you provide.
