I'm reading german names from a csv, and want to write them in a csv file, with the right encoding for ä, ö and ü. Reading works fine, but when I write to the csv, the characters are displayed like this: LÃ¶ffler.What do I need to add to my writer to get the right encoding?I tried unicodecsv, but can't get it to work:Error message:
In python2.X your best bet is using tool like unicodecsv, as csv module in this python handles only acsii. On Python3+ you'll get this ot of the box, just pass proper encoding to the open function. 
I think you must change the encoding of the file. I think UTF-8 should work.Do you use Java?Here someone showed how it should work.
