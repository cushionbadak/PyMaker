I have installed python3 via homebrew, updated pip & setuptools, installed virtualenv via pip. Now I'm trying to create a virtual env. Unfortunately, I can't get it to add pip to the virtualenv. Basically:AFAIK pip is supposed to be there as well. Creating the virtual env with high verbosity yields this:This means that all the packages I install while the virtual env is activated go to my global site packages (/usr/local/lib/python3.3/site-packages), but they are not picked up by the sandboxed python.How can I get virtualenv to properly install pip in my local environment?Update: virtualenv version is 1.11.
As of this writing, Homebrew installs Python 3.3.3 ($ brew info python3).And as of Python 3.3, Python's standard library now includes its own virtual environment implementation, and does not require the virtualenv package. See the venv module documentation. With the Homebrew Python 3 package, the command-line tool is named pyvenv-3.3.I believe using this implementation should resolve the issues you're encountering.
