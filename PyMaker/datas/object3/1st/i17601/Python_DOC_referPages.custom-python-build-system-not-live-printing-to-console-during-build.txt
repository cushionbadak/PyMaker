I recently switched python distributions to Anaconda from Continuum Analytics. After installing Python 3.3, I created a build system for use with Sublime (3):It runs scripts fine, except for the fact that output is only printed upon completion of the build. How can I enable normal (live) printing?
It's possible that you need to run the script in "unbuffered" mode via the -u flag. Force the binary layer of the stdout and stderr streams (which is  available as their buffer attribute) to be unbuffered. The text I/O  layer will still be line-buffered if writing to the console, or  block-buffered if redirected to a non-interactive file.This solution isn't specific to Anaconda, but may still be the issue.
