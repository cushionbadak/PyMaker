I have been looking at some code for a small chat program that I found online. It was originally written for 2.7, but it seems to work with 3.2. The only problem is that I cannot send strings, only numbers:The chat.py file source code:And the client.py source file:When I run these using two separate terminals, they work, but do not send strings.Thank you
When you work with sockets, the message you're passing around should probably be in bytes, b'bytes'. In Python 2.x, a str is actually what a bytes is in Python 3.xSo your message should be something like:Check here http://docs.python.org/3.3/library/stdtypes.html for more information.According to http://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input input returns a str, which means you'll have to encode message into bytes as such:Do verify that this is the right approach to convert str to bytes by checking the type of message.
Your socket code is correct, it was just failing due to an unrelated error due to raw_input vs input. You probably intended to read a string from the shell instead of reading a string and trying to evaluate it as Python code which is what input does.Try this instead:chat.pyclient.py
