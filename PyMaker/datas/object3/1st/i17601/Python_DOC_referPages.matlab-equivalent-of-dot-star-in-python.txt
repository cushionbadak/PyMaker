I am working on a matlab conversion code.what is equivalent of .* in matlab with python?where v is numpy array : In such cases, how will I convert code to python?
For numpy arrays, just using * will do the element-wise multiplication as in Matlab's .*http://wiki.scipy.org/NumPy_for_Matlab_Usersyou can use,Note: If you want to use matrices instead of arrays in numpy, you have to use the multiply method.

Result:Do not use len as a variable name, because this shadows the built-in length function len().
