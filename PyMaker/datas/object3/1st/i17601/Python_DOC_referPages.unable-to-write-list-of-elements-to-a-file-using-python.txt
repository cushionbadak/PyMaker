I have list of elements and I want to write below elements to file using print() function using python. Python gui: version 3.3Sample code:Output when I run in IDLE gui:I don't see any line written in the output file. I tried using the flog_out.write(), it looks we can pass one argument in write() function. Can anybody look into my code and tell if I'm missing something. 
If you are specifying a file-like object to print, you need to use a named kwarg (file=<descriptor>) syntax.  All unnamed positional arguments to print will be concatenated together with a space.i.e.works.
From Python DocsAll of your arguments, key, '=>', D[key], and flog_out, are packed into *objects and printed to stdout. You need to add a keyword argument for flog_out like so:in order to prevent it from treating it like just-another-object
Though if I were writing it I'd use a context manager and dict.items()
