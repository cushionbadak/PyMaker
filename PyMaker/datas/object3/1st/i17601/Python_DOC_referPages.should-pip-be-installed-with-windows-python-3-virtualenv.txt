I am using Windows 7 and Python 3.3.3I have created a virtual environment using:I then activate the new environment using:I can check my python version and it says Python 3.3.3, all is good so far.I was under the impression that I should have pip installed by default by pyvenv.py into the newly created virtual environment?  Is this true?I do not see pip in the new environment, and I cannot run 'pip' after activating the new virtual environment.NOTE: I'm specifically looking for the Windows answer to this question, TIAUpdate #1From the venv documentation here:http://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.htmlIt appears that neither setuptools or pip are installed by venv.Update #2To install, I first downloaded setuptools from:https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptoolsI activated my virtual environment, then ran:This installed setuptools into the virtual environmentI then ran:This downloaded and installed pip
It appears the answer to the original question is: No, pip is not installed by Python 3 venv with Windows.To install pip, I first downloaded setuptools from: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptoolsI activated my virtual environment, I then changed to the downloaded setuptools directory and ran:This installed setuptools into the virtual environmentI then ran:This downloaded and installed pip
