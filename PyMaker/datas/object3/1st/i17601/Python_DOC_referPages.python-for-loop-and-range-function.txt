I don't understand how the range function works:in countMe shouldn't the code go up till 18 ;why is the last number printed in countMe 15, and not 18 ;why is that in the second function oddsOut the function only founts till 7 for j and not 8 even though j is 8 ; why is the last number printed in oddsOut 14.
The stop parameter in a range does not include that number for examplewould print 0-4 but not 5.
well, from the help:so the last increment is not stop, but the last step before stop.in countMe shouldn't the code go up till 18 ;why is the last number printed in countMe 15, and not 18 ;why is that in the second function oddsOut the function only founts till 7 for j and not 8 even though j is 8 ;why is the last number printed in oddsOut 14.more generally speaking the answer to those questions is that in most of the languages, a range is defined as [start:stop[, i.e. the last value of the range is never included, and the indexes start always at 0. The mess being that in a few languages and when working on algorithmics, ranges start at 1 and are inclusive with the last value.In the end, if you want to include the last value you can do:or in your example:
Ranges in Python do not include the ending value. This is consistent with slices.If you need a way to remember this, consider that range(10) has 10 elements - the numbers 0 through 9.
