This question already has an answer here:Scoping in Python 'for' loops                    6 answers                I have tried this code :and the program executed without error, so why is i declared even after the for statement, it must no longer exist. 
Yes, your iteration variable isn’t deleted when the loop is finished. As the documentation puts it: „Names in the target list are not deleted when the loop is finished”.This has to do with variable scopes. As has been pointed out, the variable i exists within the scope of the function you’re in. A loop does not create an extra scope in python.
The scope is within a function, not a loop.  A little different than other programming languages.
