I get on input file which contains only one class definition (class is just constants container, contains keys for json, similar file is used on Java client to decode json) looks like:How to get dictionary of all properties defined inside Constants, how to parse file to dictionary ?I want to compress keys and generate new .py and .java files with same constants keys but shorter keys.
Import the moduleI used imp.load_module instead of __import__ in the following code to import abitrary file path.Find the class object.Iterate the class attribute using vars:Tested in Python on 2.7.6, 3.3.2, 3.4.0b2.

Expanding on answer number one:
Here is an example of using execfile and python 2.6 (I work on Debian Wheezy). A shorter version to build the dictionary for python version 2.7 and higher is given too. The constants.py file can define several classes, all of them will be parsed.
