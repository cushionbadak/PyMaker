I'm wondering what is the best way to create a list while avoiding the duplicate.I have some data in mysql which fields contain product types.For example:Output which im aiming is:(please note order does NOT matter for me)Data set have over 40,000 records so checking it manually is certainly not an option...I would appreciate if you could drop me a note or suggestion to achieve this.
Python sets don't allow duplicates. So, you can construct a set of unique categories, using set comprehension, like thisFor example,OutputYou can iterate a set, like a list. But, if you want to convert it to a list later on, you can use list function like this
Just change the datatype to set it will work example if you want the following outputjust do it Its doneIn set there is no duplicate members.
