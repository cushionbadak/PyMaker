I am using the Python 3.5 re module with this code:I want to return Department\Travel\FY 2015\Travel Expense Statement Jul 25 2019.pdf. I have tried the following regex, but keep getting errors such as sre_constants.error: nothing to repeat at position 12or the empty result [''] for:How can I accomplish this operation?
The problem with your regular expression is very simple, remove the ? character in your second regular expression. You just need .* that matches zero or more characters. *? together means a lazy quantifier that matches as little as possible, so if you use .*?, it means "zero or more any characters, but as few as possible". As for the first regular expression, the * does not have a preceding atom to which it could apply to, hence the error.In general case, you should rather use the ntpath module as in kennytm's answer there.
You shouldn't use regex for this. Instead, use the ntpath module (or os.path if you are sure the script will only run on Windows):
