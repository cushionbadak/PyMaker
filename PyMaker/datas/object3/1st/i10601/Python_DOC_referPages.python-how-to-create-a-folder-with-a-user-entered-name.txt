Natural Text
I have a python script which runs to take screenshots in a loop and save all those images. However currently, all images are stored in Python35 folder.Therefore I want the user to enter a name for a folder and create one by this name.I know to use makedirs function and specify a path by newpath=r'C:/users/../' .But how to append this new folder name specified by the user to the path?(EDIT) Here is the Code I have:-
If you mean building the path at which the file should be saved, use os.path.join with the base directory first and the custom directory name second (the filename can be provided as a third argument). Just be very careful about trusting user input for anything, especially filesystem manipulation.
