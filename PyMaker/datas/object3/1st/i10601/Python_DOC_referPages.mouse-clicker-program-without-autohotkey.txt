I am a total programming newb and am trying to find a way to automate a mouse click once every 5 seconds for 5 minutes at a specific location to automatically run a licensed program many times. My work computer does not allow installation of autohotkey, but I was able to install Python v3.5 (v2.7 will not install). My work computer uses windows 7 and can't install any programs that require admin rights.I tried using the PyAutoGui module and it does not appear to be working with v3.5 python?The script i want to use is something like below, but the script below is for v2.5 python, which I cannot use on v3.5. Can someone translate this script to v3.5 python?
Why not just write a Python script that would open and close the program using Popen?
PyAutoGui is compatible with Python 3.Here is a short Python 3 program that will constantly print out the position of the mouse cursor:To perform mouse even by move pointer to 100x200, then click the left mouse button:Few other examples:See: Mouse Control Functions.
