Natural Text
I search a text based data format which supports multiline strings.JSON does not allow multiline strings:My desired output:This question is about input and output. The data format should be editable with a editor like vi, emacs or notepad.I don't care if simple quotes " or tripple quotes (like in Python) """ get used.Is there a easy for human beings readable textual data interchange format which supports this?Use caseI want to edit data with multiline strings with vi. This is not fun, if the data is in json format.
I think you should consider YAML format. It supports block notation which is able to preserve newlines like thisAlso there is a lot of parsers for any kind of programming languages including python (i.e pyYaml).Also there is a huge advantage that any valid JSON is YAML.
Apropos of your comment:I want to use it for configuration. A lot of applications invent  their own configuration language. I want to avoid this. But json and  ConfigParser don't satisfy me. Json does not allow strings with  newlines (only \n) and ConfigParser does not allow nested data  structures. Next thing that I am missing: Validation (But this is a  different topic).There're 3 main options you have ConfigParser, ConfigObj, or YAML (PyYAML) - each with their particular pros and cons. All 3 are better then JSON for your use-case i.e. configuration file.Now further, which one is better depends upon what exactly you want to store in your conf file. ConfigObj - For configuration and validation (your use-case):ConfigObj is very simple to use then YAML (also the ConfigParser). Supports default values and types, and also includes validation (a huge plus over ConfigParser).An Introduction to ConfigObjWhen you perform validation, each of the members in your specification  are checked and they undergo a process that converts the values into  the specified type. Missing values that have defaults will be filled  in, and validation returns either True to indicate success or a  dictionary with members that failed validation. The individual checks  and conversions are performed by functions, and adding your own check  function is very easy.P.S. Yes, it allows multiline values.Helpful links:A Brief ConfigObj TutorialConfigObj 5 Introduction and ReferenceThere are solid SO answers available on the comparison YAML vs ConfigParser vs ConfigObj:What's better, ConfigObj or ConfigParser?ConfigObj/ConfigParser vs. using YAML for Python settings file
ini format also supports multiline strings; configparser from Python stdlib can handle it. See https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html#supported-ini-file-structure.
XML with ElementTree (standard library) or lxml if you are OK with the markup overhead:DataScriptOutput
If the files are only used by Python (overlooking the interchange), you could simply put your data in a python script file and import this as a module:DataScriptOutputUpdate:Code with dictionary comprehension
If you're using Python 2, I actually think json can do what you need. You can dump and load json while decoding and encoding it with string-escape:Output:So, you can use the decoded string to edit your JSON, newlines included, and when reading it, just encode with string-escape to get the dictionary back.
Not sure whether I've understood your question correctly, but are you not asking for something like this?
