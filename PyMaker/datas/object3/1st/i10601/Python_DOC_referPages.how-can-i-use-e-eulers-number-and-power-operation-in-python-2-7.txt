How can i write x.append(1-e^(-value1^2/2*value2^2)) in python 2.7?I don't know how to use power operator and e.
Refer math library of python. exp(x) function this library is same as e^x. Hence you may write your code as:I have modified the equation by replacing 1/2 as 0.5. Else for Python <2.7 we have to explicitly type cast the division value to float because Python round of the result of division of two int. (for example: 1/2 -> 0 in python 2.7 and below) 
Power is ** and e^ is math.exp:
Python's power operator is ** and Euler's number is math.e, so:
