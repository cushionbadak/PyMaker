I am new to python and just need a small help.We have a Pipe delimited CSV file which looks like this Every value of Zip and OPEID columns has apostrophes in the beginning So we wish to create a new CSV file where apostrophes are removed from each value of these 2 columns.The new file should then look like this:This code works for copying data without removing apostrophes
It worked for me... Try this.
The code below would be the same for all file formats. The fact that it is a *.csv doesn't change a thing. What it actually does, is that it goes in the file from which you want to remove the apostrophes, my_csv_in, and parses it line by line each time replacing them with nothing (a.k.a removing). The modified lines are written in a second file, my_csv_out.There are probably better ways to do this that take advantage of the file being a *.csv and using the csv library. You can take a look at the quoting options in the documentation.
To remove apostrophes you can use the replace function, you just need to get the content of every cell one by one, and replace the apostrophes with:More simply, open your csv file with any file editor and search and replace for "'".
You can do it very efficiently with Pandas--this will be good if your file is very large:
