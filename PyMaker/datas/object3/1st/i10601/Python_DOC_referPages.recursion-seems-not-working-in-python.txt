I am writing a piece of code to recursively processing *.py files. The code block is as the following:When I run the script with a directory path as argument, it only runs the first layer of the directory, the line:seems never get called. I'm using Python 3.5.
The recursion is happening fine, but temp_dir is not a directory so it passes control to your stub else block. You can see this if you put print(file_path) outside your if block.temp_dir is the name of the next directory, not its absolute path. "C:/users/adsmith/tmp/folder" becomes just "folder".

As temp_dir has the filename only without parent path, you should changeto
