Can some one suggest a good example for socket server which can handle multiple connections with threading from python. (Live connection (like server-client ping-pong) that will handle from threads)
Using the SocketServer module you can create a server that handles multiple connections. Using Asynchronous mixins you can start new threads for each connection. There is a very good example in the Python documentation above.
