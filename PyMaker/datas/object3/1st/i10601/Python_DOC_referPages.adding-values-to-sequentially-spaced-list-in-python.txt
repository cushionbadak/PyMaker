I am fairly new to Python and am confused how to represent the following code from Matlab into Python:In Matlab, this will spit out: P = [2,3,...,35,50,100,200] ; however, I can't seem to figure out how to easily add values to an a list with sequential numbering as is easily done in Matlab. Any suggestions would be great. Thanks!
Vanilla python doesn't have a dedicated syntax for this ... If you're working with lists, you need 2 steps:If you have the "bleeding edge" (python3.5), you can use unpacking:If you're using numpy, you can use the r_ index trick (which looks somewhat similar to the matlab version):
If you're fortunate enough to use Python 3.5, you can use additional unpacking generalizations (from PEP 448) with range:Note that the last value generated by range is one less than the end argument.
