I have a problem where, when I execute a script which involved reading in data from a file that contains unicode code points, everything works fine. But when it is executed via another application, it is raising the following error:UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xc2 in position  0: ordinal not in range(128)I am executing the exact same code using the exact same data file. A sample datafile that replicates the problem is like this:I called this sample.txt A very simple python script to simply read in and print the file contents:This executes fine from the command line; executing via Apache/CGI fails with the above error. 
A hint to the problem came from the documentation of the open function:In text mode, if encoding is not specified the encoding used is  platform dependent: locale.getpreferredencoding(False) is called to  get the current locale encoding.  [Link]Platform dependent suggested environment variables. So, I inspected what environment variables were set for my shell, and found LANG set to en_US.UTF-8. Dumping the environment variables set by Apache found that LANG was missing. So, apparently when locale cannot be determined, Python uses ASCII as the default file encoding. As a result, the error was encountered when the ordinal was out of range for ASCII. To fix this, I set this environment variable in my CGI script. If the environment variable is somehow missing from a user shell, it can be set via normal methods, or just by:Or whatever preferred encoding is desired. Note, the issue is probably far more noticeable if the locale is missing from a user shell, as text editors like vi will not display characters without it. It was significantly more subtle when only an issue when called from Apache (or some other application).
