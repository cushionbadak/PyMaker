For another simple test, I made this code (file name is test3.py) and I put in in /home/ckim/python/test3 directory.When I run the code, this_dir value gives me /usr/local/dir when I expected it to be /home/ckim/python/test3. What is the problem?
Use os.path.realpath as well to make it work:os.getcwd() might also solve your problem.
