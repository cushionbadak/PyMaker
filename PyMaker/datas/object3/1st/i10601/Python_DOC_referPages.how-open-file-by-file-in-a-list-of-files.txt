Natural Text
How can I open every single file in a list of files, do something with the file and then go to the next file?I have a directory with 1000 text files. I have already created a list with all the files names and now I want to open file by file. Do someone has an idea how to do that? What I have so far:

There's no need to create a separate list to hold filenames.  Just iterate over the results of listdir() directly.
