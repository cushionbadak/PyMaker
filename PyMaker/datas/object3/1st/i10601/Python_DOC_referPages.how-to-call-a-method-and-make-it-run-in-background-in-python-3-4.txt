I have implemented the Google Cloud Messaging server in python and I want that method to be Asynchronous. I do not expect any return values from that method. Is there a simple way to do this?I have tried using async from asyncio package:and here is my method sendNotification():
You could use a ThreadPoolExecutor:
Since GCM is not async library compatible need to use an external event loop. There are a few, simplest one IMO is probably gevent.Note that gevent monkey patching may introduce dead locks if the underlying libraries used rely on blocking behaviour to operate.
You can use asyncio's api: loop.run_in_executor(None, callable)This will run the code using an executor (by default a ThreadPoolExecutor)See the documentation
