How do I allow the user to input values and receive the answer, whilst keeping the values of "x + xy + y" on one line?
I'd suggest using a single input statement and then using a simple regular expression to parse the string into x, y and the operator. For example, this pattern: (\d+)\s*([-+*/])\s*(\d+). Here, \d+ means "one or more digits", \s* means "zero or more spaces", and [-+*/] means "any of those four symbols. The parts within (...) can later be extracted.Alternatively to four if/elif, you could also create a dictionary, mapping operator symbols to functions:And then just get the right function from that dict and apply it to the operands:
Here's another possibility.
You can get input like this:Then you can process your input data.
