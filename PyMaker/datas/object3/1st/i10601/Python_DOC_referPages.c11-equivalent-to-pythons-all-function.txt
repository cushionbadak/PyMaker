Is there an equivalent function to Python's all() built-in function?In other words: Does a C++11 function exist that returns true when all of the elements of an iterable meet a certain condition and false otherwise?
Check out std::all_of in the <algorithm> header. You can pass a custom predicate that evaluates to true or false on each element.
Also, for doing the same thing with template parameter pack (like template <bool... values>) you can use fold expression: (values && ...), but only since C++17. Documentation of this feature is here:http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/fold
