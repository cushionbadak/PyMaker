I think it is better to use map for this kind of tasks. Which creates iterator, what means it is more memory efficient.
As long as the whole array fits in memory, you should just be able to step through it, replacing each item as you go:good luck!
This should be pretty much in-place?Or, you could do it by using enumerate which takes an iterable (like a list) and returns an index and the corresponding value from the beginning till the end:
