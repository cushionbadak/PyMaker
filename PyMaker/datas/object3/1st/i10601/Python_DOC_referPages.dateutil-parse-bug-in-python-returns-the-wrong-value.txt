I have looked at many possible ways to parse python times. Using parse seems link the only method that should work. While trying to use datetime.strptime causes an error because %z does not work with python 2.7. But using parse.parse incorrectly recognizes the time zone.I parse both Fri Nov 9 09:04:02 2012 -0500 and Fri Nov 9 09:04:02 2012 -0800 and get the exact same timestamp in unix time. 1352480642My version of python 2.7.10 My version of dateutil 1.5Here is my code that runs the test.OutputExpected output
This has nothing to do with the parser, you'll see the same behavior just from mktime() alone, since datetime.timetuple() doesn't have any time zone offset information, and mktime() is the inverse of localtime. You can correct this by converting it to localtime before calling timetuple():Note that there is a chart on the documentation for time() (python 2.x docs) that tells you how to convert between these representations:My personal preference would be to convert the parsed date to UTC, in which case calendar.timegm() would be the appropriate function:
