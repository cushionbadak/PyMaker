For example, I'm having a group of multi-dimension arrays. I want to write a method to specify the size of the slice for this array such as:Because I could only get a list of [a, b, c]. I want to know how can I convert this list to slice index. Or is there a way to connect the list with slice index so as to operate this array as:Any reply would be appreciated.
Use the slice() function.(I updated the variable names to avoid shadowing the builtins by mistake.)slice(x) is equivalent to the slice :x, and slice(x, y, z) is x:y:z
