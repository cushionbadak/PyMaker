Also, assuming that I have a need to provide the application sensitive configurations such as API keys / URIs.My virtualenv might be in a path such as:I believe I want to be able to install a default config file for the user of the app to modify before successful execution.A default example might be installed to:The problem is, if I am in a virtualenv, setup.py / setuptools really doesn't handle installing into a global path ( as far as I know ).What would be the best pythonic way to handle this fairly common scenario?
Assuming the config file alters Virtual Environment Variables and that is why it must be modified before the launch of the virtual environment, then you can modify the activate bash script located in ./venv/bin to accomplish this. So if you want to add a global path from a config file, then last line in activate could be:Then the virtual enviroment can be activated as it usual would:
Have you tried using Python's site-specific configuration options? It seems to me like .pth files and a sitecustomize.py file might be helpful.See also: Accepted answer on "Using .pth files".Giving more precise detail on what might be done is difficult without a more specific example of the sort of "global path" you mean - even though this is a general style question to some extent.
