I have a script that searches through config files and finds all matches of strings from another list as follows:I need to change this part of the code:search_str is a list containing strings similar to ['xrout:55','old:23'] and many others.So it will only find entries that end with the string from the list I am iterating through in sfarm.  My understanding is that this would require my to use re and match on something like sfarm$ but Im not sure on how to do this as part of the loop.Am I correct in saying that sfarm is an iterable?  If so I need to know how to regex on an iterable object in this context.
Strings in python are iterable, so sfarm is an iterable, but that has little meaning in this case. From reading what CiscoConfParse.find_all_children() does, it is apparent that your sfarm is the linespec, which is a regular expression string. You do not need to explicitly use the re module here; just pass sfarm concatenated with '$':
Please check this code. Used glob module to get all "*.txt" files in folder.Please check here for more info on glob module.Output:
