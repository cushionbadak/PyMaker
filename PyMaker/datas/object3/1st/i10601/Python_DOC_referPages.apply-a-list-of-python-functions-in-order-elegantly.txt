I have an input value val and a list of functions to be applied in the order:How to apply elegantly and not writingand also not using for loop:Thanks Martijn for the awesome answer. There's some reading I found: https://mathieularose.com/function-composition-in-python/ .
Use the reduce() function:reduce() applies the first argument, a callable, to each element taken from the second argument, plus the accumulated result so far (as (result, element)). The third argument is a starting value (the first element from funcs would be used otherwise).In Python 3, the built-in function was moved to the functools.reduce() location; for forward compatibility that same reference is available in Python 2.6 and up.Other languages may call this folding.If you need intermediate results for each function too, use itertools.accumulate() (only from Python 3.3 onwards for a version that takes a function argument):
MartijnPieters answer is excellent. The only thing I would add is that this is called function compositionGiving names to these generics means you can use them whenever the need arisesSometimes you want it to look nicer though -And sometimes you want more flexibility -
