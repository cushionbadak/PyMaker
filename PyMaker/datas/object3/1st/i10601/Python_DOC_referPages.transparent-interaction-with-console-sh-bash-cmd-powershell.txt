Please help me to write simple console application in python. It should redirect all input to system shell (bash or windows cmd or powershell) and give all their output to the screen. Simply I can say run terminal from python application.The next code works with some strange behavior: first 3 times after any key pressed it outputs (executes?) some previous commands (may be from cache)
I think you needproc = subprocess.Popen(['bash'], stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE)From the docs:PIPE indicates that a new pipe to the child should be created.  DEVNULL indicates that the special file os.devnull will be used. With  the default settings of None, no redirection will occur; the childâ€™s  file handles will be inherited from the parent.I don't think you want your bash to be connected to your parent process's stdin directly.  That would explain wierdness.
