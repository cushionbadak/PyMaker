I want to use my script like this:and my code is like this:when I execute it, an exception is raised:so I try to add required=False when I add each argument.Then I get another exception:I'm confused. 
A better way to do this is to add a single positional argument that can have two choices.  Since you want it to be optional, use nargs='?', which means zero or one times:If run is given, the value will be 'run'.  If stop is given, it will be 'stop'.  If neither is given, it will be None.If you really want to use a mutually-exclusive group, I'm not sure if you can do it exactly how you want.  You can, however, make them optional arguments by adding a hyphen:Of course the problem with that is that the user also needs to provide the hyphen, but that's the sort of problem you can expect if you limit yourself like that.
You can achieve this with nargs='?'Which would allow you to call the program withor but not
