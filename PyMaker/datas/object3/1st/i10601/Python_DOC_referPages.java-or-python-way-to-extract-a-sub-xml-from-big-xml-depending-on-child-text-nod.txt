I have a big XML to be handled, I need to extract all "Situation" TAGS if these ones have <_0:roadNumber>A-52, <_0:roadNumber>AP-9 or <_0:roadNumber>A-55 values in theirs, because I don`t need the rest of XML. Then build a XML document with the XML substraction. I donÂ´t need a implementation, only I would like to know how can I handle this or wich API is the most appropiated, thanks.PD: My finall achieve is to dump the XML in a data baseXML GET:
For really big XML documents you should best use SAX for streaming (not needing to have the full document in memory at once) but for finding elements easly XPath is really helpful.For Python you have some XPath support in xml.etree.ElementTree and SAX in xml.sax - but there of course are other parsers, too.There are SAX implementations and XPath for Java, too.
