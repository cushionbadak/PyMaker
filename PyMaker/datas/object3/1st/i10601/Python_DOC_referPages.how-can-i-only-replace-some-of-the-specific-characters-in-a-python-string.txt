I want to replace characters in a string but not all of the characters at once.  For example:I would like to replace the string with all these optionsI only know the normal s.replace() function that would replace all occurences of that character.  Does anyone have any clever code that would replace all the possible options of characters in the string?
Return a copy of string s with all occurrences of substring old replaced by new. If the optional argument maxreplace is given, the first maxreplace occurrences are replaced.So, if maxreplace=1 only the first character is replaced.
You can still use replace() to only replace the first k occurrences of a character, rather than all of them at once.string.replace(s, old, new[, maxreplace]) Return a copy of string s with all occurrences of substring old replaced by new. If the optional argument maxreplace is given, the first maxreplace occurrences are replaced.So your example could be accomplished by:More complicated patterns can be accomplished by using the re module in Python, which allows for pattern matching using regular expressions, notably with re.sub().
Does anyone have any clever code that would replace all the possible  options of characters in the string?Take a look at regular expressions in Python.Here's an example:This would replace all strings that start with a and put an X there.
I have managed to replace all the character in the string with all the different combinations.  Although the code isnt the most efficient it does what I wanted it to
