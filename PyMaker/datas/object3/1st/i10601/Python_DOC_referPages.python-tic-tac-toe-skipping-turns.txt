I am working on a tic-tac-toe program in python. Now, the Human's turn work's fine. However, the AI, after playing the first turn, does not play any further turns. I have scanned through the code and cannot seem to find any errors that can cause this. Please ignore the comments and the part that deals with ties. I am still working on that. 
In a word, the problem of your AI is that it chose the same position all the times, which seems like "not playing any further turns".To prove that, simply add a print in the for-loop of your AI:And here's the result.I can't give a specific advice to solve this bug, as I totally didn't get the point of this AI #=_= (maybe you should use MiniMax). But anyway, your AI shouldn't place pieces at the same position.ps. you might need to change system.exit() into sys.exit().pps. the for-else grammar in Python is great for you.ppps. "remove redundant parentheses", says PyCharm.
