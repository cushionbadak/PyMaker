I have a long string of data streaming continuously, which is generated by my C# script. I would like to use it as an input to Python Machine Learning model. What is the fastest & easiest way to implement this transmission? I have found some possible options:Use sockets.Use http.Write data to a file from C#, and read the file from PythonData as an argument, while python is running as a process in C# orSomething different?
Provided that these processes run on the same machine, I think when handling big chunks of data between process memory mapping is the way to go.In other case TCP/UDP sockets is a good option since they don't have the overhead of the Application layer which, HTTP for example, has 
I suggest option 6 Use Database like sqlite.With this option you gain:Both running OnLinePython set flags to these records in database when they processed.You can complete operation latter if python off, and continue processing data.You can add results from python to the database.you have a history in database you may need latter for post processing.
