This question already has an answer here:How do I list all files of a directory?                    27 answers                This is my existing code currently. It takes user input in to search for a file as specified by the user, then adds that file to a list, and through a loop opens each file one by one. I would like to try and make this more automatic, so that the script will automatically grab all of the files in a given folder for this process, instead of the user having to input the name for each file. Any suggestions on how to make this more automated?
Use os.listdir:Use glob.glob instead to select only files matching a given pattern:
You can use a new Python library pathlib instead:
