Using python3, i have a list of words like:['foot', 'stool', 'carpet'] these lists vary in length from 1-6 or so. i have thousands and thousands of strings to check, and it is required to make sure that all three words are present in a title. where:'carpet stand upon the stool of foot balls.'is a correct match, as all the words are present here, even though they are out of order.ive wondered about this for a long time, and the only thing i could think of was some sort of iteration like:but this give me results like 'carpet cleaner' which is incorrect. i feel as though there is some sort of shortcut to do this, but i cant seem to figure it out without using excessivelist(), continue, break or other methods/terminology that im not yet familiar with. etc etc.
