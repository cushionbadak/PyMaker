I am new to python. I am using python 3.5 on mac os x el capitan.I tried using the command 'pip install requests' in the python interpreter IDLE. But it throws invalid 'syntax error'.I read about installing modules is only possible in the command line.So I moved to TERMINAL, but no command is working here also.(I tried 'python -m pip install requests')I read that mac os x comes with python 2.7 already installed and I ran 'easy_install pip' but it also works on the 2.7 version.Then there's discussion about the PATH settings also.Can please anybody explain to me how I can use my current version in TERMINAL window and what is the PATH scenario.I am familiar with the environment variable settings and adding pythonpath  in windows but not on mac.
Here is what you should do.Use homebrew to install python 2.7 and 3.5 in a virtual environment.pip install virtualenvThen make a directory called virtualenvs in your root folder and add local files with.activate a virtualenv with source ~/virtualenvs/bin/activateThen use pip to install brew in this virtualenv pip install brewThen install python 2.7 as python and python 3 as python3:Then you can use python and python3 and not have to worry about the local install.Then to run a file python3 filename.py
Followed this guide.https://docs.python.org/3/using/mac.htmlFound python3.5 in usr/local/bin instead of the default usr/bin where the default 2.7 exists.The 3.5 Package automatically genrates an alias for itself that is python3.5 for use in terminal.Ran the command 'python3.5 -m pip install requests' and everything went good.
