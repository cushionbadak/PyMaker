I have this piece of code:In my unit tests, I want to mock it so check that right path is passed:What can I replace ANY with to check that there is a lambda there?
I would do this with the call_args and call_count rather than directly in assert_called_once_with, I don't think unittest.mock has anything like e.g. jasmine.any:Note that it's not relevant that the argument is a lambda specifically, just that it is callable.
