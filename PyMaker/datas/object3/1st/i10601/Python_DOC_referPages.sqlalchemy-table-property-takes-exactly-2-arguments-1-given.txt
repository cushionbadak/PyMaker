I have the following SQLAlchemy class:When I use the property I get the error encrypt_password() takes exactly 2 arguments (1 given).Why doesn't this work?  How do I implement a property for setting the password?
You defined the getter for the property as the setter.  Either remove the property because this is a function, or define the property correctly.If you're going the property route, rename the password attribute and access it through the property for the getter.  Use a hybrid_property so that the column is still queryable directly.
