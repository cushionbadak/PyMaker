Is it possible to produce a namedtuple which inherits from a base class? What I want is that Circle and Rectangle are namedtuples and are inherited from a common base class ('Shape'):How would I do that?
You can try this:(You should consider adding __slots__ to all your three classes to save memory and for sightly faster lookups.)
