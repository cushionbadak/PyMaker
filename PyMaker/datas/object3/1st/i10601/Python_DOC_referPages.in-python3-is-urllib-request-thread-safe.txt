Natural Text
It's not found if urllib.request is thread-safe or not in Pyhton 3 document. Is there anything special that I have to look for when using it in multi-threading scripts?
According to urllib.request's source here, here and here, no, it isn't. In general, Python is not thread safe, so unless explicitly stated that a module is, you should assume it isn't.
