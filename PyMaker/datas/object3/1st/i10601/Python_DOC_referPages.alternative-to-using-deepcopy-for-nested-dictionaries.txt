I have a nested dict like this, but much larger:I've written a function which takes a dictionary and a path of keys as input and returns the value associated with that path.Once I get the nested dictionary, I will need to modify it, however, d can not be modified. Do I need to use deepcopy, or is there a more efficient solution that doesn't require constantly making copies of the dictionary? 
Depending on your use case, one approach to avoid making changes to an existing dictionary is to wrap it in a collections.ChainMap:Now we can add new keys and values to c without corresponding changes happening in dWhether this solution is appropriate depends on your use case ... in particular the ChainMap will:not behave like a regular map when it comes to some things, like deleting keys:still allow you to modify values in placewill alter the list in dHowever, if you are merely wishing to take your embedded dictionary and pop some new keys and values on it, then ChainMap may be appropriate.
