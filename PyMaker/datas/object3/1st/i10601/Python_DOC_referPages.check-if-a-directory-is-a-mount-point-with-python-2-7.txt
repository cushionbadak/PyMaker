Is there a pythonic way and without shell commands (i.e. with subprocess module) to check if a directory is a mount point? Up to now I use:
There is an os.path.ismount(path).Return True if pathname path is a mount point: a point in a file  system where a different file system has been mounted. The function  checks whether path‘s parent, path/.., is on a different device than  path, or whether path/.. and path point to the same i-node on the same  device — this should detect mount points for all Unix and POSIX  variants.You may also refer to implementation (if you're on POSIX system). Check macpath.py or ntpath.py for other platforms.
in Python 3.7, use Path.is_mount()
