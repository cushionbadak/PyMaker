can someone please tell me what the differnce between using these two in my __init__.py in my package? And which is better to use?
The difference between the possible two statements in the script bar__init__.py is what scope the sub-packages or modules under bar are imported into.  If the package bar contains the sub-package named functions, the statementfrom functions import *in bar__init__.py will import the functions sub-package into the scope of the bar package, and it can be accessed using the reference bar.functionsin Python code that imports bar.  If bar__init__.py contains the codeall = [functions]then Python code containing the codefrom bar import *will define the sub-package as functions (with no reference to bar.)Either method can be used to reference the contents of the sub-package functions, but the syntax is different.
