I am working on a program right now that has the goal of analyzing twin primes in a certain way(twin primes are primes in the form of(p,p+2)). Right now I have a code that counts the twin primes remainders in % 10 form. This is that code:print sieve(10000)This part of the code works fine but I was wondering if anyone knows of a way that when I am finding the pairs of (1)'s(the twin primes) I could also record the order they appear in the list. I don't need anyone to actually write the code that does this, I am just asking if anyone knows of a built in tool in python that I could use to preform this task.Thanks for the help. 
assuming that sieve is the Sieve of Eratosthenes, or similar, then you can use the pairwise recipe in the itertools module to obtain only the twin primes with a generator expression for examplelikewise you can use it alongside enumerate to get the index of the first prime in the pair in relation to a list of primes, for example
