I am preparing for my exam and I decided to start solving past exams. One of the requirements is to understand what a code does. But I am having troubles with this annotation.I do not understand which the structure of this nested loop and which loop is executed first.Can someone help me understand please?
As a rule of thumb, the innermost loops are going to be executed first.Having this in mind, let's break the problem down :n**0.5 is 3.xxx, so range(2, int(n**0.5)) is in fact range(2, 3), which is 2 (see range for more informations).So i is going to be 2, no matter what.r in range(i * 2, n, i) looks pretty simple now, r will be between 4 and 10 (excluded), using a step of 2. The possible values are 4, 6 and 8.The problem becomes :Which is basically all odd numbers between 2 and 10 (excluded), plus the number 2.
It starts by evaluating:which boils down to:since range(2, int(n * 0.5)) reduces to a list with a single element [2] that is used as the value of i in the for r in range(i * 2, n, i) statement. So the inner list comprehension evaluates to [4, 6, 8].Then, the outer loop for q in range(2, n) is executed and it returns those elements from the list [2, 3, ..., 9] that do not belong in the previously constructed list i.e [4, 6, 8] with:
This equivalent to :
If you're having a hard time understanding inner loops, run this code:Once you've understood this code comprehension lists become second nature to you, then just come back to your original code and you won't have any problems with it :)
