The function should return a replacement for the given match - here, if the word is found in the dictionary we return that instead, otherwise the original is returned.Thus:As for the &amp;, on Python 3.4+ you should use html.unescape to decode HTML entities:This will take care of all known HTML entities. For older python versions you can see alternatives on this question.The regular expression does not match the & character; if you want to replace it too, we can use regular expression \w+|. which means: "any consecutive run of alphanumeric characters, or then any single character that is not in such a run":Then you can do
