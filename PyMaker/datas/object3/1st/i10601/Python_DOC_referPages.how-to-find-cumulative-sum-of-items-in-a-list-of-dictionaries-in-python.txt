I have a list which is likeI want to get the cumulative sum of the values in reversed order like thisWhat is the most efficient way to get this ? I have read other answer where using numpy gives the solution like but I need to insert the cumsum in the dictionary as well
Output:So it turns out that inserting at the start of a list is slow (O(n)). Instead, try a deque (O(1)):Output:Here is a script to test the speed of each of the approaches ITT, as well as a chart with timing results:
A generator based solution:In quick time tests this is competitive with cb_insert_0The in-place version does even better:
Here's another approach using pandas -Sample input, output -
Try this:Dicts are not ordered.
Try this,ResultEfficiencyChange into a function,And then the result,Finally efficiency,
Using pandas:
