If pip is not installed on the jenkins linux-box,is there any jenkins-plugin that lets me run pip, without installing it at the os-level?
Create a virtual environment. It should come with pip, but otherwise install it in the virtualenv.
Not a specific plug-in like you might want, but as was said, you can create a virtual environment in one of a few ways to get the functionality you're after.Docker can handle this, you can create a small script to build a docker image that will have access to pip and there are Jenkins plug-ins for docker.
