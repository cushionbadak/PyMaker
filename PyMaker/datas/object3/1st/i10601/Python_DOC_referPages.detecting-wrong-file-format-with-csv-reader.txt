I like to read in a list of ASCII files (utf-8) with the csv reader.For error handling i like to detect if a user has seleted by accident a file which cannot be read.The source is like this:I the user selects e.g. file which is GZIPed i got the message:(result, consumed) = self._buffer_decode(data, self.errors, final)UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0x8b in position 1: invalid start byteWhich in the first place is ok, but the script crashes.I didn't found out how to capture the error and force the script to jump to the next file in the list. I found a lot of about dialects and other codecs, but my task is not to read the wrong file by just changing the codec.Many thanks for any comment!
How about this:    
Use exception handling - https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.htmlYour code would then look like:It's good practice to include the encoding you expect when you open the file. If you put the same script on a Windows box, the default encoding would not be "utf-8".
