I'm using the Python 3 CSV Reader to read some web-log files into a namedtuple.I have no control over the log file structures, and there are varying types.The delimiter is a space ( ), the problem is that some log file formats place a space in the timestamp, as Logfile 2 below. The CSV reader then reads the date/time stamp as two fields.Logfile 1Logfile 2The log files typically have the timestamp within square quotes, but I cannot find a way of handling them as "quotes". On top of that, square brackets are not always used as quotes within the logs either (see the [2] later in the logs).I've read through the Python 3 CSV Reader documentation, including about dialects, but there doesn't seem to be anything for handling enclosing square brackets.How can I handle this situation automatically?
This will do, you need to use a regex in place of sep.This for example will parse NGinx log files into a pandas.Dataframe:Edit : The output would be a tuple with 6 pieces of information
