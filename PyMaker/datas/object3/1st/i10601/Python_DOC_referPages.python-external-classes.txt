It looks simple, but I could not find a solution.I display the problem below with the simplest example I could come up with.(My classes are quiet more complex ;) )file A.pyfile B.py don't match with import Awith import A -> callback : cannot find _AIt only works when I do -But and logically A functions are executed 2 times.Thanks to all
There is no need to first import X, then from X import Y. If you need Y (even if Y is *) do just from X import Y. This might be the cause of 2 times execution.Also why have cyclic dependencies between modules A -> B, B -> A? Maybe they should be in one file then?
Because of cyclic dependency you are facing the import error, you can continue your work as: File A.py:Also, you should either use import A or from A import _A and if you use the later you should call the class directly as: _A(self.someVars) not as: A._A(self.someVars), this calling convention will be used for former import style(import A), for better understanding of external use of classes and module, you can refer following link: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html
