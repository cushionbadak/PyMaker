I am using Argparse on python to do a script on command line. I have this for my script:I am looking that if I call manageAdam -s it would work and don't ask for the positional arguments, something like the -h, which can be called without any other positional argument that is defined. Is it possible?
There is no built-in way to do this. You might be able to achieve something by writing some custom Action classes that keep track on the parser about their state, but I believe it will become quite messy and buggy.I believe the best bet is to simply improve your UI. The -s is not an option. It's a separate command that completely alters how your script executes. In such cases you should use the subparsers functionality which allows to introduce sub-commands. This is a better interface then the one you thought, and is used by a lot of other tools (e.g. Git/mercurial).In this case you'd have a config command to handle the configuration and a run (or how you want to call it) command to perform the operations on the device:Used from the command line as:
No, there are no such way.You can make all arguments optional and set default value to None then perform check that all of them aren't None otherwise raise argparse.ArgumentError, if manageAdam provided skip check for other arguments.
