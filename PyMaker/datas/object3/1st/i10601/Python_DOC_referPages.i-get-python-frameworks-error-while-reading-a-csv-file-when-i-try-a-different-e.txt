Natural Text
Do anyone have any idea why I get this error? I tried an very easy cvs file from the internet and it worked just fine, but when I try the bigger file it doesn't
The file contains unicode characters, which was painful to deal with in old versions of python, since you are using 3.5 try opening the file as utf-8 and see if the issue goes away:From the docs:Since open() is used to open a CSV file for reading, the file will by default be decoded into unicode using the system default encoding (see locale.getpreferredencoding()). To decode a file using a different encoding, use the encoding argument of open:csv modeule docs
