How could I check to see if any element in array1D exists in arrayMD?So far I just know of the find() method and that seems to only work for one element search.Edit: I'd like to get it's index from arrayMD as well
Output:('book', 0, 1)It's not efficient as it's iterating through each element in each array but it works.
Use in.
If you are just wondering if the element is anywhere within the second 'array', then it is probably best to flatten it first which also has the advantage of being able to deal with arrays of any depth.  This is most easily done with numpy if you aren't sure how deep the lists will be.
output in first example will be [(5, [2, 1, 1]), (20, [2, 1, 3, 0])]which means that number 5 was found and it's index is [2,1,1]second example will output[('book', [0, 1])] if returned list is empty it's means elements from 1DArray weren't found in MDArray
