Natural Text
I'm trying to convert NULL values in a .csv to NaN and then save a file with these edits. f in the code below has the NaNvalues in the correct location in the data. However, I am unable to save this as a .csv. the error is printed below the code.error:
csv.writer.writerows() expects a sequence of sequences (a sequence of row objects), which a pandas.DataFrame is not, as it returns a sequence of column names when iterated over:This can bite you silently, as a sequence of strings is actually a sequence of sequences, so you'd end up with a CSV file that contains rows made up of the letters of your column names. In your case it fails because of how you tried to replace the 'NULL' strings, which ended up adding a column with the label False (a boolean value).To iterate over row tuples, you'd use DataFrame.itertuples():The easiest approach though is to simply use DataFrame.to_csv():Note that to replace the 'NULL' values you have to use the equality operator instead of the identity operator is:Using the identity will effectively add a new column labeled False with all values set to nan:because f is 'NULL' evaluates to False instead of a new DataFrame.
