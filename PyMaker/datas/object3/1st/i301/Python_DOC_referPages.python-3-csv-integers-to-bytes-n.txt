I'am Trying to Communicate with Arduino using serial communication in python. There is this program from arduino https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/ReadASCIIString . Simply sending a " 120,200,100" to control 3 LEDS. When I tried it in python writing data to the arduino so simply arduino.write(b'120,10,244\n') and it works. But my main problem is that if I assigned those values to a variable which gets change through a GUI for example a PyQT slider which I'am planning to implement it on, How should I go about this?How to output 3 integers assigned to variables->to csv -> bytes +\nFor example P1 = self.PWM1horizontalSlider.value() # ASSUMING a value of 120P2 = self.PWM2horizontalSlider.value() # ASSUMING a value of 200P3 = self.PWM3horizontalSlider.value() # ASSUMING a value of 100into b'120,200,100\n' Read ASCII String Code
To answer your question, outside of the example:This is assuming you want the bytes to use UTF-8 as an encoding, which is common, but something you'd want to check. It could also be something like cp1252 - more here https://docs.python.org/3/library/codecs.html#standard-encodingsYou could then send the_bytes wherever you need them.
