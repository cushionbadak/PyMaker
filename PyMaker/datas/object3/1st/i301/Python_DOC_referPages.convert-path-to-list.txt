Natural Text
I have a path made of directories (e.g. 'grandpa\\parent\\child') that I need to transform in a list (e.g. ['grandpa', 'parent', 'child']).The path can have less or more subdirectories (e.g. ['parent', 'child']).I tried iterating os.path.split() but it doesn't work well in all circumstances:There should be a better way, right? Maybe a method that I'm not aware of.
You can use pathlib too.
