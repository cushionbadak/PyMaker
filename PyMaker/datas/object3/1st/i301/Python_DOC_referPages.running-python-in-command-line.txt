The best approach to your problem would be to write out a .py file and run that.However, I can imagine that for scripting purposes you may need something like this if you cannot write a file. In that case you could separate your commands by ;, but you are going to be limited to programs without blocks, e.g.:but:SyntaxError: invalid syntaxbut again:the last one is of course bad practice and all (a side-effect in a comprehension, etc.) but kind of works.
The easiest way is to use a py file and then invoked it from command line. Inside the name_file.py put:In console excute See python file
If you need run a few commands. You can run Python interpreter with writing python inside your command line. There will be >>> as a mark that all commands you write will be interpreted by interpreter.Then you can write the commands. After each command you should press ENTER.
FIRST you have to add the python to your system path1.right click on THIS PC2.click on advanced system settingsclick on environment variablesclick on the path to editclick on edit6.search python in START MENU7.right click on the downloaded package and click on copy full path or if your'e using python 3.6 you can reinstall and check the path from the install menu8.add the path to the list  NOW YOU CAN DO THISTYPE python in the command prompt and voila you should be able to run on the command prompt
