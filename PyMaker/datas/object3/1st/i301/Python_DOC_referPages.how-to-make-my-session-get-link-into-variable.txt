My goal is to scrape multiple profile links and then scrape specific data on each of these profiles.Here is my code to get multiple profile links (it should work fine):Now here is my code to get the specific data on just one profile (it should work fine too):My question is : how can I automate my scripts? In other words: How can I merge these two scripts? The goal is to create a sort of variable that is going to be a different profile link every time. And then for each profile link to get the specific data and then put it into the csv file (a new row for each profile).
It is fairly very straight forward to do this. I instead of printing the profile links store them to  a list variable. Then loop through the list variable to scrap each link and then write to the csv file. Some pages do not have all the details so you have to handle those exceptions as well. In the code below I have marked them also as 'NA', following the convention used in your code. One other note for future is to consider using the python's inbuilt csv module for reading and writing csv files. Merged ScriptSample Output from khanscraptry1.csv
