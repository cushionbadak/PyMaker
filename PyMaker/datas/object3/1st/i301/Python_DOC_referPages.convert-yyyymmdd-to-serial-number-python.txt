How do I convert a list of dates that are in the form yyyymmdd to a serial number? For example, if I have this list of dates:How do I convert each date to a serial number? Im currently using the datetime toordinal() command, but each date is being rounded to the same serial number. How do I get the same dates with different times to be different numbers?The times in the list are the datetime.datetime numbers. I tried then doing:But am not getting serial numbers as floats.
datetime.toordinal() considers only the 'date' part of the datetime object, not the time. So does date.toordinal() - it only has a date part. The first 2 and last 2 elements in your list have datetimes on the same date but at different times, which .toordinal ignores. So, .toordinal will give you the same value for those same-dated datetimes.In general, the solution would be to calculate the delta between your dates and a pre-determined/fixed one. I'm using datetime.datetime(1, 1, 1), the earliest possible datetime, so all the deltas are positive:And if you prefer ints instead of floats, then use seconds instead of days:And to get back the original values in the 2nd example:
Let me know if my understanding is wrong, I tried following and gives distinct numbers for each value of the list.I modifiedt = ['1898-10-12 06:00','1898-10-12 12:00','1932-09-30 08:00','1932-09-30 00:00'] witht = [datetime.datetime(1898, 10, 12, 6, 0), datetime.datetime(1898, 10, 12, 12, 0), datetime.datetime(1932, 9, 30, 8, 0), datetime.datetime(1932, 9, 30, 0, 0)]As mentioned in comment it is list of datetime.datetime.I am considering total MilliSeconds from 1970-01-01 00:00:00 the given date to generate a number.So dates which are before above date give values in negative. But distinct values.output:
