I have written a short python script to search for urls with a http status code in a logfile. The script works as intended and counts how often an url is requested in combination with a certain http status code. The dictionary with the results is unsorted. Thats why i sorted the data afterwards using the values in the dictionary. This part of the script works as intended and i get a sorted list with the urls and the counter, The list looks like:I just want to make it better readable and print the list in rows.  I started with python only two weeks ago and i cant find a solution. I tried several solutions i found here on stackoverflow but nothing works. My current solution prints all urls in seperate rows but does not show the count. I cant use comma as a seperator because i got some url with commas in my logfile.  Im sorry for my bad english and the stupid question. Thank you in advance.
First if you're already importing from the collections library, why not import a Counter?
Replace your last for loop with the above.To explain: we unpack the url, count pairs in of sorted_d in the for loop, and then use the a f-string to print the url and count separated by a space.
There are many good tutorials on how to format strings in Python such as thisHere an example code how to print a dictionary. I set the width of the columns with the variables c1 and c2.The string function ljust() creates a string of the length passed as an argument where the content of the string is left justified.
