I was looking through the Python docs and found a function called process. I have only seen it in use in the documentation of other features but it itself is not documented, as far as I can tell.Here are some examples from the documentation of when it is used.From @typing.overload:From fileinput:And finally, from Match objectsI am specifically interested in the last usage. My question is this, what is this process function and where is the documentation for it?
In these cases, process is just an arbitrary name for an example placeholder function  used to demonstrate example uses of the things being documented. You will often see variables and functions like foo, process, bar, do_something. Generally, if it's a generic named function/variable that isn't the specific thing being documented and isn't defined elsewhere, it will be a placeholder.For example, the last case could be written, perhaps more clearly (and verbosely), like:
What is the process function ?It is a placeholder, it doesn't exist (unless you define it).It is the equivalent of saying # Your code goes here, but it indicates the target object (line, match ...) which will be used by the user.ExampleIt means, "this is how match work and should be used, do anything you want with the match object"
