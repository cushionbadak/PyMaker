You can use the isinstance function to check if a key has been transformed into a list:d becomes:

Let's append all possible key values from the string items in the list_data. Get the list of unique items. Now loop through the list_data and check if the first item of the ":" split string matched with the list a and if matches append to a temporary list and at last assign that temporary list as the value to the key of the item in the list a.Here is oneliner using dict comprehension and list comprehension simultaneously :Output should be :Here is the long and detailed version of the code :
