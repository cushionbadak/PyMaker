I want to concatenate the two string elements in a list of tuplesI have this:It's working but is there any easy way to do this? My real list has around 1000 items and I don't think a for loop is the most efficient way.Expected output:
Use a list comprehension, and for just two elements, I'd use tuple unpacking and concatenation:Another option is to use a formatted string literal:Both are reasonably fast:Concatenation wins out here.A list comprehension removes the need to look up the list object and its .append() method each time in a loop, see What is the advantage of a list comprehension over a for loop?Formatted string literals where introduced in Python 3.6, and are easily the fastest way of composing strings with interpolated elements (even though they didn't start out that way).I also tried out [itertools.starmap()] with [operator.add()] and [str.join()], but this doesn't appear to be competitive:It does improve with more elements; by 1 million elements, map(starmap(add, largelist)) is winning by a small margin (133ms vs 140ms for a list comprehension with concatenation).
