I ask for a value which is the id of the product.The thing I want is the price of the product with that id, the last number.Products code:Shopping code:These are the things IÂ´ve been trying but i get an error code: TypeError: 'int' object is not subscriptable.Last part is ok.            
you can get the nested item by simply adding an additional set of square brackets, so for 7 in the first nested list is producto[0][3]
You can grab the last element in a list by refering to it as the -1th element.
I assume that you need to print the price of the product based on the id. I assume , index 0 is id and index 3 is Price. you need to give the index of the price
If at all possible, it would be nice to see this type of structured data in a class or named tuple.That way not only do you gain the benefit of always knowing what you're accessing. But it's very simple to figure out how to access it.Consider the following code:It might look like more effort, but if you plan on making a large, even slightly complex program, using nested arrays and non-structured data you will find yourself constantly running into problems like the one your currently encountering.That said, the answer is:You went one level too deep into your nested array.
