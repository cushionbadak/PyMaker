I've been set a task to iteratively calculate the value of x of the given formula : x3 - 3x + 4 = 0** using trial and error.The code will first plug in -1.5 as its first guess and then work up or down from there to try and get the answer 0. Every time a number is plugged in the equation the code should output "Answer ## is too big/small"I've started the code but I'm a bit stuck as it only does it twice and then stops. I used a while loop but I don't think I've used it correctly or that it may be the wrong way to go about this problem. Any suggestions/snippets of code will be greatly appreciated.
Unclear exactly what you're looking for, but this should get you started:
You've confused the concepts of while and if.  You need both for ... well, for what I think you're trying to do, try the following outline.I think you can fill in the logic for each branch of the "if".Especially note that this will terminate only if you get an exact answer.  If you want to work in a little tolerance, you'll have to adjust the exit condition calculation != 0 to have a little "wiggle room".
I think you need to put everything inside a single while loop, where you check if your calculation matches the expected result, adjust the guess if not, break the loop if yes.Note that I do not compare calculation == 0 because as you choose a step of 0.1 for guess, it's unlikely that your calculation will be exactly 0. In other words, calculation == 0 will be always false and the loop will never stop. Hence I check that calculation is close enough to 0, using a tolerance value of 0.1 (same of the step used). In python 3.5 or later, you could use math.isclose from the math module to perform this same check.
