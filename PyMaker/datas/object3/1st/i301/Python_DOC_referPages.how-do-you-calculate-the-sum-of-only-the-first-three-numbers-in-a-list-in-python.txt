Eg: list = 1, 2, 3â€¦ 10I am trying to solve a question in my course in as simple a way as possible. Sorry if there is already an answer to this question. I couldn't find anything. 
Just use slicing:Here, you can easily change 3 to some other number.See:Understanding slice notationsum()
if a is the list the you can do:You can go through the sum() function of python.Moreover, a[:3] is a slicing operation. 
The sum function sums numbers in an iterable and is built into Python.Thus for your situation you can just slice the list and use it.result is 2.5+3+4=9.5
