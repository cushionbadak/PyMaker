I need help to use python code to find the sum of numbers between two integers that were inputted.I have included my code so far below but it doesn't seem to work.The question is below:Consider an algorithm that takes 2 integers and finds the sum of all the integers between them (including the two numbers).For example, the numbers 2 and 5 give a sum of 14.  2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 14
Read line by line and it will make sense :) Good luck
The easiest approach would be to use the built-in sum function over a range from low to high. Note the ranges exclude the upper barrier, so you'd have to increment it to include the inputted high value:A more performant approach (at least for large ranges) would probably be to use the formula for a sum of an arithmetic progression:
you can remove the for-loop entirely. just use Python built-in tools, for your target, use sum(range(num1,num2+1)), your check that num1>num2 or num1<num2 are correct, and please keep them in the code, but you have one unhandle case : when they are equal, and at that case you just return sum = num1.hope it helped
