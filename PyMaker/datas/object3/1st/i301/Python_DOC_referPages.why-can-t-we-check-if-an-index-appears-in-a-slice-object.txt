In basic use, a slice object represents a subset of the integer indices of a sequence.  Why can’t I test whether an index is a member of that subset with in?  It could be constant-time, analogously to the corresponding operation on a (Python 3) range object.
Because even basic slices support negative indexes, checking for containment requires knowing the length of the sequence.  You can supply that length with range:xrange in Python 2 does not support the slicing (or the constant-time containment check).
