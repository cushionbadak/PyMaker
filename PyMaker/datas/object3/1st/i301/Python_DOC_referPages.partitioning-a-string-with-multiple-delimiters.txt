I know partition() exists, but it only takes in one value, I'm trying to partition around various values:for example say I wanted to partition around symbols in a string:input: "function():"output: ["function", "(", ")", ":"] I can't seem to find an efficient way to handle variable amounts of partitioning.
You can use re.findall with an alternation pattern that matches either a word or a non-space character:so that given s = 'function():', this returns:
You could re.split by \W and use (...) to keep the delimiters, then remove empty parts.Note that this will split after every special character; if you want to keep certain groups of special characters together, e.g. == or <=, you should test those first with |.
