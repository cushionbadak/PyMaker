It's a very specific question for a very specific situation.My function is supposed to return None and I don't know the name of the variable that I need to change before hand. All I know is that the function is supposed to change the variable.Sorry if this is too similar to another article on the website, I've been browsing for 2 hours and couldn't find an answer to my problem, maybe I wasn't using the right search terms.
Provided you are dealing with a list object (which is mutable):You don't need to return None since by default a function will return None.
I found a way to do it, it was easier than I toughtThis will add an element to both tuples and lists, this is all I needed to be able to doEdit: I don't know why this worked for me, but other people seem to get errors when doing this
