I have a problem with pyinstaller; i have python file (Main_w_PyQt5.py), which uses three pictures (kepler.png; keplerII.png and kepler.ico). I used pyinstaller with these arguments:pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole --icon='kepler.ico' --add-data='kepler.png;.' --add-data='keplerII.png;.' --clean Main_w_PyQt5.pyThe .exe file works great, until i want to close it by calling exit function, window saying "Fail to execute Main_w_PyQt5.py" pops out.What's the problem with it?
Making an answer from my (confirmed) comment:Don't use exit. It's intended solely for use in the interactive interpreter (it's not even guaranteed to exist since the site module is optional), per the docs:[These functions/constants] are useful for the interactive interpreter shell and should not be used in programs.Use sys.exit, which is the correct way to signal your intent to exit a script.People get lazy and use exit because it happens to work in most simple script environments, but PyInstaller is not simple in the least, and using it is causing you problems.
