Here is my code:So results will have the values of Fields ,I need to write the data with Fields as top row (only once) then the values in results into CSV file.I am not sure i can open the file in the function because threads will open the file multiple times simultaneously.Note: i know threading isn't desirable when crawling but i am just testing  
I think you should consider using some kind of queuing or thread pools. Thread pools are really useful if you want create several threads (not 4, I think you would use more than 4 threads, but 4 threads at a time).An example of Queue technique can be found here.Of course, you can label the files with its threads id, for example: "results_1.txt",  "results_2.txt" and so on. Then, you can merge them after all threads finished.You can use the basic concepts of Lock, Monitor, and so on, however I am not the biggest fan of them. An example of locking can be found here
