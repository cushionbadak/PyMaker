I was just wondering, is there any way to convert IUPAC or common molecular names to SMILES? I want to do this without having to manually convert every single one utilizing online systems. Any input would be much appreciated!For background, I am currently working with python and RDkit, so I wasn't sure if RDkit could do this and I was just unaware. My current data is in the csv format. Thank you!
RDKit cant convert names to SMILES.Chemical Identifier Resolver can convert names and other identifiers (like CAS No) and has an API so you can convert with a script.Output
OPSIN (https://opsin.ch.cam.ac.uk/) is another solution for name2structure conversion.It can be used by installing the cli, or via https://github.com/gorgitko/molminer(OPSIN is used by the RDKit KNIME nodes also)
