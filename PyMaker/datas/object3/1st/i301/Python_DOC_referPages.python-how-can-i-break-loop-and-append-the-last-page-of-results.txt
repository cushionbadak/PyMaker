I've made a scraper that works except that it wont scrape the last page. The url doesn't change, so I set it up to run on an infinite loop.Ive set the loop up to break when it cant click on the next button anymore( on the last page), and it seems that the script is ending before it appends the last past of results.How can I append the last page the list?
