Say I have a list of X,Y points. I then add a new point, how would i find out which old point the newly added point is closest too? I've seen a few similar questions but couldn't get any to work. I'm looking for something like:I've tried scipy and KDTree and kept getting various errors. Brand new to Python, any help would be greatly appreciated.
The easiest and quickest way would be for you to define a function to measure the distance to every point and return the closest one. For example (assuming euclidean distance):
There's probably a much more concise way but this answers it.
Do you have NumPy available? If so:That is, the point pnts[2] is closest to new_pnt. The distance is given by the square root of the sum of differences between a pair of x and y coordinates. Here I leave out the square root, as the point with the smallest squared distance is also the point with the smallest distance.
