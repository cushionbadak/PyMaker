I'm trying to create a program where the program asks the user for a file. The program then should then print the contents of the file and then count the lines. The issue when I run the program is I get this error: for count in range[1, f2_l + 1]:TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str. Isn't the count supposed to be an integer and not a string? I'd like to use keep using while f2_l != '':.
Read the docs for file manipulation and loops. i is the index in the line list. readlines() return the list of lines, each one is an str
I suggest this:It is better to do the following:Open files with the with statement, which ensures that the files you open will be closed;Use the built-in function enumerate rather than a separate for loop for the indexInstead of concatenating strings with +, use the format method
You could use Python's built-in enunerate() function as shown below to count the lines semi-automatically as they're printed:
You can use this for while loop:
