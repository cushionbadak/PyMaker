I have a folder with several CSV files. These files all contain the box drawing double vertical and horizontal as the delimiter. I am trying to import all these files into python, change that delimiter to a pipe, and then save the new files into another location. The code I currently have runs without any errors but doesn't actually do anything. Any suggestions?Here is a picture of sample data:
Instead of directly replacing occurrences with the new character (which may replace escaped occurrences of the character as well), we can just use built-in functionality in the csv library to read the file for us, and then write it againAdapted from the docs
or, skip the python, and use sed from your terminal:$ sed -i 's/â•¬/|/g' *.csvAssuming the original delimiter doesn't appear in any escaped strings, this should be slightly faster than using the regular csv module. Panada seems to do some filesystem voodoo when reading CSVs, so I wouldn't be too surprised if it is just as fast. sed will almost certainly beat them both by far.
