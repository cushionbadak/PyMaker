Unfortunately I was not able to be more specific with my title, but an example should make my problem clear. I have two lists f and a and if f[i] is equal to f[i-1]. I would like to have a new entry in f which is equal to f[i] and f[i-1] (obviously) and overwrites both of them. In a I would like to have to a_new = a[i] + a[i-1] replacing a[i] and a[i-1].My desired output is:I believe that some sort of list comprehension would be the optimal approach, but I couldn't figure it out yet. I doesn't need to be a list comprehension though, I am happy as long as there is some solution.
You can zip the lists together, use groupby to group the pairs by the f values, then sum the a values for each group.  Then you just need to unzip them back into separate listsTo answer your question in the comments, you can change the line to call some function other than sum:
For first array case:
