I have a python list in which i need to do takewhile. I am getting output as ['fd', 'dfdf', 'keyword', 'ssd', 'sdsd'] but I need to get ['3=', 'fd', 'dfdf', 'keyword', 'ssd', 'sdsd', ';']
the problem with takewhile is to get the element that satisfies the condition.you could try this (if i understood your question correctly)this creates an iterator it (so that the items that have been checked against the fist condition will not be checked again). the rest should be pretty straightforward.this answer might also be helpful.
