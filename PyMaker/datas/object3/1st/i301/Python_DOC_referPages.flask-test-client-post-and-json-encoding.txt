I am writing test cases for JSON endpoints in a Flask app.Just to understand what's happening, do both ways of sending a POST message in the code above make sense? In particular, am I double-JSON encoding in the first case?Or, briefly, what is the difference between test_ham and test_eggs? Is there any?
You are not double-encoding JSON, no, because data doesn't encode anything to JSON. test_ham posts JSON, test_eggs does not.Starting from Flask 1.0, the Flask test client supports posting JSON directly, via the json keyword argument, use it to cut down on boilerplate code here:See the Testing JSON APIs section of the Flask Testing documentation chapter:Passing the json argument in the test client methods sets the request data to the JSON-serialized object and sets the content type to application/json.Passing a dictionary to data produces a different kind of request, a application/x-www-form-urlencoded encoded request just like a <form method="POST" ...> form would produce from your browser, and the foo and bar values would have to be accessed via the request.form object. Do not use it when posting JSON is needed.
