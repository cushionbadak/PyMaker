I have a small if statement that is checking if the variable is either of 2 values. Through testing I can see that all 3 of the following would work:But, which data structure should be used here?
I'd argue that over two elements, you won't really notice a speed difference, so I'd pick the smallest of the structures, tupleTo show a size difference between the different structures:EditAs @Torxed points out, there is a trade-off between memory usage and speed. For smaller groups of elements (1-10), a tuple or list is fine, but let's try with a group of 100 elements:You get a massive boost from dict/set in this case, and that's when you would forego the memory overhead in favor of speed
First of all, the last option is not a dictionary, it's a set. Think of it as a KeyValuePair<> if you come from a C# background.Secondly. A tuple is quite faster when being assigned as it is immutable and can be compacted easily.
