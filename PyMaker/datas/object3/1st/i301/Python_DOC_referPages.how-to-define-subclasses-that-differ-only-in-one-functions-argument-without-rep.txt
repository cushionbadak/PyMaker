I'm creating classes in python like this:This happens for many more classes. It seems long and unnecessarily repetitive, since do_something is not the only thing that happens within each class. Since 'x' and 'y' are so similar, is there any way I can create them both at once, or do anything else to stop the repetition?
Since you're already using multiple inheritance, you could "do something" like this if you don't want (or can't) modify the two existing classes you're already using as base classes. It's based on the suggestion @Charles Duffy posted in a comment, and relies on the special attribute that classes have named , not suprisingly, __name__.Note I've also modified your code to follow PEP 8 - Style Guide for Python Code's naming conventions.
Put in another_class and they can both inherit it so that you don't have to replicate the code.
