I have a string like this '6\' 3" ( 190 cm )' and I would like to extract '190 cm' only using regular expressions. I can't find the appropriate pattern to look for.I have tried but it returns    ["'", '"', 'c', 'm']Thanks for helping!
too many unrequired and harmful symbols in your expression.Using surrounding [] made findall match individual characters, which explains the output you're getting.This needs a full rethink: escape the parentheses, use \d+ to match one or more digits, and explicit cm and spaces.create a group to match only digits+unit, use search to find the group and display it.
where string is:
With regular expressions:Without regular expressions: 
You could  use a capturing group which will be returned by findall:That will match:\(\s* match ( and 0+ times a whitespace char( Capturing group[0-9]+\s*[a-z]+ Match 1+ a digit, 0+ times a whitespace char and 1+ times a-z (or use cm instead of [a-z]+ if you want to match that literally)) Close capturing group\s*\) Match 0+ times a whitespace charregex101 demo | Python demoFor example:
