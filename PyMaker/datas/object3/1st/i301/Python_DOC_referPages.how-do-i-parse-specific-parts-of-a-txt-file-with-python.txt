Natural Text
I have a .txt with data I need to parse to an object that should then be put in a list. The .txt file i huge but here's a sample:It's all in one chunk, separated with semicolons. The sample consists of two objects with id, time_start and time_endI have created a class that looks like this:The main part looks like this, with opening the file and trying to parse it:So, the problem is, I don't know how to access the specific parts of the .txt file, separated by the semicolons. Obviously "item_first_semicolon_part" won't work. But how do I access the first part of the text file so that I do get the id number and nothing else (and then the start and end times)? Is there an elegant way of doing this or simply a matter of using if ; do this.Thanks in advance. I have looked through similar questions, but don't think there was anything that could help me through this.UPDATEI got a great answer from @Alderven that worked, but I just noticed that the parsed object cuts away a part of the id. I simplified the id for the sake of this question. Full id (with the rest of the data) looks like this: 57646786307395936680161735716561753784;3/13/2015 8:00:00 AM;3/13/2015 1:00:00 PM;C5CAACCED1B9F361761853A7F995A1D4F16C8BCD0A5001A2DF3EC0D7CD539A09AA7DDA1A5278FA07554B0260880882CCBB30B3399C3C0974C587A8233E5788A81DEAD2921123CB12D13CC11318C38B9679D868145315F1BE24333202D12B3787E51D1BBF97BB25482B0EF7E97DE637BAACEDD74E89E2AC52139EE9369F1D64A6259939411636051033617118653993975778241;1/3/2015 12:30:00 PM;1/3/2015 1:00:00 PM; The part: C5CAACCED1B9F361761853A7F995A1D4F16C8BCD0A5001A2DF3EC0D7CD539A09AA7DDA1A5278FA07554B0260880882CCBB30B3399C3C0974C587A8233E5788A81DEAD2921123CB12D13CC11318C38B9679D868145315F1BE24333202D12B3787E51D1BBF97BB25482B0EF7E97DE637BAACEDD74E89E2AC52139EE9369F1D64A6 seems to be missing. Perhaps because it is on the same row as the first object. The last part of the id is still there:259939411636051033617118653993975778241 How do I get the full id?
Actually it is CSV format with ; delimiter. Basically:If you want to parse data to your Employee class, then:
you can split a row using item.split(';') to get turn it into a list.you could also parse it as a csv into an array using csvreader or pandas, but that is a separate approach.if the order is right you can unpack that directly into an employee object using tmpemployee = Employee(*item.split(';'))
You need to split the line by ; using str.split:You can shorten this by removing the last ; from the line and assigning multiple values at once:
You can use the csv.reader method with ; as the delimiter, but slice only the first 3 items of each row since you have a redundant trailing ; on each line of the input:
