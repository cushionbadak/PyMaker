Initial CSV file has these columns and rowsenroll_code,student_id10030,5500010030,5580410250,5580410510,55000After reading the csv file the data list becomes a list of sublistsOutput of the above code gives this as data.The result I need is10030: 210250: 110510: 1How do I convert it into a dictionary and have the key 10030 represent and count both student_idWhen I do:It only gives output: {'enroll_code': 'student_id'}What I need is a way for python to count of number of occurences on the enroll_code, lets say if there were a thausand entries in the CSV file and enroll_code and student_id were repeated throughout the CSV file, how do I code it to get the required result.Basically I want to code it in base python what the Code below would yield
the most straightforward way that comes to mind is simply going over your items and "counting" them into a dictionaryassuming you already didyou can then do:we are going over your data item by item, skipping the header (thats why we have the data[1:] part), checking if the item is in the dictionary and if it isnt we add it with the count of 1, otherwise we increment the current count
You can use collections.defaultdictEx:Output:
If you don't want to use any external library, you can achieve the desired result using .get:output:{'10030': 2, '10250': 1, '10510': 1}.get returns the value of key (x[0]) if the key is in the dictionary, otherwise returns 0. Then we sum 1 to this value (x[0]'s value or 0) and assign the new value to the same key.Here's a link to the official documentation on .get and other dictionary's methods
This would work:
