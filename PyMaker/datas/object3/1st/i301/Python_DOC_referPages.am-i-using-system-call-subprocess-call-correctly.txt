This code fails when it runs:The program has these errors when it runs:I have ran this code multiple times with other ways, changing quotes and whatnot. I am fairly new to system calls and utilizing an HPC allocation database. I am stuck and if anyone can help me with resolving this issue that would be very helpful.Thank you!
When possible, pass a list containing your command name and its arguments.This avoids the need to even know how the shell will process a command line.
When I first started using some of the subprocess methods I ran into some of the same issues.Try running your code like this:OUTPUT:sudo mam-list-usagerecords -s 2010-04-10 00:00:00-e2010-04-11 00:00:00 --format csv --fullclass 'str'['sudo', 'mam-list-usagerecords', '-s', '2010-04-10', '00:00:00-e2010-04-11', '00:00:00', '--format', 'csv', '--full'](Command output redacted.)When the kwarg shell is set to False which is the default, the command may have to be a collection which is what shlex.split does.args should be a sequence of program arguments or else a single string. By default, the program to execute is the first item in args if args is a sequence. If args is a string, the interpretation is platform-dependent and described below. See the shell and executable arguments for additional differences from the default behavior. Unless otherwise stated, it is recommended to pass args as a sequence.Popen constructorThis issue used to confuse me to no end until I found this in the docs.
