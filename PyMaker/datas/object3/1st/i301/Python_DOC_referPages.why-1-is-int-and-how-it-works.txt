This question already has an answer here:How to create a tuple with only one element                    3 answers                In Python 3.6, x = (1)and type of x is int, it's same as x = 1.So what's the purpose of ()? Why is it not a tuple?
From the docs:A special problem is the construction of tuples containing 0 or 1  items: the syntax has some extra quirks to accommodate these. Empty  tuples are constructed by an empty pair of parentheses; a tuple with  one item is constructed by following a value with a comma (it is not  sufficient to enclose a single value in parentheses).What defines a tuple is not the brackets, it's the commas, so (1, 2, 3) is a tuple, but it's not because of the brackets, it's because of the commas which means just using 1, 2, 3 would work the same. A tuple with no elements is represented with empty brackets (e.g. ()). A tuple with one element is represented with a value, followed by a comma (e.g. 1,).
