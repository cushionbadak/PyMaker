There is a dataframe like the following, and it has one unclean column 'id' which it sholud be numeric columnIs there a concise way to remove the rows because tt and de are not numeric valuesto make the dataframe clean?
You could use standard  method of strings isnumeric and apply it to each value in your id column:Or if you want to use id as index you could do:Edit. Add timingsAlthough case with pd.to_numeric is not using apply method it is almost two times slower than with applying np.isnumeric for str columns. Also I add option with using pandas str.isnumeric which is less typing and still faster then using pd.to_numeric. But pd.to_numeric is more general because it could work with any data types (not only strings).
Using pd.to_numeric
Given that df is your dataframe, What it does is passing each value in the id column to the isinstance function and checks if it's an int. Then it returns a boolean array, and finally returning only the rows where there is True.If you also need to account for float values, another option is:Note that either way is not inplace, so you will need to reassign it to your original df, or create a new one:
