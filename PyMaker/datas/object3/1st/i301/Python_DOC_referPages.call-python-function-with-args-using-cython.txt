I use Cython to use Python functions inside C code. I need to call Python funcs with arguments from C, but compilers says I need use PyObject, when i'm calling Python function. How I must do this if I need to pass an integer to Python function for example? I'm doing something like this.start_app is a function in python which take PyObject argument, how i can initialize PyObject to use it inside python? Cause now, when i try to print(a) inside python, a have Segfault
As I understand your question you have a Cython module called "hello" with cdef public functions so that you can call the functions from C:You want to know how to pass arg. You have two options:Define the type of arg to be a C type (in Cython):This is probably the easiest solution - you can just pass a C int.Create a Python integer in C:Note that I've assumed that start_app returns void. If it returns a Python object (which it does by default unless you tell it otherwise) you must check that PyObject* against NULL (it's NULL if there's an error) and then handle the reference counting of that PyObject* (DECREF it when you're done with it)
