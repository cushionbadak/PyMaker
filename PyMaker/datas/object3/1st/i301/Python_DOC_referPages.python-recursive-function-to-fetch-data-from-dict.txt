I have created a recursive function to fetch the data from a dictionary.The dictionary consists of keys and each key has a list of keys and it goes on. So I need to fetch the flatten list of keys when I give a key input.My Dict : My function :when i call get_data("p") it returns But the expected output is : Thanks in advance for any help ...
The problem is in these lines -Here you are modifying items as you're iterating over it. So in the last iteration, your items ends up getting with the same key multiple times; you can add a logging statement to see which key is being used to call get_data.You want to obtain all the new items separately, and then update items after the iteration is done -
Here's a code which will help you achieve what you want. The common approach to get a unique collection of items is to use a set. Sets are unordered collections of distinct objects. To create a set from any iterable, you can simply pass it to the built-in set() function. If you later need a real list again, you can similarly pass the set to the list() function.OUTPUT:Update: an order-preserving approach is two lines:replace the return line of the given solution with the return line of the Update: Solution and you will get an ordered list in return.OUTPUT:Use list() function with the achieved output to get the following list:
