When I dynamically set the attribute of a class:The type of the age attribute will be of type int, but MyPy cannot follow that.Is there a way I can make MyPy understand?Django has it implemented:How does Django do this?
Since you define the field on the class, the practical approach is to type-hint the field. Note that you must tell mypy to not check the line itself, though.This is the least change, but rather inflexible.You can create automatically typed, generic hints by using a helper function with a fake signature:This is how the attrib library provides its legacy hints. This style allows to hide all the magic/hacks of the annotations.Since a metaclass can inspect annotations, there is no need to store the type on the Field. You can use a bare Field for metadata, and an annotation for the type:This is how the attrib provides its Python 3.6+ attributes. It is both generic and conforming to annotation style. Note that this can also be used with a regular baseclass instead of a metaclass.
Patrick Haugh is right, I am trying to solve this the wrong way. Descriptors are the way to go:MyPy can fully understand this. Thanks!
