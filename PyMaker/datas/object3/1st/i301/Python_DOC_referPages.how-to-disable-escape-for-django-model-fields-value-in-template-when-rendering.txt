I am working on one of my colleague's Django (Django 2.1.4) projects. I spent a couple of days to try to figure out how to disable auto escape for Form field's value when rendering it manually in a template.  {% autoescape off %} and {{form1.LastName | safe }} all don't work.Here are some relative codes. Form.pyviews.py    appinfo.htmlSome tests here:LastName's value is &#350;hahatest1: add {% autoescape off %} at the top of the template and {% endautoescape %} at the bottomresult1: {{form1.LastName.value}} displays correctly -- Åžhaha, but input textbox shows &#350;haharun result -- html pagetest2: delete autoescape tag and add safe filterresult2: get the same result, looks like that safe filter only worked on form.field.valueAny suggestion?Thank you. 
Add the answer to here in case someone gets the same problem. Create a function to unescape all HTML entities. and then
