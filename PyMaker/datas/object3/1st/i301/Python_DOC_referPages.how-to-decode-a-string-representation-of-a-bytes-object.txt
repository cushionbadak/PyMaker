Natural Text
I have a string which includes encoded bytes inside it:I want to decode it, but I can't since it has become a string. Therefore I want to ask whether there is any way I can convert it into Here str2 is a bytes object which I can decode easily using to get the final result:
A simple way is to assume that all  the characters of the initial strings are in the [0,256) range and map to the same Unicode value, which means that it is a Latin1 encoded string.The conversion is then trivial:
You could use ast.literal_eval:
Based on the SyntaxError mentioned in your comments, you may be having a testing issue when attempting to print due to the fact that stdout is set to ascii in your console (and you may also find that your console does not support some of the characters you may be trying to print). You can try something like the following to set sys.stdout to utf-8 and see what your console will print (just using string slice and encode below to get bytes rather than the ast.literal_eval approach that has already been suggested):
Finally I have found an answer where i use a function to cast a string to bytes without encoding.Given stringstr1 = "b'Output file \xeb\xac\xb8\xed\x95\xad\xeb\xb6\x84\xec\x84\x9d.xlsx Created'"now i take only actual encoded text inside of it str1[2:-1]and pass this to the function which convert the string to bytes without encoding its valuesSo, calling the function would convert it to bytes which then is decodedrawbytes(str1[2:-1]).decode('utf-8')will give the correct output'Output file 문항분석.xlsx Created'
