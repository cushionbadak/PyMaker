I have to calculate different equation (we assume 3 reactions). Each one uses a different variable and I have to read this variable from a file list.txt.So my idea is:My list is:but this code prints first line two times, the second line three times and so on. Instead, I want that k1, k2 and k3 as a variable in order to obtain in this case:How can I do to obtain this result?
it's clear here that if you read a file with readlines(), it will return a string. So, when you want to do a math calculation, you need to convert it to integer first
when you use the * operator on strings, you multiple them.for example:  "a"*3 will be "aaa"and when you use it on numbers you perform the math operation.for example: 3*6=18each line is string, so you need to cast the line to int:  int(line).also, you should consider use the map function.it will make your life easier.map perform given function on every item in the list.for example:it takes every item in the list, cast it to int, and multiply it by 3.
