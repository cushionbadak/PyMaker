So I have a class that defines characters and its attributes and it goes like this:and when I create an instance as this:it works perfectly. But what I´m trying to create is a way of creating it with key values, like this:So i tried to write the __init__ like this, using **kwargs:It says:What am I doing wrong? I´m really new to programming so I can´t figure it out.
kwargs is just a mapping; it doesn't magically create local variables for your function. You need to index the python dictionary with the desired key.A dataclass simplifies this:This generates your original __init__ automatically.If you need to do additional work in __init__ after adding the dataclass decorator you can define __post_init__ which a dataclass will call after __init__.
You do not need to define your method with **kwargs to support passing arguments by keyword. Your original version of __init__ already supports the character(health=150, dodge=5, damage=40, critAdd=1.5) syntax you want to use. Your original version is better than using **kwargs, because it ensures that exactly the right parameters were passed, rejecting things like helth=150 typos.
You should use get(), for example:
