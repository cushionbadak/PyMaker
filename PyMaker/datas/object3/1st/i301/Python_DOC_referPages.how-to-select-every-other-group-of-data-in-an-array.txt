I have a data set of ~100,000 data points, and I need to be able to select every other group of 10,000 data points and append them into a new list (so I will end up with a data set of data points 0-10000, 20,000-30,000, 40,000-50,000 etc). I cannot separate the data by simply thresholding the values themselves, I need to separate by index.I think I need to write a loop which can select in order the first 10,000 data points, check to see if the iteration number is odd or even, and if odd, append to the new list, then repeat the loop, but since the next iteration is an even number, the second 10,000 data points get ignored, and so on until the end. I understand the logic and have a vague idea of what to do but I am a chemist, not a programmer, and I don't know enough Python syntax to even begin googling to try and find out which commands I need. I don't know how to call each set of ten thousand data points in succession and I don't know how to tell Python to count iterations, let alone ignore every even one! 
There are more sophisticated ways to do this using list comprehension, etc., but here is a way to do this that might be easiest to understand:Assuming your data is in an array data.
How about trying this on a smaller list and then extending it to your larger list? output
