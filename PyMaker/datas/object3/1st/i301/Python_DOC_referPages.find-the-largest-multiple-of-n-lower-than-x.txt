What would be the more pythonic way to find the largest number multiple of n but lower than an upperbound x?Practical example:48 * 54 = 2592 is the nearest.I would do a for loop till I don't go over x. What are nicer alternatives?
The simplest way is probably using //:If the number has to be strictly less than x, use x - 1 instead:The expression x // n is the floor division of x by n, discarding any remainder.
You could use the modulo operationIf the upper bound has to be strictly lower than x use
This works too:
The most pythonic way I could think of would be for either python 2 or 3:
