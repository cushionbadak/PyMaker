Imagine I have GUI class whose main function is to handle the graphical presentation of the program, but that also stores information and links different operations. So for example something like this:Which would be the proper approach here? I see that if you pass along the whole MainWindow class, the new instance of ObjectClassA would have basically access to all the information stored in the MainWindow. But on the other hand, if I only pass along every variable individually, I can end up passing on a long list of things which appears to be cumbersome. Or is it better to simply refer to the instance of the MainWindow?I already found this similar question although I am not quite sure how the answer applies to my question.
The second way ObjectClassB is better because it respects object encapsulation.In order to decrease the number of arguments, you can use dictionaries, like this example.
