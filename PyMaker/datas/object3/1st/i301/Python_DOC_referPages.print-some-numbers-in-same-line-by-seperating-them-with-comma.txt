I want to print number like "Factors of (input_number) are " 1,2,5,10,50but is printing with an extra comma like this:         1,2,3,4,5,
You can try this:
If you want to print the elements of an iterable with a given separator, you should send that iterable to print and unpack it, and use the sep argument, rather than printing each element separately with the end argument (which, as you saw, puts the given string at the "end" of each element, including the last one).
In Python, the end keyword argument to print will specify what should be printed after the string you pass in as the first positional argument. So after each element you print, you're telling Python to print a comma (, character) and that's exactly what it is doing.One way you could do achieve this is by explicitly not setting the end keyword argument for the last item in the array using array enumeration, like so:Another way you could accomplish this would be to convert your array into strings then use the .join() method, which concatenates the elements of an iterable with a "glue" string.It may be helpful to note that casting to str should not affect the way non-strings are printed to STDOUT because they would implicitly be cast to strings when printing. For the second method, it may be helpful to reference the Python documentation for map.
