I need help with this as I am a beginner:Given the list of x,y pointsI want to create a new list with points that are not close to each other.Example (788, 117), (788, 118) are close to each other.This the function i believe will help to find euclidian distance:Thank you in advanceUpdate:this is what I tried out and it did not work how I would like:Result:with greater lists containing no duplicate points, it seems to become more of a challengeThe list is constantly being updated, that's why I have a while loopWhat am I doing wrong hereUpdate:
You can use itertools.combinations to find all possible point pairs and a list comprehension to eliminate the pairs that are too close. For example:
To make this as efficient as possible, you should short circuit the combination generation using a set of points that are known to be excluded as you go through them. You could also use the square of the distance as a criteria so that you avoid square root calculations.In you sample list of points, I noticed that you have a lot of duplications. This means that every point that is repeated will be excluded because it is at a distance of zero from another point. Note that this is an issue with both your data and and your algorithm.  Your algorithm will check the distance between each point and itself (resulting in zero) so all points will be excluded no matter what.  Your second for-loop only needs to match j points that are after the i point in the list and should exclude both i and j if they are too close to each other. Assuming that your requirement is for distinct points that are not close to each other, here's an example of how you could do it:
