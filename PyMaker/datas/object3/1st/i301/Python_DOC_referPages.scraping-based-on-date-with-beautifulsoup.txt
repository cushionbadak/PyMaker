I am very new to python programming. Emphasis on VERY. I am trying to set up my first web scraping project (for news article curation).I have already managed to scrape the news site and to create a loop that organizes the results how I want them. My issue is that I plan on scraping the web page once a day, but only for the publications that were published that same day. I don't want all of them because that would mean I would get a lot of repetition.I know that it has something to do with converting the date via the datetime module (with an if statement), but for the life of me I couldn't find a way to make it work.In the html, this is an example of how the date is displayed:This is what I have so far:
Your time tag has a datetime attribute that is giving a much better datetime representation than the text. Use that.You can use the dateutil package to parse the string. Following is a sample code:
The date is represented in the ISO 8601 format. Extract the datetime attribute as a string from the time tag. If you are using python 3.7 you can use the datetime.datetime.fromisoformat method to convert this to a datetime object and then do the comparison. If you are using an older version of python I think the easiest approach would be see this question and the first answer provided.
