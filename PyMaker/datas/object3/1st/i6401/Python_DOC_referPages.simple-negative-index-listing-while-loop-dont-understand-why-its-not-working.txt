I'm working on a simple negative index listing while loop for class and I don't understand why it's not working correctly.Instead of printing:4321I'm getting:1432Any help pointing out what I'm doing wrong would be greatly appreciated.Thank you in advance!Professor's exercise:My coding:Professor's test:
You just have a couple of off-by-one errors. And as I said in the comment, -0 == 0, so a[-0] is the same as a[0], i.e., it accesses the first item in a.Here's a repaired version of your code.outputAs Davis Herring mentions, it's more Pythonic to iterate directly over the items in a sequence rather than doing it indirectly via indexing. OTOH, it's important to do exercises like this that practice using indices to develop your understanding of how indices work.
Using a for loop with enumerate():enumerate() is used to generate the index starting from 1. We don't need the values from the list that enumerate() returns, so they are bound to _ to indicate that we don't care. Using enumerate() is a little cleaner than using for i in range(1, len(my_list)+1):, although it will execute a little slower.With a while loop you can start your counter from 1 instead of 0:
-0 is still 0.  As such, backward indexing is 1-based (or -1-based, perhaps).  You can write directlyor indirectly (with fewer -1s)or, much more Pythonically when it's not homework,
