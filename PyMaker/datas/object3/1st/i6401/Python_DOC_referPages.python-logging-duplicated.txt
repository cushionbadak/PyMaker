I have Four files, Main.pyA.pyB.pyLog_System i am using main to use functions of A.py and B.py, so now i have to log all the information when ever i call them.so i wrote a script called log_system to create log handler for each script file such as A.py, B.py so if i want to use logging in script file A.py, i would write these line: but my log files it is repeating the log many times.... so what should i do ??solution this is how i changed my log_system code, so i just emptied the Handler list if i had created an log handler already so that it does not create duplicate records.
Every time fetch_logger is called it adds a new FileHandler to the logger.  Each FileHandler writes to the log file, resulting in the repeating output in the file.One solution is to call the logger's hasHandlers method.  This will return True if any handlers have been configured on the logger, and then you can delete them.
