I'm trying to create a simple histogram in the shell to give a dictionary with keys which have their values as the probability of the key being chosen if the keys were selected at random. I used formatting which for some reason didn't work. I also did the explicit conversion as usual by using the str() function but i still got the same error. I used a for loop and for some reason it worked when the probability of the key was 1 but it gave an error afterwards.This is the debug window:This part worked fine but then the problem surfacedAfter this it seemed to work but still showed error
