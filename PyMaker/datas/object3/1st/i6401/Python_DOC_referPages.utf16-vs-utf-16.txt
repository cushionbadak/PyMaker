Which line from below is correct? I do know all these available encodings? 
Interesting question. I did some searching and it looks like you can find all of the options available here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/codecs.html#standard-encodingsso in this case, neither! It should be utf_16. Still, with my experience with python, I wouldn't be surprised if they sanitized the arg you provided so that it would work regardless. And from the link, it looks like they do! so utf-16 should be a valid alias.Notice that spelling alternatives that only differ in case or use a hyphen instead of an underscore are also valid aliases; therefore, e.g. 'utf-8' is a valid alias for the 'utf_8' codecEdit - that is definitely the correct link.https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/functions.html#open which is the documentation for open links you to it in this sentence See the codecs module for the list of supported encodings.
