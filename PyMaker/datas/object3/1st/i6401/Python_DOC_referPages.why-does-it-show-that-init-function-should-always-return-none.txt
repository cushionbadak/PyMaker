Excepton:
__init__ is called to set up the new, blank instance created. It always must return None. From the object.__init__() documentation:Because __new__() and __init__() work together in constructing objects (__new__() to create it, and __init__() to customize it), no non-None value may be returned by __init__(); doing so will cause a TypeError to be raised at runtime.Returning None is the default for a function without a return statement; remove the return (h) from __init__:You can access the email attribute after creating the instance, there is no need to return it.
