This is a function i created:I'm trying to write a unit testing for my function, the unit test should assert the function correctness when two or three parameters are provided.This is my frame:I really have little sense of what the unit testing is doing, but not quite get it.

We checked that the return type is string as we expected using assertIsInstance and we checked the output for two and three parameters using assertEqual. You may play with this using a set of valid and invalid tests with assertEqual. The official documentation has a brief description about unittest in this official doc Unit testing framework.
Typically, you'd do sth along the lines of:There is plenty of documentation and examples out there.
