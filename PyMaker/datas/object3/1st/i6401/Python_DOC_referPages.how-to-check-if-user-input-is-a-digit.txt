I am making an educational math game and want to make sure that all user inputs are valid i.e. a number.When they enter a letter or symbol a message needs to be displayed saying "Invalid, please try again." Can anybody help me?This is my code:
what you're looking for is the isdigit method on the string class.i.e. https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.isdigitHere is a way you could request a valid number again if the user did not input a valid number:Hi Jane, the function will essentially keep asking for an input until the user enters a number. All you need to do is get your ans variable with the function, and you're guaranteed it will be a number. I put it all together for you below. I actually had a couple errors in my code (sorry!) that I fixed. Your working code will look like this:Please lmk if you have any questions!
isdigit() checks if the string consists of digits. You can find it here in the Python Docs. Examples:This returns as True.This returns as False.
