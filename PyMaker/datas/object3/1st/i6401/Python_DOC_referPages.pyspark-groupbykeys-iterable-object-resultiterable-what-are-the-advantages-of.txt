I'm not finding anything helpful on line regards to the result structure after the groupByKey transformation.  What can I do with the ResultIterable object after groupByKey?  I would have expected a list returned with the key.  I can convert it to a list but not sure if I'm missing something
what are the advantages of this?SerializationWhat can I do with the "ResultIterable" The same things you can do  with any Iterable object:specifically you can assume that it implements __iter__ dunder method - it means it can be iterated or converted to another collection and can be used whenever iterable objects is expected.I would have expected a list list requires specific implementation of the collection. Iterable allows other options, including larger than memory collections, and specific implementation  can be change whenever needed.
