I use socket.recvmsg() to get the data and the sender's IP address of a UDP broadcast message. This works fine on Linux, but this method is not available on Windows (Python 3.3). How can I obtain the sender's IP address?
I noticed in the Python documentation that you linked, that recvfrom returns similar values to what your code is looking for (bytes, address) and is compatible with Windowssocket.recvfrom(bufsize[, flags])
