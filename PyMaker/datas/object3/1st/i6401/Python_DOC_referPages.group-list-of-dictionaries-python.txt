How can i group similar keys of a dictionary in a list if i haveand i want it to output like thisHere is the code i have tried but it gives me double of the key probably because of the loop
I think yo dou not fully understand the idea of a defaultdict. A defaultdict will produce a new object if none exists at lookup.So you can simply use:which yields:(pprint is pretty print, but does not change the content).Note that here we copy there reference to the dictionary to the new list, so we do not create a new dictionary. Furthermore the result is a defaultdict. We can cast it to a vanilla dictionary with dict(res).
Your data model is very redundant. You could use a dict with type as keys and list of quantities as values.The output is much shorter but you didn't lose any information.If you're only interested in the total quantities, you could use a Counter:
