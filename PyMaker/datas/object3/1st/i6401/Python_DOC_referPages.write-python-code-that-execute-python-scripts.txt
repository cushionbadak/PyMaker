I have a Python file (sql_script.py) with some methods to add/modify data into a SQL database, sayimport_data_into_specifications_tableimport_data_into_linkage_tabletruncate_linkage_table....(do_other_stuff_on_db)connect_dbSometimes I have to call only one of the methods, some others several of themUntil now what I did was modify the main method according to what I needed to do:But I find it a bad practice, as I always have to remember removing the main before committing the codeA possible option could be to write an external python file, say launch_sql_script.py), in which I write all possible combinations of methods I have to run, say:It can be useful to version this file, but still I will need to modify the main code according to what I need to do.Do you think this is a good practise? Do you have any other suggestions?
The simplest way is to use program arguments mechanism: describe intended action during script execution.Get a peek at sys.argvHere is the scratch:If you're going to parse sophisticated program arguments, check out argparse library.
Option 1: Separate them into individual scripts and run each from command lineOption 2: Write one file that parses command line argumentsI would favour option 2 if the order of the operations doesn't matter or is always constant. If there are many permutations, I would go with option 1.
