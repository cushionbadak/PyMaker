With Python 3, I want to read an XML web page and save it in my local drive.Also, if the file already exist, it must overwrite it.I tested some script like :But I have an error :
I found a solution :Thanks for your help.
First suggestion: do what even the official urllib docs says and don't use urllib, use requests instead.Your problem is that you use .writelines() and it expects a list of lines, not a bytes objects (for once in Python the error message is not very helpful). Use .write() instead
