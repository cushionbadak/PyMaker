I was looking at an INI configuration file implementation here that used this code:I want to output something if the configuration file can not be found, but the Python documentation doesn't say anything about an else condition, so I was thinking of using an if...else block here instead:What kind of differences would I see with an if...else block in place of a with block?
Well, one difference is that the if block would not parse. Assignment statements aren’t expressions in Python. Another is that it wouldn’t close the file by itself – that’s what the with accomplishes.What you’re really looking for is try, since open throws an exception when a file can’t be found:(If you’re using an older version of Python, you’ll need to catch OSError and check its errno instead.)
One tests a condition to see if it is true, then executes the code block after the condition is met example:a With statement is a boolean operation, it can be used with file I/O, or that's the most that I have seen it used with.example could be:the else clause from what i have seen only seems to work with try/the very end of if statements when the condition has never been met, and its use is basically, if the try statement fails for some reason or another, this is what you now execute.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Truth be told, I enjoy the ease of while statements. You can nest more conditional statements inside the while loop, for loops, if loops(I have come to LOVE nested loops) they ease the process of writing code so much. Here is a code snippet from a piece that I wrote not too long ago:
