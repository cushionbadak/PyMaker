This question already has an answer here:Why is 'True == not False' a syntax error in Python?                    3 answers                This works:but not this:error in the init:What I am doing wrong ?
The problem is the use of == where you need =.  This normally wouldn't cause a syntax error, but in your case, you have:which is the same as:This groups as:and that causes the syntax error.An assignment operator, on the other hand, has lower precedence, so:groups as:which is fine.
I'm pretty sure you only need one equal sign, maybe that's the mistake.= is for assignement and  == is used for comparison.
