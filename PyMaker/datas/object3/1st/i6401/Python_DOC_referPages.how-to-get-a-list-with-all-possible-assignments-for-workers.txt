I've got the following problem:I have N workers. Each of them can be assigned to one of 4 tasks T1, T2, T3 and T4. I would like to generate a list with all the assignment possibilities like this:How can I do this? Python or VB.NET code would be the best, but any language will do.
You can do this:You can call it, for instance, as:This will display the results as:
You can make the code better. But for an example this will work (python 3.6)
You want to generate the Cartesian Product of the pool of workers and the pool of tasks.There's a standard function for this: python2python3So perhaps you need itertools.product(workers, tasks)?
