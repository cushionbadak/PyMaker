I have a Python script that needs to know the value of the $UID environment variable. The problem is, that for some reason, this variable does not exist in os.environ. Below is an interactive demonstration - the $UID is defined on the shell, but although Python is launched from the same shell, the 'UID' environment variable does not exist in os.environ.Is it a known problem? Is there anything to do about it?
that's expected because UID is a shell internal variable. It is not propagated to subprocesses.You have to get the values directly through the os module with os.getuid()
I think you're looking for os.getuid()
