I have a python script that contains a Linux shell command. I'm using subprocess.check_output. My question is about the faster python method to execute a Linux shell command from python script like os.system(). 
I like subprocess.Popen, but it has troubles (maybe it can't) to deal with '>' ==> unconvenient if you have a '>' in the command line otherwise subprocess.check_output
The better way:Please check:https://docs.python.org/2/library/subprocess.html
