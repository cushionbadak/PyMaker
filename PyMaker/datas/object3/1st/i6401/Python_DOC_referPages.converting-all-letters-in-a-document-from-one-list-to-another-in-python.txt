Natural Text
I have two listsI have a variable with random text in it.var = 'backout'I want to convert all letters in the variable that exist in list1 to the letters in list2.expectedOutput = 'edfkout'Is there a way to do this?
You want to use str.translate using a translation table from string.maketrans (This is str.maketrans in Python 3)Edit:Note that we have to use strings instead of lists as our arguments to maketrans.  
We can map the keys to values using a zip()wrapped with dict() and then iterate the letters and map them to their corresponding ones with themselves being the default (in case not found):
Convert each char to its ascii value using map(ord,list1) and do the 1-1 mapping b/w list1 and list2 using zipOutput:
For people who prefer shorter but more complicated solution (instead of using the translate() method), here it is:The explanation:creates the {'a': 'd', 'b': 'e', 'c': 'f'} dictionary.The 1st argument is a key - if it is found in keys, we obtain its value: trans_dict[ch]The 2nd argument is a default value - used if the first argument is not found in keys. We obtain ch.is a list comprehension - something as creating a list from the empty list, appending next and next element in the for loop.is a standard way for concatenating individual elements of the list (in our case, the individual characters).(Instead of the empty string there may be an arbitrary string - it is used for delimiting individual elements in the concatenated string)
