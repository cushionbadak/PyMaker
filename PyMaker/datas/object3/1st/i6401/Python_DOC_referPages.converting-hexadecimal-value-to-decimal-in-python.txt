I just started working with hexadecimal values in python and am a bit surprised with what I just encountered. I expected the following code to first print a hexadecimal string, and then a decimal value.Input:Output:Hex value for n is: 190096411054295805012706659640261275091 Dec value for n is: 8921116140846515089057635273465667902228615313How is it possible that 2 different different numbers are shown? I expected the first number to be a hexadecimal string and the second it's decimal equivalent, what is this second value in this case?
0x is a way to input an integer with an hexadecimal notation.This hexadecimal notation is forgotten directly after instantiation, though:So when you call int(str(n), 16), Python interprets '190096411054295805012706659640261275091' as an hexadecimal number:You need to input the original hex string:or use hex:
