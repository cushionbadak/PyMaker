I tried to run the following multiprocessing code:and get the results:The False outputs seem strange. I have set the attribute finished to be True in the method run, and the outputs executed show that the run method has been executed. And, if I add a line print(self.finished) immediately after self.finished=True in the method run, the output would be True. Why does the class attribute finished change after multiprocessing has finished?Thanks!
This will allow you to share the finished value between processes.  It uses a multiprocessing.Value to create a shared object using shared memory.
The self.finished = True executes in another process and only changes the variable in that process, but you are printing the value from the main process.  You need variables that are shared.
