Natural Text
I am writing a program that needs input in the console to control where a turtle goes on the screen. For example, if the user of the program types w in the console, and presses enter, the turtle should move forward 30 units. If the user types a, the turtle should turn left 45 degrees, etc.I wrote some functions and used an infinite while loop for the program. It looks like this:The program works, except when I enter w in the console, it takes at least 2 entries to get my turtle to move forward. It takes even more when I try to turn my turtle right.Any ideas? Thanks in advance.
Each input() prompts for a new entry from the user.What your code does is, for every set of 5 entries:discard the first entrycheck if the second entry is 'w' then move forwardcheck if the third entry is 'a' then move leftcheck if the fourth entry is 's' then move rightcheck if the fifth entry is 'd' then move backYou should assign the first input() to a variable, then check with that.Use elif to avoid checking other characters if it already satisfies one.
