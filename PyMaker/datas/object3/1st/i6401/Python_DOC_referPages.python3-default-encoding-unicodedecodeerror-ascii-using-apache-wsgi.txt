I'm using a framework called inginious and it's using web.py to render its template. The rendering works on my localhost but not on my staging server. They both run python3. I see that web.py enforces utf-8 on the encoding in Python2 only (that's out of my hands)here is the stack traceMy html do include hebew chars, small example and I open it like so :and the line where the encoding fails is where the Hebrew chars are.  I tried setting some environment variables in ~/.bashrc:under the user centosThe ingenious framework is installed as a pip under python3.5 site-packages. and it served by an apache server under the user apacheTried setting the environment variables in the code (during the init of the app) so that the apache WSGI will be aware of them I have edited the /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf using the setenv method:and restarted using sudo service httpd restart and still no luck. My question is, what is the best practice to solve this. I understand there are hacks for this, but I want to understand what is the underline cause as well as how to solve it. Thanks!
finally found the answer when reading the file changed from to if anyone has a more general approach that will work, I'll accept his answer 
A Python 2+3 solution would be:See the documentation of io.open.
