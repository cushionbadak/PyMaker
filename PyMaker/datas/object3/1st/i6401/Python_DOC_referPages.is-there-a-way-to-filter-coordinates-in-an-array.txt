This is my array:Does anyone know of a method to filter where x coordinate is 0 into a separate array like this.Similarly, is there a way to filter through the box linked to the coordinates such as when it is equal to 1; like this
You can use two dict comprehension for both of these. (Side note: “the box linked to the coordinates” that is called a list)In addition, as commented by PM 2Ring, building only one filtered array could be done with a dict comprehension, but building multiple arrays would require iterating the original array multiple times, making it inefficient. You can use a traditional for loop instead.As proven by timeit,  the former returned a timeit value of 0.003447920083999634While the latter only 0.002893589437007904. Although it’s not much difference right now, but when you have 3, 4, or 10 filtered_arrays, and the array gets way bigger. The difference will be dramatic.Try it here: https://ideone.com/rSvC0i

You can use dictionary comprehensions.Also that's a dictionary, not a list or (numpy) array.
