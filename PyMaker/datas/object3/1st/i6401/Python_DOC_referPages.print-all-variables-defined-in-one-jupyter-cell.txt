Is there an easier way to display the name and the value of all variables defined in a single cell in a pretty way?The way I'm doing now is like this, but I waste a lot of time when there are 30 variables or more:
You can try something like this, using the inspect library.
You can use whos command to see all variables stored in the current kernel.outputs:But as said, it displays all variables, so it will display other variables from earlier cells you've run.A similar result can be achieved using locals() or globals() command from python built-in functions, which return a dictionary of variables. But the way jupyter represents is prettier. Alternatively you can use InteractiveShell. This will change the behavior of cells and act like a python shell would, so it will output every called value (to output cell) once run.outputs:And finally you can return the interactivity to default by setting it to last_expr.But the way you do it is probably the easiest and prettiest way, you can just remove the assignment on dataframe to make it a one liner or you can make it more compact to call by:
