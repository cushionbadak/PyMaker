Natural Text
Referring to A Simple Example from python.org:This is setup.py:  And then it says to run this command:python setup.py sdistHow/what/where is the parameter sdist being parsed?  
The setup function parses the command line arguments: it reads sys.argv. See source code on GitHub. You're certainly confusing between function arguments (the ones defined in the setup.py script) and the command line arguments: (which are setup.py sdist). A piece of information is given in the run_setup function comment:'sys.argv[0]' will be replaced with 'script' for the duration of the call.  'script_args' is a list of strings; if supplied,'sys.argv[1:]' will be replaced by 'script_args' for the duration of the call.
