I am trying to create a grid that lists all triplets that sum to 1, discretized at 0.01. Here is what I have tried, without much luck. First tryAnother try:
How about taking all possible values of x and y and then computing what the appropriate value of z would be:This uses itertools.product to get the cartesian product of x and y, although np.meshgrid would work just as well.We can show that the resulting triples sum to 1 (modulo some rounding errors):Here's a pure numpy version of the same approach; I'm using np.mgrid instead of meshgrid because it gives me back a single array instead of a tuple of two arrays:Here's the same sanity check (grid2 is transposed with respect to grid; that is, their shapes are (3, 5151) and (5151, 3), respectively):
You don't need to iterate 100**3 times. Here's a plain Python solution without any if:It outputs:You only need to divide by 100.0 and put the triplets into an np.array.
