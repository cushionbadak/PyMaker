Can someone explain to me, how to print the content of the following variables in a loop?I have tried playing around with the following, but it is not printing the content. The exec statement merely prints out "Week23" etc. The eval statement doesn't work due to a parsing error.
You can use locals() function:More pythonic would be a dictionary. 
You can use global() to get a dictionary of global variables and subset it using your logic with the addition of converting i to integer before converting it to string:
The problem is in the array length. numpy.linspace() actually generates an array of float as below.Try these codes, you should get what you want.At last, using a variable as part of the name is really not a good idea. Try dict if you can.
When I try to run your code as it is, I get the following:So I only see problem with floats, since you used linspace, try range, and try not to escape variable name inside exec'ed string:if you insist on linspace, try and convert it to integer before using. Also, some reusability
