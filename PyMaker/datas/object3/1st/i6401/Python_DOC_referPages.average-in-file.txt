I have this codeThe csv file looks like this:All the code works but the line of prom = (datos[1] + datos[2])/2 it says that the list index is out of range. Does anyone know something.
Given the script and the input csv file the program runs correctly for me.The only thing that I changed is casting the numbers to integers prom = (int(datos[1]) + int(datos[2]))/2Make sure that you are using the correct input file and check that there aren't any empty lines or lines with less than 2 arguments on them.(2 commas)
Catch the error and print datos and reg in the except suite. Are they what you expected? Are there any blank lines in your file? Do all lines in the file have three columns.?Or, if you don't mind a lot of stuff printing, just print reg and datos just before the assignment to prom.  Then the last print before the exception should give you a clue to what is wrong.When you split reg it must produce a list with less than three items so the file either has blank lines or lines with less than two columns.
