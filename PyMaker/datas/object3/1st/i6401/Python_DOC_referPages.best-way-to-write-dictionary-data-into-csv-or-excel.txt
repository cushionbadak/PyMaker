I am trying to write dictionary data into csv file.Keys:DictionaryI was thinking each dictionary will be written in on row with each value in new columnI am getting results like this, into single column only:Can you please help me to write it in correct manner? Also when I add new records, it should get appendedMy code:Expected outputenter image description here
As soon as you work with tables I recommend pandas.Here is the pandas solution:Output:
Your script was iterating over each key value pair in your dictionary and then calling writerow() for each pair. writerow() will give you a single new row, so calling it multiple time in this way will give you one row per pair. res only contains data for a single row in your CSV file. Using a csv.DictWriter(), a single call to writerow() will convert all the dictionary entries into a single output row:Giving you an output dict.csv file as:By explicitly passing fieldnames is forces the ordering of the columns in the output to what you provide. If the ordering is not important, and you can instead use fieldnames=res.keys()
