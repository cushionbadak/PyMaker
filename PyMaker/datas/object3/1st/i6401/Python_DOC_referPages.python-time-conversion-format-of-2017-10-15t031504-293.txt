This question already has an answer here:How do I parse an ISO 8601-formatted date?                    24 answers                I am having trouble converting the date time string 2017-10-15T03:15:04.293 into a Date object in python, simply because I can't figure out the format.I have the code line: x.strftime('%Y-%m-%d'), which accurately gives me the date itself, but lacks the time obviously. When trying to modify the string formatter, I am getting confused by the T, and the last decimal .293 (from the example above).Can someone help me understand what these values mean in this timestamp, and what the proper x.strftime('<WHAT GOES HERE ???>') might be?
The numbers after the . are microseconds. You can parse it using the datetime module, like so:The format looks like ISO-8601, which is a widely-used standard. But it appears that the datetime module doesn't yet provide a way to parse this without providing the format-string yourself.
