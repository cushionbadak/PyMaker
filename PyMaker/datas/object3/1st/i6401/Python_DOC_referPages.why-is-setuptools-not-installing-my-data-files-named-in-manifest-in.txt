Trying to use a MANIFEST.in file (contains one line):To install some files for systemd (yea, I'm holding my nose about that part)I see the files get added to the tarball by sdist, but nothing will cause them to install.setup.py contains the following linesThen if I add this to setup.py and remove the MANIFEST.inthey install as expected.  Is there something missing that I need to add for MANIFEST.in to work instead of enumerating all the files by name in setup.py?
package_data and data_files are not the same thing.  package_data are files that are stored & installed in the same directory as your *.py files (hence the "package" part); include_package_data thus only marks data files it finds inside your package directories (emphasis added) as package data.  Unless your code is stored under etc/ in your package source, none of your files will be treated as package data.  In order to install files outside your Python package directory, you need to use data_files, and there is no shortcut as there is with include_package_data.
