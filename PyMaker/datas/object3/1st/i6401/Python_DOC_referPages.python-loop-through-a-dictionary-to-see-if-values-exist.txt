I am trying to loop though a python dictionary to see if values that I am getting from a csv file already exist in the dictionary, If the values do not exist I want to add them to the dictionary. then append this to a list.I am getting the error list indices must be integers, not str.example input first name last namejohn           smith john           smithexample output first_name john last name smithuser_list =[]
Currently, your code is creating a new dictionary on every iteration of the for-loop. If each value of the dictionary is a list, then you can append to that list via the key:
Generally, you can use a membership test (x in y) on dict.values() view to check if the value already exists in your dictionary.However, if you are trying to add all unique users from your CSV file to a list of users, that has nothing to do with dictionary values testing, but a list membership testing.Instead of iterating over the complete list each time for a slow membership check, you can use a set that will contain "ids" of all users added to a list and enable a fast O(n) (amortized) time check:
The error "list indices must be integers, not str" makes the problem clear: On the line that throws the error, you have a list that you think is a dict. You try to use a string as a key for it, and boom!You don't give enough information to guess which dict it is: It could be user_dictionary, it could be that you're using csv.reader and not csv.DictReader as you say you do. It could even be something else-- there's no telling what else you left out of your code. But it's a list that you're using as if it's a dict.
