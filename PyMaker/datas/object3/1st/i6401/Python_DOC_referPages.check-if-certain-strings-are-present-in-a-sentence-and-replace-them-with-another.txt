My program is to check if the input sentence contains not followed by bad and replace it with good. For instance if the sentence contained not bad without any other string in between not and bad, I was able to replace them with good as given in the code below:and the output was:The problem arises when there is some other word (or words) in between not and bad.Have a look at the codes I tried:It throwed an error like the following while the expected output has to be The day is good:I tried something like this too:But the errorsome output I got for the above code was:IOW, the whole sentence was replaced by good.Can you suggest what should be done if I should get something like the one below:
There are a couple of ways you could approach this.  One way is to convert the sentence to a list of words, locate "not" and "bad" in the list, remove them and all the elements in between and then insert "good".Another method is to use regular expressions to find a pattern that matches "not" followed by zero or more words, followed by "bad".  The re.sub function finds strings that match a given pattern and replaces them with a string that you provide:
output:Regex explanation :I used if else condition regex here :How if else in regex works  , well this is very simple if else regex syntax:This means "if proposition A is true, then match pattern X; otherwise, match pattern Y." so in this regex :it matches 'bad' if 'not' in the string,  the condition is 'not' must present in the string.Second Regex :if you want you can also use this regex:In this group(2) is matching 'bad'.Your string :
