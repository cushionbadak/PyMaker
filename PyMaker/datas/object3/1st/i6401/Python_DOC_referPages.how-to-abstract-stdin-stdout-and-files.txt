Natural Text
I'm trying to write a Python script which lets the user to switch between stdin/stdout and files for input/output. But I'm not sure if my implementation is correct:Is the code managing resources correctly?How can I properly handle character encoding? I'd like to have everything in utf-8.Is there any room for improvement in the above code?
I think you would need to do this way. You don't need to make run() itself a @contextmanagerâ€”all it needs to do is use one (or more, and both fileinput.input and redirect_stdout are ones already). I'm not sure why you're using fileinput.input since there appears to only be one input file involved.
