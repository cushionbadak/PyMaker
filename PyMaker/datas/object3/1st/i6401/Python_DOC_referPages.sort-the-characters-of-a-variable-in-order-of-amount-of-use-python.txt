Natural Text
Example:Enter data to sort: "Hello World"Sorted: ["l", 3, "o", 2, " ", 1, "H", 1, "W", 1, "d", 1, "e", 1, "r", 1]In ASCII orderSo I want it to go into a table in order of the amount of times it comes up with the amount of times that character comes up.
Use CounterIf you want the structure exactly like as you said,Sorted: ["l", 3, "o", 2, " ", 1, "H", 1, "W", 1, "d", 1, "e", 1, "r",  1]Though, I would not recommend doing that since it will make further computation on this more confusing.
