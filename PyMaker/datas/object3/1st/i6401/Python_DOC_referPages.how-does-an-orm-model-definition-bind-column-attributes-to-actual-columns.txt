I'm trying to understand how ORMs are able to resolve table columns via a class attribute without explicitly providing table and column names.Queries then are able to do this:I understand that Column defines a method for the __eq__ operator, but how would a column instance know it is referring to class Car and attribute id (assuming those are used for table and column names by default)?I'm learning a lot about python by digging into how ORM libs work!
In SqlAlchemy and DJango ORM, the base class (Model here) is tie to a metaclass or a factory method (like __new__) which performs introspection. Here is how you can reproduce with a function (simpler solution):This setup_class function introspect the cls class and setup the name attribute if it is empty or None, for instance:Editimplementation example using metaclass:Of course, that's not enough. You have to understand that Column is a descriptor. This descriptor is used to build the SQL queries.
