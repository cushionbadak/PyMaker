I have been using python 34 and use pip from command line in windows to install my packages. Now I have installed python 36 without uninstalling python 34. However I cannot install packages into python 36 using pip as it is configured to Python 34. Any elegant solutions for this problem.
I'm adding my comment as an answer so I can add my reference.use this command to specify which python version you want to install packages too. Just replace 'SomePackage' with the package name you want to install.I found this on this HereEDITThis is for Windows. For Mac or Linux users switch py -3.6 to python3.6
