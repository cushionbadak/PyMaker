I have a list of objects. Could someone help return the object with the highest score? For example:I need a method that will return the object with the highest score. In this case it should returnSo far I tried:print max(objs, key=attrgetter('score'))but it gives me AttributeError: 'dict' object has no attribute 'score'Thanks in advance!
PandasYou can convert the dictionary to a dataframe, find the index of the max score, extract the entry and convert that back to a dictionary.This is probably faster when you have a large number of objects.Demo:Reading to a dataframeLocating the index of the maximum scoreExtracting the max and writing to a dictionary
operator.attrgetter() is for attributes, e.g. foo.bar.For item access you want operator.itemgetter() instead.
max(objs, key=lambda x: x['score'])The key argument specifies a one-argument ordering function like that used for list.sort().The most compact way to provide the function is with lambda.
Not a Python expert and I guarantee there is a simpler and less verbose way to complete.Though, it works for me:
This should do the job as well,[a for a in objs if a["score"] == max([a["score"] for a in objs])]Returns,[{'score': 50, 'name': 'Jason'}]
