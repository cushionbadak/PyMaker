first of all, I'm brand new to python, and have basic understanding of c/c++/c# which are all statically typed languages. So can the following be done in python?I want the variable birthday to be a datetime. So that whenever I instantiate I have to pass a datetime in with the parameters.Further down I instantiate as followingthis gives me the error:TypeError: an integer is required (got type datetime.date)is my instantiate wrong or should i get the following out of my head asap with python? (Why I would like to do this is so that the getage method always is presented with a datetime.date instead of something random if I make an instantiate mistake.)PS: also, if my terminology is not correct, donâ€™t hesitate to correct me. :)
I'm assuming that you fixintoas suggested by jonrsharpe.Now if you want to check the type of birthday, you can writeat the beginning of the constructor. This is however not a static check because the check will only be performed when the assertion will run.
