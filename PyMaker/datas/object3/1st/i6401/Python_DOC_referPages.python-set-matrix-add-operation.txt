I have a input matrix looks like this I am using the following code to construct a matrix of sets. The output gives me I am wondering why valuesets[0][0] is being updated each time in the for loop but not stays the same value set([1]) like I expected? Thanks.
The reason is [set()] * n creates a list by copying the same set() instance.If you want to get a list of distinct set objects, use [set() for _ in range(n)] instead.
