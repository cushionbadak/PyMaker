In R, when you assign something to a variable, you can wrap your code in brackets to also print the result: Is there an equivalent feature in python?
No. You can't mix statements and expressions in the same "command".You can, however, use ; to have both on the same "line":
There is no single statement which allows to that.First we have assignment statements. Which allow to, well, make assignments.And then you have either a print function (for Python 3.x) or a print statement (for Python 2.x). But neither of them cannot be mixed with the aforementioned assignemnt statement.So no, you cannot do that in a single statement. You can, of couse, cheat that into one line by using ; but that is something not very readable which I would not recommend.Bonun non-aswering ramblingFrom a readability point of view, assigning and printing are two very different things which should not be mixed.Moreover, if you are (for instance) using a logging library instead of direct print usage, then the "single statement" you are looking for would become useless. In fact, I think that that is a rationale behind moving print from statement to function.So, you don't have a single statement for assign-and-print and, I will add, that kind of statement doesn't seem a good idea in the Python language.
