I've got some code that needs to call the getrandom libc function, but if it's not available (as it isn't on glibc versions before 2.24), I need to fall back to invoking the syscall directly. Unfortunately, the syscall number for the getrandom syscall differs by kernel version and platform, and my code needs to run on multiple platforms.Is there a way that I can get the number at runtime?
You can use os.urandom() or random.SystemRandom()
