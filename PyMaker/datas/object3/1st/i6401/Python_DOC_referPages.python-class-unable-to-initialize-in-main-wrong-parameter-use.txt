I am pretty sure I initialized the list incorrectly, but whether it be the wrong parameter or misaligned syntax I cannot say. At first, I believed it was due to the class not visible in main(), but after removing main, the same error was still returned.I have read through the Python reference and found no discrepancies between our codes. Would much appreciate the pinpointing of any unseen errors. Thanks in advance!Reference: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.htmlError Returned:Code:
You can't reference nodes in the list comprehension while building it. (And even if you could you're trying to access elements which are not yet initialised).
Python works with indentations. Python does not use brackets for delimiting function bodies therefore your indentation needs to be correct.Here is a simple piece of code written properly:Now here is a bad piece of code wrongly indented:This is going to come up with an error. How can Python know where the function ends? Or the if statement?Now, assuming that was only a copy paste issue here what's going to go wrong in your code.You are trying to do the same thing twice here. Use eitherorAlso you have swap ) and ] in this line after the false:It's not the only errors in your code but this is the solution for the error you reported just now.
