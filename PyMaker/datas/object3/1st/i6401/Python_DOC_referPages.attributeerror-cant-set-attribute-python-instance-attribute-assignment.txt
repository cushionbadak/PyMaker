I am encountering a strange problem that relates to instance attributes. I have a variable logger, which I want to be an instance attribute. However, I get the error AttributeError: can't set attribute unless I move the attribute logger outside the __init__() function, which (IIRC), means that I am declaring logger as a class attribute (not what I want).Here is a snippet of my code:Why am I getting this error, and how to fix it?
If you look at the source code (or even if you just print(scrapy.Spider.logger) you can see that Spider.logger is a property, and in particular without a setter defined, so you can't easily assign to it.You don't necessarily need to create your own logger if you want to add additional handlers though, so I'm not sure what you're trying to achieve beyond that.  Though if you ''really'' wanted to override the default self.logger, since you're subclassing Spider there's nothing stopping you from adding something like:to your class.
