I have seen a variety of answers on here, but none that quite answered my question. I am trying to convert the following listto the following:I want to keep the strings as strings but convert the strings to ints where possible.I know I could do something like:if it were just numbers, but I am unsure how to do it when it is mixed.
There's always try/except:
You can use str.isdigit():Taking negative numbers into account:
I would just extract the conversion into a function.Also I renamed your list to int_list, so that we can still use the list constructor if required.
You can use try , except block
