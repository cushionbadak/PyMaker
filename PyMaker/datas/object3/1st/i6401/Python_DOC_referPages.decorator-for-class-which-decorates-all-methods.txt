I want to write class decorator which for all non-magic methods, to decorate these methods. The idea is that to all methods of class print its name after call; I do not want decor all methods but only class. Decorator log_method works. I have problem with log_class decorator. There are no errors and no output.
You should rebind the method to the class object using setattr passing the method name m; assigning to the local name m like you've done, does nothing. More so, you're currently passing m, a string, to log_method. Instead, you should pass the function object itself after retrieving via getattr:PS: log_method is never used for decorating, so it's not a decorator.
