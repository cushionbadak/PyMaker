I'm trying to mock a function. When I try to mock the function core.use_cases.add_owner_to_place the mock doesn't work. It keeps printing "Ouch".I've tried to test mocked_add_owner_to_place.called and it returns False.Does anyone know why it keeps using the real function even if I mock it?views.py:tests.py:uses_cases.py:
So, searching around and looking some codes on github, I found out that I need to mock from the view even if the function belongs to the use_cases module.So my code now is:tests.pyI know that this works, but now I need to search why it works. I'll explain it when I figure it out.
