I have a python script that I execute from the command line, and I pass to it some parameters from there as well. Now I'm designing the GUI to execute that script, so I want to execute the script after clicking a button, and passing the arguments from a Listbox.  I have seen some suggestions that used lambda functions. However, I couldn't find any example of executing a whole different script that takes arguments from command line basically. I also tried ecevfile, but it executes the script without taking any parameters. How can I execute the script by a button press and passing the arguments as well? 
Just an idea but you could write a function to make a batch file and use os.startfile("batch.bat")
