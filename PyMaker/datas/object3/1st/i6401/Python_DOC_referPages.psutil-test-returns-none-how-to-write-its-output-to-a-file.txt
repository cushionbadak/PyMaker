Natural Text
I'm trying to write the psutil.test() result to a file but instead it prints out the text that I want in the file and writes "None" to the test.txt.
psutil.test() just prints to stdout but returns None.You could use contextlib.redirect_stdout to redirect the standard output (e.g. when using print) to a file:
psutil.test() doesn't return a string. It prints a string. A workaround would be to use contextlib.redirect_stdout, so that string goes to your file instead of STDOUT.Be sure to use both context managers (the with statements), or your file won't be flushed and closed. The redirect_stdout documentation uses separate context managers for the file and the redirection.
