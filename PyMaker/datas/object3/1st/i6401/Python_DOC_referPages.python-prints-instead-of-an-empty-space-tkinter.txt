Natural Text
In this simple example, I would like the label to be displayed as "1   3":However, python displays "1 { } 3" instead.Where is the problem?
As jonathan and Ron Norris already said, you need to pass a string to the text argument of the Label constructor.I would suggest to transform your heterogeneous list to a string thusly:Documentation link for map: map documentation for python 3Documentation for str: str documentation for python 3Documentation for the join method of string: string join method, python 3Edit: Since you now ask for a way to do this in many code locations, with minimal code changes, I would suggest this wrapper around tkinter.Label:This function will pass all of its arguments unchanged to tkinter.Label, but taking care to transform a text keyword argument to a string, if it is a list. When you have defined this, use a "Find & Replace" function in your editor to replace calls to tkinter.Label with createlabel.Your original could would be transformed like this, for example:
A[0:] is a heterogeneous list, tkinter.Label's documentation suggests that its text parameter should receive a string (Which the word "text" also quite strongly suggests)https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.ttk.html#label-options
If you want "1 3", try:
