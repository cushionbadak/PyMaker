Say I want to delete 'Core.dll' after 'git pull', so I write a hook.Say the hook path is 'E:\client\.git\hooks', the file I want to delete is in 'E:\client\Assets\Plugins\Core.dll'.I think my way is very silly, is there any elegant way to get the relative path?
Using pathlib:
Anti solution is the best in python 3. For Python 2, you could use os.pardir and os.path.join:
os.path.relpath would be what you asked for. You should also be using os.path.join instead of that long list of + and sep. In Python 3's pathlib, there's relative_to. It appears your code is trying to apply a relative path, not get it in relative form. In that case, joinpath and normpath or realpath might help.
