I'm looking to merge two dictionaries shown below, but I was unsuccessful in doing so.I have read many blog posts, but I did not find an answer.My final output should be like:How can I do this?
With defaultdictIf you know what the expected depth is, you could use nested defaultdicts to define final_dict:There's a lot of added output because of the defaultdict, but you could treat final_dict as a simple dict.With dictsWith standard dicts, you'll have to use setdefault. The code doesn't become very readable, though:It might be a bit more efficient with dict.items():
