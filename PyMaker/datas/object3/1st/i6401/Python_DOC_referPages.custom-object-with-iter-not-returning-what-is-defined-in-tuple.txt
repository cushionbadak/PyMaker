This question already has an answer here:How to convert an custom class object to a tuple in Python? [closed]                    1 answer                In a custom object with __iter__() defined, when calling tuple(obj), it returns the data of __iter__() in tuple form, but I want it to return from __tuple__().This is a really big class, and I don't want to paste it here. I instead wrote a smaller example of my problem.If you need to see all of my code, ask, and I'll put it in a Pastebin. I just wanted to save you the effort of sorting through all of those extra methods.Does __iter__() override the __tuple__() type? For some reason I can't get it to change to return what it should from __tuple__().Thanks in advance.
__tuple__ isn't a thing. tuple doesn't look for a __tuple__ method to perform conversion-to-tuple. I don't know where you got that idea.
