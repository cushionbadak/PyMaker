I'm not quite sure why this doesn't work, can anyone please help me fix this?
Here's a slightly more Pythonic way using all
If the len(user_guess) == guess_size condition is satisfied the return True is triggering after only checking the first char. For correctness, return False when this condition fails, and return True outside the loop if this never triggers.Also, the length condition doesn't need to be evaluated inside the loop.
I am not sure exactly how you want this code to work. However, based on your comment:Given a list of single character strS and a str, return True    if every character is in the given string.I assume you simply want to know that all characters (="every character") in user_guess are in valid_characters. I would do it this way:It is not clear what guess_size is supposed to do.
This is one of many possible ways to valid the guesses
