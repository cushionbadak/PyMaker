When I run my below query and there is no data in the values such as ["VT","NCR","N","DT","RD"],  the query fails.With the error message of Is there a way to say if there is no data in any of the values still carry on running the query to grab data for the values that have data in python?For example: the ‘TRY’, ‘CATCH’, or ’PASS’ method?I have been struggling on this for days, could someone show me how to do this?My Code:
I'd like to point out a flaw in your comment Actually, it writes out the values of the the dictionary under the headers of the keys... Therefore you're writing two headers, basically. Regarding the error, according to the documentation , you can ignore missing fields and set default values when they don't existThe optional restval parameter specifies the value to be written if the dictionary is missing a key in fieldnames. If the dictionary passed to the writerow() method contains a key not found in fieldnames, the optional extrasaction parameter indicates what action to take. If it is set to 'raise', the default value, a ValueError is raised. If it is set to 'ignore', extra values in the dictionary are ignored.For example Otherwise, don't use a DictWriter and form the CSV row yourself. You can use dict.get() to extract values, but set default values that don't exist in the data
