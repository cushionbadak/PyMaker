I would like to create my own custom complex data structure in python. Below is the format of the same. I tried exploring struct module but I couldn't get any example with similar format. Could anyone please help.
Not entirely sure what is your usecase, but at first glance it looks like it could be handled by using OOP (Object Oriented Programming). A simple class would be sufficient.Have a look at Python doc: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html.
