First of all, the imports needed for this answer:Let's say that your button has been defined.Here is some sample code which will get the current directory:If you're looking to set up a GUI to ask the user to select a file, use:Which will store the file that they have chosen, with the directory they start at set to curr_directory which is the current directory.If you are instead looking to set up a GUI in which the user chooses a directory, you can use:This will store the name of the directory they have chosen in the dir_name variable.For more information, check out this link on how to use the file dialog. Alternatively, you can check the general tkinter documentation here (for Python 2) and here (for Python 3). If you need a reference to the file dialog, this is a good source.
