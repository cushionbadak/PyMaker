Try this: with open('mycsvfile.csv', 'w', newline='') as f:Here is the docAs the documentation says in the footnote:If newline=' ' is not specified, newlines embedded inside quoted fields  will not be interpreted correctly, and on platforms that use \r\n  linendings on write an extra \r will be added. It should always be  safe to specify newline=' ', since the csv module does its own  (universal) newline handling.Hope it helps!
I'm not saying this is the best way to do this as I normally handle CSV stuff manually myself, however if you need a quick and dirty fix, try executing this directly after your code.This takes your CSV as it is generated, reads it in, replaces any double new lines with single ones, and writes it all back out. Not remotely efficient, but it will work for now.
Try using the newline='' argument with writerow(). i.e. w.writerow(my_dict, newline='')
