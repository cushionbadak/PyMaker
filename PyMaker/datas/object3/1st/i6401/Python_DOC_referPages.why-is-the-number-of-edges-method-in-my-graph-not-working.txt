This question already has an answer here:Bound method error                    6 answers                I have the following command:and get the following outputwhat does this output mean?
Since g.number_of_edges is a class method and there is no print method defined for the class, Python will simply print what is knows about the object (the class name and memory location where the object is stored).Instead of print g.number_of_edges use print g.number_of_edges(). The difference is that print g.number_of_edges() calls the method number_of_edges and then prints its return value.
