Since you are looking for longitude and latitude, I am guessing that the i+1 is wrong as suggested by @Hadus.  Also, some of the lookups can be moved out of the print to make is cleaner:
In loop statementyou comparing i with length of dict_data dictionary. But in print statement you use i to index dict_data['features'] field and (!) dict_data['features'][i]['geometry']['coordinates'] field. Also, you using i+1 index. I need more information (json example at least) to say for sure what's going wrong.
The coordinates are a list (of length 2) not a dictionary.Example:{'features':{0:{'geometry':{'coordinates':['latitude', 'longtitude']}}}}@Andrew Gillis 's answer is better and I would recommend it unless you want ugly code what is never good.
