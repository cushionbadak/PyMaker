So basically I have the a formula for getting the UNIX time, but I am getting 10800, and not 0, in my Ubuntu machine (in my mac it works just fine):I have seen a couple different questions, but none brought me any insight.I think it is not a timezone issue, because:
This is a timezone issue.  time.strptime, which relies on posix strptime returns a local time in all cases.  Please read the documentation of strptime carefully, you will note that while %Z is supported as a format character "fields are parsed, but no field in tm is changed"Generally speaking, a posix implementation of strptime that does support %Z will only support the values of UTC, GMT or the systems tzname (available in python from time.tzname).  But it will not alter the return value based upon them.
UNIX time is completely timezone dependent you may find clear answer here en.wikipedia.org
