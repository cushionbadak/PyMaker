I'm trying to implement simple tree class which is inherited from dictionary. Here my code:So everything works quite well, although I'm not sure about keys function realization:...but not an iteration through it:How can I get something like this?Pretty sure that it must be __iter__ and next attributes of tree class, but I haven't figured out how to write it yet.I've searched over Stack Overflow with no luck:python recursive iteration nested dictionaries python class inherited from dictionary iteration through nested dictionariespython iteration through nested dictionaries
Yes, you need __iter__ (an iterator will have a next() automatically).Following your existing logic:Unlike your current keys() implementation, this only walks the tree on an as-needed basis: If a client only needs the first two keys, it only calls next() twice, and so the iterator only proceeds past two yields.(I might suggest implementing keys as simply return list(iter(self)) -- that way you have the lazy approach available for those that want to avoid the inefficiency of unnecessarily walking a full tree, and the non-lazy approach otherwise).
