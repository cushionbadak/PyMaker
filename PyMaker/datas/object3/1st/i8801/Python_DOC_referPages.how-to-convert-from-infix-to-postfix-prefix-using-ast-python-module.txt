Here's what I got so far:I'm trying to understand how to convert complex infix math expressions to postfix  expressions to be sent to a swig c wrapper, to do that I'm trying to use the AST module. Could anyone advice here?
You can use ast.dump to get more information about the the nodes and AST structure:With above information you can change the visiting order of the node's children which allows you to generate postfix or prefix expression. In order to generate postfix expression change visit_BinOp, visit_BoolOp and visit_Call so that they visit arguments before visiting the operator/function:With above changes you get following output:If you want prefix expression instead just swap the order around so operator/function is visited first:Output:
