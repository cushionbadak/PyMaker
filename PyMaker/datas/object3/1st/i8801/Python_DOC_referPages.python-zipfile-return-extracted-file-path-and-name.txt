I have this current code to unzip the contents of archive to extract_dir. However, I cannot figure out how to get the extracted file path & name of the extracted file.For example, if the archive is called test.zip and ZipFile extracts the contents test.exe I want get C:/windows/users/admin/downloads/test.exe in to a variable?EDIT: Sorry I wasn't clear, in the source code for zipfile targetpath is returned I am wondering how I can get this?
Here is the solution, I can't accept the answer for 2 days though.
