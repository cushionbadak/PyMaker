Natural Text
In the documentation, TemporaryFile() mentions The returned object is a file-like object whose _file attribute is either an io.BytesIO or io.StringIO object (depending on whether binary or text mode was specified)...However, as of Python 3.6, there is no text=True method of asking for text mode.   How does one do it?
TemporaryFile signature:We are interested in a mode parameter. The last symbol is 'b', which means binary mode. If you pass mode='wt', it will be opened in a text mode.All modes are described on this page: https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open
