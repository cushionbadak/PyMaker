Natural Text
I've got a dataframe. Column B contains 4-character hexidecimal values:I am only interested in the first two characters of the hex in Column B. I want to replace Column B with the only the first two characters in the hex, and then convert them to decimal.So the end result should be a data frame that looks like this:I can't even figure how to get the first two characters sub-setted. This seems like it should work, but it doesn't:Any help would be greatly appreciated.
You can slice the column using str[:2] and then call apply and use a lambda to convert the hex to decimal:
Just a stylistic difference, but instead of using a lambda you could also pass the keyword argument base for int() directly to apply.
