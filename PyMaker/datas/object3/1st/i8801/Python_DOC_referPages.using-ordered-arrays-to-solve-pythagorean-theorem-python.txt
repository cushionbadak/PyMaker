Okay, in Pythagorean Theorem, you need the hypotenuse to be the longest length. I was able to sort my array that will automatically order my values from smallest to greatest. Now, the problem is what do I do with the values? The user in the program doesn't know what the longest length (user inputs coordinates) and the computer graphs the three points and uses distance formula to see the lengths between the three sides. Here's the code that can sort the values.So, for example, if the user plot 3 random points (lets use (3,5),(10,10),(19,20))I made the program print the array distance numbers.If I plug in these three numbers, I know it'll work. I made the program tell you these leg measurements would make it scalene, and its an obtuse triangle.But what if the user made the points without paying attention to the side lengths?What I'm really asking is how I can use the array as seen above and implement into the Pythagorean theorem, from smallest value to largest. Thanks so much for helping!!
I think this might be a better approach, assuming your three lengths are currently numbers (ints or floats or even strings) in the variables x, y, and z:Note, however, that due to inaccuracies in floating-point arithmetic, there will be some failures to detect right triangles, because, for example, 25.0 != 25.000000000001... If you want to get around that, you need to use something like if abs(a - b) < epsilon for some suitably small epsilon.Without the first three lines, the code should work correctly for all integer values, though, because then all calculated values will be integers (or longs), and the arithmetic should be exact.
