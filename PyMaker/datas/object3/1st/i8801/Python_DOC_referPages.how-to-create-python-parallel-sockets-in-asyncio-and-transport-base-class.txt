I used asyncio for my non-stop server in python and implemented connection_made , connection_lost , data_received funtions in my ServerClientProtocolI used this class first beacause of using multiple times repeatedly sending data to socket class socket got closed and program exitedand second becuase I thought its async and have parallel answering multiple coming sockets in same time,but it's not.how should I use that in one async thread and parallel answering socket?this is my code:
server.server() might be blocking the other connections.  If this is a long-running call, try using asyncio.start_server (example here) instead, and call server.server() using await loop.run_in_executor(None, server.server, data)
