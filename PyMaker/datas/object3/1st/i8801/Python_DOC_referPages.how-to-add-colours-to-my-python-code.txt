Natural Text
Just wanting to know how I can add colours to my outputs. Code below:Using python tkinter gui. 
So, the main problem is that in tkinter, the Label widget accepts a single color.You might compose your text of various labels, side by side, if you pack each with .pack(side="left") - and assign a color to each widget. That is not too practical.The other ay of coloring text is using a tkinter.Text widget instead.  The problem is that on the opposite side of Label, the Text widget is too broad and allows a lot of options to format text inside it.  With a couple hundred lines, a program using a "Text" widget as its main component could become a Text Editor for rich text, in the way of Microsoft Word.The downside is that documentation is hard to find, with few examples, and incomplete. (That is my main  motivation in getting you this answer - one more "real World" example won't be bad).The most complete (but still lacking) documentation for the Text widget is here: http://effbot.org/tkinterbook/text.htmBy reading it, you find out that to be able to enter colored text in a Text widget you have to pre-configure  "tags" with the text attribute, and then use its insert your text using an index as position, and marking up which tags you are using.I made a subclass of the Text widget which hardcodes some style elements (and the "state" configuration), so that it behaves more like a Label - and added two new methods: append which allows you to add text to the end of the element, specifying a color and a background color, and clear, to clear all its contents and start over.The idea is that you use the "ColoredLabel" class I list bellow in place of your "Label" widgets. As it inherits from a tkinter Widget, methods such as "configure", "pack", "grid", will work normally  - and then use its "append" method to create its contents:And if yours "answer_label" attribute is defined as a "ColoredLabel", you just write your code as:(Of course, if you want the whole label to be the same color, Label has support to it - just do self.answer_label['foreground'] = 'red' on your original text)
