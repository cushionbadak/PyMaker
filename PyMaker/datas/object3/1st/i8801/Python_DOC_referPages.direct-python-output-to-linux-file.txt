This question already has an answer here:Correct way to write line to file?                    10 answers                I have a script written in python which I am running on ubuntu. I would like the output of this command to be directed into the file. print str(kFx) + ',' + str(kFy) + ',' + str(kFz) I would ideally use the python.py > file.txt but the script has some interactive parts which I won't be able to use if I redirect the output to a file. I tried changing the code to this but I get syntax errors. I literally use python for the first time so excuse my lack of knowledge. Any ideas on how to do that? Thank you,Alex
you can open the file with file=open("output.txt", "a")) like you did. then instead of printing you would use becasue you opened the file in append mode (denoted by the "a" in open) it would add this string to the end of the file. you might also need to add a new line after your string:when you are done writing:
On Python 3, it could look like:I've added space after the comma for readability. See What does ** (double star) and * (star) do for parameters?On Python 2, you could add from __future__ import print_function at the top of your script and convert to string manually ", ".join(map(str, kF)) or just:You could use kF object instead of kFx, kFy, kFz e.g., a tuple/list:or for readability, you could use collections.namedtuple to create a custom class:It enables kF.x, kF.y, kF.z syntax. If you need a mutable object, you could use types.SimpleNamespace:On Python 2, you could partially emulate it using class Point3D: pass.For a richer functionality, you could try attrs package:To run this and other code examples that require third-party Python packages from PyPI, you could use fades for convenience (to install, run: sudo apt-get install fades). Though it is not necessary, you could just install dependencies manually instead: pip install attrs (make sure to run your script with the same python executable as pip: head -1 $(command -v pip)).To print kF to the file:To save it in JSON format:
If you use with-keyword; the file-stream will only stay open inside the block. Then you dont have to remember closing it when you are done.If you meant to append to file like echo "test" >> test.txt and not echo "test" > test.txtThen just change the open mode to 'a' instead of 'w'
