I need to use the ArUco C++ library for a part of my project where my main programming language is Python. I could not install python wrapper for ArUco on my system in Anaconda environment. It just throws errors. So I thought I could install and write a code in OpenCV in C++ and can transfer the result to my main Python code. Is it possible? 
Are you going to detect ArUco makers? If so, you may try OpenCV 3.2 with contrib modules which include a ArUco marker detection (aruco module) module. This Aruco in opencv webpage has python code example.You can get OpenCV3.2 with contrib prebuilt binary from this site for Python 3.5 or 3.6 on Windows 32-bit or 64-bit platforms. It can be installed to Anaconda by pip install {filename}.whl as conda install doesn't support whl file.
You can also use boost python to easily write python functions in C++!http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_63_0/libs/python/doc/html/index.htmlIn order to nicely pass OpenCV data to/from python, there is numpy support:http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_63_0/libs/python/doc/html/numpy/tutorial/ndarray.htmlI am not sure whether opencv data can directly be used somehow... Probably yes.
