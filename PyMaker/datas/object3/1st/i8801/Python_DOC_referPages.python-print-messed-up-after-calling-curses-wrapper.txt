Natural Text
I am having a problem with curses library in Python. Consider the following code:The problem is every text printed by "print" function is messed up even before calling "create_screen()" function which initiates the screen by "curses.initscr()" 
You can use print and input normally before and after your program uses curses. Also, you do not have to put all your code into main, and you don't have to pass the main function to curses, either. main is just a function like any other. Check out this simple example:This prints and asks for user input, then shows a curses screen, then goes back into "normal" printing mode.
