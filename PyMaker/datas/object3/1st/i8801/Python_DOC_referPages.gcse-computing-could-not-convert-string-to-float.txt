In this task we are to create a file, edit it with a user input and output said file. The extension to this is creating an average and total for the list and writing/reading the file with this new data. However, I keep on getting this error whenever I run it: ...even though I thought the list would not be in string value in the first place. Please help! Code below:
since item is a float, you cannot add it to a string.would work better.Aside, you have to close myFile before reopening it for reading
float() can convert a string representing a number to a floating point number.E.g: "3" is converted to 3.0When you pass a string of numbers it can't tell what is a number from another.E.g: "3 4 50 200000 3.0E20" If you want to convert all numbers in a string, you might want to do something like that:The result is [3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0]More about float here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#floatMore about split here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.split
Why don't you use numpy?Notice that the delimiter is the space.The numbers must be seaprated first, after that you can use them.
You need to change this line float(input("Input numbers: ")). Here you input is space separated numbers. So you can't convert a numbers separated spaces. You need to split all spaces and then convert. Here is modified code. With this you need some other changes also.
