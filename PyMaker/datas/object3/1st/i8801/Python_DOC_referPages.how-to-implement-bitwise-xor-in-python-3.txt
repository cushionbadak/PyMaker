i would like to implement XOR operation of 1000000^10100001.But im not getting the correct output. My w1 is:10100001 and my binary o.p w2 is:0b100110001011110110000010.I should get: 00100001
You need to use 0b... to denote binary number.Also when converting string to a number using int, specify base 2 (the second optional parameter). Otherwise it is interpreted as a decimal number:And, you don't need to call int for 0b10000000, because it's already an int object.UPDATE If you want to get a string representation back, use str.format or format with format specify 08b (0: leading zeros, 8: at least 8 digits, b: binary)
