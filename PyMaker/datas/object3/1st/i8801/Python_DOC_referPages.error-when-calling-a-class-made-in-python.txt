i have created a class called errors in which i am trying to do some errors analysis. i keep getting the error code:TypeError: unbound method just_print() must be called with errors instance as first argument (got ndarray instance instead)i am trying to use the just_print method in order to just use it print the result to the interpreter module by passing it the two arrays x,y as years and temps.Thank you for any help :Dmy original code is al follows: 
You are tying to access test.just_print(years, temps) where test is not a instance of class, please create object.You have to declare just_print method a staticmethod or change its signature as def just_print(self, x,y): and call with instance.
