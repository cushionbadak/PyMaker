I have this code parsing command line arguments:When I run a command line with an argument that starts with j argparse AFTER the -j argument argparse will replace the -j argument with the remainder of the word:Example:program.py -j orange -jungleargparse will return args.juice = "ungle" instead of the desired "orange"I have created a workaround but I'm curious if anyone else has seen this or knows the reason why it is happening?  Or is this maybe a bug in argparse?
This is expected behaviour. For single-dash options the space is optional. So these two are equivalent:See the Option value syntax section of the documentation:For short options (options only one character long), the option and its value can be concatenated:If you want to pass in orange -jungle as the value, you need to use quoting on the command line:If you want to pass in additional positional arguments that just happen to start with a -, use -- to signal the end of the option flags:See the Arguments containing - section:If you have positional arguments that must begin with - and donâ€™t look like negative numbers, you can insert the pseudo-argument '--' which tells parse_args() that everything after that is a positional argument:
