Is it possible to do the followingThis worksBut I don't know the second part of the object until the code is being run, I think what I want is thisThis would have the same outcome as the above. Does that make sense?
Indeed, setattr and a dictionary would do the trick.Hope this helps!
You keep saying usethismodule.<something>. So let's pretend you're right.Python maintains a dict of currently imported modules in sys.modules. You can look up a module, by name, and get an "object". (A module object, in fact.)If you have an object in hand, you can either hard-code an access to one of its attributes, or use getattr or setattr on it.
