This question already has an answer here:How to iterate through two lists in parallel?                    8 answers                I have a list of data called ID, and another list called Dates. They are paired data, and the lists are of equal lengths, approximately 800,000 items long each. I want to pair each item from each list, put them into a tuple, and append these tuples into another list. I.e.:Here's my try. It seems like it works, but when I tried to use it on the actual lists, my computer crashed because it couldn't handle the data. Any tips on a faster way to do this? 
You are looking for the zip function, which will return (in Python 3) a zip object that you can iterate through:You can also call list on the object if you want the full list:
Use izip from the itertools module. This creates an iterator from your lists instead of building another one and this way saves memory.
