I'm looking for a way how to evenly distribute objects according to their attributes to list. For example:I want to reorder this list to make all fruits of the same kind apart as much as possible. The solution for this simple example is:So orange,apple,orange,orange,apple,orange is one of the correct solutions. This is a simplified example. In fact, it is about scraping huge number of urls. I scrape those urls using pool of 100 workers. There can be multiple urls with the same site so I want to distribute them evenly because I don't want to overload someones server. Do you have an idea what to solve this? Or is there some module which can do that?
