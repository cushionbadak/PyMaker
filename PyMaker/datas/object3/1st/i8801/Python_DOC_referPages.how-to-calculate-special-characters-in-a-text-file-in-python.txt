Natural Text
I want to calculate the number of non-alphanumeric characters in a text file, so that I can use that count as a feature in my feature set for text classification.Any help would be greatly helpful.
You can simply iterate over the file and use the str.isalnum() method to count the number of non-alphanumerical characters.So something like:So after the loop, the count_special contains the total number of non-alphanumerical characters.By parsing one line at a time, this method will usually be able to process large text files, since it does not have to load the entire file into memory first.
You can use this way. You have to define list of special characters as regex:And find number of special characters as a length of re.findall:
This function will return the number of non alpha numeric chacacters in a file:
You can use string method "isalnum" (https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.isalnum) which return False if string contain non-alphanumeric characters.
