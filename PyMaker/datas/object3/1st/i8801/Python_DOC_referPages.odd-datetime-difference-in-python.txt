Could someone tell me how come python shows a difference of 1310 seconds between two dates?
As you can read here a timedelta object has three fields: days; seconds; and microseconds. Or as is specified in the documentation:class datetime.timedelta(days=0, seconds=0, microseconds=0, milliseconds=0, minutes=0, hours=0, weeks=0)(...)Only days, seconds and microseconds are stored internally. Arguments are converted to those units:A millisecond is converted to 1000 microseconds.A minute is converted to 60 seconds.An hour is converted to 3600 seconds.A week is converted to 7 days.(formatting added)Althout the constructor is timedelta(days=0, seconds=0, microseconds=0, milliseconds=0, minutes=0, hours=0, weeks=0) and thus provides ways to enter hours, it thus converts the minutes, hours, etc. all to seconds. The constructor will look like:(but probably a bit more advanced, etc.)So that means that .seconds actually is modulo day, and without microseconds.You can however use timediff.total_seconds to return the total amount of seconds:So total_seconds() is basically:If you divide your 1310 by 60, you will see that it returns:so 21 minutes and 50 seconds
