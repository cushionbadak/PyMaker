When I use the operator in to compare strings in my program it works great but if I call it in a module I created it doesn't seem to work. I know I am making some error but not certain what it is, can anyone help?Here is my code:Module:code works though when not in module as shown here:Basic program takes a list of words in from a file and then looks to see if a particular root is in the word.  Thanks
The function is doing root in word but I think what you actually want to do is root in wordCheckedGlobal variables are the devil. best to avoid them if you can help it.Suggestion - if writing Python code that other people might look at ( hint: probably any/all code) it's a good idea to read through and follow PEP-8
