Natural Text
I am saving a text file in python after processing it as follows:This file takes by default today's date as the last modified date. Is there a way I can change this and force-give it my own desired last modified date?
In os.utime(outputfile, (atime_ns, mtime_ns)), atime_ns is access time in nanoseconds and mtime_ns is modified time in nanoseconds.In this example, 56000000 corresponds to the following:Date in India timezone*: 10/11/1971, 9:03:20 AMDate in Los Angeles*: 10/10/1971, 8:33:20 PMDate in Berlin* :10/11/1971, 9:03:20 AMDate in Beijing*: 10/11/1971, 10:33:20 AMDate in New York* :10/10/1971, 10:33:20 PMIt will change last modified and access date of the file you are dealing with. You may find the reference for os.utime on https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.htmlHope it helps.
You can use os.utime:
