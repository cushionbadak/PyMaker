Basically, I have created an Excel addon which connects to Odoo ERP server using xmlrpc and gets an array object. Everything is working well except when number of records are huge, it fails and throws memory error.Could someone suggest a better practice to achieve this functionality where the data volume is huge. Below code I am trying on server side in Python.Thanks,Burhan
