I want to access ctype.Structure with I have defined, as a bytes in Python (b''). I don't know it is a correct way? I need to send a header (it should be architecture free) to other device. So I defined it for example as:Now I need to calculate CRC. Start from filed at version to compilation_time I have a function that work with bytes. So for me it would be OK just convert ctypes.Structure to bytes (b'') or access directly memory and change last two bytes.I have tried use struct but I didn't found pragma option.
struct is what you want:< means pack little-endian and will not add padding bytes like C would, so no _pack_ is necessary.  If you need big-endian, use > instead.I used 6s and passed a byte string of the correct length for your time.  If you want to pass raw bytes instead use 6B and list the 6 bytes instead of the one string.Here's a ctypes solution.  I used crc32 because one was available in the library for demo purposes.Output:
