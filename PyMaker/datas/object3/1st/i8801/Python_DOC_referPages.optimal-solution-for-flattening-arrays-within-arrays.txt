Looking for an optimal solution .The structure I have is Is there any better solution than the following?
You could use itertools.chain:N.B. target_list could possibly also look like this:
I'd say [v for l in a.values() for sl in l for v in sl] (or [[v] for..., if you really want a bunch of single-element lists for some reason) would be tidier. Note that it might not be sorted in the order you had in mind, so if that's important you may need to sort manually at some point (depending on your Python version and implementation).
