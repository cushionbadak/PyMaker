Natural Text
Is there an alternate method to read a text file in python apart from using open()? I am using the below code, but I want to know if there's any alternative method to do it. Thanks.
If you want to read line by line you can do this. 
You can also use a context manager like this:In your example you simply open the file, you do not read anything yet. For basic questions like this you should refer to the official python tutorial at python.org.
