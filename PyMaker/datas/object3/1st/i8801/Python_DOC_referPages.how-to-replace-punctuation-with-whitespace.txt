If the input isI would want the output to be: I am having trouble replacing punc with whitespace
Like @DYZ said, you just need another conditional statement that replaces the special characters with spaces:Output would look like what you wanted: hey  m y nam e i s
You forgot to add a space ' ' when the character is punctuation. Also, punc_list does not actually have to be a list; you can just make it one long string and iterate the characters, or as noted in comments, just use string.punctuation. And to improve lookup speed, you could also make it a set, but it really should not matter much in this case:Or a bit shorter, using a ternary expression ... if ... else ...:Or even shorter, using str.join:Or even shorter, using regular expressions re:
Is the homework question supposed to help you learn about loops? Learning about dicts and translate is useful too i think.
Use str.translate. To convert all the characters in the punc_list to spaces.You can create a dictionary mapping on the fly using a dict comprehension, which maps all the punctuation character codes (uses ord function) to a space.
I would just add an else statement to if i not in punc_list: so that the code looks like this:All this does is say:If the character isn't in the punctuation list add it to the new string.If it is in the punctuation list add a whitespace to the new string instead.
See this code , with using 2 loops :
