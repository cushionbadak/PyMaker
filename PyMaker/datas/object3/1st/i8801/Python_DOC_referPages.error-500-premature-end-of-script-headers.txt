I know this is a fairly common question but I've left no digital stone unturned and still can't find an answer that works for me.I am running MAMP and Pythons 2.x and 3.x on a Mac running macOS Sierra. I am trying to learn Python CGI scripting and I am going through this tutorial.So far, I am at the point where I test CGI (here). I've uploaded my file to the server with the name index.cgi, in /Applications/MAMP/cgi-bin/index.cgi. However, when navigating to http://localhost/cgi-bin/index.cgi I get 500 - Internal Server Error. This occurs regardless of whether I save as a .cgi or .py.Here's what I've tried:Consulting the Apache docsChecking file permissionsAdjusting the Content-TypeEnsuring my file is in UNIX formatChecking the Apache error log (Applications/MAMP/logs/apache_error.log)Note: I have also tried clearing them and then reloading to isolate the individual error - it doesn't help. All I get is [TIMESTAMP] [error] [client ::1] Premature end of script headers: index.pyHere's the code in index.py/index.cgi:Any help would be hugely appreciated!
Have you tried setting the ScriptLog directive to get a more detailed error message?
