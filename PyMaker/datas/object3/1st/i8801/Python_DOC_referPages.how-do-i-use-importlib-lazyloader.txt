In my module, I have a couple of functions that depend on an external module with a long startup time.  How do I use LazyLoader?  If I haveororhow would I replace those statements to use LazyLoader such that the execution of the contents of the module are postponed until needed?It is not immediately obvious from the documentation how to use it.  There is no example, and nullege code search only comes up with the unit test included with Python itself.
The original issue has some code that seems to to a full import lazily:The following files imports two modules lazily:To test, I used the following in myown.py.That worked nicely (Python 3.8a0).
