Natural Text
I've created this code to analyse an input sentence to allow for the user to search for a certain word within it. However, I can't seem to figure out how to make it so all the punctuation in the input sentence is disregarded. I need this because, if a sentence such as "hello there, friend" is input, the word "there" is counted as "there," and so if the user is searching for "there" it says it is not in the sentence. Please help me. I'm really new to python.

You could split the string on all punctuation marks:
This is a little long winded maybe but in python3.There are a couple of advanced concepts in here.Filter will take a function and an iterible returning a generator with the items that don't return true from the functionhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#filterLambda will create an anonymous function that will check each letter for us.https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#lambdax.isalpha() will check that the letter in question is actually a letter. followed by x == ' ' to see it it could be a space.https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=isalpha#str.isalpha''.join will take the results of the filter and put it back into a string for you.https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=isalpha#str.join
Or you could use nltk package for tokenizing your text which does the sentence tokenization as you would be expecting and it also avoids the common pitfalls of punctuation as 'Mr.' --> This will not be broken down based on the punctuation.OUTPUTSo I guess you should try using nltk package and see if it works.Click this link here for better understanding. Hope this helps :)
