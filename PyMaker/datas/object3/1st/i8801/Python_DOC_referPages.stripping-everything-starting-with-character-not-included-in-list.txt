With code:I'm getting list of strings like '189.00 z\xc5\x82'. I would like to remove z\xc5\x82 part from every element of list. I can use .strip(' z\xc5\x82') but I rather would like to remove everything starting from first character (from left) that is not in list ['0','1','2','3','4','5','6','7','8','9','.']because string to remove may differ in some cases.
