python-2.x has a list of non-essential built in functions but python-3.x has no such list, and clearly there are built in functions in python-2.x that are no longer in python-3.x.  Is there a list somewhere of all the python-2.x built in functions that were removed in python-3.x?
The list of removed built-ins in 3.0 can be found here.There are a few functions that were renamed:intern() was moved to sys.intern().raw_input() was renamed to just input(). The old behaviour can be emulated by using eval(input()).reduce() was moved to functools.reduce().reload() was moved to imp.reload() in 3.0, and subsequently moved to importlib.reload in 3.4.xrange() was renamed to range(), replacing the old range() builtin.And one function resurrected:callable(), which was removed in 3.0 and resurrected in 3.2.
