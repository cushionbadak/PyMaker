In this example code, I would like to determine if x is an instance of TestProperty:However, I get the following exception:Is there anyway to tell if an attribute is an instance of a class when it is a descriptor?
With the current __get__, Test.x causes the AttributeError because when the code accessing the descriptor using class, instance is passed None; (=> getattr(None, 'x') => None.x)You should modify __get__ to handle such case:BTW, as you may know, with x = TestProperty("x"), accessing x attribute through an instance will cause another exception, because it will call the __get__ (-> getattr(..) -> __get__ -> getattr(..) -> ...) recursively until stack overflow.
The best way to implement a property is with the @property decorator:It returns True when I run it.See the documentation for @property at https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#property.
