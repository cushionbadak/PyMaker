I keep getting the "NameError: name 'scipy' is not defined", when I know I've downloaded and imported scipy.Any tips? Here's my code:Thanks!!
try withthe problem is that you import the module scipy.integrate and bound it to the variable integrate with the instruction as, that is why you get the name error in scipy.integrate.ode(eq1), scipy is not in your namespace, just integrate; if you want to include scipy it then import it as so you can use its other featuresor just without the as
