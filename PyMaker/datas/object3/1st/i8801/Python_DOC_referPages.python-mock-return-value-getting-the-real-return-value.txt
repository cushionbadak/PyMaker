When using patch.object in order to mock a method, is there a way to specify that for certain parameters values, the method will run as it was not mocked at all, and will return the "real" return_value, and for other parameters values to set a specific return_value?Thanks.
Here's a solution (modified from where I've used it) that works reasonably well.  It involves setting side_effect of the patch to a function.The takeaway here is you can provide a smarter implementation of the function you are patching as side_effect: https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html#unittest.mock.Mock.side_effect
