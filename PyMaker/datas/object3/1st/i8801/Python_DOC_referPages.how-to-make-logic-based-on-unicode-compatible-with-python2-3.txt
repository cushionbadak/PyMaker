I want to make this code compatible with python2-3 : There is no unicode or decode on str type in python 3. What is the best workaround to make this code python2-3 compatible?
I highly recommend using six library for writing Python 2/3 compatible code.Plus use isinstance() for checking type instead of type(). type() won't work in case of multiple-inheritance:Other approach is to basically write your own aliases for compatibility based on Python version obtained using sys.version_info:A good example of this is compat.py file from requests library:Now you can import these functions from this file instead of using the builtins directly.
