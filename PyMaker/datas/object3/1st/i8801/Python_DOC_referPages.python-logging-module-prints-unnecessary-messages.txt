Please consider this dummy code.Output:Question: How to avoid below lines from being printed? If I change logging.basicConfig(level='INFO',... to logging.basicConfig(level='WARNING',... then Those messages are not printed, but then all my messages get logged with WARNING severity. I just want the logging module to print the messages that I explicitly write using logger.info .... and nothing else. Hence I need any pointers on how to avoid the unnecessary messages from being printed.
Solution:Output:Explanation:Earlier, I set the  INFO level on root logger. Hence, all other loggers who do not have a level set, get this level propagated and start logging. In the  solution, I am specifically enabling this level on a logger LUCIFER.Reference:from: https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.htmlChild loggers propagate messages up to the handlers associated with their ancestor loggers. Because of this, it is unnecessary to define and configure handlers for all the loggers an application uses. It is sufficient to configure handlers for a top-level logger and create child loggers as needed. (You can, however, turn off propagation by setting the propagate attribute of a logger to False.)ANDIn addition to any handlers directly associated with a logger, all handlers associated with all ancestors of the logger are called to dispatch the message (unless the propagate flag for a logger is set to a false value, at which point the passing to ancestor handlers stops).
