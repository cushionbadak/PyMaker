So when constructing a list of tuples, the order within some of the tuples seems to mix up. The content within each_file[2] will be before the content each_file[1] randomly.Example output from printing filelist:Information about about the code below:projectDict is a list of pandas.dataframe objectsIs this a result of using itertuples, or is there another glaring error within my code? I used iterrows and had the same issue. I also have verified that the data is not structured in the way of the output.
You write:Now the syntax {a,b,...,z} is a set. In a set, an element occurs at most once and the order is undetermined. Like is written in the documentation:A set object is an unordered collection of distinct hashable  objects. Common uses include membership testing, removing duplicates  from a sequence, and computing mathematical operations such as  intersection, union, difference, and symmetric difference.The syntax for a tuple is (a,b,...,z). So you should change the line to:Or - as @Matthias says - you can even omit the rounded brackets and only use the comma:Nevertheless, you can here use slicing, since each_file is already a tuple:Here you slice from index 1 (inclusive) to index 3 (exclusive).Finally you can use list comprehension to turn your entire program into a one liner:or even more elegantly:
