I am creating a rock paper scissors lizard spock game in Python for my class and i am trying to figure out why whatever choice I make I am always winning even though I set up all my if statements correct. ``
To summarize all of the things you should pay attention to:boolean conditions - the result changes with the parentheses that are inside the condition. if True or (True and False) --> this basically calculates the True and False part first (like in regular math) and then you have True or False which evaluates to True. if True or True and False --> this basically calculates the True or True part first (like in regular math) and then you have True and False which evaluates to False - because you don't use parentheses. Do not call a function within the same function - this is called recursion, and it's not for the what you need. Use a while loop, that runs as long as i.e. -  you didn't get a proper choice input (while choice!='n' and choice!='y':).Your instrcuions choice - the choice made by the user doesn't really change the flow of the game. the game starts also if the user entered no. You should Add an exit statement in the instructions function.
The reason is you are missing parentheses on all of the "if" conditions.
