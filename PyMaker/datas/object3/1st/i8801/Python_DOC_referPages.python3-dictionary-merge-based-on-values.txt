I have a dictionary composed of {key: value}.I select a set of keys from this dictionary.I'd like to build a new dictionary with {keyA: set of all keys wich have the same value as keyA}.I already have a solution: Is there a faster way to do it?It seems very slow to me, and I imagine I'm not the only one in this case!
So you want to create a dictionary that maps key to "the set of all keys which have the same value as key" for each selected key in a given source dictionary.Thus, if the source dictionary is:and the selected keys are a, b, and e, the result should be:One way to achieve this would be to use a defaultdict to build a value to key table, and then use that to build the required result from the specified keys:Output:
Try this 
or just use collections.defaultdict(set) if you are careful enough not to access any non key later :-)
Since you select a set of keys from the original dictionary. We can modify @Nilesh solution for your purpose.
This was sort of stated in the comments by @Patrick Haugh:
