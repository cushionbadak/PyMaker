I have a problem with segmenting a pd.DataFrame (or pd.Series) at a point the value switches.For example, I have a data likeas you can see, As and Bs and Cs are arranged in chunks.What is the most pythonic way to manage them in to segments?I believe the code will be produce a array-like data that is like:which is a list of the names for the segments.
Most pythonic way would be using itertools.groupby() But your output format needs some work as it only holds 10 numbers (0-9) what's the difference between character '11' and '1' when it's repeated several times like that.
