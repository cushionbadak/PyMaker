I hate thinking about these changing lists altogether.  The more pythonic version is with list comprehensions:
A more concise solution would be:Output:Explanation:for s in lucky will iterate through all strings in lucky. With s.split() we then split each string s into the words it is made up of. Using len(w), we then obtain the length (number of characters) for each word w in s.split().
