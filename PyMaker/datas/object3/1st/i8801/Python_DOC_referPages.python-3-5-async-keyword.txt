I am currently looking into pulsar for an asynchronous HTTP client.The following example is in the docs:but when I try to execute it I get It looks like the async keyword is not recognized. I am using Python 3.5.Working example:
you can only use async with inside a coroutines, so you have to do thisinternally pulsar use asyncio, so you don't have to import it explicitly to use it, use it through pulsaras a side note, if you upgrade to python 3.6 you can use async list/set/etc comprehension
