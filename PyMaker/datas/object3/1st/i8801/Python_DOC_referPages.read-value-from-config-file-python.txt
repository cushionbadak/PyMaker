I have a file .env file contain 5 linesI want to write python to grab the value of DB_DATABASEI want this bheng-localI would have use But some people might change the order of the cofigs, that's why linecache is not my option. I am not sure how to check for only some strings match but all the entire line, and grab the value after the =.I'm kind of stuck here : Can someone please give me a little push here ? 
Have a look at the config parser:https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.htmlIt's more elegant than a self-made solution
This should work for you
