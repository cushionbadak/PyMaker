How can non-iterable kwargs be included in the map function of concurrent.futures? For example, in the code below, how can c be called as False for all function calls of single? That is, single(iterable_a[i], iterable_b[i], c=False) where i is an int between 0 and 3.
You can use a functools.partial for that:will generate a function single2 where c is set to False. So you can use:So your map calls a function generated from partial(single,c=False) and you map with that function.
