The Python docs about asyncio - Subprocess say:The communicate() and wait() methods donâ€™t take a timeout parameter: use the wait_for() functionIt's pretty easy to impose a timeout on communicate() using wait_for(), however I can't find a way to retrieve the partial results from the interrupted communicate() call, and subsequent calls to communicate() doesn't return the lost part either.Example script:Output from the example script:Notice that only the last 2 packets are printed. Output about the first 2 packets are lost.So, how should I get the output from the subprocess before the timeout happened?Edit: To be more precise, ideally what I'm looking for something that:Does what communicate() does, i.e. asynchronously write to a subprocess's STDIN and read its STDOUT and STDERR, without possibility of deadlocking (that the docs ominously warn about);has a configurable total timeout, so that when either the subprocess terminates or the timeout is reached, the received STDOUT and STDERR so far are returned.Looks like such a thing does not exist yet, and one would have to implement it.
You have to use process.stdout:See the example in the user documentation.
For the second part of your question, "how should I get the output from the subprocess before the timeout happened?" I would suggest using asyncio.wait() which does not cancel the task (p.communicate()) instead of asyncio.wait_for() (which cancels the task):Regarding "retrieve the partial results" , I would suggest not to use communicate() which calls stdout.read() and use a different approach:Combining the two solutions (and using readline() instead of the much cooler async for) gives:Notice the timeout (1 second) is per line.

If killing subprocess after timeout was expected, you could get the partial output like this:
