I'm ssh'd into a remote server, and there I created to python files as a test: one to create a database, and one to read data from it. The script that creates the databaseHere the print commands the data that is required, e.g. it prins the ID's of the images. In my script to read the data from the db:I have a limited knowledge of sqlite3, but I would expect the print command in the second script to print the ID's found in the images table, from the Materials.db, yet it returns an empty array.
