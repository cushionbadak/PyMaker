Having following file handler.pyAnd following test test_handler.pyHow can I mock job function, taking into account that handler.py is called in subprocess
This isn't the best approach to test this feature.Since it is a unit test, you should test the worker and check it's value.handler.pytest_handler.pyCheck if the result of method is equal to the expected. And so, adjust the method/test.Anyway, this is an example, based on you question code.
