Split function on official python site is as split(pattern, string, maxsplit=0, flags=0)But when I check it on spyder it is split(sep=None, maxsplit=-1) Is string argument removed from split() function in python 3.6?If not then why can't I pass a string arg in it? 
The first split is from the re moduleThe second is a str methodThe way you call the str.split method is off a str object like the following
