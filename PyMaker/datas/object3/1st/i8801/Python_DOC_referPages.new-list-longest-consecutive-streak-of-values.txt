I want program that outputs a list consisting of the longest streak of consecutive occurrences of the same value in L in PYTHON.In case multiple values have the equal number of streak, smallest value is chosen.Input:Output:Code
Just use itertools.groupbyThere are actually two groups of 3, so I presume you want the first of such groups.groupby returns two things. The grouped element and the group, we only care about the later. So we make a list of just the grouper elements, use list to convert them from grouper objects, which have no len function. Now we can use max to determine the largest element, returning the first such element in the event of a tie. We need to use a key function as using max on lists themselves has no meaning. So pass len as the key function used to determine maxness.I notice you ask that the item with the lowest value is selected, rather than the first in the list. This complicates matter a little. Although your code makes no effort to account for it, heres a solution. Instead now you have to create a list just of the elements that have the longest length [[3,3,3], [7,7,7]] and select the value with the lower value.Trying to do this in a one liner might be a bit much.Try switching the final min call for a max and see that a different entry is chosen.Or more simply, as pointed out by @ShadowRanger in comments, you can return a tuple of length and negated value from the key function to favour lower values in the event of a tie in length. To favour larger values, remove the negation.
Below python code will do the same. @Paul's version is more Pythonic
