Natural Text
here defining a variable:and it print out ok like this : {"website":"hello"}, but i want to pass a dynamic value to its value, so its format should like this: {\"website\":\"{0}\"}.format(msg), but it output a KeyError, I have no idea of this Error, and change all kinds of string format such as triple quotation and change {0} with %s, but all seems useless. how can i solve it.
My suggestion is using json.loads()What you can do is using json.loads() convert the json string to dictionary and then change the value, finally convert it back to string
