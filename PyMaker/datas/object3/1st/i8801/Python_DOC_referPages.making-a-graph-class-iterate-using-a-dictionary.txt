I am trying to build a iterable graph class with python 2.7. I want  to be able to iterate though a dictionary containing the vertexes.Cutting and pasting from    https://github.com/joeyajames  has got me so far but  now  I am confused as to how  to make this work so that I can test vertices dict for  the presence of an vertice and  add if not present. This part is maybe unneeded."if (a not in gra ):" because the validation is done in the Graph class itself.The expected output is a dictionary with the vertices as keys. Actualy im not even sure a list is not better object to use.
You are trying to use not in, which tests for containment; implement the __contains__ hook to facilitate that:I've assumed you wanted to test for vertices, so create one before testing for containment:For iteration, I'd not make Graph itself the iterator; that limits you to iterating just once. Your next() method also lacks a return statement, so all you are doing is produce a sequence of None objects.Make it an iterable instead, so return a new iterator object each time __iter__ is called. You can most simply achieve this by making __iter__ a generator:Note the yield. I've assumed you wanted to iterate over the vertices.
