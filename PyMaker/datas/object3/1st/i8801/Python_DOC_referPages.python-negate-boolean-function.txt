A python boolean function can easily be negated with lambda functions, but it's a bit verbose and hard to read for something so basic, for example:I'm wondering if there is a function to do this in the standard library, which might look like:
As far as I know there is no builtin function for that, or a popular library that does that.Nevertheless, you can easily write one yourself:You can then use:The negate functions works for an arbitrary amount of parameters of the given function: if you would have defined is_dividable(x,n=2). Then negate(is_dividable) is a function with two arguments (one optional) that would also accept these parameters.
In case of filter you can use ifilterfalse from itertools.
You can create a decorator:This decorator can also be used with @negate.
