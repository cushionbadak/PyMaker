As you can read in the documentation of str.join:Return a string which is the concatenation of the strings in the iterable iterable. A TypeError will be raised if there are any non-string values in iterable, including bytes objects. The separator between elements is the string providing this method.So the ' 0x' is a separator that is put between the strings. You can however easily solve this with:
str.join() only places the joiner between the joined elements. From the str.join() documentation:The separator between elements is the string providing this method.(Bold emphasis mine).Join on a space instead, and change the format to include the 0x prefix:The # changes the format to include the 0x prefix for you; do take into account that you need to adjust the field width to take the extra 2 characters into account (each field now takes up 4 characters, including the 0x prefix).Demo:
