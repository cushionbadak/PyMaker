I am new to python testing. I am using pytest and started learning about mocks and patches. I am trying to write a test case for one of my methods.helper.pyThings I want to test are:Is the Draft4Validator class instantiated and the validate method is invoked with the json_data?Is ValidationError thrown and exit is called?Here is my attempt at writing a test case so far. I decided to patch open method & Draft4Validator class.I wanted to pass some fake data and paths to my method instead of trying to pass real data. I got this error messageUPDATE:How do I go about creating patches for 2 methods specially Draft4Validator and how do I simulate ValidationError exception?
