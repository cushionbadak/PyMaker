Natural Text
I want to insert a string in a certain row, via String and Number of Position From:ToI have done much research, some replaces the value, so it was of no use, any ideas how to go about it? New from python, I tried translating my code from C++, but its kind of hard to do it in this language.My code so far:Please help. Thanks!
If it is a line-wise text file, then this would be a way to do it.Using with always closes files, even in case of errors or other unexpected events (the with statement manages contexts, not only for file handlers). Then, simply insert the item into the list and write the list back.If you don't want to modify the list in-memory, you could use the built-in enumerate in the second for-loop:But if you want to manipulate the CSV data in some way, you could just import csv.
