I am trying to post a http form and get the response. I understand "requests" might be the way to go. I am trying to post to the login form on this page: www.dust2.dk/Login comparing the response to check if I recieved the error "Der er ikke registreret nogen bruger med den email" ("There is no user registered with that email")Somehow the form is not being posted or the response is not being saved. I have tried searching around for a solution, to no avail. Here is my codeAs you might guess the result is: "Nope! Keep trying" If I print out the response r, i simply get the source of the page www.dust2.dk/Login. Do you have any pointers of what I might be doing wrong here?
I had to do something similar the other day by sending a post request in Python. I followed this. You need to import and use urllib and urllib2. EDIT: actually follow this guide instead if you're using Python 3.See if that does what you want.
