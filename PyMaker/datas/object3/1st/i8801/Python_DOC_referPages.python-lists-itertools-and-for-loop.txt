This question already has an answer here:How to iterate through two lists in parallel?                    8 answers                I have 2 lists of the same size. startn in list1 corresponds to endn in list2.I want to use both the lists in a single for loop for further calculations.Problem being: I want to use a combination of 2 elements from each list in the for loop. For example:I want to extract start1, start3 from list1 and end1, end3 from list2 and use these 4 values in a for loop. For a single list, to extract a combination of 2 elements, I know it's the following code:But how do I extract 2 values from list1 and the same corresponding values from list2 and use in a for loop?
You can zip the two lists and then use combination to pull out the values:
Use zip to combine the start and end lists together into a bunch of tuples: (s1, e1), (s2, e2), etc. Then do combinations of that:
There's probably a more Pythonic way but try this:Edit: on second thoughts this is the Pythonic way. I see other people have the same idea though.
