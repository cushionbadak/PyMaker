I have been asked to design a leader board,This is what I tried My csv file looks like thisI wish for it to display the person with the most wins first, can you help?
Try slurping the file into a list:Then sort all the rows on the key of most wins:You might want to stack several sorts, or define a more complex key, so that you can enforce ordering within equal numbers of wins (for example, 7 wins of 8 plays is better than 7 wins of 100 plays).
