This question already has an answer here:How to Repeat a piece of code a certain amount of times in python                    2 answers                I am very new to Python coding. My code asks the user for an integer input. How do I get a function to repeat the number of times the user inputs? I would also like to know how I would get the function to repeat a random number of times within a certain range without user intervention.
You would want to use for-loops. Import random and use randint(0,x) for example to get your random number, then loop for that num of times.
