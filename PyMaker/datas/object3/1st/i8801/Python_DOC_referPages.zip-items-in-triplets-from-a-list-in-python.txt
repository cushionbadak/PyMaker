I have a list A with valuesI need to zip it in the following way,Could anyone guide me to solve this?
zip will return a list which's length is equal to length of the shortest input sequence. As the last one (A[-1:]) have only 1 element, you can't use zip. Try something different like that one below.
You can use zip with itertools.repeat:
I'm not sure why you want to use zip here. For the given data you can just assemble the desired output like this:or if the list items must be tuples:But you can do it with zip and itertools.cycleoutputThis will work on any a of odd length.Instead of using itertools.cycle, you can use itertools.repeat, as in niemmi's answer.Another option is to zip with an iterator of the source list:output
P = zip(A[::2], A[1::2], A[-1:]*2) should give the expected output
