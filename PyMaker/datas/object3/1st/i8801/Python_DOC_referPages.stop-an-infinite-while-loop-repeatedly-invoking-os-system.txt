Thank you guys for seeing my post.First, the following is my code:My problem is that Ctrl + C does not work!I tried changing position of try block, and making signal(SIGINT) catching function.But those also does not work.I have seen https://stackoverflow.com/a/8335212/5247212, https://stackoverflow.com/a/32923070/5247212, and other several answers about this problem.I am using MAC OS(10.12.3) and python 3.5.2.
This is expected behaviour, as os.system() is a thin wrapper around the C function system(). As noted in the man page, the parent process ignores SIGINT during the execution of the command. In order to exit the loop, you have to manually check the exit code of the child process (this is also mentioned in the man page):However, the preferred (and more pythonic) way to achieve the same result is to use the subprocess module:Your code would then look like something like this:As an added note, subprocess.run() is only available in Python 3.5+. You can use subprocess.call() to achieve the same effect in older versions of Python.
Also catch "SystemExit"
The problem seems to be that Ctrl+C is captured by the subprocess you call via os.system. This subprocess reacts correspondingly, probably by terminating whatever it is doing. If so, the return value of os.system() will be not zero. You can use that to break the while loop.Here's an example that works with me (substituting say by sleep):
