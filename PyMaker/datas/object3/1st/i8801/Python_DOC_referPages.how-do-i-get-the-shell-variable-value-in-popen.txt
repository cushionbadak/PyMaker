I'm trying to pass some secrets to shell commands using environment variables. The Popen seems using "single quote concept" to escape the arguments so the commands cannot get the variable value. Expected output is the real $PATH values like "/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin..."Thanks!
You need a shell to evaluate your line:But if this is all you want then consider this:
Use shell=True, but be careful https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#security-considerations
Using shell is dangerous if the command line is filed from external sources, so use it with caution.Also, there is an optional parameter to decide where the shell should be when launching the command.
