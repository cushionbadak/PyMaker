Natural Text
I'm trying to get the code to return both the X and Y coordinates to the screen at the same time, but what I get after clicking in the window a few times is something that look like:123 200443 67104After I close the window the program spits out the last "84" and then reads:123 200443 67104 84But I want it to do that while i'm still in the window clicking on new points.Does anyone know what I'm doing wrong.
Fixed it> I was running in a old version of wing IDE 5.0.9 to be exact, so I updated to 6.0.1 and it worked. Note: My friend was using version 5.1.0 and it worked fine on his too.
