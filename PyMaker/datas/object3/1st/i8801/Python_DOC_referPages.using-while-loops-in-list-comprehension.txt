say I have a function:Is there anyway to convert it to a list comprehension like this?I get a syntax error
No, you cannot use while in a list comprehension.From the grammar specification of Python, only the following atomic expressions are allowed:The expression corresponding to a list comprehension - testlist_comp looks like the following in Python 3:Here, the only statements allowed arewhere There is not a single while statement allowed anywhere. The only keywords you are allowed to use is a for, for a for loop.SolutionUse a for loop, or take advantage of itertools
You don't need a list comprehension for that, range will just do:A while loop is not possible inside of a list comprehension, instead you could do something like this:
There's no syntax for this, but you can use itertools. For example:(That's not pythonic though, the generator solution or explicit solution should be preferred.)
