I'm currently learning Django however I'm torn on how to structure the equivalent of add method using it. I'm creating a URL shortener and I'm between the following methods to implement in creating the shortened URL:vs.Specifically, I want to know the best practice on the following:Is it best practice to explicity test if method is post or http_url = request.POST["http_url"] is enoughIs http_url = request.POST.get("http_url","") recommended to be used or this is just suppressing the error?If (2) is not recommended, how can I make the http_url required and throw an error? I also tried the following but the except block is not triggered when I submit a blank form
will throw a KeyError when the key is not present in the dictionary. You can use a try...catch clause to handle the error.Generally though, its idiomatic and perfectly normal to do:More about get here.
