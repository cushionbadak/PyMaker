There is no way to return False from issubclass when class is derived from class with __subclashook__ implementation. I modified code from:python subclasscheck & subclasshookI only added '(Sized)' to both class definitions:Is there any way to return False in this case? Or maybe I'm doing something wrong?
The problem is that you return NotImplemented when the __subclasshook__ doesn't exit early. And as stated in the documentation:If it returns NotImplemented, the subclass check is continued with the usual mechanism.So it uses the normal subclass check and finds that you do, in fact, inherit from Sized so returns True.There are two solutions:return False instead of return NotImplemented. However, do you really want/need issubclass to return False for direct subclasses?If you inherit from object for classes A and B it works as expected:
I think the good way to implement this:I think that when we assume that abc is mechanism similar to compilation (or reflection) in other languages we should return False. If there is some doubt the class is correct subbclass then code shouldn't run or even compile (not in python).
