I am relatively new to Python an was using Youtube videos to study. I wrote a small script on my own as follows.Only the func1() is executing. I want both of them to execute. Can someone please tell me how to do it.Thanks.
I see you are missing a ":" after def main() And it's executing both function for me when I put a print statement inside both functions.Result:Python 2.7.9 (default, Dec 10 2014, 12:24:55) [MSC v.1500 32 bit (Intel)] on win32Type "copyright", "credits" or "license()" for more information.================================ RESTART ================================in func1      in func2
The main method needs a : at the end to be completely/correctly declaredafter that everything will work fine :)final code: http://ideone.com/t2TmZkEdit:from another file:create the file  myExampleFuntion.py, then move func1 and func2 there, then in the original file import that doing import myExampleFuntion.pyand call them
