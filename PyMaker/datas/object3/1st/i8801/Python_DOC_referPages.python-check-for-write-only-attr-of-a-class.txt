I'm using a Class provided by a client (I have no access to the object code), and I'm trying to check if a object has a attribute. The attribute itself is write only, so the hasattr fails:Is there a different way to check if an attribute exists?
You appear to have some kind of native code proxy that bridges Python to an extension, and it is rather breaking normal Python conventionsThere are two possibilities:The driver.console.con object has a namespace that implements attributes as descriptors, and the input descriptor only has a __set__ method (and possibly a __delete__ method). In that case, look for the descriptor:Here the vars() function retrieves the namespace for the class used for driver.console.con.The proxy uses __getattr__ (or even __getattribute__) and __setattr__ hooks to handle arbitrary attributes. You are out of luck here, you can't detect what attributes either method will support outside of hasattr() and trying to set the attribute directly. Use try...except guarding:You may have to use a debugger or print() statement to figure out exactly what exception is being thrown (use a try...except Exception as ex: block to capture all exceptions then inspect ex); in the traceback in your question the exception message at the end looks decidedly non-standard. That project really should raise an AttributeError at that point.Given the rather custom exception being thrown, my money is on option 2 (but option 1 is still a possibility if the __get__ method on the descriptor throws the exception).
