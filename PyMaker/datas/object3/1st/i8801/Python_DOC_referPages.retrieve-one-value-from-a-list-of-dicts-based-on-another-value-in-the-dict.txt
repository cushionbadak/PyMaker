I have a dictionary created from a JSON document:With this data, I want to get the 'temp' value from the first dictionary in the 'hourly_forecast' list whose 'hour' is '22'.I know I could use the code below to get the first element:... but this data always changes based on the time I retrieve it, so if it was 1 PM it would be "hour": "13" first up.Basically I need help with pulling the 'temp' data based on the 'hour' value with a list that is always changing, so I can't just pull it based on element sequence.To sum it up, I'm stuck printing the 'temp' key from the 'hour' I want.
A good way to approach this is to narrow your search down step by step until you get just the piece of information you're looking for.First, use a list comprehension to get all the english temperatures, regardless of hour:Then restrict it to cases where the hour is '22':Now you've got the temperature you want, wrapped in a list. If you convert the list comprehension to a generator expression by replacing the brackets [] with parentheses (), you can call next() on it to get the first (and only, in this case) item:... et voil√†!
