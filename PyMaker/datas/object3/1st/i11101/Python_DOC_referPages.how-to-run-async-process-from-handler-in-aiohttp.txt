I'm trying to understand how to run an asynchronous process from coroutine handler within aioweb framework. Here is an example of code:I want to run process function asynchronously from the handler. Can someone provide an example how I can achieve that. I'm struggle to understand how I can pass/use main event loop within a handler and pass it around to another function which by itself can run async process within it.
I guess you should define your existing process function as a coroutine (async def should do the job to wrap your function as a coroutine) and use asyncio.ensure_future in your main handle function.According to asyncio documention the ensure_future method should schedule the execution of the coroutine (the process function in your case) without blocking/waiting for a result.I guess what you are looking for could be related to some existing posts like this one : "Fire and forget" python async/await
