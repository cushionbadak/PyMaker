Is there some more convenient way to write into python files than using read/write for any file (like txt files etc).I mean python knows what actually is the structure of python file, so if I need to write into it, maybe there is some more convenient way to do it?If there is no such way (or it is too complicated), then what would best way to normally modify python file just using normal write (example below)?I have lots of these files in my subdirectories called:__config__.pyThese files are used as configuration. And they have unassigned python dictionary, like this:So what I need to do, is write to all those __config__.py files new version (for example 'version': '1.0.0').UpdateTo be more specific, given that there is a python file with a content like this:Now running some python script, it should write into python file modifying given dictionary and after writing, output should be like this:So in other words, write should only modify version key value, and everything else should be kept like it was before writing.
I came up with solution. It is not very clean, but it works. If someone has a better answer, please write it.
In order to modify the config file, you can simply do sth like this:Notice that the print function here actually writes to a file.for more details on how the print function do the writing for you, see hereI hope it helps.
