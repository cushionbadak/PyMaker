In my python code, I call a function written in FreeFem++ and then I save the output from FreeFem++ code in a text file and I want to read this in python.The problem is that, when I run the python code, as the out.txt has not been created, it gives me an error saying the out.txt doesn't exist!
Use subprocess.run() to call your freefem++ program, and make sure that your call actually generates the file before it exists. You could check that by adding a breakpoint just before the open.So change to subprocess:To check that your file is indeed created before opening it:Finally, the most elegant solution would be for you to make that the freefem++ program outputs everything to stdout, and that you take that output through a pipe within python, using subprocess.popen():
