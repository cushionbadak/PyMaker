I'm following a tutorial on neural nets1It's in Python 2.7. I'm using 3.4. This is the line that troubles me:if test_data: n_test = len(test_data)I get: TypeError: object of type 'zip' has no len().Is there a way to rewrite it so that it works in 3.4?
If you know that the iterator is finite:Or if you know that test_data is always small and a profiler says that the code is the bottleneck in your application then here's code that might be more efficient for small n_test:Unfortunately, operator.length_hint() (Python 3.4+) returns zero for a zip() object. See PEP 0424 -- A method for exposing a length hint.
A bit late now to answer, but in case anyone else stumbles on it: for that same neural net example tutorial, it turned out I had to wrap the 3 zip calls in the mnist_loader with a list(zip(...)) construct:And then it worked.
Force the zip() to evaluate.
Some InfoThis is because in the Python 3.x, zip returns a generator object. This object is not a list (it's better) but it behaves like one. You can try iterating through it like this:The Quick AnswerPlease show us the code surrounding where the error happened.But I think I can still give you a quick (and not necessarily good) solution.turn thisinto this:
In mnist_loader wrap your zip results in list() constructs like below
