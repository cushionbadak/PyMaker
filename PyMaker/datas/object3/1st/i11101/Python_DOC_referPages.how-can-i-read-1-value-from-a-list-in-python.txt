I know how to use I want to know if there is a better command.In more detail:Unfortunately, pop removes the number from the sequence, so I was wondering if there was a better way.I am a beginner, so please give simple/detailed answers.
Read a specific item in index i:Read a sequence of items from index 'start' to index 'stop':Iterate over a list:If you need both the index and the item, use the enumerate function:You can also get the reversed list:Get list length:And there are so much more operations you can perform on lists.
You can just do list[i] , i being the index of the element to be read.
Simplest way to print a list:a being the list.To print a list element:index being the position within the list(0 to len-1)If you just want to check if a value exists in the list:value being the value searched and a being the list.
You can loop over the list three ways:1. If you want just each element in the list:2. if you want the index of the elements in a list:3. If you want the index and the corresponding elements in the list:These are the three main methods of looping over lists. 
Fetch the i-th element in aList with aList[i-1]. Positions range from 0 to list length minus one.You can treat the list as a stack. See Python Data Structures for details. Stacks are equipped with method pop() for extracting an element from the top.
