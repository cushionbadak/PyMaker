Python's semaphore doesn't support negative initial values. How, then, do I make a thread wait until 8 other threads have done something? If Semophore supported negative initial values, I could have just set it to -8, and have each thread increment the value by 1, until we have a 0, which unblocks the waiting thread.I can manually increment a global counter inside a critical section, then use a conditional variable, but I want to see if there are other suggestions.
Surely it's late for an answer, but it can come handy to someone else.If you want to wait for 8 different threads to do something, you can just wait 8 times.You initialize a semaphore in 0 with s = threading.Semaphore(0)and thenwill do the job.
For any further readers: starting from python3.2 there are Barrier Objects which provides a simple synchronization primitive for use by a fixed number of threads that need to wait for each other.
