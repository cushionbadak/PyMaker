I'm trying to patch a config file used in a django app and having trouble understanding how to do it given the way we import the config.  I don't think the fact that it's Django has much relevance here, but it partially drives this file structure.app/views.pyapp/config.pyHow do I properly patch this config setting?I've tried varieties of @patch('app.views.CONFIG.MAX_NUMBER_RETRIES', 1) or @patch('app.config.MAX_NUMBER_RETRIES', 1) in my testing function to no avail (I use pytest).
This should work:I tried it with a small example (without Django) and it worked as expected. This is probably not pytest but mock related. Have a look at the documentation: Where to patch .
