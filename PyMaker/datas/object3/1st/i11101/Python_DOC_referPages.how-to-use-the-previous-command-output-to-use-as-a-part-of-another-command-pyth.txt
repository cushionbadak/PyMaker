I have been trying to use the output of a system command to use it as a part of the command in the next portion. However, I cannot seem to join it up properly and hence not being able to run the second command properly. The OS used is KALI LINUX and python 2.7The errors are:It seems that the reading of the first command is alright but it can't join with the RAW portion. I have read many other solutions, but they seem to be for shell scripting instead.
