I'm still getting a handle on python and have been trying to implement a REPEAT UNTIL loop using online tutorials. Everything seems to be in order but I keep getting a syntax error but I absolutely cannot find an error with my syntax! Can someone help me? My code is;detvar is my string variable the error is for the 'detvar' on the last line. 
This is all you need:REPEAT and UNTIL are not valid expressions in Python. Instead, you want to use while condition != value, which is what you originally had.The while statement allows you to continue iterating as long as a condition holds true. Alternatively, you can repeat until something is true by negating the condition.So, while detvar != "SABRE": iterates the body of the loop (which is everything indented under the colon) until detvar is equal to "SABRE".Edit: In accordance with Bryan Oakley's comment, detvar is initialized as a value that is not "SABRE" so that the loop body executes at least once.
This is a horribly worded question, and I have no idea what this code is meant to accomplish, but I'll see if I can decipher this. There's no need to use "REPEAT," just doIt should exit the loop when devtar = "SABRE" automatically.
