For python 3 I want to convert a float to a string, with possibly different length (i.e. number of digits) but with full precision.Also I need to have a decimal point in any case:currently my code is this:can this be done more elegantly? (e notation would be possible, too)
Use Pythons string formatting functions:If you want to be able to feed it integers (such as 1) as well, use '{:.55f}'.format(float(x)).If you want to strip any trailing zeroes, use '{:.55f}'.format(x).rstrip('0').Note that 55 decimals after the point is way overkill (but it's what you showed in your question); 16 digits should suffice to express the full precision of double-precision IEEE 754 floats (20 digits for the 80-bit extended-precision you might encounter).
why do you use Decimal, you can just use:but if you use Decimal for something else than instead of this:you can just use:Edit 1:also good module for float precision is bigfloat:
