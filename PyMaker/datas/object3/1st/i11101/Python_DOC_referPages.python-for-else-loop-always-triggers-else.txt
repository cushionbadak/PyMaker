Natural Text
I am trying to read a tab-separated file and collect all characters except control characters. If a control character is hit, the remainder of line should be ignored too.I've tried the following code in Python 3.5, using a for..else loop:I'd expect this to check each character for being a control character and if it hits one (break is triggered), skip to the next line, hence trigger the else/continue statement.What happens instead is that continue is always triggered, even if the break statement in the if clause is never reached for a line. Consequently, the final print statement is never reached either.What am I doing wrong?
The else block of a for loop is only executed if the for loop never was interrupted. You'll only see the continue statement in the else block executed if there were no control characters in the line. From the for statement documentation:When the items are exhausted (which is immediately when the sequence is empty or an iterator raises a StopIteration exception), the suite in the else clause, if present, is executed, and the loop terminates.A break statement executed in the first suite terminates the loop without executing the else clauseâ€™s suite.A better test to see if there are control characters in a line is to use the any() function with a generator expression:or you could use a regular expression; this'll be faster as the looping over text is done in C code without having to box each individual character in a new str object:
