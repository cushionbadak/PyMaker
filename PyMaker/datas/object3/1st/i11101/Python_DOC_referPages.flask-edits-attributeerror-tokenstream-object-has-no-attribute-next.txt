I am trying to test the flask-edits package (https://github.com/nathancahill/Flask-Edits)   Can anyone help with this error: AttributeError: 'TokenStream' object has no attribute 'next' The template:The error occurs here:The error:Gist including the code:https://gist.github.com/archienorman11/98993d66fc30283ba113f8a4f2b39669
Assuming Flask-Edits wants to support Python 3, this is a bug in Flask-Edits.  It should use the builtin next function to advance iterators: next(parser.stream).  The method on the iterator changed from next to __next__ between Python 2 and 3.  The builtin function works for both.
