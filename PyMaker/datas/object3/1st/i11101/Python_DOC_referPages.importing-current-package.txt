I'm writing a script and running it with the -i argument in order to keep the repl open after it finishes in order to be able to see info about the objects that I'm using while debugging.In order to avoid having to quit and re-run the script I figured out that I can modify and save the script and then import [script-name] and then call my main method with [script-name].[main-method] ().Now I want to write a single-character method (for convenience) that does:but to also be able to change the script's file name and retain the easy-reloading functionality without having to alter the code.I've tried using importlib (see below) to no avail.
import, in any of it's incarnations, only reloads the script once. You are looking for the reload function:This code will reload the module you are currently in (probably __main__) and rerun a method from it. If you want to reload a script from within the interpreter, do the following instead:You may have to replace import mymodule with mymodule = importlib.import_module("".join(sys.argv[0].split(".py"))) if the script is in a weird location.Sources:https://stackoverflow.com/a/1676860/2988730https://stackoverflow.com/a/1547978/2988730
