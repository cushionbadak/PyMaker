As pointed out strings in python are immutable. Operations on them return new strings instead of changing the original. Your output requirement is also a list of integers, so you have to parse the strings:Using a list comprehension the string is split starting from right 1 time only using '-' as delimiter and the first string is picked up and parsed as integer.
Use a regular expression:
str.replace is not in-place. It returns a new string with the replaced characters. Therefore:Doesn't affect the strings in x whatsoever. You should also call replace directly on the string object you have, instead of calling the general replace from the string module.Instead, what you should do is:And just a small bit of code to emphasis that str.replace returns a new string:
id like to use e regular expressions. just take a look here and use this for composing a regexp
