I have a code that runs in Python 2.7 but not in 3.5 and I can't find the reason. It has to do with importing.The root folder has a subfolder called s. From the root folder, I am running the script a.py which includes the line from s import *.In the folder s, there is a file called b.py which has the import line: from c import cwhich tries to import the class saved in c.py which is located in the subfolder s as well.When I run the script a.py from the root folder, I get the ImportError saying "No module named c".In Python 2.7 this runs without problems. Can someone please suggest what may be the issue and how this should be done differently in Python 3.5?
Implicit imports within packages are not available for Python 3, so to get this to work you will need to use an explicit relative import:This should work for both Python 2 and Python 3.  This also makes your intention more clear that you want to import from a relative package, not an installed package.
