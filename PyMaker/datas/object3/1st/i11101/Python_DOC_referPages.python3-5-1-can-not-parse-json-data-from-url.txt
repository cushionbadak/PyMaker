I have already got my url and access this url on the browser. It will give you json data format, however, when I use build-in function of python3 it also gives me an error and the get_report gives me <function get_report at 0x103362840>. How could I use build-in function of python3 to return the json data?Here is my code
Before anything else, please, when you put raw code on the page, use the {} button, or put 4 spaces before each line of your code. It helps clarifying the overall.If you receive a string containing formatted and valid JSON, you can parse it using the builtin json module.A simple code snippet that can be used to parse a json string using this module can be that:It will store the loaded list/dictionary in a variable, that you'll be able to use later.EDIT: By looking at your recent update, I must precise that, if you didn't know yet, if you try to print something and it gives you this result:It means that the thing you just printed is a function, actually stored on the address 0x103362840 in memory (you don't have to worry about this part), which means you can actually call this function using this syntax (following the example just a bit higher): Now, if you try to do something like:instead of:you will print the result that the function returned. So here, it will execute the function get_report, then return the result, and since we are printing the result in the console, if the get_report returns the actual needed content, it will print it in the console.
