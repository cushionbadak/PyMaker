I have an XML string where I want to modify the model type for specific interface. Now, I want to change model type='e1000' where source network='nat'. How can I do that?
You don't need multiple find*() calls. You can do it in one call:
Here's some crude ElementTree code that does the job. In a real program you'd probably want some error checking. But if you're sure your XML data will always be perfect, and that every interface tag will always contain a source tag and a model tag, then this code will do the job.outputIf you're using an old version of Python you may not have iterfind. In which case, replace it with findall.
Thanks for your answers, but this is also worked for me
