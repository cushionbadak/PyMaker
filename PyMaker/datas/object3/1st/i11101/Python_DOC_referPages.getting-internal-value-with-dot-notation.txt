I have a dictionary:Each key (e.g. 'time') only ever has one value (e.g. {36.0 'mo'})I'd like to access the 36.0 by doingAnd the 200.0 by doingHow do I do this? So far I have:Which produces {36.0: 'mo'} not 36.0. 
I'd subclass dict and override __getattr__, after having enshured that there is no name clash between the data keys and dict methods.
Below snippet hijacks the attribute access, and returns the first key of the dict instead of the dict itself. It does this for all attributes except __dict__, so use accordingly and be aware of what this implies.Testing it
