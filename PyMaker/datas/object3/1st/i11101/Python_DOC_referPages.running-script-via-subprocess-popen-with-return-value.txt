I have a simple script which is having the structure of:  Now, I ran the script via the code using subprocess.Popen() method like this:   My question is how can I return a value from the running script to the calling script using return value, or other method.  I cannot use return under the context of if __name__ =='main':So does it mean I cannot pass a return value to be assigned in the calling script to the p variable?I'm also want to try avoiding parsing the prints of the script run to the console..
You can capture the output in the calling script using  subprocess.check_output():To also capture standard error in the result, use stderr=subprocess.STDOUT.
Use communicate() to retrieve output of your script. And returncode to get the exit code.For your other script to return an exit code, you should use sys.exit(code).
