Sometimes an argument to a function I write can be of any type as long as it is a hashable - for instance, because my function adds it to a set or uses it as a dictionary key.Is there a way to type-hint this fact using the PEP 484 type hints introduced in Python 3.5? The typing module doesn't seem to include a hashable type, but is there some other way?
The typing module does in fact contain a Hashable type (now documented). It's an alias for collections.abc.Hashable.
