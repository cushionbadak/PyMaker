I have a structure like this:I tried below but it gave me an error: string indices must be integers.How do I sort the above based on the "time" value?Thanks.
Since this is a json, I would just decode it using json.loads:Output:
Apparently, your structure is a string. You need to convert it to a python object using json.loadsThereafter, the value at the key 'record' is a list. The list has one dict object at index 0. So you need to access the dict object first, then you can access the values of the dictionary.
