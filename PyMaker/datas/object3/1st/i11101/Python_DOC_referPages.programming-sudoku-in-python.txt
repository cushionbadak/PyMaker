hi guys, I am new in programminG and I have this project for my school. I have to  make Sudoku in python and this is what I have done, but it is not finished and it has some mistakes, e.g. if it appends one column and then it realises that this number is already in the rove I don't know how to delete it from the column.PLEASE HELP
To fix your problem you need to add variable which will tell you if number was found in column so there is no need to check is number in row or in box.So to fix that your code should look like this:so if variable error is True then you don't call function unos.To make code more readable (by the way your code is not easy to read, and lot of it should be shortened by using for loops and functions) you should use function to print error message and return True, it should be something like this:and entire code would be:code still isn't pretty, but that's problem in your programming you should use for loops (your variables where you store informations about rows, columns and boxes should be in list and then you should check if inputted number exists in row by using for loop and one if, and not by using nine ifs:for example instead of using:you should use:and then when you are checking if inputted number is already in column instead of using:you should use:similar logics  applies to rows and boxes, if you want to improve your code you should do something like that.)Also your sudoku program have other problems like: you can input number on place where number already exists, you can't delete inputted number...PS: if you are going to use any of my code I suggest you to rename variables because your code isn't in english.
