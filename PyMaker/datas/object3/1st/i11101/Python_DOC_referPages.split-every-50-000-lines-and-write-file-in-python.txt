I read files which contains 75,151 lines.I want to split every 50,000 lines.So I made 2 files, one files have 50,000 lines and the other file has 25,151 lines.I made code like this(INSERT_NUMBER : 50,000)which is the better way to split every 50,000 lines and make new files ?
Here's one way using itertools.groupby():So the trick here is to use the line number of each line to group it into chunks using integer division, and then to use the grouping key as a counter for the output file name.Is it better than what you already have? It's a bit more complicated to read the code, but it doesn't need to deal with those annoying edge cases when you try to group using modulo arithmetic.
