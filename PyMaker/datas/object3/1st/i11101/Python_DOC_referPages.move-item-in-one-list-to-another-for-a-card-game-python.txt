Ok so I'm trying to make a poker game in Python.. and I want to move the used cards from the list to another list where I will store the used cards. I'm using this code :The while function is where my problem is. I can sometimes get the same cards when I print them. How can I fix that and where is my mistake ? thanks in advance
You just need to append the drawn cards to your used list, and not back into deck:
The simple fix is to use used.append(drawn_card) as others have suggested. A better way is to randomly shuffle your deck and then slice the required number of cards from it:However, you are probably dealing multiple hands from the same deck. You can handle that by keeping track of the offset into the shuffled deck and then slice from there, but that's a hassle. Or you can make a copy of deck, shuffle it, and pop off the required number of cards for each hand:Possibly the cleanest way is to use itertools.islice() to take the first n items from an iterator:
used.append(drawn_card)
