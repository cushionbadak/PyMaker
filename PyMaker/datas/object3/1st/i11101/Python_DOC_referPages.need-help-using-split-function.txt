This function adds up the numbers between zero in a string.  For example ('25025') becomes 25+25.  However, if I have a 0 at start and/or end of the string of the string argument being sent to test_string, it creates a space in the at the start/end of the list and won't compute.  What can I add to this function to make it filter out both 0s and blank spaces?
If you're ok with keeping your current approach, then this should do:Otherwise, you could use a comprehension in a generator expression altogether:
You can use string one of methods strip()/rstrip()/lstrip().Docs about these methods can be found here
Replace this:With this:This code is self-explanatory: convert x to integer and append it to the list if bool(x) is True, thus skipping all the empty strings.str.split("0") treats "0" as a delimiter and doesn't include any occurrences of it in the result. Check the docs for some examples and more explanation.
Try thisboth  test_one('2022022022') and test_one('02022022022') will return the sameThere've been a mistake on my side regarding case when string ends in zero. Made a correction.
