This question already has an answer here:Can I detect if my code is running on cPython or Jython?                    4 answers                As the title says,I want to know if the python which comes pre installed on mac is cpython. I mean logic says it probably is,but I couldn't find it being written anywhere officially so wanted to confirm. I want to download a few things and for compatibility they require the installed python to be cpython/iron python.
With command Python --version you get the information like that:[GCC 4.0.1 (Apple Computer, Inc. build 5367)] on darwinIt is almost affirmative that it is cpython with gcc as compiler.An alternative(which is more official) is to check with python code:The function python_implementation:Returns a string identifying the Python implementation. Possible  return values are: ‘CPython’, ‘IronPython’, ‘Jython’, ‘PyPy’
