I am pretty sure this is the easiest mistake i can ever overlook. had a similar problem once but cant remember how i solved it for the love of god...ok i edited it and its working as intented, but even with that tutorial i struggle with something else. How do i save the new value after the calulation so it doesnt always start at 100? 
As you have edited the original question, and you are now askingHow do i save the new value after the calulation so it doesnt always  start at 100?you need to return the new value and assign to the player_hp variable and move the randomisation of enemy_hit so it actually takes a new value before you call eHit(), like thisI have put a while player_hp > 0 in there for testing purposesThinking about this, I would do it even a little different again, the following code so you can try this yourself:now you can call random_hit() with default, or with changed parameters for "bigger" hits like random_hit(20, 30), you can also call random_hit() from other functions, no need to double assign.And you can take is further, as a hit is a hit, no matter who is hitting who, so no double functions, something like this:
print(eHit) is wrong; eHit is a function not a variable. You should call it like print(eHit(somthing))Purely based on the names of the variable declarations at the start, I guess you meant print(eHit(enemy_hit))Then you run into the problem that player_hp is a local variable, and used before assignment, so now you need to change eHit()and your print statement is nowprint(eHit(enemy_hit, player_hp))The same goes for other functions you have defined.
