I have two arrays as follows: I want to get the index i where e[i] and f[i] == True.The expected output for the above will be:There may be more of such matches, so I need a list of all of the indices which satisfy the above condition.I tried to find the list of matching values by doing this: To get the index, I thought I could use .index(True) of list. But it doesn't work or just gives output as 0. Maybe only giving the first index and not all. Finally, I need the 1 added to each element of output so instead of [0,3] output should be [1,4] but this is easy I can do that if I get the indices, 
Take a look at numpy.where in the docsOutputs:
You can just use a list comprehension to pick them out:Using enumerate() you can specify the initial index, in this case 1.
or simply this 
Something else if you don't want to be dependent on numpy:
