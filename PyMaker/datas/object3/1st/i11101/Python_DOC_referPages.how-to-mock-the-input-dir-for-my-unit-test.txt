Related to a earlier question of mine: How to unit test a method that calculates the size of a dir?I want to unit test this function:   So from what I understood I have to mock the os.walk function But mock_walk.return_value(5000) goes without effect as my test fails What am I missing?
Ok, I was heading down the wrong path. Should have mocked the os.path.getsize() method. Plus, the return value needs to be provided like this .return_value = 5000
