I recently start teaching myself game programming. Someone recommend me to start with Python and I got the book "Beginning game development with Python and Pygame: From novice to professional". I got to a part where they teach about Vectors and creating a Vector2 class. Everything was going well until I tried to overload the division operator.My code goes like this:Now, when I tried to call the "/" operator, this shows up:This was all in Python 3.3 but if I run it with Python 2.7, everything works correctly.Where's the problem?
In Python 3.x, you need to overload the __floordiv__ and __truediv__ operators, not the __div__ operator. The former corresponds to the // operation (returns an integer) and the latter to / (returns a float).
In Python 3, the division operators are called __truediv__ and __floordiv__. See the Data model documentation for more information.
