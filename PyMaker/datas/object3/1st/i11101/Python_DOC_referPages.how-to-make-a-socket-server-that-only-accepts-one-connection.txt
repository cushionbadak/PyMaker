I write a TCP server using Python. I want the server only accept on client connection.I use the listen functionbut the server still can accepts more than one connection.
From the documentation:If backlog is specified, it must be at least 0 (if it is lower, it is set to 0); it specifies the number of unaccepted connections that the system will allow before refusing new connections.So if you use listen(1) you allow one unaccepted connection. If you want to allow no unaccepted connections, you must use listen(0).
If you want only one connection, pleae don't use loop for socket.accept() in- connections. demo code:
