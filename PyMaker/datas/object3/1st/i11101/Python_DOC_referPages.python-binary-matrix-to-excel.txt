I'm trying to export a binary matrix to excel..I'm using what I've learned from Write list of lists to excel file using xlwtand I'm getting an size errorwell, I have a binary matrix 2221x9947 and the following code:I first use mb = int_to_str_matriz(matriz) to convert the ints on the matrix to str, then I pass the new matrix to exportar_matriz(mb)I'm trying with this, and getand if I try the other option that it's given on the topic I quoted, usingIt works, the problem is that it is not useful this way, because I need to each column to have the (0,1), so I can analyze the data..any solutions?I tried without the str convertion and gets the same error...
You won't be able to do this using xlwt. Instead, consider exporting to .csv format (either using a library such as csv, numpy, or pandas, or without the aid of a library).The .xls (Excel 2003) file type is limited to 65536 rows and 256 columns, so there is no way you can export your 2221 by 9947 matrix using xlwt (unless you transform it into a different shape first). This restriction was removed on later file types such as .xlsx (Excel 2007), but the xlwt library does not currently support this format.
