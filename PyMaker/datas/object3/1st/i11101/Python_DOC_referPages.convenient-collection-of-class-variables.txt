Python beginner here. I am trying to write a convenience function to access class variables from a list of objects.currently, I am writing one function for each variable. For example, I have a class 'swarm' that contains 'animals'. Each animal has many variables that store time series such as position, heading etc. (Only a couple are given in the example below.)I am looking for a convenient way to access a specific variable from all animals from the Swarm class. I want to obtain a matrix with n columns where n is the number of animals.in pseudo code, I would like a function in the 'Swarm' class that takes the variable name to be collected as a string input. something like this:obviously, this way of accessing 'var' doesn't work. any hints?
Use getattr(obj, name) -- it's a built-in function that tries to retrieve the field or method with the given name from the provided obj, if that attribute exists.(You may also be interested in hasattr and setattr if you plan on doing more metaprogramming.)
