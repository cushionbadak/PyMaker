Natural Text
I am doing a sentiment analysis and I want to Add NOT to every word between negation and following punctuation. I am performing the following code: Traceback (most recent call last):  line 14, in     flags=re.IGNORECASE)line 182, in sub return _compile(pattern, flags).sub(repl, string, count)TypeError: expected string or bytes-like objectI dont know how to fix the error. Can you help me?
re.sub takes in a string, not a file object. Documentation here.Also remember to always close the file you open.
