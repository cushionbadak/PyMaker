This function works fine if one path is a subpath of the other one, like this:However, if two paths are on the same level, relative_to does not work.I would expect the result to beThe function os.path.relpath does this correctly:Is there a way to achieve the functionality of os.path.relpath using pathlib.Path?
The first section solves the OP's problem, though if like me, he really wanted the solution relative to a common root then the second section solves it for him. The third section describes how I originally approached it and is kept for interest sake.Relative PathsRecently, as in Python 3.4-6, the os.path module has been extended to accept pathlib.Path objects. In the following case however it does not return a Path object and one is forced to wrap the result.Common PathMy suspicion is that you're really looking a path relative to a common root. If that is the case the following, from EOL, is more useful Common PrefixBefore I'd struck upon os.path.commonpath I'd used os.path.comonprefix.But be forewarned you are not supposed to use it in this context (See commonprefix : Yes, that old chestnut)but rather the following one from J.
