I have this Twitter App, i am running it locally sometimes it fails due to Slow internet connection. once it fails i have to restart the app from Cmd. is it possible to make the bot sleep if network fails and retry the code       
I would do something like this:Later, I would just wrap it in some while loop, check status and if status is 60 I would put it to sleep, else do what you want.
