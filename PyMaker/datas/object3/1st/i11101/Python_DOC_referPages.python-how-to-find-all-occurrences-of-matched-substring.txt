I have a big string - html page. I need to find all names of flash drives,i.e. I need to get content between double quotes: data-name="USB Flash-drive Leef Fuse 32Gb">. So I need a string between data-name=" and ">. Please, don't mention BeautifulSoup, I need to do it without BeautifulSoup and better without regular expressions, but regular expression are also accepted.I tried to use this:but result is None.But on regex101.com it worked:
py2: https://docs.python.org/2/library/htmlparser.htmlpy3: https://docs.python.org/3/library/html.parser.htmlOutput:I've added some comments to the code to show you what kind of data structure is returned by the parser.It should be very easy to build from here.Just feed in HTML, and it will parse it fine. Refer to the docs, and keep trying.
If you want to do it with basic python string parsing here is a wayThis is what happens in my python shelllet me know if this part of script works separately
