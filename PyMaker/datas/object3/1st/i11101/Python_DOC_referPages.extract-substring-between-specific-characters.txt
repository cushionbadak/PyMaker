I have some strings like:I would like to get rid of the '\i{}', '\io{}' characters, so that I could get just:I've tried the following code (adapted from here):It works in part, because when I run it I get just:without the part (which I want to keep).Any hints?Thanks in advance for any assistance you can provide!
Use s.replace('\i{}', '') and s.replace('\io{}', '')
You ca do this in different ways.The simplest one is to use str.replaceAnother way is to use re.sub()
You need to use the re.sub function.
You could use a character class along with re.sub()See a demo on ideone.com.
You can either use s.replace('\i{}', '') and s.replace('\io{}', ''), as Julien said, or, continuing with the regex approach, change your pattern to:re.search('\i{}(.+?)\i0(.++)', item_name)And use m.group(1).strip('\\') + m.group(2).strip('\\') as the result.
