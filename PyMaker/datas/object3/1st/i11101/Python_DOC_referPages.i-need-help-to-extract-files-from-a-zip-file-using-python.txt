i have created a zip file called shoppy and put "cats.txt" in it and now i want to extract it but my code doesn't work it gives me this error here is my code
The first problem is that open() refers to the builtin function, not to any function in the zipfile - there is no zipfile.open() function.To open a zip file use the zipfile.ZipFile class:This will unzip the file into the current directory. If you would prefer to unzip into a string you can use zipfile.read():Now content will contain the unzipped content of the file.
