How can I convert a ipv4 subnet mask to cidr notation using netaddr library?Example:  255.255.255.0 to /24
Using netaddr:Using ipaddress from stdlib:You can also do it without using any libraries: just count 1-bits in the binary representation of the netmask:

Use the following function. it is fast, reliable, and don't use any library.
How about this one? It does not need any additional library as well.It is in some ways similar to IAmSurajBobade's approach but instead does the lookup reversed. It represents the way I would do the conversion manually by pen and paper.
As of Python 3.5:will print:24  0.0.0.0/24
