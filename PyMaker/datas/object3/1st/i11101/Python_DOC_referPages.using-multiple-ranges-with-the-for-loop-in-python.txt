I don't understand of using the multiple ranges in the for-loop as follows.I googled but still not find out. Any help would be appreciated. 
In Python 2.7, you can add ranges because the result of calling range(something) is a list, and lists can be added to produce a new list:But in Python 3.5 you can't do this as the range type represents an immutable sequence of numbers. Check the docs for more information.
Each range expression returns a list: range(1,21) returns [1,2,...,20], and range(30,100,10) returns [30,40,...,90]. The + operator concatenates the two lists, so range(1,21) + range(30,100,10) evaluates to [1,2,...,20,30,40,...,90].
