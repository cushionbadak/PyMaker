I tried type(4) == type(int), which returns False, but print type(4) returns <type 'int'>, so 4 is obviously int.Confused why the first statement returns False and not True?
The type of int is type itself:You'd compare with int directly; int is, after all, a type, as we established above:or even, since int is a singleton, like all types should be:However, the proper way to test for types is to use the isinstance() function:isinstance() also allows for any subclasses of int to pass this test; a subcclass is always considered to be at least an int. That includes any custom subclasses you could build yourself, and still have it work as an int everywhere else in your code.
Look this:Yu should use:
You are comparing int with type(int), instead you should:
The type of int is typeand type of 4 is int.So you doing wrong comparison.What you can do to get the desired output is:Compare the type of 4 with intOr you can use is operator for this like
In Python, type int itself is also a object whose type is type. So type(int) is type. On the other hand, type(4) is intSo if you want to check if type(4) is type int, you should write as
