I am trying to run SUMO through traci interface. I copy pasted this example from this link. The code is as followsWhen I try to run the code, it throws me the following errorAnyone know what is wrong.
Looks like you're running in an ipython notebook. They have non-standard "standard" I/O streams that can't be used like a "true" file object (because they're really data queues, not pipes, so they don't have a file descriptor to use for low level I/O).You can't use them with libraries (like subprocess) that perform low level I/O; the error is there to tell you this.. You'll need to use a real file-like object, possibly something as simple as sending output to a tempfile.TemporaryFile and then copying output from the file to stdout if that's what you need.It's possible it would work by just not passing Popen stdout and stderr arguments at all; the default behavior for subprocess is to use the same stdout and stderr as the parent, so if there are valid file handles opened (even if the notebook replaced sys.stdout/sys.stderr for Python use), it might "just work" (where "just work" includes the possibility that data sent to the underlying file descriptors 0 and 1 is discarded, so you never see it).Or just don't run in the ipython notebook.
The problem was that my command line used Python 2 whereas the spyder IDE used python 3. Since I wont be needing to pass any more arguments to the stdin, I removed the option and simply tried to open the sumo-gui with subprocess as follows. It works now.
