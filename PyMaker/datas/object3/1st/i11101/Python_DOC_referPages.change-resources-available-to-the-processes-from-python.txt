Is there a way to change resources available to a running process from Python? Namely I would like to change Max open files soft:hard limit.I know I can use ulimit -n 1024000 and spawn process from that shell, but that would require stopping that process beforehand.I'm also aware of prlimit, but it's not available in Wheezy 7.6 with util-linux 2.20.1-5.3.Python resource module apparently allows changing limits just for itself...I have found the following blog article, which explains how to do it with gdb and I'm just hoping that something similar exists in Python.Essentially I think I'm asking how to make setrlimit system-call for a running process from the Python program.
Take another look at the resource library. The function resource.prlimit() takes a pid as its first argument, and raises ProcessLookupError if a process by that ID cannot be found. So I believe it's exactly what you're looking for.resource.prlimit(pid, resource[, limits])Combines setrlimit() and getrlimit() in one function and supports to get and set the resources limits of an arbitrary process. If pid is 0, then the call applies to the current process. [...]When limits is not given the function returns the resource limit of the process pid. When limits is given the resource limit of the process is set and the former resource limit is returned.The catch is that this function is not present in Python 2.7. Hopefully you can dip your toes in python 3 for this one task.
