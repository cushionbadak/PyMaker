I´ve a "binary" file with variable size record. Each record is composed of an amount of little endians 2 byte-sized integer numbers. I know the start position of each record and it´s size.What´s the fastest way to read this to a Python array of integer?
I don't think you can do better than opening the file and reading the size of each recorde then use struct.unpack('<i', buff) for each integer you want to read, file.read(2), will get you 2 integers.
