Natural Text
I have a file with YAML headers, that is a file with starts with ---, have ---. Something like:I want to use regular expressions in python3 to split the contents: YAML contents and the rest of the file. In my example, the first part is thisAnd the second that:I use this re: p = re.compile('---\n(.*?)\n---\n(.*?)') but it does not work.
. does not match newlines, unless you set the DOTALL flag:Note that I dropped the ? from the second *; you'd want everything after the second ---, not just the first 1 character.From the documentation:re.Sre.DOTALL  Make the '.' special character match any character at all, including a newline; without this flag, '.' will match anything except a newline.However, you could just split your text on the ---\n line; limit it to two splits:This splits your text into a prefix, the YAML section, and the rest. The prefix is ignored with [1:].Demo:
For such a simple delimiter, you don't really need regular expressions. Given test file......something as simple as......should suffice.
