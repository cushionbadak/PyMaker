You can use enumerate to do the task...    Output - But as said in the comments its better to use a dictionary hereAnother way to do this is to use zip- Edit : As said in the comment you can do it without making direct references, as in real world, the function will be encapsulated within another class so you won't have direct access to data.- 
You can use the zip built-in function:
You can use the the built-in function zip()This will get you a list of tuples.You can turn tup_list into a dictionary
