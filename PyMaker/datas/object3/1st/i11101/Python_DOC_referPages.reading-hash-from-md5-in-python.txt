I can't seem to find anything on the interwebs on this.Basically I have a bunch of xml files with a respective md5 file for eachI want to be able to compare each xml with its md5 hash to ensure they have been sent to us correctly.I have tried running this as a binary file but I don't think it works.this returns b' \xc0\xff\xae\x91\x1c\tJ\xc5~\xbe\x8d\x93\xad\xf3\x0c'.where when I calculate the hash for the xml I get '20c0ffae911c094ac57ebe8d93adf30c' thanks for the help.
