With this code:I have an output like this:but how I can create an algorithm capable of this:More important: every column of output must have different ranges, for example: first column: 0-4 second column: 0-10 etc. And the number of columns ( a,b,c,d ) isn't fixed; depending on other parts of the program, can be in a range from 2 to 200. UPDATE: to be more comprehensible and clearwhat I need is something like that:the question is been partially resolved but still had problems on how to change the range parameters such like the above example.Excuse me for the mess ! :)
itertools.product can already do exactly what you are looking for, simply by passing it multiple iterables (in this case the ranges you want). It will collect one element from each iterable passed. For example:Outputs:If your input ranges are variable, just place the loop in a function and call it with different parameters. You can also use something along the lines ofif you have a large number of input iterables. With your updated request for the variable ranges, a nice short-circuiting approach with itertools.product is not as clear, although you can always just check that each iterable is sorted in ascending order (as this is essentially what your variable ranges ensures). As per your example:
