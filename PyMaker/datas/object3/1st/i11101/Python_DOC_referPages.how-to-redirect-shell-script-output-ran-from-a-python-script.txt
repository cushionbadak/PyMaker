This question already has an answer here:Running shell command and capturing the output                    14 answers                How do I pipe a subprocess call to a text file?                    2 answers                I am executing few shell scripts from a python script. A particular shell script(last line of the code) call is used to run a Hive query to get some table information and I would like to redirect this output to a file. Here is how my python script looks like.When I execute this, I get the result on the terminal but I need to redirect the output to a file from python script to do few more operations using the output. So I basically want my Hive query output to be redirected to a file so that I can use the file for other operations within the same script. In shell script we can redirect the output using '>' to a file but is there a way where we can get this done using python?I have searched posts related to this but all of them are redirecting the python scripts output to a file which I don't want to.
Check out documentation for subprocess.call: you can supply params like stdout and stdin.This is a generic way - similar approach would work in C and in many other languages too.Old python-specific way would be to use subprocess.check_output instead of subprocess.call.Current python-specific way would be to use subprocess.run and literally check its stdout: output = run(..., check=True, stdout=PIPE).stdout
