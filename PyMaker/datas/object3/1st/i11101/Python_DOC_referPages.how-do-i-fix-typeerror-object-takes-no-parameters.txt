Here's my program:Here's my error: Any suggestions?
You named your initializer method init; the correct name is __init__. The double underscores are how Python indicates names reserved for Python "special" use. By not using the correct name, the superclass (object's) __init__ was invoked, but it takes no arguments, so you get the error.Sidenotes: You've got another error in saveData; the final print and close calls should almost certainly be dedented, so you write all the data, not just a single item.In addition:should almost certainly become (importing csv at the top of the file):which handles newlines and splitting on commas for you, and doesn't involve the anti-pattern of an infinite loop calling .readline() over and over (even if this wasn't CSV, the correct way to iterate by line is for inLine in inFile:, which avoids the while, readline and if not inLine: break; for inLine in map(str.rstrip, inFile): avoids the need to explicitly slice off the trailing newline too).
You're missing __. Yourhas  to be
