I am having an issue printing random numbers to the same line, then printing the total of the 6 random numbers on the second print statement. Here is what i have so far.Should look like this
I'm not sure what is wrong with your code because of its poor indentation but here are some things to take note of:You need to have a variable which stores the totalPython print function defaults all strings to print out with a newline.Store totalThis is simple, just add a variable outside of the for loop which adds the number:Remove newlineFor Python 3, it is simple to remove the newline. Just supply a new keyword argument to the print function and it will work:If you are using Python 2 in the future, you could do it two ways: Either import print_function from __future__ or print with a comma:Import from __future__:Or use a comma:The output:
You will have better luck if you indent your code correctly.And to you need to actually accumulate the total in a variable which is trivial because summing is very basic and everything basic is very well documented.
The correct code is as follows:OR (if Python 3)
See this: Print new output on same lineIn addition:Make sure to fix your indentation; python is very strict about it.You need to either save the numbers in a list or accumulate the sum in a variable. Otherwise after you print num1, it's gone.
