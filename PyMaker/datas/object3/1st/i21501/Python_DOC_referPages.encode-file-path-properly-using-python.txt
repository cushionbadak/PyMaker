I am trying to open files by getting the path from a dictionary. Some of the file names have commas (,) and other such characters which when used give a "no such file found error"For instance the following file path will not open: foo,%20bar.mp3If characters like commas exist then it should be encoded as : foo%2C%20bar.mp3Can anyone tell me how to do this?
