Is there a Pythonic equivalent to Ruby's #each_cons?In Ruby you can do this:
For such things, itertools is the module you should be looking at:Then:For an even more general solution, consider this:This allows arbitrary lengths of subsequences and arbitrary overlapping. Usage:
I don't think there is one, I looked through the built-in module itertools, which is where I would expect it to be. You can simply create one though:
My solution for lists (Python2):Edit: With Python 3 itertools.izip is no longer, so you use plain zip:
A quick one-liner:
Python can surely do this. If you don't want to do it so eagerly, use itertool's islice and izip. Also, its important to remember that normal slices will create a copy so if memory usage is important you should also consider the itertool equivalents.each_cons = lambda l: zip(l[:-1], l[1:])
UPDATE: Nevermind my answer below, just use toolz.itertoolz.sliding_window() -- it will do the right thing.For a truly lazy implementation that preserves the behavior of Ruby's each_cons when the sequence/generator has insufficient length:Examples:Note that the tuple unpacking used on the arguments for izip is applied to a tuple of size n resulting of itertools.tee(xs, n) (that is, the "window size"), and not the sequence we want to iterate.
Same as elias's code, but works for python 2 and 3:
