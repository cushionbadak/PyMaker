I found the following code that is compatible with python2However, this isn't working with Python 3. I get the following errorCan someone help?I'd like to convert my list of [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] to [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]EditNow Python3 compatibleCode below is adapted from the selected answer. Simply change name from izip_longest to zip_longest.
In Python 3's itertools there is a function called zip_longest. It should do the same as izip_longest from Python 2.Why the change in name? You might also notice that itertools.izip is now gone in Python 3 - that's because in Python 3, the zip built-in function now returns an iterator, whereas in Python 2 it returns a list. Since there's no need for the izip function, it also makes sense to rename the _longest variant for consistency.
According to the doc:
After all that discussion above, here's a python3 solution that I believe gives safer, more predicable results.The results are:
