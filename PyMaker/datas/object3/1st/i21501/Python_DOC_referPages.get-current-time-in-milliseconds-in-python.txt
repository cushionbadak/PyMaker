How can I get the current time in milliseconds in Python? 
For what I needed, here's what I did, based on @samplebias' comment above:Quick'n'easy. Thanks all, sorry for the brain fart.For reuse:Then:
time.time() may only give resolution to the second, the preferred approach for milliseconds is datetime.

another solution is the function you can embed into your own utils.py
If you want a simple method in your code that returns the milliseconds with datetime:
Just sample code:Output:1534343781311
The simpliest way I've found to get the current UTC time in milliseconds is:
Microseconds is 1/1000000 seconds, milliseconds is 1/1000 seconds sodt.microseconds/1000.0 should be dt.microseconds/1000000.0
