Natural Text
I am trying to delete macros from C headers but I have problem with deleting multiple line macros. So for exampleThis is regexp for deleting one-line macros but I am not quite sure how to include \n in regular expression.
should do the trickEDIT: fix by @Blackie123
This one is deleting all multiline macros in a text. There is a \r?\n for compatibility with windows line endings. One important thing is writing "flags=" before flags, because fourth argument in re.sub() is a count, so accepted answer above is quiet wrong and method is interpreting specified flags as a count argument.https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.subBug in Python Regex?
