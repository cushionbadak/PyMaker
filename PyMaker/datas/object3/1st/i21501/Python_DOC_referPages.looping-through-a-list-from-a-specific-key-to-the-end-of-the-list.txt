in Python how do i loop through list starting at a key and not the beginning.e.g.loop through l but starting at b e.g. l[1]
The straightforward answerJust use slicing:It will generate a new list with the items before 1 removed:A more efficient alternativeAlternatively, if your list is huge, or you are going to slice the list a lot of times, you can use itertools.islice(). It returns an iterator, avoiding copying the entire rest of the list, saving memory:Also note that, since it returns an interator, you can iterate over it only once:How to chooseI find slicing clearer/more pleasant to read but itertools.islice() can be more efficient. I would use slicing most of the time, relying on itertools.islice() when my list has thousands of items, or when I iterate over hundreds of different slices.
My 5 cent:
This will loop through items in l beginning with 1:
The syntax for slicing a list like this is: l[1:]To answer your question:
