Is there a Python method to create directories recursively? I have this path:I would like to createCan I do it recursively or I have to create one directory after the other?The same thing for:chmod and chown can I do it recursively without assign permissions for each file/dir?
os.makedirs is what you need. For chmod or chown you'll have to use os.walk and use it on every file/dir yourself.
a fresh answer to a very old question:starting from python 3.2 you can do this:thanks to the exist_ok flag this will not even complain if the directory exists (depending on your needs....).starting from python 3.4 (which includes the pathlib module) you can do this:starting from python 3.5 mkdir also has an exist_ok flag - setting it to True will raise no exception if the directory exists:
Here is my implementation for your reference:Hope this help!
I agree with Cat Plus Plus's answer.  However, if you know this will only be used on Unix-like OSes, you can use external calls to the shell commands mkdir, chmod, and chown. Make sure to pass extra flags to recursively affect directories:EDIT I originally used commands, which was a bad choice since it is deprecated and vulnerable to injection attacks. (For example, if a user gave input to create a directory called first/;rm -rf --no-preserve-root /;, one could potentially delete all directories).EDIT 2 If you are using Python less than 2.7, use check_call instead of check_output. See the subprocess documentation for details.
Try using os.makedirs:
