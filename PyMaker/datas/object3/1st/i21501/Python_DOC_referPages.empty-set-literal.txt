[] = empty list() = empty tuple{} = empty dictIs there a similar notation for an empty set?Or do I have to write set()?
No, there's no literal syntax for the empty set. You have to write set().
Just to extend the accepted answer:From version 2.7 and 3.1 python has got set literal {} in form of usage {1,2,3}, but {} itself still used for empty dict.Python 2.7 (first line is invalid in Python <2.7)Python 3.xMore here: https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/2.7.html#other-language-changes
By all means, please use set() to create an empty set. But, if you want to impress people, tell them that you can create an empty set using literals and * with Python >= 3.5 (see PEP 448) by doing:this is basically a more condensed way of doing {_ for _ in ()}, but, don't do this.
It depends on if you want the literal for a comparison, or for assignment.If you want to make an existing set empty, you can use the .clear() metod, especially if you want to avoid creating a new object.  If you want to do a comparison, use set() or check if the length is 0.example:
Adding to the crazy ideas: with Python 3 accepting unicode identifiers, you could declare a variable ϕ = frozenset() (ϕ is U+03D5) and use it instead.
if you want to initialize empty set then apply below code. this one is works perfectly for me in python 3:
use it like thisa = setora = {0,1}
