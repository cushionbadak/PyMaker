A python dictionary has an internal order that is randomized and that you shouldn't depend on.If you would like to retain the order that you inserted objects in, you should use a collections.OrderedDict.
dicts are unordered because keys aren't compared, their hashes are.Use an OrderedDict from the collections module to maintain the order you inputted.
