Root logger doesn't log when (I think) it should:From my understanding this should log something but it does nothing.Quick Google searches didn't help me to figure this issue out, neither did the official documentation.In the other hand, if I use logging.warning instead of logging.debug, it does work.What am I doing wrong?EDIT: Checking the current level with logging.getLogger().getEffectiveLevel() indicates me that the level is still at 30, like before the call of logging.basicConfig.Checking logging.getLogger().isEnabledFor(logging.DEBUG) effectively tells me that the root logger level isn't enabled for logging.DEBUG.
EDIT: Turned out OP's (me) trouble was due to already calling logging.debug before logging.basicConfig, thus settings the config to defaults and the call to logging.basicConfig was ignored as pointed out by @SmCaterpillar.Although, this alternative solution allows you to "force" root logger level after a basicConfig has already been set, could still be useful!Found a "solution":But it doesn't carry out the format I gave in in logging.basicConfig.That said I'm already satisfied: It is already some kind of progress. Logging even with not exactly the format I expected is always better than no logging at all.
