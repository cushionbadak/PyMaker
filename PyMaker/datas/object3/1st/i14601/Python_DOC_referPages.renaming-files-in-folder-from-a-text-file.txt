Natural Text
I want to know if it's possible to rename file in folder from a text file..?I explain:I have a text file in which we find for each line a name and path (and checksum).I would like to rename the name of EVERY photo file ( path).Extract from text file:...15554615_05_hd.jpg    /photos/FRYW-1555-16752.jpg de9da252fa1e36dc0f96a6213c0c73a3  15554615_06_hd.jpg    /photos/FRYW-1555-16753.jpg 04de10fa29b2e6210d4f8159b8c3c2a8...My /photos folder:Example:Rename the file FRYW-1555-16752.jpg to 15554615_05_hd.jpgMy script (just a beginning):

Something like this ought to work. Replace the txt with reading from a file and for the file names use something like os.walk
The problem can be solved by: Looping through all files using os.listdir(). listdir will help you get all file name, with current directory, use os.listdir(".")Then using os.rename() to rename the file: os.rename(old_name, new_name)Sample code: assuming you're dealing with *.jpg
Yes it can be done.You can divide your problem in sub-problems:Open txt-fileUse line from txt-file to identify the image you want to rename and the new name you want to give to itOpen the image copy content and write it in a new file with the new name, save new fileDelete old fileI am sure there will be a faster/better/more efficient way of doing this but it all comes to dividing and conquering your problem and its sub-problems. Can be done in python using a loop, file open in read/write modes and "os" module to access the file system.
