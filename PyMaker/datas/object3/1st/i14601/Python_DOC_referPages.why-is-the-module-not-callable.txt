I have most of my program done however I keep getting the error and can't seem to figure out why it keeps doing so.  I've also tried animal_list = Zoo.Zoo()here is some of my programand
From looking at your other questions, your Zoo class is quite wrong.Your Zoo class should be written like this:Instead you define methods like this:and define variables like:which simply don't make sense.Your problem is that you used a module (Animal) instead of self. I have no idea where you might have gotten this idea, but you may want to peruse class definition in the Python documentation.
