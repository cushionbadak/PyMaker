Ipython Notebook doesn't seem to print results in real time, but seems to buffer in a certain way and then bulk output the prints. How can I make ipython print my results as soon as the print command is processed?Example code:Supposing that the above code is in a file that is imported. How could I make it that when I call the printer function it prints a number every 5 seconds and not all the numbers at the very end?Please note that I cannot edit the function printer() because I get it from some external module. I want the to change the configs of ipython notebook somehow so that it doesn't use a buffer. Therefore, I also do not wish to use sys.stdout.flush(), I want to do it in real-time according to the question, I don't want any buffer to start with.I also tried loading ipython notebook with the command:but that also doesn't seem to work.
Since Python 3.3, print() has an additional flush argument that can be used to force flushing:
This is merely one of the answers to the question suggested by Carsten incorporating the __getattr__ delegation suggested by diedthreetimes in a comment:In the original answer, the __getattr__ method is not implemented. Without that, it fails. Other variants in answers to that question also fail in a notebook. In a notebook, sys.stdout is an instance of IPython.kernel.zmq.iostream.OutStream and has a number of methods and attributes not present in the usual sys.stdout. Delegating __getattr__ allows a flushfile to masquerade as a ...zmq.iostream.OutStream duck.This works in a python 2.7 notebook run with ipython 3.1.0
