This question already has an answer here:Python regex string matching?                    2 answers                I am trying to check if my string contains some regular expression.The strange thing is is, that while re.sub() would find the regex and will replace it, re.match() does not return any results...Here is my usage:re.match(): - trying to match the pattern ,\s*param2 - nothing is returnedre.sub(): - Successfully replacing the same pattern ,\s*param2 by " hello"How can I match the pattern ,\s*param2 without substituting it?
Note that re.match matches from the beginning of the string. You are probably looking for re.search. See search vs. match for some details.
