I have Flask application that exposed API that can run application in background and can kill it later by specifying the PID. However, for unit testing purpose, after killing the PID and checking if the PID is killed using psutil.pid_exists(pid) it seems to always returning true. I have checked manually that PID does not exist and run psutil.pid_exists(pid) on different python console and it returned true. This is causing my test to fail.In views.py, I have:And in my test:I'm running on OSX if that make any difference.Update:I've tried running on the test on my build server (Ubuntu 14.04) and the test failed.This is my run_scriptand my child.pyI added a simple scripts that demonstrate this. https://github.com/shulhi/kill-pid/tree/master
It takes time to terminate a running process. In this case it's a child process, so os.wait() or one of its variants will know exactly how long to wait. To future-proof, i'd use os.waitpid(pid, os.WEXITED).
