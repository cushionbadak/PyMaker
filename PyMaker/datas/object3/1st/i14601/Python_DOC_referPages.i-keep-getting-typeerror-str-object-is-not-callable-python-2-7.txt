Guys I'm a beginner and I'm trying (slightly failing) to teach  myself programming and writing code so your help is really appreciatedI keep getting the error:Can you guys tell me whats wrong with my code and how to, for beginners, know what to fix?Thanks
You are missing % sign here:print "%r favorite food is %s" % (person, fav)In your call you have: "%r favorite food is %s" (person, fav), and right after the string object there is a call sign, that's why it thinks that you tried to "call" a string as a function.You can use the format method:
You can also do it like this:I just prefer this way as it is more explicit and it is useful when you have too many parameters to replace in a string to keep track of the order.
