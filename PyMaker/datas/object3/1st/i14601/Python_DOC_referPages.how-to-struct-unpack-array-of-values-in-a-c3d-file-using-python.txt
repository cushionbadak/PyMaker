I'm coding my own script to retrieve values from a c3d motion capture data file. Data are stored as integer in an array of dimension 1x14. How can I retrieve these values ?Thank you for any help,Arnaud
I don't know the c3d file format at all, but if you know what kind of integers your data contains, it's easy to unpack them. You just need to give struct.pack an appropriate format string.For 16 bit integers, the format code you'll want is h or H (depending on whether the numbers are signed or unsigned). You also may need to start the string with a specifier of the byte ordering (< or > for little-endian and big-endian, respectively) if the integers are not stored with the same byte ordering that your CPU uses natively.Try something like this:
