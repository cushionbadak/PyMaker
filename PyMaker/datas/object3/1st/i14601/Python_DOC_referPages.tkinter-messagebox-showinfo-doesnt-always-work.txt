I have just started working with Python's tkinter GUI tool. In my code I create an simple GUI with one button and I want to show the user a messagebox if they click on the button.Currently, I use the tkinter.messagebox.showinfo method for it. I code on a Windows 7 computer using IDLE. If I run the code from IDLE everything works fine, but if I try to run it standalone in the Python 3 interpreter it doesn't work any more. Instead it logs this error to the console:Do you have any tips for me? My code is:
messagebox, along with some other modules like filedialog, does not automatically get imported when you import tkinter. Import it explicitly, using as and/or from as desired.
This is case sensitive - tkinter should be Tkinter wherever it is used. I did this and was able to run your example.
