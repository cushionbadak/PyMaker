This question already has an answer here:Python read a single character from the user                    20 answers                I'm new to python and I have a python2.x script that asks a user to enter a choice between answers A, B or C in bash. How can I make the script to quit immediately when only escape key is pressed at that time while waiting for user input? For now, I have this function. However, after escape key I have to press enter too.The code is in UTF-8 and escape key in bash terminal gives me ^[. As I understand msvcrt doesn't work in Linux. Can this be done, so the script works in Windows and Linux?
To read and input without the user having to press enter you could use the msvcrt module. You can find more information about it here.
