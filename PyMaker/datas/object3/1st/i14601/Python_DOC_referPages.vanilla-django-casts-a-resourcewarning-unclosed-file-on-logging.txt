I have an issue with my Django 1.8/Python 3.4 setup.When running I get the following warning:these are the settings in settings.py related to logging:I've tried to search on Google and SO for a similar issue without luck. I know how to silence this warning, of course, but I would like to know if this warning is referring to something that may leak resources in production and if there is a way to "close the file". Did Any Stackoverflow Django ninja had the same issue?
After further search I've found a potentially related issue and a blog post that drove my to the right direction. It was really simple, indeed. I'd just had to add a 'delay': True to the configuration:and the warning was gone! For further reference the property is explained in python docs:If delay is true, then file opening is deferred until the first call to emit().
