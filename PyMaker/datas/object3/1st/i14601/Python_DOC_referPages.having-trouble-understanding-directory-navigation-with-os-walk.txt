I'm relatively new to python and I'm trying my hand at a weekend project. I want to navigate through my music directories and get the artist name of each music file and export that to a csv so that I can upgrade my music collection (a lot of it is from when I was younger and didn't care about quality). Anyway, I'm trying to get the path of each music file in its respective directory, so I can pass it to id3 tag reading module to get the artist name.Here is what I'm trying:However, .abspath() doesn't do what I think it should. If I have a directory like this:and I run my code, I get this output:I'm confused why it doesn't show the 5 files being inside of a folder. Aside from that, am I even going about this in the easiest or best way? Again, I'm new to python so any help is appreciated.
You are passing just the filename to os.path.abspath(), which has no context but your current working directory.Join the path with the subdir parameter:From the os.path.abspath() documentation:On most platforms, this is equivalent to calling the function normpath() as follows: normpath(join(os.getcwd(), path)).so if your current working directory is C:\Users\User\Documents\python_music all your files are joined relative to that.But os.walk gives you the correct location to base filenames off instead; from the documentation:For each directory in the tree rooted at directory top (including top itself), it yields a 3-tuple (dirpath, dirnames, filenames).dirpath is a string, the path to the directory. [...] filenames is a list of the names of the non-directory files in dirpath. Note that the names in the lists contain no path components. To get a full path (which begins with top) to a file or directory in dirpath, do os.path.join(dirpath, name).Emphasis mine.
