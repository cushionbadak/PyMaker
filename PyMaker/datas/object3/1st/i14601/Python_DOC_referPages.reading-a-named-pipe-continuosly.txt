What is the best way to read a named pipe continuously in Python? This is my current code: However, when I run this code it seems to be taking a lot of resources from my CPU (One of them will go to 100%). It works fine with the sleep of 1 second. However, I need to read the pipe continuously to make sure if there is new data. Is there a better way to accomplish this?This is what I am sending to the pipe in C++:Thanks!
select.poll works fine (at least for Linux, not sure if Windows supports this; select.select ist afaik available, however). Just have a look at the documentation, the module is in the standard library and well documented (there is no need to know how the OS select() function actually works).Documentation:https://docs.python.org/3/library/select.htmlNote: poll() returns a list of file descriptors, not file-objects. So, you should have a dict which maps file descriptors to the corresponding object (I would have this also if I just poll one file.
