I have a code which generates either 0 or 9 randomly. This code is run 289 times...According to this code, if 9 is generated 35 times, then 0 is generated. So there is a heavy bias at the start and in the end 0 is mostly output.Is there a way to reduce this bias so that the 9's are spread out quite evenly in 289 times.Thanks for any help in advance
Apparently you want 9 to occur 35 times, and 0 to occur for the remainder - but you want the 9's to be evenly distributed. This is easy to do with a shuffle.
It sounds like you want to add some bias to the numbers that are generated by your script. Accordingly, you'll want to think about how you can use probability to assign a correct bias to the numbers being assigned.For example, let's say you want to generate a list of 289 integers where there is a maximum of 35 nines. 35 is approximately 12% of 289, and as such, you would assign a probability of .12 to the number 9. From there, you could assign some other (relatively small) probability to the numbers 1 - 8, and some relatively large probability to the number 0.Walker's Alias Method appears to be able to do what you need for this problem.General Example (strings A B C or D with probabilities .1 .2 .3 .4):Specific Example:
