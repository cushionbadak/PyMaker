After approximately eight hours of searching and attempting to implement solutions, I am still vexed by this problem.I am attempting to make a dinky ANOVA package that can read data from a text file, count the number of participants based on lines within said file, and then run an ANOVA after a few simple calculations.However, the one thing that's keeping me from finishing this project is converting everything into a calculable format--from string values to integer values.Here's what I have so far:And here's the text from the data file it's reading:1 2 3 1 2 31 2 3 1 2 31 2 3 1 2 31 2 3 1 2 31 2 3 1 2 31 2 3 1 2 31 2 3 1 2 31 2 3 1 2 31 2 3 1 2 31 2 3 1 2 3Here's the output generated by the readline portion:I'd really appreciate any and all guidance. Thanks.
You can use map to convert the strings to ints.(You seem to have an extra iteration to find the number of participants which can be counted during the first loop) You can also use a list comprehension:Or instead of map, use a nested list comprehension:edit:As @Padraic Cunningham mentions, python 3 requires using list(map(fn, it)) since map returns map objects.
Instead of this:use this instead:This list comprehension iterates over each item in the line list, and changes it to an int. The new list is then appended to your existing c1resplist list.There are plenty of ways to improve your current code (for example, you are opening and iterating over the file twice), but this should at least get you the data you're looking for.
