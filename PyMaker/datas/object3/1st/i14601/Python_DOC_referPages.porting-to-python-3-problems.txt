How would I go about porting this to Python 3?I know that I could do this myself but I don't know how. xrange is not defined in Python 3. What should I change that to?
In python3 the xrange operator was renamed to range (with the old range removed) so changing that should fix your problem. Otherwise the functionality is the same.
