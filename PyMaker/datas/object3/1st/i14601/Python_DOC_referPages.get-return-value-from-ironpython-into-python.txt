I am trying to execute a IronPython Script from Python 3.4.I Have function in IronPython script which returns a dictionary and I want to get that dictionary into python 3.4 area.I am using Subprocess.call to run IronPy script from Python 3.4So, I want to know that is there any way to get return value of external (IronPy) program into python 3.4 area.
You can't directly return an object from a subprocess. The "return value" of a process is just a number from 0-127 (the number you pass to sys.exit, or 0 if you just fall off the end of the program), which isn't very useful.However, subprocesses are connected by pipes: if you just run the child with check_output instead of call, whatever bytes it writes to stdout, you can read.So, if you can convert your data into a stream of bytes and back, then it's easy.If the data in the dict are all simple types (NoneType, bool, int, float, str, list, dict), encode it with json.Or, if they're all builtin/stdlib types and types defined in .py files that you share between CPython and IronPython, encode it with pickle.Or, if they're something you can represent as fixed C-like structures, you can use the struct or ctypes modules.etc.For example:And:When you run this, it'll print out value.(Because json.dumps defaults to escaping anything that's not pure ASCII, you can safely pass it as text rather than bytes. For most other formats, you'll want to use sys.stdout.write in the child instead of print, and leave the universal_newlines=True off the parent.)
