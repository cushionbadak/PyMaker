I know the sorted() function in Python can operate on a number list or dictionaries, and it returns a list of sorted number or keys. For example:Then we can obtain the re-arranged sorted number list as [0,1,2,2,3,4,6,8]My question is that: does sorted() function have any other functionality? I hope you guys could give me some simple examples. :)
Python's sorted takes in any iterable (list, dict, tuple), e.g.,Also, it can optionally take in a key, which means you can sort by some characteristic. For example, you could sort a string alphabetically or lexicographically:A cool feature of sorting using a given key means you can also provide a lambda expression, so, as in the following example, you can sort by the length of a dictionary value (list):This also works with tuples:Note that when sorting nested lists or tuples (or other iterables), it will sort first by the first inner index and then by the subsequent inner indices.You can also specify how you want to sort a class:You can also use attrgetter to get an object's attribute to dictate what you want to sort on:Furthermore, with key, you can have a function that combines multiple keys, e.g.,Next, you can specify whether or not you want a reverse sort:sorted also works with lists of multiple types (only in Python 2):Note: sorting among multiple types does not work in Python 3. You'll get a TypeError.Lastly and for historical reasons, Python's sorted allows for a cmp, or comparison function. For example:It should be noted, too, that Python's sorted uses Timsort as its sorting algorithm, which is a stable sort. This means that if there are multiple of the same element (or field), the original order will be preserved.Sources:https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#sortedhttps://docs.python.org/3/howto/sorting.htmlhttps://wiki.python.org/moin/HowTo/Sortinghttp://www.thegeekstuff.com/2014/06/python-sorted/http://www.peterbe.com/plog/sorting-mixed-type-lists-in-python-3
