Natural Text
I have two text files. One text file is "numbers.txt". It contains 10 digit phone numbers, one on each line. The second file "users" contains data about several accounts. I only want to find info on the accounts listed in numbers.txtSo, for each number in numbers.txt search users file for said number. If found return that line of text and the following line of text (or return all text until next empty line would also work).numbers.txt looks like:users file looks like:Result I'm looking for:I'm stuck / stumped as to how to approach it. What I have so far:
Read the numbers into a setLook at the first ten characters of each line in users.txt. If that string is in numbers, save two lines to a container (dict)
The code is not optimal therefore have to read users_data numbers.txt lines times:
I just suggest you might can sort the data first, then we can loop for number in numbers. can find the number in the users_data.
This is written in Python 3 to get the behavior of StringIO that I wanted. Just change with StringIO(nums_txt) as f: to open('numbers.txt') as f: to use the name of the file of your nums file and same with the user file part. This should be obvious:Prints:Comments:It is not obvious if the users file is formatted like that. Adjust the regex accordinglyOnly works if the numbers in numbers are uniqueRecords in users without a corresponding number in numbers are gathered in the dict nfs
