Natural Text
I have text file as follows,depending upon the first value of the first line I want to read the next four four lines.how can I achieve this in python.
First, this is a really bad format. If you wrote the code that generated it, or otherwise have control over it, you should change it to use a format that's intended for data interchange, rather than just dumping out everything in human-readable format and then trying to figure out how to parse human-readable data.But, assuming you can't change that...First, you need to open the file:Now, to do anything with the first line, you need to read it:Or, if you prefer (they mean the same thing, if f is a file):But this is a string, like '3 4\n'; you presumably want it as two numbers. So, you have to split it, then convert the parts to numbers. (I'm guessing integers.)Now, apparently that 3 4 means you want 3 chunks of 4 lines each. So, let's give them better names:Now, we can just loop chunks times:Then, we can read 4 lines:I'm not sure what you actually want to do with each line. My guess is that you're going to want to parse them into, say, a header line, plus a list of the rest of them as lists of values?You can parse that header again with split and calling int and float on the parts, but what about the stuff? Those look a lot like someone just calling print on a Python list. If that's what happened, the literal_eval function does exactly the same thing Python itself would do with a string that looks like a Python literal. When you print a list whose values are all int, str, float, or list, literal_eval can reverse it. (Although there may be rounding errors if there are floats.) So, instead of that last loop:For example, one thing you can do is this:
