Hopefully the incorrect code still conveys what I'm trying to do. I get a string error using enumerate (and range) b/c 'count' is interpreted as a string when I instead want it to be interpreted as an integer value. I want to create arrays with integer values from 0 to the count value. If it helps, my purpose is to create a single list of values when only the frequency of each value is given. Thanks!
From what I understood, each row in your CSV file has a number and a count; and you want to create, for each row, a list with the number repeated count times.As you have used it, you will not get a string error - you are using enumerate wrong since it expects an iterable as the first argument. But in this case, enumerate is not needed anyways.In general though, what you read from the csv will be a string, so you need to convert it into an integer. You could do something like this:Or you could use comprehension and get all the lists at once:
There are several problems here. I am not sure what you are trying to do.1) To get rid of the error, just transform your count into an integer:2) To create a list that ranges between 0 and count:3) you have an infinite loop:Maybe what you want is something like:
