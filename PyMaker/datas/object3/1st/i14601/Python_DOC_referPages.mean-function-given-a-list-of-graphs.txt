I need a function that, given a list of graphs, builds a newgraph in which for each abscissa the ordinate is the average of the ordinate of the several graphs supplied.The data for each graph is a pair of lists of numbers, the first of which is the abscissa and the ordinate the second.The function should assume that all graphs have the same abscissa lists.For example:Expected return from function(graphs):
We can use the zip function to easily add the corresponding ordinates from each ordinate list, by using the "splat" operator *. This tells zip to treat each list in ylists as an argument, so it zips all of those lists together, creating a list of tuples. The first tuple in the resulting list contains all the 1st members of each list in ylist, the 2nd tuple in the resulting list contains all the 2nd members of each list in ylist, etc. outputI developed the above code on Python 2.6.6. On Python 3 you can changesize = float(len(graphs))tosize = len(graphs)FWIW, it's possible to condense the mean_graph function into one line, although it does make it a little harder to read:or for Python 3:
