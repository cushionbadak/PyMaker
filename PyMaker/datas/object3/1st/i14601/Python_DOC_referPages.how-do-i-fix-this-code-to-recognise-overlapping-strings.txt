No count,list or lambda can be used.I'm suposed to make a program that receives a lower string from the user then finds, counts and print the number of times a substring appeared.But I'm having problems with overlapping strings.example: string is memem, the expected exit is 2
One way to do this is to use the second argument of str.find which indicates an optional index to start searching for the substring within a string.From the docs:str.find(sub[, start[, end]])Â¶ Return the lowest index in the string  where substring sub is found, such that sub is contained in the slice  s[start:end]. Optional arguments start and end are interpreted as in  slice notation. Return -1 if sub is not found.So if we keep track of the last_index found in a variable, we can simply start the search for the substring again in the next possible index. Expressed in code, this is the expression last_index + 1. If last_index is ever -1, we stop searching for the substring and output our count:
You could useThis will then find replace in entrada, increment the count, find replace in entrada[i+1:] where i is the start of the previous match, increment the count, and repeat forever.
