Hey everybody.I have this assignment where I had to make a program that decodes a shift cipher. Right now it works, but it's incredibly slow. I suspect it's probably because of the nested loops. I'm not really sure where to go from this point.Some explanation of the code: The program reads in an encrypted file where each letter is shifted by a certain amount (i.e With a shift of 5, every A would now be an F. This would be done for every letter). The program reads in a dictionary file as well. There are only 26 possible shifts so for each shift it will decode the file. The program will take the file for each possible shift and compare it to the dictionary file. The one that has the most in common with the dictionary file will be reprinted as the final decrypted file.Thank you everybody!https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3bXyam-ubR2U2Z6dU1Ed3oxN1k/view?usp=sharing^ There is a link to the program, dictionary, encrypted and decrypted files.
Just change line 16 :So the if item in dictionary_file: is executed in constant time instead of linear time. The program runs now in 4 seconds, disabling print statements,and changing i=highest_so_far in highest_so_far=i, and capitalizing dictionary.
