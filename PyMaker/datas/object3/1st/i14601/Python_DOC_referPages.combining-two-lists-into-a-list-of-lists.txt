I have two lists:And I to combine them to create a list like the one below: How could I achieve this?
You want itertools.zip_longest with a fillvalue of an empty string:For python2 it is izip_longest:If you just want to use the values you can iterate over the the izip object:Some timings vs using map:map also creates another list using python2 so for large lists or if you have memory restrictions it is best avoided.
In Python 2.7: another way to do this:For the example lists given in the question, this way is faster than using using izip_longest: If the lists are longer and the non-existing value is to be filled with '' then izip_longest is significantly faster. However, if you are content for the resulting list to be creating with a None rather than a '', you don't need the list comprehension or the conditional: just map(None, a, b). Then the speed can be similar to that of izip_ilongest for longer lists.Note that when lists of unequal length are to be combined it is not necessarily the case  that the result should take the length of the longer one. If you want a zip type function to always take the length of the first argument then the answers to the SO question "Is there a middle ground between `zip` and `zip_longest`" are illuminating.
