I am trying to convert a string, such as 'AB0001', to an integer that appears as '001' I am trying:though my output is:I need this to be an integer to be used in:Thank you for your time and please let me know how to acquire the following outcome:
You cannot have leading zeros at all in python3 and in python 2 they signify octal numbers. If you are going to pass it into a string just keep it as a string.If you want to pad with 0's you can zfill:I don't see why you slice at all thought when you seem to want the exact same output as the original string. will give you exactly what you want.
If I understand you correctly, you're going to be using the int in a string, correct?  Since this is the case, you should do exactly what you're doing:You don't need to store the variable as an int with the format 001 (which you can't do anyway).  You convert it to that format when you create format_string.
Using string-formatting via the .format() method is good for this.Results in:Here, {:04} is a format specifier telling string to format the given value by filling with up to 4 leading zeros.Therefore,ã€€using "{:04}".format(0) will result in the string, "0000".
