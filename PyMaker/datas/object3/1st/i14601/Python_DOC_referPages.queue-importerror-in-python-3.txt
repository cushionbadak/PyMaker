I am not sure why I am getting this ImportError. queue.Queue() is in the documentation.https://docs.python.org/3/library/queue.html?highlight=queue#queue.QueueI am using it in a function like so:node_queue = queue.Queue()error:Line 5 is import queue:
A kinda standard cross py2-py3 compatible version:
Another way to avoid version problems is:
for ImportError: No module named 'Queue' in Python3, just replace the sentence "import Queue" with "import queue as Queue".
Replace #!/usr/bin/env python3 with #!/usr/bin/python3If your env isn't set up correctly then #!/usr/bin/env python3 may not work. If #!/usr/bin/python3 gives the same error then try running /usr/bin/python3 --version in your shell as a sanity check.If you don't get a sensible output from /usr/bin/python3 --version then you have odd installation of python 3 and I suggest installing it using your package manager (apt-get, yum, homebrew or whatever you prefer - this will probably fix the !#/usr/bin/env issue).
