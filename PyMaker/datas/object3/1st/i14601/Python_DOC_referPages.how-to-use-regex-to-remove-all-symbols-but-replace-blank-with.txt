I know that with regex, for exampleI can remove symbols from the string. But what I want now is to remove all other symbols but replace blank with '-'. Is there any way to do that?For example, Thanks!
If you want to replace spaces with - then ignore and str.replace:
You can specify a function to do the replacing:Demo:From the docs:re.sub(pattern, repl, string, count=0, flags=0)...If repl is a function, it is called for every non-overlapping  occurrence of pattern. The function takes a single match object  argument, and returns the replacement string.So, replace will receive each match and return '-' if it is whitespace or '' otherwise.
Like so:You can also do this without a regex:And you can place all the target 'special' characters in the second argument to translate.
