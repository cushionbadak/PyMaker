I'm new to python and programming in general. This problem is asking for a parallel array for 10 trucks , an array for miles, an array for gallons, and another for costs per gallon.  If anyone has a recommendation on helpful sites or videos I could take a look at to figure python out that would be awesome! Thanks for the help in advance. So far I have this..
Something like this should work:There were a few issues with your original version:As stated in the comments, you don't (generally) initialise a Python list to start at a certain size, instead you create it empty and then add as much stuff into it as you need.The for loop need to be in the form of for <var> in <iterable>. Then you can use range(x) as your iterable, in Python 2.7 range will return a list of all the numbers in that range, in Python 3 it returns an iterator (which is more memory efficient). range(3) will allow you to iterate over 0, 1 and 2 (for a total of 3 iterations).The print statement can be tidied up a bit. By using <string>.format() you can make the output a lot easier. See https://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html#format-examples for the full documentation.
