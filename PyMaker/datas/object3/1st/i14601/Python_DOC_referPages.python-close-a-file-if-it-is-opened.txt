I would like to insert the following function into a Python script, concerning a file, and I haven't found how to write it yet:if the file is opened, close itif it is already closed, do nothingAny help will be really much appreciated. Thank you in advance!
You write this as f.close().In Python 3.x, IOBase.close says:Flush and close this stream. This method has no effect if the file is already closed.Likewise, in Python 2.x, file.close says:Close the file â€¦ Calling close() more than once is allowed.Of course if you read the docs, you'll notice that files (whether 3.x IOBase or 2.x file) also have a closed attribute, so if you really wanted to write what you were asking for explicitly, you could:But that has no benefit over just calling f.close(). Unless you want to make sure that some file-like objects that aren't 100% file-like raise an inscrutable AttributeError instead of just working as you'd like, but I doubt you want that.
f.close() is the way to close a file. Python details how to use file operations Here in python 2 and here in Python3
