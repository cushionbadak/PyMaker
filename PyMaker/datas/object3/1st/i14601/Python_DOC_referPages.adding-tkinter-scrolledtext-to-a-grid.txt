Natural Text
So, I have a basic layout that is created with the following code (written here for brevity):Which I had hoped would add the ScrolledText to the grid. This did work when I was using just a Text widget.However, I get a KeyError because output is not in the children list. Here is the output of the pprint statement (again, cut to show pertinent portion):As you can see, there is a named input child that was added in code not shown. However, the output named widget doesn't appear to be added. Why does output.grid(row=0, column=0, sticky=tk.N+tk.S+tk.E+tk.W) not add it as expected?
It seems like creating a ScrolledText actually creates a Frame wrapping the actual ScrolledText widget together with a ScrollBar, and the name you assign to the ScrolledText is not assigned to the Frame, but to the wrapped ScrolledText.Thus, master.children does indeed not contain a child with name 'output', but the Frame. The 'output' widget can then be found among the children of that Frame.So if you want to get a reference to the ScrolledText widget you have to get if from the Frame, but instead it might be much easier to just bind it to self when you create it, i.e.This is indeed the same object as the one you would get from the Frame's children:Output:
