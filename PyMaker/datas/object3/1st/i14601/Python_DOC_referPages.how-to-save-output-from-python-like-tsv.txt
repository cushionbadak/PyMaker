I am using biopython package and I would like to save result like tsv file. This output from print to tsv.Thank you.
That is fairly simple , instead of printing it you need to write that to a file.And if you want to name the various columns in the file then you can use:So the complete code may look like:
My preferred solution is to use the CSV module.  It's a standard module, so:Somebody else has already done all the heavy lifting.It allows you to leverage all the functionality of the CSV module.You can be fairly confident it will function as expected (not always the case when I write it myself).You're not going to have to reinvent the wheel, either when you write the file or when you read it back in on the other end (I don't know your record format, but if one of your records contains a TAB,  CSV will escape it correctly for you).It will be easier to support when the next person has to go in to update the code 5 years after you've left the company.The following code snippet should do the trick for you:Note that this is for Python 3.x.  If you're using 2.x, the open and writer = ... will be slightly different.
If you want to use the .tsv to label your word embeddings in TensorBoard, use the following snippet. It uses the CSV module (see Doug's answer).word_count is a list of tuples like this:
The following snippet:Yields a file output.tsv containing So, in your case:
I prefer using join() in this type of code:The 'tab' character is \t and the join function takes the (3) arguments and prints them with a tab in between.
