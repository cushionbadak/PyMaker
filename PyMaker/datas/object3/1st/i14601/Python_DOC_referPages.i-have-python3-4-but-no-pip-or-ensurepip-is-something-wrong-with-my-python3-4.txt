I've read in multiple places that python3.4 ships with pip. My OS is Lubuntu 14.04 and the default python version is Python 2.7.6 but init says I have python3.4 installed (when I run python3 -V it says I have Python 3.4.0). I made this post earlier last week:How do I use pip 3 with Python 3.4?One of the comments to the reply said that "It may be worth mentioning that python3.4 should always ship pip by default. So python3 -m pip should work out of the box. If not, there's python -m ensurepip to bootstrap pip. get-pip.py should not be necessary here."I can confirm that I do not have pip because I didand it said that pip is currently not installed. I tried runningand it saidI then triedand it saidWith that said, is there something wrong with my version of python3 because it does not have pip or ensurepip? I'm asking because I've read in multiple places (for example, in my previous question) that python3.4 comes with pip and I don't think that is true for my case. My end goal is to run Django1.8 using python 3.4.3.
On Ubuntu and other Debian derivatives you have to install python3-pip to get Python3â€™s pip.
