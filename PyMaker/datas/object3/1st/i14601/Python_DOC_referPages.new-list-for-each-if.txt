I have the following code:What I want is for each of the IFs to start with a clear self.deployJobs but I can't seem to figure out the logic.
the problem is it's clearing after each part of the if loopAn if statement is not a loop.  The indented code blocks within it (technically, "suites" within it) are not executed sequentially.  Zero or one of those suites will be executed per iteration of the loop, never more than one.I want the list to contain everything in the if, then when it moves to the elif to be empty againOnce an if or elif condition is determined to be true, the suite following that if or elif is executed, and then the entire if-elif-else structure is done.  Execution of the if suite will never "move to the elif".The Python Language Reference describes the behavior of if statements clearly.What I want is for each of the ifs to start with a clear self.deployJobsAssuming you mean each you want each of the if statements suites to start with a clear self.deployJobs, then you should put your self.deployJobs = [] line immediately before your if statement... which you've already done.So I'm afraid on this point I have to join the numerous other posters who can't figure out what you want this code to do.  I can suggest, however, that ending suites with self.deployJobs = [] is probably not helping you at all.
