When I run the program I get everything up to q outputted as it should be, but the .mafft that should be created by q is coming back empty. Edit: I forgot to ask the actual question. What am I doing wrong here? Is it some syntax I am unaware of?
It has nothing to do with using os.system() instead of subprocess.The problem is that you are not closing the outfname file before running the program.  Move the closes to before the os.system() call:The input file to mafft (outfname) is empty because the buffers have not been flushed, you are "suffering from buffering".I would consider what everyone has said about using subprocess, but after you get this working!  Only change one thing at a time!
