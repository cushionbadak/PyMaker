I have a function I'm calling every 5 seconds like such:I'm exiting the script by either catching a KeyboardInterrupt or by catching a System exit and calling this:I'm also restarting the program every so often by calling:My question is, how do I get that timer thread to shut off? If I keyboard interrupt, the timer keeps going. 
Basically when your code is about to exit, it will fire one last function and this is where you will check if your thread is still running. If it is, do something that will either cancel the transaction or otherwise exit gracefully. In general, it's best to let threads finish by themselves, but if it's not doing anything important (please note the emphasis) than you can just do t.cancel(). Design your code so that threads will finish on their own if possible.
Another way would be to use the Queue() module to send and recieve info from a thread using the .put() outside the thread and the .get() inside the thread.What you can also do is create a txt file and make program write to it when you exit And put an if statement in the thread function to check it after each iteration (this is not a really good solution but it also works) I would have put a code exemple but i am writing from mobile sorry
