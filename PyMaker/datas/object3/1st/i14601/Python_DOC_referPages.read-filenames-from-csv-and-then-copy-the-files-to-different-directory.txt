I have been able to write a batch file to find files and put the file paths into a CSV. I haven't been able to figure out how to read the file locations from the CSV and then move the files to a different storage device with the same folder structure using python.  This is what I'd like to do.I wish I had some code to show you but none of it has worked.
Here's a quick and dirty solution. (I haven't tested it yet, YMMV!)
Adding to Daniel's post, since he did warn he hadn't tested it :), I think you'll need to make a couple small changes. Basically, I think the issue in the suggested code is that filename is assumed to be the full path. But then that creates a problem when you get to the os.path.join command for new_filename because you're adding a new path to a full path and name. I would suggest including a filepath and filename in your csv to make the code run. The changes appear to work when I testd it, although I didn't run as a function (and I used print() statements for Python 3.4 syntax):
