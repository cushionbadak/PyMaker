I've been trying to use the sep='' to separate the numbers in between each other but they never separate unless I use end="".However, when I switch sep='' with end="" it works properly.So, what am I doing wrong?Also, how do I separate the numbers in between with a "+" symbol without having it appear at the end?Thanks!This was the output:
You can use string join function to join item in the list with some string, here is exampleso your case should be 
If you look at the documentation for the print-function. It takes a variable numbers to print out separated by the given sep and ended with end. So you can simply use the *syntax to pass your sequence to print. Simply:
You're using numbers in a for loop. Even though the variable name is plural, it only gets one value at a time.  i.e., if s_num==1 and e_num==2, the for loop will be unfolded to the following:As you see, numbers takes a single value from the range each time through the for loop, not the whole range. sep is used to separate multiple values being printed out from a variable list of arguments passed to the print function. Since there is only a single value being printed out in each print statement, there is nothing to separate so setting sep does nothing.
