My  task was to encrypt a random message using a list of 7,3,19,5. Here is my code for this task:My output is this:
You don't need to modify your list if you know about the modulo operator % (division remainder).You also don't need to keep count manually (there's enumerate() for that), and you should be using better variable names:
The length of string is variable and list has got fixed elements.So modify your list.Modify your list w = [7,3,19,5]*len(m)output:Instead you can use random numbers.For the above function you can import random
resetting the g value when it reaches the length of w will also work.
