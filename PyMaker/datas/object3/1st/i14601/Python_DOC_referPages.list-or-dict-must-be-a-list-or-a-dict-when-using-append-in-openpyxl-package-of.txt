Based on this tutorial : LINK we have this structure:This returns below error for ws.append(range(100)):What is the problem?
Evidently the argument to ws.append must be either a dictionary or a list. Presumably you're using Python 3.x, where range no longer returns a list (it now behaves like Python 2.x's xrange).The simplest fix is to explicitly convert the range into a list:
As @jonrsharpe notes, you cannot use range like this. A range in Python is essentially for looping over only. You can convert it to a list: list(range(100)) if you really need the values explicitly.
