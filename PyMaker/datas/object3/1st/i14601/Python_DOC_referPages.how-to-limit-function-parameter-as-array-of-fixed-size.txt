How can I limit python function parameter to accept only arrays of some fixed-size?I tried this but it doesn't compile:with I'm new to this language.
What about checking the length inside of the function? Here I just raised an error, but you could do anything.
1st way (you'll most probably want to use this)You can just check for all the criteria inside your function by using if statements:2nd way (only for debugging)You can use assert as a workaround solution (meant for debugging):So this will check if both criteria are met, otherwise an assertion error will be raised with the message Wrong Input Type.
