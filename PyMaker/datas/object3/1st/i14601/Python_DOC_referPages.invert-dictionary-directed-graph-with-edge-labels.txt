Natural Text
I would like to invert for example this dictionary:Imagine that this is a directed graph with vertices 1, 2, 3 and labelled edges like 1 -> 1 with label '[]', represented in dictionary form by 1: {1: '[]'. The labels don't have to be strings, they can just be lists.I want to reverse the edges and keep the labels as they are.The output i want is:I saw some methods like Python reverse / invert a mapping but they all work for simpler dictionaries having no "labels". 
Just iterate the sub-dictionaries and the keys in those and add them to a new dictionary with first and second key reversed.Or use a defaultdict, i.e. p = collections.defaultdict(dict), then you don't need the p.setdefault(to, {}) line.Afterwards, p is {1: {1: '[]', 2: '[]', 3: '[]'}, 2: {1: '[1]'}, 3: {2: '[1]'}}
