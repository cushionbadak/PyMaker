I need to join the elements in a list without using the join command, so if for example I have the list:The output should be:Here is my code so far:But, in the end, the answer ends up being 125610 which is clearly wrong.I think the logic is OK, but I can't find the problem?
If you just want to print the number rather than return an actual int:
You could just convert each element to a string, add them, and then convert back to an int:

There can be few more options likeOption1Option 2Option 3Option 4
a numeric solution, using your code
You may try map and reduce with lambda like this:
Here's an entirely numerical solution, playing off of your notion of messing with powers of 10. You were on the right track, but your implementation assumed all values were 1 digit long.This returns 1241511, as requested.All I'm doing here is looping through the list in reverse order and keeping track of how many digits to the left I need to shift each value. This allows integers with an arbitrary number of digits.
