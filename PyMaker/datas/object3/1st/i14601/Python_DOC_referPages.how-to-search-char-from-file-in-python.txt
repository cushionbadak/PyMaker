Actually i am coming from C++ and i am new here as well, I am having iteration problem.I am using python 2.7.8 and unable to solve which is what i am wanting. I have a file name called "foo.txt". Through code i am trying to find using how many "a e i o u" are in the file. I have created array: vowel[] = {'a','e','i','o',u} and my code should shd give me the combine count of all vowels. But i am facing error:file foo.txtmy code:
Do in range(len()) instead, because if you use for k in vowels , k will be 'a' then 'b' then 'c'... etc. However, the syntax for getting objects via indexes is vowels[index_number], not vowels[content]. So, you have to iterate over the length of the array, and use vowels[0] to get 'a', then vowels[1]' to get 'b' etc.
Python has a wonderful module called collections with a function Counter. You can use it like this:You can also do it without collections.Counter():Please note that the time complexity of a set {} lookup is O(1), whereas the time complexity for a list [] lookup is O(n) according to this page on wiki.python.org.I tested both methods with the module timeit and as expected the first method using collections.Counter() is slightly faster:
Python prides itself on its abstraction and standard library data structures. Check out collections.Counter. It takes an iterable and returns a dict of value -> frequency.
