How do I read all data from a python socket? There doesn't seem to be a "sendall" (like Socket#read in ruby) counterpart for reading and concatenating buffers seem fairly low-level for a what's supposed to be a higher level language. If I do have to resort to that  (concatenating buffers that is), is there an optimal buffer size I should choose assuming that I'm dealing with UNIX sockets?
The higher level of abstraction you want is in io, which can be fitted atop a socket with makefile:
