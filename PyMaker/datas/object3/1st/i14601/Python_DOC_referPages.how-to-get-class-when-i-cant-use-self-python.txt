I have one weird problem. I have following code:And output is something like this:So how can I get B instead of second A?
The magic __class__ closure is set for the method context and only really meant for use by super().For methods you'd want to use self.__class__ instead:or better still, use type(self):If you want to be able to call the method on a class, then use the classmethod decorator to be handed a reference to the class object, rather than remain unbound:classmethods are always bound to the class they are called on, so for A.f() that'd be A, for B.f() you get handed in B.
