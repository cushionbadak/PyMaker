This question already has an answer here:How to properly use python's isinstance() to check if a variable is a number?                    3 answers                What is the best way to determine if a Python object is numeric?I'm using the following testBut I wonder if there is another way.
The preferred approach is to use numbers.Number, which isThe root of the numeric hierarchy. If you just want to check if an  argument x is a number, without caring what kind, use isinstance(x,  Number)as shown belowAlso, type(o) in [int, long, float, complex] can be rewritten asto make it more robust, as in able to detect subclasses of int, long, float and complex.
Try the isinstance function.Return true if the object argument is an instance of the classinfo argument, or of a (direct, indirect or virtual) subclass thereofSample Usage
