Natural Text
So I'm making a quick text based application and made a guess at doing this. I want my program to accept an input from the user and create different outcomes when a user inputs a direction. It just is going to the if no matter what I type. I took a shot in the dark and this is my code.
input() returns a result, but you ignored it and nothing happened with it. if ("left"): just asks if the string "left" is not empty. It is indeed not empty.Store the return value of input() in a new variable, then test that variable for equality with ==:You probably want to peruse the Python tutorial some more.
