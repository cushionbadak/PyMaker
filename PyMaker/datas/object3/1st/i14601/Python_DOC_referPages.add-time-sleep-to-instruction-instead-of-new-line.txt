I have a lot of necessary time.sleep() in my script. I want to clean up the code and possibly append the wait/pause to the previous line instead of creating a new line. Example:Is there any way of achieving this? (Python 3.4)Thanks in advance.
If you mean combine these two lines in one line, try:
If you unconditionally want to be able to sleep after a particular function (or group of functions), the easiest way of doing this that I'm aware of is to use a decorator.The issue with that solution is that the duration of the sleep can't be altered, and you can't enable and disable the sleep call on a case-by-case basis. To enhance the solution you can add arguments to your decorator.Which means you could now write you code as follows:One other alternative that can let you inject code is to rewrite the Abstract Syntax Tree of your code at runtime. This would allow you to inject arbitrary function calls. Libraries like numba and pony use tricks like this to transform Python code into something domain specific.
