I would like change my dict values to dict, not tuple like they are now. I have function which returns i elements of the combination n on k-places.OUTPUT = (1, 2, 3)EXPECTED = {1,2,3}
Your expected output is a set, not a dictionary; just use set() on the result:Demo:To get a specific iteration of a iterable object, you could use an itertools.islice() call, rather than produce a dictionary with all results:but there are probably more efficient ways of calculating a specific combination of n out of k than brute-forcing.
