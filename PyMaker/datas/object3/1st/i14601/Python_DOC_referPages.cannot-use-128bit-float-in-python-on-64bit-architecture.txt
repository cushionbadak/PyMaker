I checked the size of a pointer in my python terminal (in Enthought Canopy IDE)via I've a 64bit architecture and working with numpy.float64 is just fine. But I cannot use np.float128?or results in:I'm running the following version:
Update: From the comments, it seems pointless to even have a 128 bit float on a 64 bit system. I am using anaconda on a 64-bit Ubuntu 14.04 system with sys.version_info(major=2, minor=7, micro=9, releaselevel='final', serial=0)and 128 bit floats work fine:This might be an distribution problem. Try:Install AnacondaUpdate canopyCheck that the version of python in the path is the one supplied by anaconda or canopyEDIT: Update from the comments:Not my downvote, but this post doesn't really answer the "why doesn't  np.float128 exist on my machine" implied question. The true answer is  that this is platform specific: float128 exists on some platforms but  not others, and on those platforms where it does exist it's almost  certainly simply the 80-bit x87 extended precision type, padded to 128  bits.  â€“ Mark Dickinson
