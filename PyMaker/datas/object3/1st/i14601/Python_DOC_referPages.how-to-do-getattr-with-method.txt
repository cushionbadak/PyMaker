This question already has an answer here:Call a Python method by name                    5 answers                How would I do the following:I know I can do getattr(instance, method) to get instance.method, but is there a builtin to actually run that method?
Just do getattr(instance, method)().  getattr returns the method object, which you can call with () like any other callable.
All you need to do is add a () to the end:
You can use operator.methodcaller to create a function that will run that method on the passed instance when executed. However you still have to actually call it on an instance.This is useful when you want to call the same method, for which you don't know the name, on different instances.
