Natural Text
I'm relatively new to Python, and I'm trying to create a piece of code in Python that looks through each line of a text file for a certain value, inputted by the user, then replaces a line with a new one created by the code. However, when I try the code, the file goes blank. I've got an f.close() but the code still won't write.Here is my code:
You will have to read the entire file, then change the content before writing again, as w clears the file contents. If appending to (adding to the end of) the file suffices, you can change the mode argument to a to open the file in append mode.You should also consider using with instead of manually closing the file:, as this closes the file and cleans up regardless of errors thrown etc.
Mode w+ means "open the file for writing, truncating it first, and also let me read it"So, it's doing exactly what you asked.If you want to open the file for reading, but also let you write it, that's spelled r+. Or, in Python 3.0+, you can also just use plain +.The docs for open even include examples of different modes that explain exactly what you're asking:The default mode is 'r' (open for reading text, synonym of 'rt'). For binary read-write access, the mode 'w+b' opens and truncates the file to 0 bytes. 'r+b' opens the file without truncation.Or, for the 2.x version:Modes 'r+', 'w+' and 'a+' open the file for updating (reading and writing); note that 'w+' truncates the file.That's the difference between r+ and w+ (or r+b and w+b): use the r one when you don't want truncation.
