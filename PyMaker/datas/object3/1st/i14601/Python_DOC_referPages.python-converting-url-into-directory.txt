I am trying to convert a url like "www.example.com/images/dog.png" into directories from the current directory.So I get a folder named "www.example.com", inside that "images" and finally inside that the file saved as "dog.png"I've tried using urllib.url2pathname(path) but it keeps appending P:\ to the start of it.
You can use os.makedirs() to create the directory tree, but that will fail if the final directory already exists. So you can test if it exists before attempting to create the directory tree, or use try: ... except OSError:. In Python 3 you can supply an exist_ok parameter to over-ride this behaviour, see the Python docs of os.makedirs for further info.If your system doesn't support directory names containing periods you can translate them to another character, eg _, like this:(just insert this after the fullname = os.path.join(cwd, url) line).And as jwilner mentions in the comments, it's more efficient to usethan path, basename = os.path.split(fullname) if you don't need the base component of the file name (in this example "dog.png").
