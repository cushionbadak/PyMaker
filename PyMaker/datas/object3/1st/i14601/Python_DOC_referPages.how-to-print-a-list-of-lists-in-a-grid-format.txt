If I have a list of lists like ([1,2,3,4,5],[2,4,6,8,10],[3,6,9,12,15])How can I print it on the screen in a grid format? Just like:My code is like But I don't know how to make each list in a single row like example above.
Maybe just adding an empty print on the main for:
If the width of your elements varies more than tab width, you can use fixed width columns (filled by spaces):
My solution creates string with space-separated numbers in rows and \n-separated rows. It's using str.center method and generator-expressions.str.center(width[, fillchar])Return centered in a string of length width. Padding is done using the specified fillchar (default is an ASCII space). The original  string is returned if width is less than or equal to len(s).Output:Let's break it up:It iterates over row, converts values to strings and calls center method. Result is space-padded values.It creates single string from values. So now, string contains whole row.It takes processed rows (strings)from previous step and joins them using newline character, so result is row1\nron2\nrow3.
