Natural Text
I can get the function to work regularly but when I do it recursively, it repeats infintely and I have to 'Ctrl C'to end it in the shell. Non recursiveRecursiveI'm not sure how I can get it to work recursively so any help is greatly appreciated!
You need a recursive case and a base case.But more important than that is to use variable names that have meaning.
