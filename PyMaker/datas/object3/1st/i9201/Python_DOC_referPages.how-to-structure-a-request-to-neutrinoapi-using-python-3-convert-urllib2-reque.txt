Natural Text
Im new to server side code and interested in using the neutrinoapi (www.neutrinoapi.com) for filtering some bad words out of text. I have written the following code in Python 3 (im using bottle server):This request is returning the following error:raise HTTPError(req.full_url, code, msg, hdrs, fp)urllib.error.HTTPError: HTTP Error 403: ForbiddenThe example on the website is at this link: https://www.neutrinoapi.com/api/api-examples/python/Examples provided are using python 2.7 and urllib2 which i understand is now built into urllib. Cant seem to get the request to work in Python 3. Any ideas on how to make a proper request?
The Python example doesn't use JSON for the parameters, only for the response. You'll need to URL encode those parameters instead; use the urllib.parse.urlencode() function for that, then encode the resulting string to bytes.You also need to send the content parameter for a bad-word-filter request, not an IP address:
