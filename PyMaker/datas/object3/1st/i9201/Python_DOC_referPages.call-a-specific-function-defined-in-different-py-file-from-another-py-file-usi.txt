Like I said in my comment, use getattr to access a function by its name.
In your code string is a string with the name of the function you want to call. ob.string() looks for a function namend string on the object ob.

Instead use user_input=int(input("enter the test case number")) which parses the given string to an integer.If you ever need something more flexible you can use ast.literal_eval from the ast module which can also parse lists, dicts, ...
