I have a string abccddde I need to find substrings like:a, b, c, cc, d, dd, ddd, esubstrings ab or cd are not valid.I tried finding all the substrings from a string but its not efficientThis is outputting:['a', 'ab', 'abc', 'abcc', 'abccd', 'abccdd', 'abccddd', 'abccddde', 'b', 'bc', 'bcc', 'bccd', 'bccdd', 'bccddd', 'bccddde', 'c', 'cc', 'ccd', 'ccdd', 'ccddd', 'ccddde', 'c', 'cd', 'cdd', 'cddd', 'cddde', 'd', 'dd', 'ddd', 'ddde', 'd', 'dd', 'dde', 'd', 'de', 'e']This was the method i followed to find the substrings but it gives all the possiblities but that is what makes it inefficientPlease Help!
You can use itertools.groupby() for this:Output:
You could use collections.Counter():Counter(s) returns a dictionary containing the amount of times the letters repeat in the string. We then iterate through the dictionary and create all the repeated strings ('d', 'dd', 'ddd', etc) for one term. 
itertools.groupby can tell you the number of consecutive chars. After that for each group you have the char repeated upto that number.
here is one way using regex:

The following will do what you want. I don't know if its efficient compared to other solutions though.Timings
