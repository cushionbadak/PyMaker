This is my code:The strange thing is that the code runs just fine. I only get tracebacks after breaking my loop with a KeyboardInterrupt, spilling out accumulated tracebacks from each loop that ran like this:This specifically happens only if I break the code manually, can anyone shed some light as to what best practice I am ignoring?
If you want to see the output from your print statements immediately, just use flush=True.Whether output is buffered is usually determined by file, but if the flush keyword argument is true, the stream is forcibly flushed.Exception tracebacks are only printed when you exit your program with an exception.
