I need to create a ORDERED list that contains a series of sub-lists. But I'm not sure how to iterate through known variables.Here's an example. Let's say I have the following sub-lists:I'm trying to append the lists to a larger list list_all:So I'm trying to iterate through the variable names but I'm not sure this is possible?This seems to work if list_all contains strings of the known variables but I don't need the variables obviously, I need the data within those variables.So I guess the question is how can I dynamically create and execute python variable names? I need to do this because the number of lists changes with each use case.
If you really, really need this, you could get the variables and their values from the globals() or locals() dictionaries.However, almost certainly it would be a better idea to store the individual lists as part of list_all to begin with, and access them as list_all[0] etc. instead of list_0:
