I'm  a Java, C++, C programmer trying to learn Python. While playing with some code I encountered this weird behavior. I'm somewhat familiar with non statically typed languages, but can't come up with a solution or explanation to this phenomenon.The variable or "name" list is a list of numbers, I'm dividing that list into three more lists (a, b and c). Then I clear list and repopulate it with a predetermined combination of (a, b and c). In the first pass of the loop, list gets cleared, but by the second pass of the for loop list = [] is making reference to another completely different variable and not clearing my list. Does anyone have an explanation as of why this is happening?
Like one of the commenters already said, don't name the variables after built-ins. This Pythoncode should do the trick:The try/except block isn't nessesary, but it was in the code I used as a example.
