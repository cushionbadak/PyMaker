Here is the python code, I use python 3.5.2/Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4790K CPU @ 4.00GHz :The output is:Normally, to get a more reliable result, it is better to do the test using K-fold. However, since K-fold loop itself has influence on the result, I don't use it in my test. And I'm sure this inequality can be reproduced, at least on my machine. So the question is why this happened? 
I run it with pypy (had to set empty_loop_t = 0) and got the following results:So I guess it's up to what interpreter does with the source code and how interpreter executes it. It might be that deliberate assignment takes less operations and workload than disposing of the result with non-JIT interpreter while JIT-compiler forces the code to perform the actual number of operations.Furthermore, the use of JIT-interpreter makes your script run ~50 times faster on my configuration. If you general aim is to optimize the running time of your script you are probably to look that way.
