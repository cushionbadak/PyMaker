Below is the code I am currently working with. Im trying to make it so I can add a second piece of data after the name so it reads (name1,data1),(name2,data2),(name3,data3). Is there a function that allows me to do this?
You can store the information in two separate lists if you will and zip them together with zip() in the end.You can try like so:Demo output:Or if you make sure the user enters 2 values separated by comma, you can try it like so:Demo run:
You don't need a special function, just append a list instead of a string:Or, if you don't know what the data will be until later:and then:Where x is the index of whatever list you want to append to.Alternatively, if you prefer to build up the two lists independently first, you can use zip() to merge them them.That may or may not be more appropriate depending on your program's structure. Without knowing how or when or in what order your data_list is gathered, it's hard to say.
