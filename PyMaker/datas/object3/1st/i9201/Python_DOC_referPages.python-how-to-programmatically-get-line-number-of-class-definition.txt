suppose I have a module named test.py. In this file, I know a class named dummy.How to get the line number of class dummy definition after I import it? Is there an API can do such thing?if dummy is a function, then dummy.__code__.co_firstlineno will return the line no. But if dummy is a class, it doesn't have__code__attributeI wanna know is there a way which can return the line no without parsing the file.
inspect.findsource(test.dummy)[1] provides the line number via regex search in the source file (rather slow). If you define the class, line numbers could be exposed like this:
Look at the Retrieving source code section of inspect. Try getsourcefile() and getsourcelines().
