I have a variable tt = 0I want to start an event whenever t value is changed.How ? There's no valuechanged.connect properties or anything for variables...
For a global variable, this is not possible using assignment alone. But for an attribute it is quite simple: just use a property (or maybe __getattr__/__setattr__). This effectively turns assignment into a function call, allowing you to add whatever additional behaviour you like:Now you can do foo = Foo(); foo.t = 5 and the signal will be emitted after the value has changed.
