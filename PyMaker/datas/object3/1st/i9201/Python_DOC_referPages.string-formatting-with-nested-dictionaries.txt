My setup is the following. I have a nested dictionaryand a stringOf course, the following doesn't work :What's then the proper way of doing that?Note: I'm aware of the question String formating with nested dictionary, but I believe my problem cannot be solved by looping over the dictionaries. The above is of course a very simplified version of my actual problem, and I need both to respect the formatting of dic1 and call the print statement only once.EDIT:As pointed out in the comments, I was indeed a bit hasty about my simplifications...
If the keys are strings, this could work:If not, this works (I just discovered this actually):
Since you didn't specify a version, I'm going to assume the lastest version of Python (3.6). It's simple:
Expanding on @juanpa.arrivillaga's answer:WithThe format method in 894 gets a reference to dic1, and names it d.  Then expressions in the {} are evaluated using that dictionary.Alternatively the dictionary accessing could be done on the right, and strings passed to the format string:This works with the old style formatting, which takes a tuple of values:==============The dictionary can also be referenced by position:str format examples
