I am trying to execute javascript code in python, using pyv8 safely. At the end of the day, I have an object being used by javascript, with few fields I would like to have hidden.I know python doesn't have encapsulation (as explained in this question), but yet, is there a way to disable access using __getattribute__?So this object denies access to a "private" variables, unless unlocked using like this:As far as there's no way to do with from javascript, nor to call __enter__ since the object is "locked".Seems not very efficient though. Is there a better way?
You could use a property getter that restricts access?More info can be found here:https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#property
