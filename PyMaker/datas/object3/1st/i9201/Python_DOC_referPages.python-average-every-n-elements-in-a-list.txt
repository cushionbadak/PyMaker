I need to average every n elements in Python list, n = 3 in this example:So that the output list would be: 
Borrowing a bit from @Jean-Fran√ßois Fabre's answer but using statistics.mean (avaiable for python 3.4+):
You can compute the [2,5,8] list in a list comprehension like this:Then put it back in list1 (preserving size) like you requested like this:or with a list comprehension:Final edit: found a nice oneliner to sum it all up:
Don't need itertools :-)Explanation: Following splits the job into 2 steps; does that help? Which part is still unclear?UPDATE: Another way of doing a no-itertools one-liner:Explanation: We calculate the averages as before. Then we spread them around like this:which can be further unwound like this:Note [1]: The first arg of sum appears at first look to be contained in unnecessary round brackets ... if you think so, try to run it without them and see what happens.
You can use mean in numpy as :
