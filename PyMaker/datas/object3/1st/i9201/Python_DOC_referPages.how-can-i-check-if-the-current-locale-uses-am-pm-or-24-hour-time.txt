I'm trying to update a string which should display the time differently depending on whether the current locale uses AM/PM or 24-hoursIf the locale can be determined I can then update the time string using strftime("%I:%M %p") or strftime("%H:%M") depending on the localeHow can I programatically determine if the current locale uses AM/PM or 24-hour time?Or is there a better way to reach the same goal (displaying a time differently depending on which locale my software is running on)?Grateful for help and with kind regards,Tord 
Tord, the behavior is odd, but this worked on Windows 7. Note that prior to setting the locale the time displayed as 24hour clock. Once locale was set it displayed using the 12hour AM/PM setting. That is the correct setting from my laptop.
Using the time.strftime() function with the %p parameter will give the equivalent for AM/PM in the current locale, and for locales that don't use AM/PM an empty string is returned. I use this in the following way:I've tried this for two locales (one with and another without AM/PM)Reference:https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/time.html#time.strftime
