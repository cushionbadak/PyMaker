Natural Text
According to Wikipedia, the Unicode block for braille is U+2800 .. U+28FF.I'm trying to convert normal text to Braille symbols (dots). To do so, I'm mapping this string:The reason for mapping this specific string is mentioned on this Wikipedia pageMy code:I want to print braille characters like thisThe problem is my output looks like this
remapping strings is built-in to python: with str.maketrans  and str.translate you could do this:note that the length of intab must match the length of outtab if you pass 2 arguments to maketrans only (you could pass a third argument; see doc).
I used a simple Python dictionary and it works but it's very basic
