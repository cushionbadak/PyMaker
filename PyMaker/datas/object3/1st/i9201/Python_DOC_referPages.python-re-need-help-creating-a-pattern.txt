Quick silly question...I am trying to create a pattern to match the following type of string '12/06/06 08:15'.I tried r'/d{1-2}///d{1-2}///d{1-2} /d{1-2}:/d{1-2}' and '/d{1-2}///d{1-2}///d{1-2} /d{1-2}:/d{1-2}' but obviously it doesnt work... Can anyone give me a leg up?
This should work for the pattern shown:But this really should be done with a datetime lib and just handle exceptions for non-matching lines.Python documentation for strptime: Python 2, Python 3Python documentation for strftime format mask: Python 2, Python 3Good strftime reference
