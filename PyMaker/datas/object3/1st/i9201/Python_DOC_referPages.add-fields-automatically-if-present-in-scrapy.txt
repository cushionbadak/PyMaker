Writing a spider to scrape a website, But got stuck at a problem.A block of code like below is there. And i want to write a spider that crawls for all the <li> tags present inside the <ul> tag to extract there href Attribute and store it in an incremental variable Such as Field1 , Field2 , Field3 etc With 'Field' being constant and the numerical value increasing  for as many <li> tags presentExample Html: (Not putting the original html as it's long)Having trouble with xpath so using css selectors.
You can use enumerate() over the response.css() or response.xpath() to index the matching href attribute values:Note that I've assigned different href values for demonstration purposes.
