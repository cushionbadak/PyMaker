I am looking to write a piece of python code that deletes all folders and their contents, but does not delete individual files.For example here are some files and folders contained in a directory (Folder B) along with the script file that does the deleting. How do I delete folderA, folderB,folderC,etc, but leave the files?  Thanks 
Use os.listdir() to get the contents of the directory, os.path.isdir(path) to see if it is a folder, and if it is, shutil.rmtree(path) to delete the folder and all its content.
