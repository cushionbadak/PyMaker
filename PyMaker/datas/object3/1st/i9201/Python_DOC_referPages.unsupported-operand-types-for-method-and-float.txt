How to fix this? Thanks
coffee.price is a method, so coffee.price + 0.5 gives you that error.If you wanted to get the result of that method instead, call the method:Note, I replaced += with = here, you are setting a new attribute after all. I also renamed the attribute, because otherwise your CoffeeWithMilk.price method will get really confused too, causing a second error that looks a lot the same, as self.price is still a method too. This necessitates fixing the def price(self) method to:So the completed code looks like this:You can avoid re-defining the price method altogether by using class inheritance; make CoffeeWithMilk a specialised version of Coffee:You get the __str__ implementation along too, so your final print(coffeeWithMilk) will output something a little more interesting.You could also make Coffee.price a property; properties are methods that are automatically called for you each time you access the attribute:In this case, I'd not use either a method or a property however. There is no need to make _price hidden here. Just replace it with a direct attribute:That's because neither the method nor the property do anything more than pass along the _price attribute. You may as well just directly access it.    Last but not least, you create a CoffeeWithMilk instance from a Coffee instance, then another CoffeeWithMilk instance from the first CoffeeWithMilk instance, so your final instance has added 0.5 to 4 twice:
