So in my code I usually do this to convert string to int, but I was wondering if there was a less clumsy way, because it feels kind of long.Maybe this is just how it has to be, but thanks in advance if you have any ideas.
Given that you're trying to convert a string to an int, I'd suggest you use the int function.Your python code would look like:This 3-letter function does what you need in a short way. Actually in other languages like Java, the syntax is almost twice as long.Java example
Maybe you were hoping for something like myNumber = myInput.toInt. But it is not currently possible to do it natively.  And funny enough, if you want to extract the integer part from a float-like string, you have to convert to float first, and then to int. Or esle you get ValueError: invalid literal for int(). So, this is a robust way: For example:
If it is user input, chances are the user inputted a string. So better catch the exception as well with try:
