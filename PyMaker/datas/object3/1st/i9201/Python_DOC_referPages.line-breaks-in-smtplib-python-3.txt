Natural Text
I am trying to make a script that sends a email. But how to do line breaks? I tried the following:Change msg = MIMEText(msginp) to msg=MIMEText(msginp,_subtype='plain',_charset='windows-1255') NOTE: msginp is a input (msginp = input('Body? '))Does anybody know how to make line breaks? Like the enter key on your keyboard?My code is:Thanks!
I can't add a comment to see if this was totally what you want but i'll give it ago.Your msginp = input('Body? ') ends once you press the enter key, for a new line you'd need to enter \n. Rather than typing \n each time you can make a loop.Once all the data has been collected you can use the MIMEText as you would before.Replace your msginp and MIMEText with this (total is the msginp)
Exit when you enter empty line
