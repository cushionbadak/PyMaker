I'm creating a function for a game which includes a board and words. I have designed this function and I don't really know if I could use a loop or a list method to run it correctly.This is the function I am creating:
You have a couple of options for getting the letters.  You could use a simple loopYou could simplify that into a list comprehensionOr you can use zip, which will actually make each column, and then you can choose among them.Personally, I would choose the list comprehension.Once you have that however, you should use ''.join to combine the list of strings into a single string
