Quite a stupid question but...So when there's no return at the end of the function, why would the code return None? When it's called recursively and a or b is eventually equal to 0, it meets the if condition right? Then it should return the non-zero value.
If neither a nor b is equal to zero, neither one of the first two return statements will be executed.Without the final return, the flow of control reaches the end of the function without hitting a return statement, so the default value of None is returned.
