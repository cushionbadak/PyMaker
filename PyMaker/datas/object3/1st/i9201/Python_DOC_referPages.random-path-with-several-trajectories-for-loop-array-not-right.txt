I am trying to code a random path with several trajectories. My code is below and calculates a path, but the for loop does not create multiple different paths. Rather, it plots the same path n times on top of itself. I want to be a able to graph n number of different paths from within the same for loop, store the values in a single array, then graph them next to each other. Any idea what I am doing wrong?
If you want to create a different path on each iteration of the loop then you should call randint inside of the loop, and calculate the path thereIf you want to store all the computed paths, you can store them in a list or array:Then paths[i] would contain the i-th computed path, and paths[i][j] (or paths[i, j] with an array) the j-th position of the i-th path.Yet another alternative would be to store all the paths in a linear list (or a one-dimensional array) one after the other, so paths[:n] would be the first path, then paths[n:2*n], paths[2*n:3*n], etc.
