I am working with a non-nested json file, the data is from reddit. I am trying to convert it to csv file using python. Each row is not having the same fields and therefore keep getting the error as:Here is the code:Here are few lines from the data:I am thinking of getting all the fields that are available in csv file (as header) and if data is not available for that particular field, just fill it with NA.
I suggest you to use the csv.DictWriter class. That class needs an file to write to and a list of fieldnames (I've figured out from your data sample).
Your question is missing information about what you're trying to accomplish, so I'm guessing about them. Note that csv files don't use "nulls" to represent missing fields, they just have delimiters with nothing between them, like 1,2,,4,5 which has no third field value.Also how you open csv files varys depending on whether you're using Python 2 or 3. The code below is for Python 3.
You can write a little function to build the rows for you, extracting data only where it is available and inserting None if it is not. What you called header, I called schema. Get all the fields, remove duplicates and sort, then build records based on the full set of fields and insert those records into the csv.
You can use Pandas to fill in the blanks for you (you may need to pip install pandas first):
