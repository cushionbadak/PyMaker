This is a generic question. I wrote a piece of code that uses tensorflow to do the computation.I want to print the time consumed during the execution of the code. First I used: But I read that this is an inaccurate way to measure the execution time. How to accurately measure the execution time of my program. 
Use time.perf_counter(). perf_counter is a "performance counter". It is the highest resolution time from an undefined starting point (Usually since the program started running) available on a platform. It is used for things measuring performance when subtracted from a subsequent call. It is a float in seconds.time.time() is the seconds since the Unix epoch (1 January 1970), and may not be more precise than a second.You can safely replace calls to time.time() with time.perf_counter(), as you are subtracting them.
