I have the following:I see the following object has __hash__ attributeQ:even though it has __hash__ attribute, still it cannot be used as key.Why?
Did you try looking at the value of the attribute?Just because something has a __hash__ attribute doesn't mean it's hashable; the __hash__ attribute has to be a callable that actually hashes it (instead of, e.g., raising an exception).
