In my book , Python Crash Course : This code is given but it gives an error.The traceback is as follows:print("- " + topping)TypeError: cannot concatenate 'str' and 'NoneType' objectsQ. What is the NoneType object here ? Is it topping? If yes, why? Even when i use str() around topping , It gives me a funny output:Output: Q2. Why is displaying 2 outputs for each?- one with the list of toppings -and one with None ? 
You shouldn't be passing the function to itself.Replace these:withThe reason that the error is happening is because you are passing the function make_pizza, which has no return value (it returns nothing), to itself.However, the inner function still executes completely. That is, the second make_pizza in each of your examples is running properly, which is why you're getting two outputs.For the second function though, you're effectively trying to run:Which of course leads to an error here:because topping is None.The reason you sometimes saw - None in your output is because str(None) casts None to "None" (as in, a string containing the literal text None).
