Natural Text
I have a script that emails me links to me. The problem is the links arent included, instead I get:My script looks like:The error is occuring on this line (I believe):It appears its printing out the object details in the email to me, and not the value.Thus, what am i possibly doing wrong here?
I don't know why you use print or lambda anyway. If you simply wrote:and drop the:it should probably work.So the try block should read:I think however that you do not really understand what lambda and print are supposed to do. print is used to write data to the standard output channel, but you want to write it into an email, so you do not need to print it locally, you need somehow to store your message in memory.Finally lambda:... is used to create an anonymous function, if you do not feed it any arguments, its usage is usually to postpone execution (for instance to achieve laziness). But here you actually need the message, so again no need to use this construct.
When you say Yo are simply creating lambda function , it is not executed yet . In order to execute you need to specifically invoke it by calling TEXT()In order to fix your problem change to And msg = str(TEXT())
