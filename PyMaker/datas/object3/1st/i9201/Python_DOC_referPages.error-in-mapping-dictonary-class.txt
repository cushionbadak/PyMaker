I'm trying to create a simple mapping class where when keys are 1-1, e.g. key1:key2, key2:key1. I'm running into an error when I'm checking to see if the class is equal to a value I enter, I should be getting True but I keep getting False. I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong, my code is below, any help would be appreciated. 
Your Mapping class has to implement the __eq__ magic method in order for == to work properly. Assuming that two Mappings are equal if the Dict is equal, you can try somehting like this:Without this, == will fall back to checking whether those are the same instance, i.e. what is does.Often, when you implement __eq__, you would also implement the __hash__ method, so the two are consistent. Again, you could simply delegate to self.Dict for the hash, but dict is not hashable (for good reasons, see below), but you could hash the items:Without __hash__, you could e.g. not use your Mapping class as key inside another dictionary. However, this setup is problematic, as the dict is mutable, so hash(m) might change between uses, making it impossible to retrieve the Mapping from the dict or set at a later time.
