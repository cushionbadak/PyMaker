Natural Text
I'm building openoffice documents. I have a scaffold that I use to generate my content.xml file. The content-scaffold.xml file is stored in filesystem and looks like this:The idea is that I take this xml and inject stuff into the office:text tag (in python), then render it back. In this example, i'm injecting a simple text:p tag.However, this is what the namespaces declarations look like once rendered:This results in the following error:Namespace prefix text on p is not definedIt's pretty clear that ElementTree is only keeping xmlns declarations that are needed (in my case fo, office and style since they are the only ones present in content-scaffold.xml), and it's pretty neat. However, I really want them all, in order to be able to use all namespaces.Any idea how to force ElementTree to keep them all? Or am I thinking this wrong from the start? I'm open to any alternate solutions.Note: I'm using Python 3 and ElementTreeThanks
ElementTree is rather weak when it comes to namespace handling. However, what you are asking for can be done (but it is a bit of a hassle):This code will create a result document with all namespace declarations preserved.Here is how it can be done with lxml:Note that you have to provide the element name using Clark notation in SubElement().
