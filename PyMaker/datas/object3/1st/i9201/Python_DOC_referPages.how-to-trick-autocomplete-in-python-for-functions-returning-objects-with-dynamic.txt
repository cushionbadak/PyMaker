How can I make PyCharm's (or any IDE's) autocomplete functionality to suggest me b, c, d and e as attributes for lala().can i define a custom list somewhere?
Solution for Python 3You can just use Union type if it's possible to list all possibilities.I have added C class because it's not in A and B class hierarchy so the example will be more clear and holistic.
For PYTHON 2Union doesn't work so only 1 class can be passed
