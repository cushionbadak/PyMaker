I search SO but no clue. but in Can help would be great and it will save my day. thanks
This is easy to solve. Since you have not the milliseconds but microseconds stored in time_con, we can do time_con.microsecond*1000 to get milliseconds.Results in Which is hopefully what you want. Hope this helps!
In Python 3 you can doHere is the link to datetime.datetime.timestamp's documentation.
Please read the docs for calendar.timegm (emphasis mine):calendar.timegm(tuple)An unrelated but handy function that takes a time tuple such as returned by the gmtime() function in the time module, and returns the corresponding Unix timestamp value, assuming an epoch of 1970, and the POSIX encoding.The UNIX timestamp is defined to be a non-negative integer. Well, Wikipedia says that it can be floating-point, but anyways, UNIX systems normally represent it with a variable of C type time_t, which is whole non-negative. An integer, because it's meant to represent the number of seconds passed since the beginning of the UNIX epoch. So, it clearly cannot represent milliseconds because it's defined to be a whole number.
