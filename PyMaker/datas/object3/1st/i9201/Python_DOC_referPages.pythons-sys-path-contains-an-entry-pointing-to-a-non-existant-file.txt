I usedand I get this:I am confused why this is in there:when I try to pull it up in the File Explorer, nothing is there.
sys.path stores a list of strings, each one (as you can tell) is a path to a location on your computer.Python looks in these places to find modules your program can use (when you do import sys python is getting the sys module from one of the locations in sys.path)Paths to .zip files are just as valid as paths to folders, python will try to unzip any archived files.Now that you know what sys.path is, we can look at your "problem."You've said that C:\Users\HowLo\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python36-32\python36.zip doesn't exist.All this means is that python doesn't load any modules from there.It really has no (meaningful) implications whatsoever.
The sys path can be appended with whatever path you choose. It is after all simply a list.It is used to search for modules which are not in the current folder.  More on that in the docs.A list of strings that specifies the search path for modules. Initialized from the environment variable PYTHONPATH, plus an installation-dependent default.As initialized upon program startup, the first item of this list, path[0], is the directory containing the script that was used to invoke the Python interpreter. If the script directory is not available (e.g. if the interpreter is invoked interactively or if the script is read from standard input), path[0] is the empty string, which directs Python to search modules in the current directory first. Notice that the script directory is inserted before the entries inserted as a result of PYTHONPATH.A program is free to modify this list for its own purposes. Only strings and bytes should be added to sys.path; all other data types are ignored during import.
