Both attrib and extra arguments of xml.etree.ElementTree.Element(tag, attrib={}, **extra) could be used to set element attributes, except attrib should be given as a dictionary and  extra  given as keyword arguments, they nearly have the same effect , for example ,I don't see any difference between the two, (1) any difference ? (2) what's each of the argument used for ?
Look at the source, they're merged together:https://hg.python.org/cpython/file/tip/Lib/xml/etree/ElementTree.py#l172It's been there since ElementTree was a third party library supporting Python 1.5.2.One would imagine that it's there for convenience, since it may be quite common to have a dictionary of attributes from somewhere, but it should also be ergonomic to write a literal function call with some attribute names, so neither case requires extra punctuation.
