My goal is to generate functions dynamically and then save them in a file. For e.g, in my current attempt, On calling create_fileThe output I want is('/tmp/code.py'):The output I get is('/tmp/code.py'):a_nested_func is indented. How can I reduce the indentation? I can do lstrip etc. but I wonder if there is a better way.
Use the textwrap.dedent() function to remove the common leading whitespace:Note that there is no need for a StringIO(string).readlines() dance here.
There's a function in built-in module, textwrap.dedent.
