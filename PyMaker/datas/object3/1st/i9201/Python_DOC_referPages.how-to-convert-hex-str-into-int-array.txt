I have strings of hex, for exemple '01ff6fee32785e366f710df10cc542B4' and I am trying to convert them (efficiently) into an int array 2 characters by 2 characters like [1,255,...].I tried but it only takes the characters one by one.Can i do it without using a for loop (I might be wrong but if think it would be slower) ?
You could range(..) over substrings of length 2:So i iterates of the string with steps of 2 and you take a substring of length 2 from i to i+2 (exclusive) with c[i:i+2]. These you convert by taking int(..,16).For your sample input it generates:The last element is 12 because the length of your string is odd, so it takes c as the last element to parse.
Two relatively simple solutions, but these will error out if the string has an odd number of characters which might or might not be what you want.
