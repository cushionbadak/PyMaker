I have the following code to get user input to do certain tasks. What I want is to break out of the user prompt when some other task, outside this module, is completed. So even though the shell is showing 'Enter Command:', I want it to stop waiting for a prompt from the user and continue to the other task. Is this even possible and if so, how? Thanks in advance.     Edit:Actually this is already in a thread and the thread closes correctly. The issue is the screen is stuck on the user prompt even though the user prompt is useless at that point since the thread calling for the input is already closed. Any suggestions?
Using Signalsyou can use signal module (linux / unix only)output when input is 'hello':output when no input for 5 seconds:Using Selectanother option is to use select.select() for non-blocking io operation.the get_user_input function tries to read every 0.1 sec the sys.stdin, if there is data to read it reads single byte. if it encounters a new line it returns the string.if the timeout passed we exit returning Nonethe code:example output for input hello select:example when no input for 5 seconds:Windows supportif you use windows for some reason you can check out this answer about  msvcrt module. basically its the same as select.select for non-blocking io using msvcrt.kbhit() to check if user returned input.if you need more info please update about your OS.
I think you can use this answer to read until a timeout, then check a variable and exit if the variable is set to false. If not then attempt to read again.https://stackoverflow.com/a/2904057/2066459
