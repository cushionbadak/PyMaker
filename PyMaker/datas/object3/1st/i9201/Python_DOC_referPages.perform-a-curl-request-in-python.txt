I am trying to perform a curl request in python. My code is the following:Howver I am receiving in the second line the following error:TypeError: expected string or buffer (payload = json.loads(open("request.json")))Any idea what this error is about?
You are opening file open("request.json") this will return <open file 'request.json', mode 'r' at 0x108526810>.json.loads need string.you can try file.read will return file content instead of file object.If you dont want to use read you can directly use json.load instead of json.loadsThis is what I triedTry to read same file.
expected string or bufferopen() returns a file. And there's a difference between json.load() and json.loads() (the second accepts a string, not a file) Besides, I don't think the json.dumps() is necessary 
You are using json.loads() but attempting to load a file. You need to use json.load() instead.
