I'm trying to write a function which accepts a list of chars and return a list of tuples composed of the chars that were repetitive in the list and how many times they repeated. For example: if I have a list such as: ["a", "a", "b", "b", "b", "c", "a", "a"]It should return:I wrote a code for this but the output I get is:Here is my code:I don't know what the problem is. I would like to hear your opinion. Thanks in advance.
One liner with collections.Counter() and itertools.groupby() methods.Output:
You don't need to keep an extra counter, just increment the counter in the tuple if the value is the same as the previous one:Output:
Your code will only append to new_list when the current character is different from the previous one. When the list traversal ends though, it ignores the last streak of characters.
Your code does not insert into the list when it comes to the last items, if they are equal you don't insert them.You need to check the last items as well, if they are equal so insert them as well, as in here:
You can try using itertools.groupby:
This is probably the most pythonic solution that uses your counter logic: Output:
