I have a dict of Boolean flags in my app. As I work through a data set, I key into the dict using fields from the data and flag whether I've already performed a do-once operation on them. Right now, I'm initializing a dict of False values with the right keys, then copying that dict at the start of the loop that operates on the data. Here's a code snippet from a function that distributes database records to a set of .csv files:Is there a better way to reset the dict of flags on each outer iteration? A more Pythonic way?
You'd better not use a dict at all. A dict where values are just booleans is really just a set (unless you actually distinguish the three values True/False/notIncluded, but you're not doing that).I think this is what you want:((Edit: This is about the now-fixed do_once = do_once_defaults) Btw, you're not copying the dict. Your do_once is just another reference to the same dict object that do_once_defaults references. So you're not resetting the flags there. The simplest way to actually make a copy would be do_once = dict(do_once_defaults), but I really think you should use the set as suggested above.)
use defaultdict from python stdlib:output:
Yes, just build a dictionary comprehension:
