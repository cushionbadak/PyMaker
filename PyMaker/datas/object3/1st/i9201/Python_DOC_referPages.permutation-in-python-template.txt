I want to create function for every possible permutation of an array. I wrote some code and I don't know what is wrong with it. It return me first possibility = [1,2,3], but then It fails with error : original[i] out of index but it should be originial[1] which equals 2. Maybe del temp erases also from original but that would not make sense for me.Thank you in advace.
Python standard library module itertools provide itertools.permutations which yields permutations:
You better use itertools for this since these are well optimized and tested routines. Nevertheless in case you want to implement it yourself, there are some things that can be improved/corrected:You return a value, but only in the last recursive step you need to propagate them back;you return a reference to the list you construct on the fly, as a result you will always return the same list;you always delete the first element, not the one you picked; andyou do not restore the element after deletion.Some additonal improvements:use .pop() instead of del on the last element; andyou can simply use if original instead of a comparison on len(..):
