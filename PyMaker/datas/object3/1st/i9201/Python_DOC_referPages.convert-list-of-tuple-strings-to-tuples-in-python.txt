How would I convert the following list: to the following list of tuples:I started an attempt with this:but still not complete and its getting ugly.
map uses split to  split each string into a list, ['foo', '1/', 'bar', '2'].  Then we assign the four parts of the list to variables, and manipulate the ones we care about to produce integers.
well there is one line answer to your question :
There's a chance with re.findall and a nice list comprehension:In case the structure of the initial list changes, re.findall would still fish out all ints, as opposed manually splitting and manipulating the strings.
Here is a reusable set of functions that would enable you to more thoroughly understand what it is that you're doing, complete with comments. Perfect for a beginner, if that's the case!Be mindful, this is a very down and dirty, unpythonic version of what you may be looking for, it is unoptimized. Patrick Haugh and Moses Koledoye both have more simplistic and straight-to-the-point, few-line answers that are extremely pythonic! However, this would be reusable by inputting other lists / arrays as parameters.My intention for adding this is to help you understand what it is you would be doing by "opening up" the process and going step-by-step.You can effectively assign the function to a variable:So you can access the return values later.Cheers!
