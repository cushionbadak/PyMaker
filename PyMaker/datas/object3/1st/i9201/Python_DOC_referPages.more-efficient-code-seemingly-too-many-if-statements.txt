I've looked into this but I couldn't find anything that helped me (Apologies if the answer to something similar is out there that could have helped me). I'm writing a currency converter that suffers from tons of if's that just doesn't seem efficient nor can I imagine very nicely readable, so I'd like to know how I can write more efficient code in this case:
You can always use dictionaries for lookups:Then all your ifs are mostly covered by:However is it possible that other characters are included? Then you'd need to introduce a fallback:As noted it's not the most efficient way because it calculates every conversion (even unneccessary ones) each time. It could be more efficient to have a baseline, for example P and have the factors saved:
Instead of converting directly from the source unit to the target unit, you should do it in two steps:This code is all you need. You can call it like this:
Another approach, using a matrix (in fact just a list of lists):First you create the currency conversion matrix.Then you match currency with a number (pretty wuch like an enum in other languages such as C or Java). For this you use a dictionary: it is like a list except that you define indexes (it is not from 0 to length - 1).Then you get the appropriate conversion rate, multiply it with your number and print it.This is pretty similar to MSeifert answer, except that you use less dictionary, so it may be easier to understand if youâ€™re not comfortable with those.
