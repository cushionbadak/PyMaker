I've checked this, this and this.The 3rd link seemed to have the answer yet it didn't do the job.I can't have a solution where the whole file is brought to main memory, as the files I'll be working with will be very large. So I decided to use islice as shown in the 3rd link. First 2 links were irrelevant as they used it for only 2 lines or read 1000 characters. Whereas I need 1000 lines. for now N is 1000My file contains 1 million lines:Sample:So if I read 1000 lines at a time, I should go through the while 1000 times, yet when I print p to check how many times I've been in through, it doesn't stop at a 1000. It reached 19038838 after running my program for 1400 seconds!!CODE:What am I doing wrong ?
