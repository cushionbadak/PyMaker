I am writing a python script where I have to find common substrings in many string sequences.For example:jasper occurs 3 times - one time each in sequence1,sequence2 and sequence3.G1b occurs 2 times - one time in sequence1 and one time in sequence 2.For each substring occuring two times or more, i need to add them to a dictionary as substring => count.In this case my dictionary will be:I will be using thousands of sequences to fill up this dictionary and if one substring occurs two or more times in any of the sequences, itneeds to be added to this dictionary. What would be the best way to do it without crashing the system?
This is one way to do it:Prints counts of all substrings occurring at least twice with a minimum length of 3:
First, we'll write a quick little generator that takes a string and yields every substring of that stringThen we can use itertools.takewhile to take only those substrings that occur more than onceprints
