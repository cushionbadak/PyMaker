I'm new to python. Currently, I'm trying to implement a program to download large no of files from the remote server(http/https). The no. of files are large(>1000). To handle this I need to implement the code in a way so it can utilize the OS resource in a efficient and optimal way. To handle this the way which I took is multiprocessing.Here, is my implementation : If I run this code, it gives me normal output. But I think I didn't implemented the multiprocessing correctly. Can you please give some input to optimize this piece of code?Thanks in advance.Regards,Ashish
You may do thisReference: https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html#module-multiprocessing.poolNote that map_async does the job parallel, but map blocks the process until the called function returns
I had the same problem in python 2.7. The issue is that the multiprocessing library don't support more than one argument in pool.map(func,arg). As a solution i have used the multiprocessing library from pathos.So your function could be as follow
