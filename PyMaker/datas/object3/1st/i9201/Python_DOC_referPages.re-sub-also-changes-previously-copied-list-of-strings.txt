This question already has an answer here:How to clone or copy a list?                    20 answers                It's been a while since I used Python, And this one I really don't get:- I make a list of strings M1- I copy it to M2- Then I change a "e" to "E" using re.sub in M1- M2 is also changed!Here's is some code for thos who are interested.  It shows this behaviour on both Anaconda2 and Python 3.6.0.
m2 = m1 makes m2 point to the same object that m1 points to. It's like you're copying a pointer.If you want to copy the contents, you could do something like m2 = m1[:].
m2=m1 gives you a shallow copy of m1, which is just a reference.You need deep copy.see https://docs.python.org/3/library/copy.html
