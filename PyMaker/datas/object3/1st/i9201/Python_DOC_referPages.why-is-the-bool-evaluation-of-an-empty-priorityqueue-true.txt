Why doesn't an empty PriorityQueue evaluate to False like other iterables in Python?
As you can see from the source code, the PriorityQueue class doesn't implement __len__ or __bool__, and the default is that if an object is present it's truthy:If a class defines neither __len__() nor __bool__(), all its  instances are considered true.
