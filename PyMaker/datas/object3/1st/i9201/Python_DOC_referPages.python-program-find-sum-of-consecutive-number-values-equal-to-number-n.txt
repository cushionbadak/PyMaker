I  want to find consecutive digits in a string that sum to a given number.  Example:a="23410212" number is=5 — output 23,41,410,0212,212.This code is not working.  What do I need to fix?
This (sort-of) one-liner will work:This uses a nested generator expression over all possible slices and filters out the ones with the correct digit-sum.This is, of course, far from optimal (especially for long strings) because the inner loop should be stopped as soon as the digit-sum exceeds n, but should give you an idea.A more performant and readable solution would be a generator function:Definitely read up on sum and map, as well.
Your function has several problems.  Most of all, you have no way to give it different data to work on.  You have it hard-coded to handle one particular string and a total of 10.  You've even written variable names with "ten" in them, even though your example uses n=5.  Your function should have two input parameters: the given string and the target sum.NOTE: schwobaseggl just posted a lovely, Pythonic solution.  However, I'll keep writing this, in case you need a function closer to your present learning level.You have several logic paths, making it hard to follow how you handle your data.  I recommend a slightly different approach, so that you can treat each partial sum cleanly:Now, this doesn't solve quite all of your problems, and I haven't done some of the accounting work for you (variable initializations, def line, etc.).  However, I think it moves you in the right direction and preserves the spirit of your code.
