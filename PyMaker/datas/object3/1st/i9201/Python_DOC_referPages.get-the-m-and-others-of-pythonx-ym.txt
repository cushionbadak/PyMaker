(See this question for what the m means)I need to construct the include path of .virtualenvs/foo/include/pythonX.Ym to compile something (i.e. -I...) against the virtualenv. I can get the X.Y using sys.version or sys.final_version.How do I get the m to construct the include path?EDIT: I tried sys.executable but that is pointing to .../foo/bin/python, which is unhelpful for this.
The easiest way to get the include path is to use the sysconfig.get_path() function:This path is adjusted for virtualenvs already. For scripting purposes outside of Python, you can either print the path directly:or get all sysconfig data by running the module as a script:then parse the output that dumps to stdout.Other than that, if you only want the executable name (with the m included), you can get that from the sys.executable variable; this includes the m suffix:As of Python 3.2, you can also use the sys.abiflags variable; it is set to m in this case:Also see PEP 3149.For earlier Python versions, the various flags that influence the suffixes are available still via the aforementioned sysconfig module as configuration variables:Note that ubuntu merely compiles multiple binaries and adjusts the executable name to reflect the configuration option chosen; on other systems the ABI flags are not necessarily reflected in the executable name.
