I have different functions, but each takes different number of arguments and different arguments. I want to be able to execute only one of them and to do this based on the name of the function as string. I tried this:but it executes all functions :( no matter what is the string function_name.Do you have any ideas why this happens and how to achieve what I want. (I'm new to Python). Thank you very much in advance! :)
You need to add just the functions to the dictionary; you added their result.To support variable arguments, use either lambdas or functools.partial() to wrap your functions instead:orIn both cases you call the resulting object (partial or lambda function) after retrieving it from the dictionary.
