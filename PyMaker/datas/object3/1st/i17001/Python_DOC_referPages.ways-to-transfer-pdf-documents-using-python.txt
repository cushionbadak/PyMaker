I'm looking to add a feature to my educational program.The program currently saves a PDF document with a set of exam questions and the end user's respective answers to them. I would like to add a way for all clients to send their respective PDF documents to a server (would be teacher), for them to save.I've looked into sockets for the transfer, but I'm not sure if this is to simple for my problem...Any help would be appreciated.Thanks
Since your question is tagged "ftp" i assume this might help you out.Take a look at the ftplib in python, it's for both python 2.x and 3.x.More about the ftplib module:This module defines the class FTP and a few related items. The FTP  class implements the client side of the FTP protocol. You can use this  to write Python programs that perform a variety of automated FTP jobs,  such as mirroring other ftp servers. It is also used by the module  urllib to handle URLs that use FTP. For more information on FTP (File  Transfer Protocol), see Internet RFC 959.Lookup the ftplib module in the python documentation for 2.x here and 3.x here.
