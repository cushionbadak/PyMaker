I have to run the following simple system command from a python script.I wrote :But it gives error:Can some explain what am I doing wrong. And also throw a bit light on the subprocess module?
You missed a comma:Without comma 'python' 'wkhtmltopdf' is same as 'pythonwkhtmltopdf' (String literal concatenation):UPDATERemove the space after the second command line argument.
Just want to share 2 ways to make the calling easier.1) Call with a string of command and "shell=True" so that you don't have to split the command. For example,2) If security is a concern with "shell=True" (https://docs.python.org/2/library/subprocess.html#frequently-used-arguments) you can try the shlex module in standard library. For example,shlex is especially helpful when your command is complicated.
