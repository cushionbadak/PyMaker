I was wondering if there was something similar to Android's logcat but for Python. I haven't had much luck in my search for this.Edit:I very much understand that python is not an operating system. I'm looking for something that hooks into the debugger with similar features to logcat. I know about python's logging library but it is not what I'm looking for.
You are confusing things, logcat is as defined in the Android documentation as a tool for collecting operating system messages, it has nothing to do with programming. The Android logging system provides a mechanism for collecting and viewing system debug output. Logs from various applications and portions of the system are collected in a series of circular buffers, which then can be viewed and filtered by the logcat commandSo obviously there is nothing similar in Python, just because Python is not a OS, it is a programming language. Don't mix things! Android is the operating system, you write apps in a programming language like Java.If you want to generate logging messages, then Python gives you the logging library.
Python has a standard logging module called logging. This is used frequently in Python applications and systems, including by many other Python modules, etc. jabaldonedo is correct in that Python is a programming language not an Operating System, so its approach to logging is going to be different.  However, the logging module is probably closest to what you're looking for.Here's a link to recipes relating to how its used:  https://docs.python.org/2.7/howto/logging-cookbook.html
