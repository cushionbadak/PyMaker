I was wondering if it is possible to convert numbers into their corresponding alphabetical value. SoI was planning to make a program which lists all the alphabetical combinations possible for a length specified by a user.See I know how to build the rest of the program except this!Any help would be wonderful.
ororAll of the solutions above output lowercase letters from English alphabet along with their position:You'd create a dictionary to access letters (values) by their position (keys) easily. For example:
What about a dictionary?But don't go over 26:But if you are looking for all alphabetical combinations of a given length:
Big Letter:1 -> A 2 -> B ...Small Letter:1 -> a 2 -> b ...
You can use chr() to turn numbers into characters, but you need to use a higher starting point as there are several other characters in the ASCII table first.Use ord('a') - 1 as a starting point:Demo:Another alternative is to use the string.ascii_lowercase constant as a sequence, but you need to start indexing from zero:
Here is a quick solution:which producesNote that the number of solutions totalling to N is 2**(N-1).

If you just want to map between letters and numbers in your own way, Dictionary is what you should look at.
