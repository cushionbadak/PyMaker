I want to make a function that goes through a list and makes a dictionary with keys for each thing in the list and values of the one thing in the list following the key.should return:but actually returns:
Don't use list.index(); that'll only match the first occurrence of a letter; for 'o' it'll never find the second 'o'; you'll only repeatedly add the same characters to the sets.Use enumerate() to add an index to your loop, instead:I started enumerate() at 1 instead of the default 0 so it always represents the next position.Demo:Now that it is working, lets simplify this a little; use dict.setdefault() to add the set to the dictionary when the key is missing, for example. Strings are already sequences, no need to cast them to a list either:Instead of enumerate(), we could also use zip() to pair up the letters of the word:
Your problem is that index() always returns the first index in the string, so you'll be adding the same character to the set over and over.Try something like
Here is the another answer:
