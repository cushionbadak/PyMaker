I was wondering if there was something inside python io, so that when a file is opened in say a+ you could set the pointer to a specific point and start writing
What you want is f.seek(position) (docs for Python2 and Python3):Here, you skip over the first 10 bytes and then write the new data. Note that there is also an optional second argument whence that allows you to specify whether position should be relative to the beginning of the file, the current location within the file, or the end of the file. See the documentation links above for more information.
