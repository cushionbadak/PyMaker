I've been playing around with Python for making one-line solutions for some competition problems, and I've run into the following issue. My solution can be written as max([f(k) for k in range(n)]) (where f(k) is some simple expression), which looks great, but when n is large it ends up constructing a list before finding its maximum, which exceeds the memory limit. Is there a way to find the maximum without actually constructing the list, while still keeping it down to one line? I know the following works, but if I wanted that I'd just use a different language:
max() takes a generator also:This saves you from having to build the entire list.Thanks to @DanielRoseman for pointing out that in Python 2.x you should be using xrange() instead of range(). Recall that range() returns a list in Python 2.x, whereas xrange() returns an xrange object (a constant-memory iterable).
