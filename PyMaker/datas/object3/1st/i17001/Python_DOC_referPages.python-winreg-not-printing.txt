Hi there im trying to understand this code. I know it gets the gateway name and mac address in registry but when i tried to run this code, it doesn't show anything. Can someone give me links about winreg that has basic examples. Thank You
Module documentation.  Read it to understand function args/returns.Example showing registry key values/current user information.A very thorough recipe showing many, many things winreg can do.
