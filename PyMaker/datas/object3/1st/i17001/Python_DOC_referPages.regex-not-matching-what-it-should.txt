I have a simple problem using Regex with python...I am trying to grab GPS coordinates out of a line that will be formatted as such:Sometimes it will have the leading '-', sometimes it wont. Consequently, my regex is as follows:Here's the weird part:I have tested this query on solely the GPS coordinate string (above) and it works fine, matches it, and acts as intended. However when I try to get it to match the GPS coords when there is "noise" around it, it does not catch it... Here is one line that the GPS coords are in:Any idea why it would not be catching this? Something to do with the commas?Thanks guys.EDIT:Thanks for all the responses... Here is a quick test script that I was using:
Aside from the fact your regex looks a little fragile, this is likely due to using re.match instead of re.search.re.match tries to match the regex to the beginning of your string, where as re.search tries to find a match anywhere in your string.The difference is explained in the python documentation here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#search-vs-match
As SpoonMeiser said, you should be using re.search(). Here's a little more sophisticated regex which captures both lat and lon in named groups`.. Assuming the last values are longitude values.. This might break but it's a nice idea.
