I'm wondering what is going on with the file open() mode validation (Python2.7):So, I cannot open the file in illegal mode, but I can open it in rock&roll mode. What mode is actually used for opening the file in this case? Note that on python3 I cannot use both illegal and rock&roll:And, this is confusing, why the behavior is different for python3.x? 
The Python 2.x open function essentially delegates its work to the C library fopen function. On my system, the documentation for fopen contains:The argument mode points to a string beginning with one of the following sequences (Additional characters may follow these sequences.):Your ock&roll is considered "additional characters".In Python 3, the allowed open modes are more restricted (essentially, only valid strings are permitted).
The previous traceback explains it nicely:"ValueError: mode string must begin with one of 'r', 'w', 'a' or 'U'""rock&roll" begins with "r", so it's apparently legal.
