Say I have a master script that runs weekly via cronjob. This script imports a bunch of different functions from other Python files and runs their functions in sequence. I'd also like to be able to run a couple of the functions the master script runs but ad-hoc from the Terminal. What is the best way to construct both the master script and the individual files containing functions to be run? Example of current situation:master_script.pydo_bulk_thinkgs.pydo_another_thing.pyIf I want to run my_other_thing() without running the entire master_script.py, how and where should I be defining and calling everything? The imported files just have function definitions so I can't actually execute any function by running python do_another_thing.py; and I also shouldn't execute the function my_other_thing() within do_another_thing.py because then it will run on import. It seems to me that I need to restructure things, but I need some best practices.
Going to attempt to answer my own question after some more research, which then lead me here. Execute the defined and imported functions within do_bulk_thinks.py and do_another_thing.py, but use __main__ to stop the functions from running when they're imported. So master_script.py remains unchanged, but the other files would have:do_bulk_things.pyAnd do_another_thing.py
