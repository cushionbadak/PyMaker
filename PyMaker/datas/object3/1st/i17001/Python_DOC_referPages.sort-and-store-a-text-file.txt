Natural Text
I am trying to sort and store the following information, which will be read from a txt file:Here is the code I have thus far:I know I need to fill the array, but how would I go about splitting the txt file since there are both spaces and commas? I want the array to hold [first name, last name, birthday, sport, team]
Easy answer:string.split()More complicated answer:Use the csv module. It's a bit more complicated to start out with, but will get you further. 
I would recommend numpy!
I figured it out. I filled the list, then split name.
