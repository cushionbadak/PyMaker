I have written some python code:When I create an instance of key with baby = key('radan',20), I got a TypeError. I don't know why I am getting this error. Is it because of object.__init__(self,age)?If yes, please help me in explaining why we use object.__init__(self,age) and what the purpose of that is and help me solve this code.
Your code contains several errors:output:
Some pointers:Actually, you can can name the self instance parameter whatever you like in Python (even this), but it makes the code harder to read for other people, so just use self.You don't have to use object.__init__(self, name, age) here. If you remove that line and implement the changes above, your code will work just fine.
When you do baby = key('radar', 20) you are actually passing three arguments: the instance, the name and the age. However your initialiser is defined to take exactly two arguments so you get a TypeError.self is the argument implicitly passed when referring to an instance of an object. For your __init__ function, I would just do:So we can assign the arguments passed as attributes to the current instance, conventionally called self.It makes no sense here to call object.__init__ at all, just remove that line.Apart from that, everything works fine (except use %s instead of %d).Testing:
