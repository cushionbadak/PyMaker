I wrote a script to find all permutations of a list of numbers in lexicographic order. The output is correct when immediately printed, but it gets changed if I append it to a list. In the output of my script, first you see the list with a single element, then the lists I append to that element, and finally you see the finished list after the sub-lists are added:As you can see, the initial [1, 2, 3] list is not even in the final output. Below is my code. Can anybody tell me what the heck is going on?
Because a list in list is actually a reference, not converting to value when you use append(). So when you edit the list afterwards, the previously added one also changes.Adding [:] to copy the list before appending could fix it:(Note the [:] part)And after the change I can get:Should be what you want :)
