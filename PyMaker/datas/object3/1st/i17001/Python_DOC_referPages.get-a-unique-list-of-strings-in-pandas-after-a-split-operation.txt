I'm getting started with pandas, and have one column of data in a larger DataFrame such as and what I'd like to do is split the sequences of words into their component parts, then get a unique set or counts for the words.  I can do the split just fineHowever, I'm not sure where to go from here. Again, I'd like to have output such as or the same in a dictionary with counts, or in a Series/DataFrame equivalent of one of these two.The best I've been able to do so far is to use apply() in combination with a Set to get the unique words.  pandas is a very elegant package from what I've seen so far, and it seems like this is probably within easy reach for someone who knows it better than I do.Thanks in advance!
If I understand you correctly, I think you could do it as follows using pandas. I'll start with the series before you split the strings:Now just compute the value counts of the Series:
This code makes a dictionary of all of your words and their counts.The result is a dictionary with counts:
I was recently working on the similar task where I wanted to count space separated strings. Using it for your data would be like this:resulting into:
