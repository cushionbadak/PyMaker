Natural Text
I have a file test.txt with this: I need to transform it inWhat is the most pythonic way to do it?
Assuming that that list-part of each line is an actual valid Python list, we can use ast.literal_eval to safely parse it. So we just need to iterate over each line, split the first part from the list part, parse the list part. And then for each element in the list, we write a line to the target file.
You can split each line on this regex: (?:\[|\]|, ), store element one of the split into a variable. Then iterate elements 2-and-up, and for each element print [element 1][comma][the next element].
