Complex numbers use "i" to denote the imaginary unit.Does anyone know, why Python uses "j" instead?
In some disciplines, in  particular electromagnetism and electrical engineering, j is used  instead of i, since i is frequently used for electric current. In  these cases complex numbers are written as a + bj or a + jb.Source.
The python complex number standard follows the Engineering standard where a j is used instead of an i to represent the square root of 1.Also, check this resource for an alternate explanantion.It states that j is preferred when referring to complex numbers due to i's multiple other uses which might lead to confusion.
The symbols i, j, and k are used for unit vectors in the directions of the x, y, and z axes respectively. That means that “i” has two different meanings in the real plane, depending on whether you think of it as the vector space spanned by i and j or as complex numbers. But if you use j to represent the imaginary unit, its meaning does not change. Either way it points along the y axis.Said another way, bold face i and italic i point in different directions But bold face j and italic j both point in the same direction.Source: http://www.johndcook.com/blog/2013/04/23/why-j-for-imaginary-unit/
Complex numbers are a.o. heavily used in electronics for phase computations. An i denotes current there.
