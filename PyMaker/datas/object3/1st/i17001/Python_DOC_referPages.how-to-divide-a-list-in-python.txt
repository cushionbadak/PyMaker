I have this list examplelist1=[['p1', 'p2', 'p3', 'p4'], ['p5', 'p6', 'p7']] and if any variable is the same as other variable them split it in a group. Lets say p1 and p4 are the same and p5 and p6. So I want a new list that looks likelist2=[['p1', 'p4'], ['p2', 'p3'], ['p5', 'p6'], 'p7']. So how I need to divide them, pls help. I am using the newest version of python.Ok to be more specific for "the same" in my program, I use p1 and p4 and if they give the same result for a certain character then I merge them in one group. Exampleif you have more questions just ask me.
