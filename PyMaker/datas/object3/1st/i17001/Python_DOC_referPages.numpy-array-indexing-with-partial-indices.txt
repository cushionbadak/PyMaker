I am trying to pull out a particular slice of a numpy array but don't know how to express it with a tuple of indices. Using a tuple of indices works if its length is the same as the number of dimensions:But if I want to get a slice along one dimension the same notation doesn't work:So is there a way to use a named tuple of indices together with slices?
Instead of using the : syntax you can explicitly create the slice object and add that to the tuple:In contrast to using foo[:, ind], the result of this should be the same as foo[:,2,3].
For accessing 2D arrays... I believe what you are suggesting should work. Be mindful that numpy arrays index starting from 0. So to pull the first and third column from the following matrix I use column indices 0 and 2.For accessing 3D arrays...3D numpy arrays are accessed by 3 values x[i,j,k] where "i" represents the first matrix slice, or from my example below. "j" represents the second matrix slice, or the rows of these matrices. And "k" represents their columns. i,j and k can be :, integer or tuple. So we can access particular slices by using two sets of named tuples as follows.
