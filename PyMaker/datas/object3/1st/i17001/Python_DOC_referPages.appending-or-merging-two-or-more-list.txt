If you're ok with tuples, use zip() like below:Or you can create lists of lists, again using zip()Be sure to understand that the lengths of the zipped lists must be equal, or in your case, you might end up missing some data. This is stated in the docs:The returned list is truncated in length to the length of the shortest argument sequenceExample of the above, notice how we're missing the last list.You can get around that by using itertools.izip_longest() which allows a fillvalue to be used (defaults to None):
You can simply use zip():
