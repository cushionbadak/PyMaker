Looking through the new pathlib module in Python 3.4, I notice that there isn't any simple way to get the user's home directory. The only way I can come up with for getting a user's home directory is to use the older os.path lib like so:This seems clunky. Is there a better way?
It seems that this method was brought up in a bug report here. Some code was written (given here) but unfortunately it doesn't seem that it made it into the final Python 3.4 release.Incidentally the code that was proposed was extremely similar to the code you have in your question:EDITHere is a rudimentary subclassed version PathTest which subclasses WindowsPath (I'm on a Windows box but you could replace it with PosixPath). It adds a classmethod based on the code that was submitted in the bug report.
As of python-3.5, there is Path.home(), which improves the situation somewhat.
There is method expanduser():
Caveat: This answer is 3.4 specific. As pointed out in other answers, this functionality was added in later versions.It looks like there is no better way to do it. I just searched the documentation and nothing relevant came up for my search terms.~ has zero hitsexpand has zero hitsuser has 1 hit as a return value for Path.owner()relative has 8 hits, mostly related to PurePath.relative_to()
