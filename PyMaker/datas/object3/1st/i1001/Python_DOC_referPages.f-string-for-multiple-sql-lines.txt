This one works (one line only):But these ones don't (2 lines):How do you use f-string in multiple lines?
The issue stems from essentially invalid multi lines and not really any fault of f-string.. Note that you only need to use your variables inside the {} parenthesis and not pass them separately with f-string syntax. Use triple quotes or backslashes at end of strings to use multi line strings. Link to docs
