I have the following dict:I update this to True when something happens and triggers it. What I would like to be able to do, though, is check if any of the values in the dict returns False (and if they do return False for any of the values do one thing, and if not, do something else).So... how would I go about this? Would be nice if I could do this in a one-line check, but if not, I can work around that.Note: this is for Python 2.7x
What about doingIt is worth mentioning that So, pay attention to this possibility. Depending on what you want to do, you may want to check for all(default_wallart.values()) and len(default_wallart)
You can not simply use the all builtin on the dictionary's values for this, because it will return False if it spots any falsy value such as 0, [], {}, ...Demo:We need one more step, checking explicitly against False.There is no False:    There is at least one False:(Checking against True or False with is is fine because these two are singletons.)
You could use all:Output
If you are sure that all values are either True or False then you could use in operator
You can loop through all values on the dictionary to find if any of them are False
