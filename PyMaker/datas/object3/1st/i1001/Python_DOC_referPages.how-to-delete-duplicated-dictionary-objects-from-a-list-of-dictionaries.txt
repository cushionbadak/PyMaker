I want to delete duplicated dictionary objects from  a List of dictionaries.I don't want the dict element that has the same 'plate' element with another dict element in the list. I want it only once.My output should be like this:This is my code, but I'm not getting the exact result.This gives me the output:which is not expected, what's wrong with my code.
If any element from the groups of duplicates is acceptable, you could do:OutputThe idea is to create a dictionary where the keys are values of plate and the values are the dictionaries themselves. If you want to keep the first duplicate entries use reversed:Output
You can use the unique_everseen recipe, also available in 3rd party more_itertools:Internally, this solution uses set to keep track of seen plates, yielding only dictionaries with new plate values. Therefore, ordering is maintained and only the first instance of any given plate is kept.
you can also use pandaskeep = 'first' or 'last' will help in which entry to keep in output
If you are a pandas user, you can considerIf you want to keep the last seen duplicates, pass keep='last'.
Assuming you want to only keep the first duplicated dict found, You can use setdefault():If you instead want the last duplicates, simply iterate in reverse(). 
You can use one groupby:Results:
Good old verbose for loop, then list comprehension:
