This question already has an answer here:Are dictionaries ordered in Python 3.6+?                    3 answers                Explaining this could be hard. I have a very long and complicated script. The final product of this script is a nested dictionary (normal dict, not OrderedDict).What I cannot explain is that when I run the script on a local machine, the dictionary has always the same structure (keys, values and nested keys and values). When I run the same script on a server I don't get any error, but the dictionary structure changes every time (randomly). Keys are always in a different position and so nested keys and values.Any ideas why this is happening?Can it be a different python version? On the local machine python3.6 and on the server 3.5
Yes, see here (under .values()):Changed in version 3.7: Dictionary order is guaranteed to be insertion order. This behavior was an implementation detail of CPython from 3.6.
