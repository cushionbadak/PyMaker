want to give user the control to input flexible number of argumentsplease tell me what should I pass as an actual argument
add takes any number of arguments, e.g.Since you have the arguments in a list (in variable d), you can unpack them this way:Let me clarify what the * does. It can be used in two places: in function definition and in function calls.In function definition, * is used for making it possible to have a function which takes an arbitrary number of arguments.For example, this function takes 2 arguments x and y and an arbitrary number of other arguments:See how it behaves in the example:As you can see, all other arguments are packed into a tuple and stored into the other_arguments variable.When calling a function, the opposite can be done, i.e. a tuple or a list of values can be unpacked to be called as arguments. See this example:It can be called with 3 arguments:or with one list unpacked into 3 arguments:
Perhaps you can condense what you wrote into something like below : You can pass arguments like this, this will print the input values stored in the list d and the sum of the input values stored in c.
