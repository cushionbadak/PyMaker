Is it possible to generate a random number with random.randint from 0-100 on increments of 5?If its possible I need way to generate random integers from 0-100 but only with increments of 5.
Either use random.randrange() which lets you pick a step value:or just generate a number between 0 and 20 and multiply that number by 5:I'm assuming here that 100 is a valid result. If 100 should not be generated, use random.randrange(0, 100, 5) or random.randint(0, 19) * 5.If you wanted to generate a numpy array of such numbers using the numpy.random.randint() function (instead of the standard library random module version), just use
The following code will generate random integer between 0 to 100
