While learning python, I have read questions regarding my one but I could not get why such implementation is done by python.Case-1: Exception is thrown & sd is set to 45Case-2: Exception is handled by except & sd is set to 50Case-3: No error is occurred then else will be executed & sd is set to 23We always wish that our code must work & if error is thrown it should be handled. But why else play role here that, if code in try block have no error then run this.Please suggest if I misunderstood, missed or misdirected.
I recommend checking out https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html - There's an entire section on this:The try â€¦ except statement has an optional else clause, which, when present, must follow all except clauses. It is useful for code that must be executed if the try clause does not raise an exception. ....@Edit To elaborate on this - The point of else is when you do something that you think might error (like, opening a file that might not exist), you can put the code utilizing that file in the else statement rather than within try, allowing you avoid catching an exception not raised by your try statement (ie, what if something completely unrelated to opening the file broke in your usage of the file?)
