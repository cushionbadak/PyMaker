As you can see, the following array called routine has a series of other arrays inside of it.I have tried to copy each item inside this array into a new array. However when i did so i got this output and the following error message.Clearly the code works through the first array inside the 2d array, however stops after that.This is the code used to generate the above error message.Is there a way in which i can join up these arrays so that there is only one array that looks like this.
If you have nested lists you can try using list comprehension:This only works if you have list of lists or two levels deep.To change your code, we can do the following to obtain the same result:Notice that I removed the -1 from your code. range(start, end) goes from start to end-1aka the entire array since arrays start from 0. That said, you don't need the -1.
You can try this :
This is what you want:
You don't need to use index. python can do it as simple as :
using chainOutput
For nested lists, a robust solution to combine all components into a single list can be done using chain.from_iterable
