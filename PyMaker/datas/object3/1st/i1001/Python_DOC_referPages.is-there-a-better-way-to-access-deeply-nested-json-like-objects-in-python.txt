I often have to deal with accessing deeply nested JSON responses. One way to access an element could be something like this:But that's obviously not at all safe. One solution is to use the get method of Python dict and pass {} as the default argument.But that again can raise an IndexError exception which leaves me with a length check for every list element access.And that's not at all pretty. So, is there a better solution for this?
Just wrap the entire thing in try/except:
Adding to the other answer, if you want to just ignore the exceptions you could use:Addtionally, another way is to suppress exceptions is with contextlib.suppress():
