I am trying to split a message into its individual words, and trying to tokenized those message.if show nameError: name "unicode" is not definedat the end it show unicode not defined, im trying to change the python version also remain the same issue. Did i need to replace the unicode by str in python plugin directory ?
I assume you're on python 3 so just try deleting the line message = unicode(message, 'utf8') â€“ your message variable is probably a unicode string already. If it's not then it's probably a bytes object, in which case the right way to turn it into a unicode string under python 3 is message.decode('utf8'). See https://docs.python.org/3/howto/unicode.html if you want more info.
