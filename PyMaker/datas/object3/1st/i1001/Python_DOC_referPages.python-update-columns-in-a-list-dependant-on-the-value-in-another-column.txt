Assume I have the following list: I want to do something that accomplishes the following: Set the values in the 1st column equal to "D" where the value in the 2nd column is equal to 0.So the list after the update should look like this:
Naming a variable list is not recommended, since it will shadow the builtin function list().  If you wish to do this in place, use indices:Otherwise, you can rebuild the list with a list comprehension:You can also do it this way without unpacking:Theres also nothing stopping you from doing it normally:The list of possibilities goes on(no pun intended).Also in Python bool(0) evaluates to False, so you can use not here instead of explicitly checking == 0. You can decide if this is worth using, since empty types and sequences such as "", [], (), {} etc. will also evaluate to False when testing for truthiness.
