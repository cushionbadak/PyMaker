A simple example for what I want to do:I have two (or more) dictionaries with same keys:and I would like to have a new dictionary containing both, looking like this:of course, I have multiple dictionaries and I would like to add them to one big dictionary for example in a for loop. I don't want to map all values to one key, maybe its not a dictionary of dictionarys, but a list of dictionaries? (This is why I am asking..)
You can map the same key to multiple values with a collections.defaultdict():If you want to keep the same dictionaries together in nested lists:Or you can use itertools.groupby():
You could use the extend or update methods: output: this is the default, but it can be implemented differently to turn a dictionary in to a dictionary of dictionariesedit:to get around any potential overwriting
