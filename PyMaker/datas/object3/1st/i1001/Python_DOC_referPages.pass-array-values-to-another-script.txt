I am having an issue where I need to access variables from one script in another. I've searched this question and I understand that we can use import to access variables in another script. The data is coming from an Arduino and is sent to a Raspberry Pi via serial and the values are continuous until the script is stopped. I have put my code into a function and I need to return the sensor data continuously.values.py script:second.py script:I need to include the if len(row)==6 statement because the first line that prints will be three values and the other values will be out of the index.My question is how would I access each individual array value in the second script. Would I need to print the function, I am confused on how to do this. I think the return statement is causing only one value to print and not be continuous.
You can use the json format to pass a single variable, an array, a hashmap.For continuous transmisssion, you can read the data line by line and decode/load the data once a line is completed.The documentation with examples :python2 https://docs.python.org/2/library/json.htmlpython3 https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html
You can return a dictionary from your printVal() function. Then you can assign the return values to a variable in your second script like so:
