So, I have a problem with my dataframe from dictionary - python actually "names" my rows and columns with numbers.Here's my code:I've tried to rename columns like this:dataframe=pd.DataFrame.from_dict(sorted_by_value, orient='index', columns=['A', 'B', 'C']), but it gives me a error:Is there any way to fix it?Edit:Here's the first part of my data frame:The 1st rows and columns are exactly what I need to remove/rename
By sorting the dict_items object (a.items()), you have created a list.  You can check this with type(sorted_by_value).  Then, when you try to use the pd.DataFrame.from_dict() method, it fails because it is expecting a dictionary, which has 'values', but instead receives a list.Probably the smallest fix you can make to the code is to replace the line:dataframe=pd.DataFrame.from_dict(sorted_by_value)with:dataframe = pd.DataFrame(dict(sorted_by_value), index=[0]).(The index=[0] argument is required here because pd.DataFrame expects a dictionary to be in the form {'key1': [list1, of, values], 'key2': [list2, of, values]} but instead sorted_by_value is converted to the form {'key1': value1, 'key2': value2}.)Another option is to use pd.DataFrame(sorted_by_value) to generate a dataframe directly from the sorted items, although you may need to tweak sorted_by_value or the result to get the desired dataframe format.Alternatively, look at collections.OrderedDict (the documentation for which is here) to avoid sorting to a list and then converting back to a dictionary.EditRegarding naming of columns and the index, without seeing the data/desired result it's difficult to give specific advice.  The options above will allow remove the error and allow you to create a dataframe, the columns of which can then be renamed using dataframe.columns = [list, of, column, headings].  For the index, look at pd.DataFrame.set_index(drop=True) (docs) and pd.DataFrame.reset_index() (docs).
index and columns are properties of your dataframeAs long as len(df.index) > 0 and len(df.columns) > 0, i.e. your dataframe has nonzero rows and nonzero columns, you cannot get rid of the labels from your pd.DataFrame object. Whether the dataframe is constructed from a dictionary, or otherwise, is irrelevant.What you can do is remove them from a representation of your dataframe, with output either as a Python str object or a CSV file. Here's a minimal example:
