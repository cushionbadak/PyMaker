You want to convert html (a byte-like object) into a string using .decode, e.g.  html = response.read().decode('utf-8'). See Convert bytes to a Python String
The problem is that your regex is a string, but html is bytes:Since python doesn't know how those bytes are encoded, it throws an exception when you try to use a string regex on them.You can either decode the bytes to a string:Or use a bytes regex:In this particular context, you can get the encoding from the response headers:See the urlopen documentation for more details.
