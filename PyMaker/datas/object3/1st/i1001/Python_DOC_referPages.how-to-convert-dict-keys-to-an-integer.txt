I have a dictionary where the keys are integers, and are in sequence.  From time to time, I need to remove older entries from the dictionary.  However, when I try to do this, I run into a "dict_keys" error.  When I try to cast the value to an int, I'm told that's not supported.I see answers here saying to use a list comprehension.  However, as there may be a million entries in this dictionary, I'm hoping there is some way to perform the cast without having to perform it on the entire list of keys.
You don't need to convert dict_keys to int. That's not a thing that makes sense, anyway. Your problem is that np.min needs a sequence, and the return value of d.keys() is not a sequence.For taking the minimum of an iterable, use the regular Python min, not np.min. However, calling min in a loop is an inefficient way to do things. heapq.nsmallest could help, or you could find a better data structure than a dict.
You want a list is you want to use numpy:but actually you can use the builtin min here, which nows how to iterate, and for a dict, the iteration happens over keys anyway
You could use an OrderedDict and pop the oldest key-value pair. An advantage to use an OrderedDict is that it remembers the order that keys were first inserted. In this code, the first key will always be the minimum in the OrderedDict d. When you use popitem(last=False), it simply removes the oldest or first key-value pair.If you'd like to remove the oldest 5 key-value pairs, extract these key-value pairs into a list of tuples and then use popitem(last=False) again to remove them from the top(heap analogy):
