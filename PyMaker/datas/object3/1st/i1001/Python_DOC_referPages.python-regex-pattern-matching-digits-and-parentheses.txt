I would like to know how I can possibly get/match a list of digist ending with a list of digits in parentheses?Original textCisco IOS Software, 3600 Software (C3660-JK9S2-M), Version 12.4(25b)strong text, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)ROM: 3600 Software (C3660-JK9S2-M), Version 12.4(25b), RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)Expected matchBelow is what I tried, but it doesn't work or get the specific versionAny idea?Thank you
Try this: .*Version (.*?\)).*. This expression should work regardless of if the number in the brackets in followed by a letter or not. You then fetch the result (the version number part) by using \1 as a 'variable'. In python, you do it using the group() function from the result. Check beforehand if anything was matched at all for safety.Full example code:To obtain multiple version numbers (i.e. both instances of the numbers after the 'Version' string, one can use regexoutput = re.findall('Version (.*?\))',show). Here, a list is returned and the group will be automatically fetched by definition (see https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.findall), so the check at the end is not needed.
May this working:\d+\.\d+\(\d+.\)result:any problem leave ur comment pls.
