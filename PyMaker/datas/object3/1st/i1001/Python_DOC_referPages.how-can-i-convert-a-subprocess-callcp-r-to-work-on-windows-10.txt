My goal is to use a code that another researcher gave to me. I am on Python 3.7 on Windows 10. I assume that the code is written for Python 2 and Linux OS. I need to translate some of the old Python 2 commands to my new 3.7 version. I cannot use another Python version, or change my OS. I have started the job, and some of the translation are quite obvious, but I need your help for this one.The old command is:WD and ProcessDir[ProcessNumber] are both file paths. I need a new command for Python 3.7 on Window 10. I assume that "cp -r" is equivalent to the Windows command xcopy, but my problem is the following: WD + "Albedo", + "CIE_data", etc. How to xcopy several files in one command with subprocess.call?
Frankly, there's no good reason to use any OS-provided tool for this when Python's shutil module gives you an OS-independent way to copy a directory tree. Thus:
I would seriously recommend not copying files like that. As you see in your current situation, you are not guaranteed to have the same program available on different machines. On the other hand, you have Python, which has all the cross-platform file-copying utilities you will likely need.For generic file operations, the shutil module is your friend. In particular, shutil.copytree does what you want almost exactly. The only difference is that the destination may not already exist, and you have to copy one source folder at a time.Another point is that you generally don't want to concatenate paths that may or may not contain a trailing slash with +. Use os.join instead. It will not only handle such differences, but make sure that the path separator it inserts is correct for your OS.In total you have:If something goes wrong along the way, you may want to pre-clean your output using shutil.rmtree. Before calling copytree, do
