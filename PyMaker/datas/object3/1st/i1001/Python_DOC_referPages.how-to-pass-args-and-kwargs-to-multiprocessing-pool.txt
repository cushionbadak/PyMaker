If I have the following function:and I want to parallelize with multiprocessing.How can I pass the following arguments 1, 2, d=10? i.e. 2 args and 1 kwarg?I saw this post, but it does not seem to make it actually parallel. Another possibly useful example was provided here, but it is hard to untangle. 
How about:Which prints:I guess that you want to pass the kwds as a dict. The keys need to be strings.
