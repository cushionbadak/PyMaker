This question already has an answer here:python: class override “is” behavior                    4 answers                Is there a way to compare a Python class to None using the is operator?Is there something I can implement on the class so that the is operator will return True when comparing to None?
You can't overload the is operator because it is used to check if two variables refer to the same value, which you should never need to overload. The most similar thing is to overload == with the __eq__ method:
https://docs.python.org/3/library/operator.htmlFollowing similar syntax of the other operator overrides methods you have defined, you can do one for is_. Hope this helps!
