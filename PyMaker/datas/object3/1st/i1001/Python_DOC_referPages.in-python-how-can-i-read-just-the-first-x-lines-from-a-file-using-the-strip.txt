Natural Text
See code below where I try to use 2 different functions to read different parts from a text file (essentially a save file for a game board). The first one tries to read the first 5 lines and assign them to a matrix (list of lists). The second one tries to read the 6th line and assign it to a string. However I can't seem to get the code to work. Any ideas?savefile.txt looks like this:
in both functions you are reading complete file. You need read all lines and then use required lines , see below example:
Instead of opening the file in each function, take an already open file as an argument:Then open the file once before calling each function. Note that load_from_file should be used to ensure that load_board and load_side are called in the correct order and with no other reads from savefile to break the pre-conditions.
savefile as in code, is a file instance, not a list of lines. Instead, use savefile.readlines() for all the lines. Also, would give you all 6 lines, not just 5. So loadBoard[-1] would be [M].
Why not load the file once and then use the output to parse out what you want?This can be used like so:
You can also enumerate over the file object.Output
