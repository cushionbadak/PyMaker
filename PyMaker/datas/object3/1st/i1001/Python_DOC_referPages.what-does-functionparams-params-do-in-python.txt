This question already has an answer here:Meaning of function calling in Python?                    1 answer                I meet some Keras functions that look like the following : Function(1*List of parameters separated by commas)(2*A parameter). But I don't understand what does Function do on the second list of parameters. I have never met this kind of functions in Python. The usual type of functions' prototypes I see are of the following : Function(List of parameters)Example of these functions met in Keras :x = Dense(128, activation='relu')(x)x = Dropout(0.35)(x)out = Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')(x)In this case, it looks like that Function takes into account what was done precedently on x before applying on it new changes. Is this kind of function writing backed by any Python manual ? Is it a new type of function writing in Python ?How does it work ?
It's just a function that returns a function which you immediately call. You can do the same:This function can now be called like this:This works becauseFunctions are first-class objects. A “def” statement executed inside a function definition defines a local function that can be returned or passed around. Free variables used in the nested function can access the local variables of the function containing the def. [1]See also: Naming and Binding.
