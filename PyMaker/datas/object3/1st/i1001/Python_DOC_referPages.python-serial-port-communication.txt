Here is my code for serial port communication but i'm getting in the output as b'\x0b\x16 )6\x06\x07\x08X\x02\x16,'     (it's Hex+Ascii value) and this is my input data uint8_t myBuf[]={11,22,32,41,54,6,7,8,88,2,22,44};any one know what i'm doing wrong here? 
What format do you want your output in? As you suggest, what you have is the correct data but in byte format. For example you could get it as a list of python ints as follows (Python 3):The struct module may also be useful for you in decoding byte data.(I can't leave a comment, sorry.)
When you wrote str(data) you requested python to tranlsate the binary data to a readable string (In a readable fromat).Since there is no readable representation to most of the bytes python just translates them into their hex representation (as a string).If you want to print them as a list just: list(data).
