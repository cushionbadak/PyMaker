I have a list of tuples which I would like to import into a dictionary. Those tuples consist of two strings. I would like to convert those tuples into integers. i.eThe resulting list should be:I have tried using:But that doesn't seem to work.
You could use eval function to get the tuples, like this. Works in both python2, and python3.
You also need to split your strings by ','.Another option is to use the csv module.If it's not terribly important the the inner elements of the result are tuples and that they are of type int, we can simplify the csv solution to~edit~thelogicalkoan's answer reminded me of ast.literal_eval which provides the most elegant (and safe) solution here.
An alternative solution is to use ast.literal_eval (instead of eval which can be considered unsafe):So, you can do:
str.partition can be used to do this.The generator expression (z.partition(',') for z in myList) produces the output of str.partition on each element of the list, and then we call int on the parts that we require. 
This is a different option:
