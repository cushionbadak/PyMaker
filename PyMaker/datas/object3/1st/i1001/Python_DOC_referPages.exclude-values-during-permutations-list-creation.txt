I know that in Python I can easly create a list containing all permutations of a given string, using the permutations() function. Now imagine if I wanted to generate only the permutations of the string "3212323" that do not contain the string"33". How can I achieve this result ?Example:"3231322""3332122"  <-- I don't want you"3213223""3223213""2223313"  <-- I don't want you"2322313""2312332"  <-- I don't want youecc...Note: I know that I could generate all the permutations first, and then remove the specified ones from the list, but what I need is to not generate these permutations at all, so discard them while creating the permutations list.Any suggestion will be appreciated. Thanks in advance.
Solution with custom filterIt's python so you can see the source code and modify it
You can use generators:All of those are generators, that way you won't have all possible combinations at once in you memory. If you want to have as a list just change the second line (or the outermost in the one-liner) parentheses to square brackets.
If you look at the documentation for permutations, they give you what the function is essentially. You can modify this to exclude '33'
Similar to _mads first option, you can also use the filterfalse(predicate, iterable) function from itertools:
