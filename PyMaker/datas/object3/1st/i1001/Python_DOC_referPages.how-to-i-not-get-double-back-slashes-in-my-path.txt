Natural Text
I have this little part of a code that I am not understanding why I am getting double backslashes when I join the both paths together. Here is the codeWhat am I missing? I keep getting this error
Differentiate between "display in your ide /debugging session" and "what is in the string".You might want to quit using python2 string formating and get raw-strings vs. normal strings straight:Output:Output:Doku:formatted string literalsraw f-stringsWhat exactly do "u" and "r" string flags do, and what are raw string literals?Also: you can use / as well on windows as directory seperator - it works and it is less overall hassle if you need the strings for f.e. os.xxxx methods.
This is just the way that the python REPL prints out escaped characters. The actual strings only have a single backslash between each component of the path. You'll notice that the data printed from your print statement shows the single backslashes.
