I may be missing something fundamental here but consider the following:how do i iterate through the list of dicts so that when i do a print it returns me the variable name the dict equals i.e. i want to be able to retrieve back 'dDict' and 'lDict'?I do not want a quick hack such as dDict['name'] = 'dDict'Any ideas..?EDIT: the reason i want to do this is so that i can append these centrality measures to a dataframe with new column name i.e.: 
You can iterate over globals() and get the variable name of the object that matches the content you are looking for. More info on https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html?highlight=globals#globalsHowever, this is a rather cumbersome trick, you should not do that! Rather, redesign your software so you don't have to look for the variable names in the first place.
