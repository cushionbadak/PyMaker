Natural Text
how can i make python recognize these two lines as one line because they are one sentence. I'm reading these from a text file. So if i want to check if the word is in a sentence and if it is it should print these two lines because they are one sentence. But my code is only printing the first line.Code Expected codeActual result 
You must specify how do you want to read your file. The "new line" default delimiter is being used here. Check out the Build-in Functions and take a look of  open() . "...When reading input from the stream, if newline is None, universal newlines mode is enabled. Lines in the input can end in '\n', '\r', or '\r\n'".You must specify the delimiter in the stream in order to be read as you wish. 
You could use something like csv reader.
