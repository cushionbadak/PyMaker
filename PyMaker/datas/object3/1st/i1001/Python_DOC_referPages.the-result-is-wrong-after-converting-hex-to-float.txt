I am trying to convert Hex 4991a480 to float using Python 3.6But it doesn't work correctly.The result I want to get is 1.1931e+06. I used a conversion website, and it gave the result I was expecting. What am I doing wrong? 
It's the same thing, you just need to format it ([Python 3]: Format Specification Mini-Language) to the exponent notation ([Wikipedia]: IEEE 754):Note that [Python 3]: struct.unpack(format, buffer) returns a tuple.
The value which printed is actually the answer you expected, written in long-form notation instead of scientific notation. There is not a problem here.See this for more on scientific notation.
