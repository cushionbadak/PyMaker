Recently I have been working on a code and got stuck for days on this error.Basically the program calculates how many calories you have to eat everyday. I have to take input from an entry and I don't know how to convert that input(it's a string by default) into a float to start using the numbers.I am using Python 3 with Tkinter.Here is the code:I tried all the methods I found on the internet but nothing worked.
Probable cause: you forgot to fill out one fieldExplanationa float can be constructed from a str, it just has to have the right format.You should be able to convert string that look like floats to floats by just using float(mystr). Pay attention to:No spaces (or non-digit characters)  Period (.) as decimal separator, not comma (,)  some special things are allowed (e.g. "inf", "5e3",...)Most probably (if you didn't cut anything off your error message), you forgot to fill out one field and are thus trying to perform float('').Some examplesFurther thoughtsAn alternative for getting the float values is asking for them in a popup window -- tis can be done with tkinter.simpledialog.askfloat. This will return you a float directly and show an error message if the string entered could not be converted.But, it may also return None when the user clicks the "Cancel" button, so you might want to check the result befor computing stuff.Example:Edit:If you keep the Entry widgets, you may want to catch the error and show the user a message. This can easily be done with tkinter.mesagebox, specifically of this case the showerror function.Example:
