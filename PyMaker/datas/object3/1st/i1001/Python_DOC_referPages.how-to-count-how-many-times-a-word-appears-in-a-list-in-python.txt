This question already has an answer here:Nested List and count()                    7 answers                I have the following list in pythonand I want to go through the list and count how often each word appears in it.I have tried counting the individual words using length() and I get a 2 as a result which means it does not work.Is there any way I can count how often a word appears in a list as I intend storing the counted word in a new list and it's frequency in another list.Thanks in advance 
First thing to note is probably that texts is a nested list, which is also why you get 2 for len(texts) since texts contains 2 sublists.If you want to iterate over the individual words, you need to iterate over the sublists and then over the words inside the sublists. Luckily, Python's list comprehensions can be nested:As for the counting: The standard library has a dictionary class for exactly such purpose: collections.Counter:This will give you a dictionary mapping individual words to their occurrence count.
One liner:
You can use Counter for this.
You can count the words with Counter:Source: How do I count unique values inside a list
