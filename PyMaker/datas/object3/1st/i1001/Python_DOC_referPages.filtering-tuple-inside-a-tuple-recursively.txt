i'm trying to figure out how to filter a tuple inside a tuplelike so:this is how far I got :it works when there are no tuple inside a tuple, and I have no idea what I need to change to make it work ( I must use only recursions).does anyone have an idea?
Only apply the filter function directly on non-tuple elements, and only perform recursion on tuple ones:
Here's a generator solution that also works:Note: The benefit of using isinstance() over type() is when you want to support multiple types such as list, set, then you can just pass a tuple of types: isinstance(x, (list, set, tuple)). 
I think this is what you want.
Alternate one-line solution that preserve's the input's recursive structure:TESTRoughly equivalent to:
