This question already has an answer here:Syntax behind sorted(key=lambda: â€¦)                    6 answers                Why are Python lambdas useful? [closed]                    26 answers                Please be gentle I'm still learning Python. I've an example where pairs = [(1, 'one'), (2, 'two'), (3, 'three'), (4, 'four')]pairs.sort(key=lambda pair: pair[1])The result is[(4, 'four'), (1, 'one'), (3, 'three'), (2, 'two')]Can you please help explain why this is the sequence?
A lambda is simply a short way of declaring a simple function. That code could just as easily have been written:In this case, the lambda function is telling sort how it should turn a value in the array (in this case, a tuple which doesn't have an obvious sorting order) into a value that it knows how to sort (a string).
