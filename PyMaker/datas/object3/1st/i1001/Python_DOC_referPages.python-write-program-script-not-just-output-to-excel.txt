Natural Text
for documentation/reporting purposes I would like to memorialize the script that I run for a report as part of the output to an excel tab.  Is this possible?for example, if i have the below code:this will take the output from the sql script and create a dataframe and then create an excel file and put that data frame on sheet 'test1'.  I would like to create a second tab that contains all of the code that was utilized within the python script (basically creating an audit trail).Any help you can provide would be appreciated!
I made an example how to add the code of the script to the second sheet, should be able to replace the part under # First sheet, use your SQL data with your SQL part.
