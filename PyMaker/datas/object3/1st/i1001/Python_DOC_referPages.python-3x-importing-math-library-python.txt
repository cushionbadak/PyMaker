I have the following code which i want to execute :But it throws an exception :What am i missing ? 
math.log2 was introduced in Python 3.3. You are probably using an earlier version.In those earlier versions, you can useinstead.
You have a file called math.py in the same directory as the code you're trying to run. Delete or rename it.When you import math, Python walks through the directories in sys.path and imports the first file called math.py (or a directory called math with an __init__.py file inside) that it sees. The first entry in sys.path is the current directory, so it sees your math.py first.See the documentation for modules or for the import statement. 
As already suggested either use Python3.3 or aboveoruse math.log(num, 2)Another slight modification is required.Please changea.someNum('9') to Else this error occurs.
