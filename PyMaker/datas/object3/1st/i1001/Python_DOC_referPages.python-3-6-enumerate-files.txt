I am trying to loop a series of jpg files in a folder. I found example code of that:which will loop through the image files in image_folder. However, it seems like it is not following any sequence. I have my files name like 000001.jpg, 000002.jpg, 000003.jpg,... and so on. But when the code run, it did not follow the sequence:What seems to be the issue here?
Here's the relevant bit on os.scandir():os.scandirâ€‹(path='.')Return an iterator of os.DirEntry objects  corresponding to the entries in the directory given by path. The  entries are yielded in arbitrary order, and the special entries '.'  and '..' are not included.You should not expect it to be in any particular order.  The same goes for listdir() if you were considering this as an alternative.If you strictly need them to be in order, consider sorting them first:
I prefer to use glob:The glob module finds all the pathnames matching a specified pattern  according to the rules used by the Unix shell, although results are  returned in arbitrary order. No tilde expansion is done, but *, ?, and  character ranges expressed with [] will be correctly matched.You will need this if you handle more complex file structures so starting with glob isnt that bad. For your case you also can use os.scandir() as mentioned above. Reference: glob modulenotice even if there other files like .txt they wont be in your listOutput:
