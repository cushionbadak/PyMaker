I have the following build_settings_message function and I am a bit confused how should I write a unit test for it. What aspects of it do I need to check?
You have to mock SlackTeam and Site and return some fake, but real-looking values for team and domain, then verify that the value returned by build_settings_message is correct (based on team and domain).Be sure to check edge-cases such as no team, duplicate domain, etc.
