Natural Text
I am trying to set an environment variable in Jenkins that I want my python script in Github to use. I can access variables once they're not a collection but i would like to set a collection variable. In this case, a list.I have a list variable like:list = ["item1","item2"]When i try to print it from Jenkins using: print(os.environ['list']) it prints the whole list as a single string and using print(type(os.environ['list'])) prints "string".
Environment variables are just text. In cases (e.g. the PATH and PYTHONPATH variables), this can be done by using os.pathsep to separate elements of the list. E.g.and then reconstructYou could also use some serialization standard like JSON.I don't believe it would work to store the list itself.
Create a string variable in jenkins and then use str.split() in the python script to make a list.In Jenkins: jenkinslist = item1 item2 item3In Github/python: pythonlist = os.environ['jenkinslist'].split()
