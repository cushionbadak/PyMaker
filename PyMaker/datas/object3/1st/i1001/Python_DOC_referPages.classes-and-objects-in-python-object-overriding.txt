need a small help on this codeI know if i change the variables in the highlighted lines to "other.name" i'll be getting the desired output as below.But if i just give "other" ill be getting the below output.Can you guys please explain me the importance of adding ".name" in the print statement.
In this line c1.greet(e1) you're passing e1 which is Employee("bhargav") object of class Employee.So when you print "Get back to work, %s!" %(other), you're trying to print the object of Employee class and not the name attribute of that class.If you want to print the name attribute of the object whenever you try to print the object, then You can override the __str__() function and provide your custom string representation for the object.Something like this:Reference : https://www2.lib.uchicago.edu/keith/courses/python/class/5/#str
When you do c1.greet(e1) and e1 is e1 = Employee("bhargav"), which is an object of Employee class. Hence, you are getting output as Get back to work, <__main__.Employee object at 0x0000021858C64FD0>! Doing print(e1.name) will print bhargav and doing print(e1) will just print the Employee object along with it's memory location (0x0000021858C64FD0).                   To achieve what you are trying to do use dunder __str__ in Employee class like this:              Output:         
If you want to return result from object of a class then you need to declare it.Using repr(for python2) or str(for python3 and python2).Now this will show desired output.
