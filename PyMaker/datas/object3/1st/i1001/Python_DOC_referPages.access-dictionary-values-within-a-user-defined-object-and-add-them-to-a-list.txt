I was wondering if there is a way to access specific dictionary values within user-defined objects?E.g.When doing I get:{'key1': 0, 'key2': 1}But how can I get the dictionary value of, lets say, "key1" (only "key1")?Also, I am trying to add the content of an object to a list (as specific list elements). Is that somehow possible?I am trying to do something like: When I do:I only get:Noneinstead of:["text", 0, {"key1":0, "key2":1}]
It will make sense to have a closer look at the python data structures. Your should be able to solve your issues yourself after reading through this documentation. At least it will help you to better understand the solutions below.In short, here is how you get the value for a key:And how to append to a list:or in one go:
But how can I get the dictionary value of, lets say, "key1" (only "key1")?Here is a horrible (but, working and dynamic) answer using exec:Instance your class with arguments:Try returning key values via direct access:
