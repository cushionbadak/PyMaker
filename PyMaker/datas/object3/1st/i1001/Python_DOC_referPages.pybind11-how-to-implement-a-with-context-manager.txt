I'm trying to implement a Python with context manager with pybind11.Following Python's documentation, my first version is:I don't know what the types of exc_type, exc_value and traceback. I guess they can be simple pybind11::object? Are they more specific bindings, I can use?
Indeed these arguments will come as Python objects, so you should use pybind11::object type for them. Using void* is not a solution.Pybind11 is probably the best Python wrapper for C++ mechanism that uses C++ as its language at the moment.
