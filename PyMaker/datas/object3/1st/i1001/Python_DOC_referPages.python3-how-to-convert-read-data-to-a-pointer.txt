Natural Text
I have python 2 code that works:Prints "18"However, it does not work in python 3. I get:I am simply grabbing one 32-bit field from a file and printing how C would see it. How do I make this work in Py3? All the code examples I find are for python 2, and the docs make no sense to me.
Python 3 distinguishes between binary and text I/O. Files opened in binary mode (including 'b' in the mode argument) return contents as bytes objects without any decoding based on https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#openI imitated the example provided by you inline below, instead of reading from a file.Same thing in Python 3https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#int.from_bytes has more information about the method
As Mad Wombat commented, python3 does read the file as a byte array rather than a string. The following snippet essentially synthesizes the process.
