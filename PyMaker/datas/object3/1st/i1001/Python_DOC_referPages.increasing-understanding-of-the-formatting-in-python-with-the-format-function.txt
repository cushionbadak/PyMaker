For the following lines of Python code I'm failing to understand a key concept.A string is assigned to the variable joke_evaluationand include {} to embed another variable within it.The third line of code has got me stuck, we are saying print the variable joke_evaluation then using the .format() function and passing another variable to it - hilarious which is set as a boolean data type. Are the {} effectively functioning as placeholders? How does the .format() function know to populate the {} with the variable hilarious?Please explain in basic terms if possible to increase my understanding, I'm failing to understand how Python populates the curly braces {} as I've mentioned above.
Here's my understanding of the the format method:Any string with curly braces {} will be replaced with the variable you have provided. So, if I have a string say:myStr = "hello {}"then doing: Now, doing this:As you might have guessed, the integer 123123 was implicitly converted to string before being included in the string.Now, coming to the curly {} part:You can have multiple curly braces and must have the same number of parameters passed to format method. Eg:myStr = "hello {},{},{}, nice meeting you"res = myStr.format("abcd",123,"lol")print(res) #prints "hello abcd,123,lol, nice meeting you"You can even put indices in the {} to indicate position like {0} and {1}.
Yes, {} acting as placeholders, which is treated by .format method in special way.How does the .format() function know to populate the {} with the variable hilarious?If you're providing {} only, it's substituted position-wise, i.e.For more verbose or re-usable substitution you can use named arguments:More on awesome string formatting: pyformat.infoA bit more on formatting, when .format substituting placeholders with some objects, it calls __format__ method on it, whichAccepts formatting spec â€” which gives you ability to control how it will be converted (for example, '{:.2f}'.format(3.1415)Return str, which will actually substitute placeholders
