This question already has an answer here:Retrieving python 3.6 handling of re.sub() with zero length matches in python 3.7                    3 answers                I'm trying to regex replace n occurrences of a letter with a single letter. Should be simple enough, as I know regular expressions. Python 2.7.15 works as expected:But Python 3.7.2rc1 gives me:Using 'x+' as pattern partially works around the issue, but obviously does not work for 0-length matches.
This looks like an intentional change in python 3.7. From the documentation:Empty matches for the pattern are replaced when adjacent to a previous  non-empty match.Using that terminology, I found this post detailing how to regain the old functionality.
