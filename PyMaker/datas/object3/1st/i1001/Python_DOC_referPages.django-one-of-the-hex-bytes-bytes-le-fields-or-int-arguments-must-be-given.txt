I am trying to filter data on based of UUIDAutoField in an API using Django. I am using PostgreSQL but while sending data from mobile app I have a string and that string UUID is on API level is not matching up with the same UUID it is giving me this error:TypeError at /api/updatestate/  one of the hex, bytes, bytes_le, fields, or int arguments must be givenand I am doing this to string type uuid when I get it from API requestempId = uuid.UUID(request.POST.get('employee_id'))
The error message tells you exactly what the problem is: you need to specify one of those arguments in your call to uuid.UUID (on line 78 of views.py).  The doc is pretty clear:Exactly one of hex, bytes, bytes_le, fields, or int must be given.
