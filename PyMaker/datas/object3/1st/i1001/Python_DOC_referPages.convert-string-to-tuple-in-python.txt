This question already has an answer here:converting string to tuple                    3 answers                covert a string which is a list into a proper list python                    2 answers                Pretty simply question but giving me some trouble: I have and would like:Have tried using .split(), and just converting the whole thing to tuple(str) with no success. 
There are two ways to achieve this, both parse the string as Python code.The seemingly easier option is to use eval.The slightly more complicated, but better, option is to use ast.literal_eval.In Using python's eval() vs. ast.literal_eval()? everything has already been said why the latter is almost always what you really want. Note that even the official documentation of eval says that you should use ast.literal_eval instead.
How about this?
How about using regular expressions ?
Shortest is doeval() evaluates and executes string as python expression
