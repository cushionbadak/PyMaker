Is it possible to create lists without specifying how many items are going to be in it?At the start of my code, I create all the lists I want to populate by using:These lists can store 7 items so, if I want to store 8 items, I am having to add a new ,“0” to each list each time if I want the code to add an 8th item later. Is there a way to not have to specify the list size at the start? Or some kind of dynamic list where it doesn’t matter?
The other answers already mention that lists in python are dynamic, so you can specify an empty list and append to it. Also, other operations are supported, such as insert list.insert(i, x) (inserts an element at a given position), which allows you place an element anywhere in the array, not just at the end.
In python when you define list you don't need to define size, or a type. And if you like you can mix and match. (i.e. list with int, string, and complex data types)
Python lists are dynamic, and can hold any number of items. For example, if this was your code:You could modify it to look like this:In fact, you could do for i in range(1000) and it would be fine. A way to shorten the above is a list comprehension:which would do the same.
