I am working with an Excel file in Pandas where I am trying to deal with a Date column where the Date is listed in ISO 8601 format. I want to take this column and store the date and time in two different columns.The values in these two columns need to be stored in Eastern Daylight Savings. This is what they are supposed to look likeI have achieved this, partially. I have converted the values to Eastern Daylight savings time and successfully stored the Date value correctly. However, I want the time value to be stored in the 12 hours format and not in the 24 hours format as it is being right now?This is what my output looks like so far.Does anyone have any idea what i can do for this?
You can set the time format used for outputting - the time value itself is (and should be) stored as datetime.time() - if you want a specific string representation you can create a string-type column in the format you want:Output:
You should use d.time().strftime("%I:%M:%S %p") which will format the date as requested.strftime() and strptime() Behavior
It looks like you are very close.  %H is the 24 hour format.  You should use %I instead.How can I account for period (AM/PM) with datetime.strptime?
