I want to print each word in word = "They stumble who run fast" on a new line using index slicing.I've tried using a while loop, like printing words after each spaceThe result should be like this:
If you absolutely need to use index slicing:Output:But why not use .split()?Output:
I think I know what this problem is for (edx class..as I ran into the same thing). This solution worked for me using the pieces they're encouraging the students to use at this point in the course:
The obvious solution would be to use str.split, but that would violate your desire for slicing:A better way might be to keep track of an index for the current space and keep looking for the next one. This is probably similar to what you had in mind, but your loop doesn't update and variables:A shortcut that probably won't be acceptable either, but produces the desired output:
Not sure why anyone would want to do this rather than just use str.split(), but here is another (fairly ugly) way along the lines of your initial stab at it.
