In the code below, when we run m.choose_slot(), and enter the slot by entering the number, it gets popped from the entered location instead of the number from the list itself ,even though in the for loop I mentioned i==b (iterator is equal to the entered number that is b). I want the number entered to be popped.P.S I am a beginner in Python and I am doing this as a part of my first project.   
The list.pop(i) removes i-th element of the list by it's index. If you need to remove element by value, use list.remove(x) method instead.Some links:https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.htmlIs there a simple way to delete a list element by value?
