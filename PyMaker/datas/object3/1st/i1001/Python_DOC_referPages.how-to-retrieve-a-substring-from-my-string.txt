The string variable myvar can have the following values:I need to extract the numbers 483.93 and 1,763.61. These numbers should be converted to float numbers or rounded up to integers.This is what I tried:It works in the first case (261.30 (NM) / 300.76 (MI) / 483.93 (KM)). But it fails in case of 952.27 (NM) / 1,096.09 (MI) / 1,763.61 (KM). Is there any generic solution?
You can use this regex that detects the last number in the string and places it in group1,DemoThen with following python code, you can convert it into float or int. I am converting it to float as they are decimal values but you can easily cast them to int.Prints,
With single re.search function, without any replacement:The output:
You could also achieve the same by using only split() 
What I would do in this case is create a list of the values, from which I can extract any of those.
You can do it with regular expression.
Since the values are followed by (KM) you could use a positive lookahead:\S+ Match 1+ non whitespace characters(?= \(KM\)) Positive lookahead to check what is on the right is a space and (KM)For example:That will give you:Regex demo | Python demo
