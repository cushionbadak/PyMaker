I used to use year and week number to convert to date for some propose.it works well before 2019, but when i tried to import 2019 wk1 data, it wired.2019 wk1 becomes between 2019-01-07 ~ 2019-01-03But on the contrary, if i use date to convert to year and wk, it's correct.May I know what's wrong with my code? thanksI use given year and weeknum to convert to date. ideally, 2019WK1 should be between 2018-12-31 to 2019-01-05, but it became 2019-01-06 to 2019-01-13.then I use that date to convert to year and wk, the result is what's I expected.
According to strftime() and strptime() Behavior,%W: Week number of the year (Monday as the first day of the week) as a decimal number. All days in a new year preceding the first Monday are considered to be in week 0.%w: Weekday as a decimal number, where 0 is Sunday and 6 is Saturday.You put 4 as %w, indicating you want date of Thursday of the week number you provide.First week (%W=1) of 2018 that starts with Monday is: Jan 1 - Jan 7 or Jan 4 (Thursday)First week (%W=1) of 2019 that starts with Monday is: Jan 7 - Jan 13 or Jan 10 (Thursday)For 2018, there's no Thursday the week before, so %W=0 will output the same as %W=1. However, for 2019, there is a Thursday the week before, so %W=0 will output Jan 3.
