I have an enum that I define like this: At some later point I would like to check, if a value that I took as a parameter in a funciton is part of an_enum. Usually i would do it like this assert 1 in to_list(an_enum)How can I convert the enum object an_enum to a list? If that is not possible, how can I check if a value "is part of the enum"?
How can I convert the enum object an_enum to a list? How can I check if a value "is part of the enum"?
I'm not sure why you're defining enums like you do, there's supported functional way to do this:If this suits your needs, you can donot actually membership check, but you don't need any special methods/transformers
