I am trying to execute n processes simultaneously. The example below works with 2 processes that are supplied externally.At the moment it is all hard-coded for just these 2 processes but I would need to come up with the generic solution how to accomplish the same - i.e. run n processes at the same time.My code is as follows:Thanks for your suggestions!
You can either spawn processes in a loop, or use executor pool.In real life, later one is often preferred approach, as you can limit pool size and have easy result gathering.If you're using python 2, there's backport including ProcessPoolExecutor
