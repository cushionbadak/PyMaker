Tkinter doesn't draw image to canvas from another method.Example 1 works, example 2 does not work. Can someone please explain why?example 1example 2
If I remember correctly, there's a problem in Tkinter when the image you're displaying goes out of scope (because it's a local variable). Try to make photo an attribute of your class (by replacing photo with self.photo in your _draw_image function) and see if that solves the issue.Does this help?EditFor a more complete explanation, see this website: http://effbot.org/pyfaq/why-do-my-tkinter-images-not-appear.htm
