A puzzling question arose when using thriftpy2,this is my code：the type of the client is:but when I remove await：the type of the client is:cause I can't call rpc's serviceWhy do it return different types of objects?
This is because the make_aio_client is a coroutine, not just a regular python function. Since python 3.5 the async keyword indicates that function is a coroutine:Regular function call won't actually execute it, just create a coroutine for you.Roughly speaking, coroutines are just generators (functions that yield the result). That's why it's type is a generator.You have to use the await keyword to schedule the execution in the event loop:Read the asyncio manual to learn more about coroutines and awaitables.
