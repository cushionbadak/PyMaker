This question already has an answer here:Understanding python's lstrip method on strings                    3 answers                I am searching for an easier way to remove the '-' in front of each string in a list. (only the first '-' if there is one in front of the string)I thing this can be written much easier...Thanks for your help ;)
str.lstrip('-') should do:S.lstrip([chars]) -> strReturn a copy of the string S with leading whitespace removed.  If chars is given and not None, remove characters in chars instead.
You may use str.lstrip() with list comprehension to achieve this as:where new_list will hold value:
Just adding an alternative approach, using list slicing and list comprehension;
