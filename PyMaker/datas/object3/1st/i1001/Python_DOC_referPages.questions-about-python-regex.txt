Why the following pattern string results in a match of "A cat", instead of "a hat" since match is greedy by default?Could someone shed some light on them?
From official document:If zero or more characters at the beginning of string match the regular expression pattern, return a corresponding match object. Return None if the string does not match the pattern; note that this is different from a zero-length match.
From the official Python documentation on regexesre.match() checks for a match only at the beginning of the string
As others have alluded, re.match starts from the beginning of the string-to-match and only checks for what is necessary. Notice match='A cat' at the end of the object's string representation denotes what was matched: r'(\w+) (\w+)' of "A cat jumpped over a hat".If you were to add a $ to the end of your pattern, indicating the string-to-match should end there, it will not result in a match. And if you were to take that same pattern and shorten it to only two words, it would match once again:
