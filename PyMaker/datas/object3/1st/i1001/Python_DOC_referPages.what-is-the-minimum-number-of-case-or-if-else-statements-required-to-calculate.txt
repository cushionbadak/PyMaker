Consider a right-angle triangle, which has the propertiesHypotenuse (side)Adjacent (side)Opposite (side)AreaGiven any 2 of these properties, it is always possible to calculate the value of the other 2. My question relates to what the most efficient/elegant way of doing this is.At present, the only way of doing this that I can think of is to use (4C2)*2 = 12 case statements, each relating to a possible combination of inputsa that may be provided.For example, using python you might have something like...and so on...You could then create your triangle object, and print its four properties, using code (in this case python) like the below.This is hideous. Is there a more eligant solution to this problem?
Yes, at least two - one using args and one using key word args. So:This would work with your current input, but let's agree - it's still not very elegant solution. So, let's use kwargs:And now you can simply call this code as:t1 = RightAngleTriangle(adjacent=10, opposite=12)
