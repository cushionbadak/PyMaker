what i'm finding hard is that you can't nest "i for i in [list]" inside Boolean logic checks, and not wanting to list all 26 characters
You can use "aabc".count('a') to give you the amount of times a appears in aabc, for example. In this example, it gives 2.Building on from this, you could implement some simple code to check how many times every letter of the alphabet occurs like so:Which produces the output:NB: you don't have to list all 26 characters in the alphabet because string.ascii_lowercase has that for you. Note there is also string.ascii_uppercase and so on. More information: https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.htmlFor more information about str.count(sub[, start[, end]]): https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.countAlso collections.Counter can create a dictionary for all the letters in the string. Using this, you could rewrite the above code like so:Output:Edit NB:can also be written as:using the newer str.format interface.

using defualtdict you can do this way .output:
You can get the each available characters count in a given string using below codeYou can find the live demo here
