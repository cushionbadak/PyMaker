I am expecting the list to be sorted and then duplicates will be spaced by increments of 0.1. Why is my code below not working? Here is what I am expecting to get versus what my program is returning:Expected Output: [11, 15, 15.1, 20, 20.1, 20.2, 20.3, 20.4, 30,  30.1, 40, 40.1, 50, 50.1]Actual output:[11, 15, 15.1, 20, 20.1, 20.1, 20.1, 20.1, 30, 30.1, 40,  40.1, 50, 50.1]Python Code:
here is the solution according to your code.your code is right what you were lacking was the case when my_list[i]+0.1*ivalue is already present. ie in example when 20 is there you increase it to 20.1 (happening) but you miss that but when 20.1 is there . you just checkingonly for 20 not for 20.1 . that is why 20.1 is coming in your solution not 20.2.
You could use itertools.groupby to group equal consecutive elements:Output
I can propose simple fix to the original code:
The problem is you are only incrementing it once. You are not keeping a count of how many times a number has appeared before. What you need is some kind of frequency dictionary that will store how many times this number has appeared. Using that frequency f you add f-1 increments to the number.
Try this improved code:
Using defaultdict:Output:If you need the original values to still be integers, comment below and I'll change that.
Another (more advanced) option is to write a cusom generator:IMO, this is not the easiest solution. I'm sharing it anyways because it might help others understand generators, especially yield from.
