Here is my current code:My issue is, I'm practicing List Comprehension but am confused as to why "count += 1" does not work in this type of format:I am, however, able to do it in a normal for loop as I did below. Can someone explain how I can accomplish the function below with a list comprehension?(The above lines of code with the list comprehension format are not necessarily related to accum(s).)
Comprehensions take an expression as its first element; count += 1 is a statement.Instead, use enumerate, which takes a generator producing x and returns a generator producing (i, x) where i is the index:
use enumerate for this type of thingas a list comprehension
if you want to maintain count in python list comprehension, use enumeratecheck this answersand try this code"-".join((elem.upper() + elem.lower() * i) for ii, elem in enumerate(li))
