I'm trying to determine how to use re.sub to replace the content of a capture group, but unfortunately, my brain is too small to understand the API documentation for the re.sub function.So far I've managed to successfully isolate the string that I would like to replace using the re.search function, but the process of using the re.sub function's API properly escapes the past, present, and future capabilities of my fatally, and tragically flawed brain.I'm able to select the string that I would like to replace using the re.search module:However, once I attempt to replace null withhello, my naïveté becomes readily apparent.This results in the following:I have tried other approaches, but, none of them have worked - the proper usage of re.sub is painfully obvious, but, after reviewing dozens of examples, my brain simply doesn't have the processing power available to understand this.One such approach was as follows, but, this is laughably incorrect, and I know that I should be embarrassed by my "attempt".Another approach was as follows, but it's also laughably incorrect.This resulted in the following:The result is technically correct, but, it wouldn't tolerate spaces in the wrong place.Any how I can replace null with hello?
When using group(1) you extract the group you're interested in, but when using sub, the match is fully replaced by the replacement. And since the start & end of expression is used to match the context, when subbing, the whole match is replaced by hello; not just the group you're interested in.One way is to create 3 groups, and on match replace the groups by original groups \1 and \3 and change the central one by hello, like this:prints:
