I've been struggling with JSON transformation using Python. I have JSON in the below format: But instead of having duplicated parents, I would like to merge children together to get that:
Take a look at the itertools groupby function. Here's an example with your data grouped by Parent.Here I've placed your example dicts inside a list and group by the Parent entry in each dict. This is all wrapped up inside a dict comprehension to give a meaningful output.
You can also use a collections.defaultdict() to do this, which can be serialized at the end:Which gives a JSON array of JSON objects:You can also group into the data by parent key using a nested defaultdict():Which gives this new structure:And will allow easy O(1) lookups for the parent.
