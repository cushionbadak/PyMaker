This question already has an answer here:Is there a short-hand for nth root of x in Python                    7 answers                How to find integer nth roots?                    11 answers                I'm trying to make a calculator in python, so when you type x (root) y it will give you the x root of y, e.g. 4 (root) 625 = 5. I'm aware of how to do math.sqrt() but is there a way to do other roots?
Use pow:OutputFor your example in particular:OutputSee more about exponentiation with rational exponents, here. Note that in Python 2, as mentioned by @Jean-Fran√ßoisFabre, you  need to specify the exponent to 1.0/n.
If you want to 625^(1/4){which is the same as 4th root of 625}then you type 625**(1/4)** is the operator for exponents in python.print(625**(1/4))Output:5.0To generalize:if you want to find the xth root of y, you do:y**(1/x)
