Writing a cli function that should do the following:In case, the function parameters are not set (I get them from docopt),I would like to look them up from environment.The following does not work due to fast loading in functions:What would be the pythonic way to achieve this?
You can do this easily with keyword arguments:If you want to keep the signature, you can create a decorator (functools.wraps takes care of aligning the signatures):However, this forces you to name all parameters when calling the decorated my_function (i.e. a=.., b=.., c=..). To avoid this, you could use inspect.signature to bind the parameters in the wrapper; this would allow you to get the name and value of all parameters, both *arg and **kwarg.
