IssueI would like to install with pip3 a python module from github into a local folder named local_lib/ and then use it in a script, without any virtualenv.ContextHere is my folder structure :Here is the command line i use to install the path.py package from github into the local_lib/ folder :Here is the content of the local_lib/ folder after the command line :Here is the content of my_script.py :But when i execute the script with python3 my_script.py, i get the following error of import :Traceback (most recent call last):   File "my_program.py", line 4, in module   from local_lib.path import Path   ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'local_lib.path' Should i change the way i import the package into my_scipt.py or should i change the command line to install the package ?
You have to tell Python that it has to look in local_lib for modules. E.g. by adding it to sys.path in your script (before importing from it) or by adding it to your PYTHONPATH environment variable.
For this, you can just download the path.py file into your local_lib folder and your path.py use case should work. You don't need install it with pip3.Should you want path.py to be available for scripts in any folder on the machine, using the same syntax, use the solution from Roland Smith or install it the generic way with pip install path.py.
