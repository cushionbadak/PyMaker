This question already has an answer here:Merging dictionary value lists in python                    3 answers                I have the following two toy dictsand I would like get a unique dictionary where I stack the second dictionary values after the first ones, within the same square brackets.I tried the following codebut the output I obtain has two lists within a list for each key, i.e.whereas I would like to obtainHow can I do that with a line or two of code?
You almost had it, instead use + to append both lists:
if not all the keys from d2 are in d1, then the simplest thing is using set union and dict.get:
You could use extended iterable unpacking:Output
The code will work irrespective of whether d1 or d2 have the same set of keys. I have added a key 'e' in d1 and 'd' in d2.
You can use itertools.chain to efficiently construct a single list from input lists:For the more general case covering an arbitrary number of dictionaries and keys which are not equal across dictionaries, see Merging dictionary value lists in python.
