I am trying to convert a string with "2019-01-06T01:00:24.908821" to a date using the "datetime.strptime" function. However, I am not able to find the format for this conversion to be successful.I'm using the entries as proposed by the library itself, however I'm getting a "ValueError" when I try to perform the conversion.If you would like to read the proposed standards, you can find here:https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#strftime-and-strptime-behaviorMy code:
You have a colon (:) instead of a decimal (.) before the %f in your format string.ChangeTo
