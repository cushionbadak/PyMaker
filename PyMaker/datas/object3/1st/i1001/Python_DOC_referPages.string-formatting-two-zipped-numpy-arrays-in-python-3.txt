I would like to use pythons format function to print subsequent numbers of a numpy array.I have got two numpy arrays, let's say:Now I would like to print this:I can almost achieve this by:but it yields:Of course I could useand so on but this requires to know the length of the array.Note:This line of code does what I want but this does use the old formatting style and I would like to know if it's possible with the new one, too. It also looks a little bit funky, I think :-D
You can use itertools.chain to interleave the elements from both lists:And if you want to print all elements joined as you specify you can do:
Do the following:Output
what about some numpyoutput
You can use zip() to iterate through two iterables at the same time.Output:
Since you use numpy, what about
It's also possible with itertools.starmap:Normally, the method given by @yatu with itertools.chain is the way to go, especially if you want all elements to be separated by spaces. But starmap could come handy when you'd want to have some special formatting between the pairs, for example:
Throwing another into the mix
