Natural Text
I'm trying to create a Text object with multiple strings using the Zelle Graphics library, but it seems to accept only a single string argument. This is how I set it up:This is the desired output (as displayed in the graphics window):"You have x remaining"
You neglected to explain that you are using the graphics module by John Zelle. I know that is in the tag, but it is better to be a little bit more explicit. Even experts cannot be expected to know automatically about every library out there.The Text class in that module has a constructor with the following signature:meaning you have to pass it a Point object and exactly one string. That means you can't do this:but you can do in Python 3.7 or in earlier versions.
From what I understand from your question you would like something like this:You can think of %s as a place holder, and you asign its value after the % outside of the string.Another way of doing it would be like this:This would print the same thing.
String formatting is what you are referring to..format should be good Documentation
