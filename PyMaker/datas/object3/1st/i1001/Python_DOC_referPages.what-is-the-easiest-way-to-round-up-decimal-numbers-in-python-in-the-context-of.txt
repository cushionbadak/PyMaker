I have a difficult time dealing with floating point numbers, and I find even the built-in decimal class in Python to be pretty confusing at times. As a solution, I wrote a method myself, which simply takes in a value, and a number of digits which should be shown after the floating point, and returns a string in a nice format. It looks like this:Pretty self-explanatory. It accounts for zeroes as well, just to make the output look nice. However, one thing I completely forgot about was rounding up the numbers. For example, format_to_decimal_string(19.2189, 3) returns '19.218', when I would like it to return '19.219'. With such a huge method, I feel like there is no easy way to add a fix to this? Should I try re-writing a new method with another angle of solution with the rounding up, or can it be incorporated into this existing method? Thanks.
If you want to use the decimal module for this, you can do:The quantize method will round decimals to the number of decimal places in its argument (so you could pass .001 instead of raising the decimal to -3).
Using round()You can use round() to accomplish this. If you want to cast this number as a string:Using format()You can also use format() to accomplish this:
