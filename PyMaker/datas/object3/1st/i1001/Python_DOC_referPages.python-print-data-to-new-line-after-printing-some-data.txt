You can dooutputEDIT - expand the answer in case of unequal length:Use itertools.zip_longest()outputThe default fillvalue is None - you can keep it if you prefer
Expanding on one of the answers and using your simple list (bob, sob, cob, dab), you can use a modulo based on index position in the single-dimension list, then append '\n' to create a new line with proper spacing:Output:
https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print If what I think you're trying to do is just get a statement to print on a new line, the end= parameter must be added into the print statement. It's not required, but it is useful.If you want to print multiple names on the same line, you can use the separator parameter sep="," to add a comma after each name. The end parameter goes after it to ensure skipping to the next line.
