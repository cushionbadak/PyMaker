Natural Text
I'm not sure if my json file is unique but I couldn't find any other question/answers that worked.My JSON file looks like:Is there a way for python to delete an entire line from the file?This is what I've done so far:If the timestamp is 1234, I want it to delete the entire object so the file will just look like this:Thanks!
Combining both jonrsharpe's and ajon's suggestions, instead of deleting it while reading, read it into memory and then write it back.You might however have an easier time to read the jsons first and then eliminate the lines with matched elements, instead of manipulating the text directly:This method gives you more conditional flexibility over multiple keys/values if necessary as opposed to looking specifically for "TimeStamp": "1234" within the line.
As suggested by @jonrsharpe, you can read in the file.  Do whatever manipulations you want.  Then rewrite the file.Here is an example:test.out:Python code:test.out after:
Reading the whole file into memory may lead to troubles with large files. You may want to write to a temporary file and then overwrite the old file with the new file. There is a build in python library for that: https://docs.python.org/3/library/tempfile.htmlIf you are sure, your file is not large, you do not need read_line you can directly use json.load().
