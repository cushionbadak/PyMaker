It's not hard to do outside of numpy:There is also the np.core.defchararray module which has "goodies" for working with character arrays -- However, it states that these are merely wrappers around the python builtin and standard library functions so you'll probably not get any real speedup by using them.
You had the right ideas there. Here's a vectorized NumPythonic implementation trying to go along those ideas -Or a one-liner with np.column_stack -Sample run -
One way would be to use str.join() and list comprehension , example -If you really need the \n at the end, you can concatenate it after joining th strings. Example -
