I have MAC address that I want to send to dpkt as raw data. dpkt package expect me to pass the data as hex stings.So, assuming I have the following mac address:    '00:de:34:ef:2e:f4', written as:    '00de34ef2ef4' and I want to encode in to something like    '\x00\xdeU\xef.\xf4' and the backward translation will provide the original data.On Python 2, I found couple of ways to do that using    encode('hex') and decode('hex').However this solution isn't working for Python 3. I'm haveng some trouble finding a code-snippet to support that on both versions.I'd appriciate help on this.Thanks
binascii module works on both Python 2 and 3:
On python3 encoding between arbitrary codecs must be done using the codecs module:This will only work with bytes, not with str (unicode) objects. It will also work in python2.7, where str is bytes and the b-prefix does nothing.
