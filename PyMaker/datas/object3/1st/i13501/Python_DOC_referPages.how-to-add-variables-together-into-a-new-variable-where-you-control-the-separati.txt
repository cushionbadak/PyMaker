Natural Text
Let's say i've declared three variables which are a date, how can I combine them into a new variable where i can print them in the correct 1/2/03 format by simply printing the new variable name. I know i could set the sep='/' argument in the print statement if i call all three variables individually, but this means i can't add addition text into the print statement without it also being separated by a /. therefore i need a single variable i can call.
The .join() method does what you want (assuming the input is strings):As does all of Python's formatting options, e.g.:But date formatting (and working with dates in general) is tricky, and there are existing tools to do it "right", namely the datetime module, see date.strftime().Note the - before the m and the d to suppress leading zeros on the month and date.
You can use the join method. You can also use a list comprehension to format the strings so they are each 2 digits wide.
You want to read about the str.format() method:https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.formatOr if you're using Python 2:https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#str.formatThe join() function will also work in this case, but learning about str.format() will be more useful to you in the long run.
The correct answer is: use the datetime module:Trying to handle dates as tuples is just a PITA, so don't waste your time.
