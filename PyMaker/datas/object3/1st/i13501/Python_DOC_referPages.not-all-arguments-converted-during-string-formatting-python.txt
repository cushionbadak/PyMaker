Natural Text
I am writing a script which prints the list items that are divisable by 3 XOR the last character ==4 but I get an error stating: TypeError: not all arguments converted during string formatting I am new to Python and may have missed something obvious. Code below:
First of all you need to change 4 to '4' because your items are string and convert the j to int in j%3 also you need to parenthesis your comparison expression because the precedence of ^ is higher than == and it will raise a TypeError also if you want to preserve your result you can use a list comprehension : If you just want to print the result you can use a usual loop with print function.
