I am trying to write a program that reads an integer and displays, using asterisks, a filled diamond of the given side length. For Example, if the side length is 4, the program should displayHere is what I am trying to do. It is executing, but I can't seem to get the spaces right for the program to show the diamond shape properly....Thank you!
How about the following:Giving:So how does it work?First we need a counter that counts up to side and then back down again. There is nothing stopping you from appending two range lists together so:This gives you a list [0, 1, 2, 1, 0]From here we need to work out the correct number of spaces and asterisks needed for each line:So two formulas are needed, e.g. for side=3:Using Python's string formatting, it is possible to specify both a fill character and padding width. This avoids having to use string concatenation.If you are using Python 3.6 or later, you can make use of f string notation:
This might work better for you:Output for userInput = 6:
Thanks Guys, I was able to formulate/correct my code based on the help I received. Thanks for all your input and helping the SO community!
This worked for me for any positive width, But there are spaces padding the *s
How about this:The output:This is similar to some of the answers above, but I find the syntax to be more simple and readable.
