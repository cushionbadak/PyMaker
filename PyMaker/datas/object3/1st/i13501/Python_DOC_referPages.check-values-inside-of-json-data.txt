Could you please help me? I have response with json data and would like to check not only the structure of the json but also some values inside. json data is represented by build-in python types (dict, list, str, ...). Could you please advise easy way to check data inside some arbitrary json in python?For example let's take following json:I would like to check that responses have 3 elements in employees lists with specific values in firstName and lastName.I understand that if I have json as a python dict I can check any value inside just by doing:Maybe in this simple case it is not big deal. But in my case I have responses with complex structures where interesting (to me) data are deep inside in different places. It is hard to write something like data['a']['b'][0]['c'][1] for each value which should be checked...is there a better way to check data inside complex json?
If you would like to check that you have 3 elements in employees list with specific firstName you could use check_json_data function from here https://github.com/mlyundin/check-json-data
