i a currently building a calculator in Tkinter. I've been searching a few youtube videos to define a few functions and i came across this:I understand that it is creating a new variable called result that holds the contents of string.get(), but i am unsure what 'Eval' does?Help would be appreciated
This takes the string as an expression and determines its value.  For instance, the string "3 + 5" would return 8.
