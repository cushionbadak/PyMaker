If I have a set of integers which denote the values that a list element can take and a python list of a given length. I want to fill the list with all possible combinations. examplelist length=3 and the my_set ={1,-1}Possible combinationsI tried approaching with random.sample method from random classbut it doesn't help. I did: 
That's what itertools.product is for :And if you want the result as list you can use map to convert the iterator of tuples to list if list (in python3 it returns an iterator which as a more efficient way you can use a list comprehension ):In python3 :
Use the itertools.product() function:The list() call is optional; if tuples instead of lists are fine to, then result = list(product(my_set, repeat=length)) suffices.Demo:random.sample() gives you a random subset of the given input sequence; it doesn't produce all possible combinations of values.
If the list length is 1, the result is a list whose elements equal to the set. Every time the list length increases one, the result can be gotten by append each element of the set to the resulted list.
