I'm writing a test suite in py.test for a class that uses ftplib and such for FTP things.  I need to disrupt the connection I'm using to simulate network problems and cover an exception. Please note, for this project I was required to use a real FTP server instead of mocks, so mocks won't help (I think).Is there a simple way I can interrupt the port / socket to simulate problems?Thanks for your time
The FTP class has the sock field.If you call the .close method on it, you terminate the FTP session control connection.
