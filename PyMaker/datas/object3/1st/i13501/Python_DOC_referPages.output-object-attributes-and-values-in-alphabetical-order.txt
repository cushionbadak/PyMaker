I need to generate an export (csv) of a series of simple objects like this:What is the simplest way to list the attribute/value pairs in order by attribute? __dict__ changes order every time.
You could use vars() on self, then sort the items:This then gives you a sorted list of (attributename, value) pairs.However, if your class is little more than a container for 4 related datapoints, then consider using a namedtuple class:This lists the attributes in named order, always:Because the instances are sequences (a subclass of tuple in fact) you can pass these directly to a csv.writer().writerow() call; at the same time you can use instance.bank or instance.file_name to access the fields.Another alternative is to use dictionaries, and use csv.DictWriter() to handle the order (the fieldnames argument determines the order).
