Ive got some lazy trouble about pythons strings.I have a project with python 2.x and all strings we have there are 'blabla'.Now we want to move this strings to unicode without taking extra libraries like  __future__ or moving to python 3 or using sys.setdefaultencoding.And i have to click this all through project to change '' to u''. But not all strings i need to change, for example fields of object i do not want to change:obj = {'field': field} A question: is there a way to make it automatic? And i have stacked with a next problem my regex [^u]([\'][^\'\"]*[\']) catches '   ' '   ' middle section which are not a string. For now i have next replacements: (\'.*\') --> u$1
is there a way to make it automatic?If you mean -- is there a program that may decide what type of string (Unicode (u''), bytestring (b''), or native ('')) should be used in a specific place in an arbitrary program -- then no: there is no such program -- you should inspect each and every case very carefully. See Text versus binary data.
