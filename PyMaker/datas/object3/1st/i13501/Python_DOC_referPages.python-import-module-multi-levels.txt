I'm using Flask framework and would like to test a single class (not Flask app, and I've read the test documentation here)My folder structure is like below picture, and init.py for each folder.But I tried all below but none of them works.ororCould anyone please give me some hints on how to includereporting/dashboard/helpers/grouper.pyin my test module located at reporting/tests/helpers/helper-test.py?Thanks a lot.
I've identified the cause. It's because the __init__.py under folder "reporting" is not empty, but doing some initiation operations for Flask app. When I made this "__init__.py" a empty file, the import was successful usingAlso, python-2.6 may not recognize "from xxx import yyyClass", but only "import xxxModule"reference reading: The import system
