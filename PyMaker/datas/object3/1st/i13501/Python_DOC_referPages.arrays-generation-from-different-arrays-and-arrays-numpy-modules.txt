I want to build an array which will contain arrays of increasing sizes based on the current values of array.for example with  andwith n=current_array (thus limit_array=[10,3]  I want my output_array to be:     [[1,...,10],[1,2,3]]I wanted to avoid for loops; so I wanted to use arange like that:  I understand this is not possible to do that since first two arguments for arange are floats only, but then how would you do that?subsidiary questions:  1) I am not sure numpy can handle arrays of different sizes. If it is not, I can do this with a array array of arrays (https://docs.python.org/3/library/array.html). But I have to do an array multiplication of this array of array.So will this be slower than array.arrays processed together? Or should I definitely find another solution?2) As I said, I have a third np.array [1,2,3] I have to multiply the previous one with.Will I obtain something like[[[1,...,10]*1,[1,2,3]],[[1,...,10]*2,[2,4,6]],[[1,...,10]*3,[3,6,9]]] ?Edit:I also came up with  but not sure it can work
I do not think you can avoid for loops as such, but you can use list comprehension and np.arange() , which should be a bit faster than normal for loops. Example -Demo -You can use list comprehension for your second usecase as well -
