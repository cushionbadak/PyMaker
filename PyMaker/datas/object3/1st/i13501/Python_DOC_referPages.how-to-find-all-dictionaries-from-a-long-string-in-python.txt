I am trying to retrieve all JSON like dictionaries from a long string. For example, I want to get {"uri": "something"} and {"link": "www.aurl.com"} as result. Is there a way to do this through regex in python?
Probably the "nicest" way to do this is to let a real JSON decoder do the work, not using horrible regexes. Find all open braces as "possible object start points", then try to parse them with JSONDecoder's raw_decode method (which returns the object parsed and number of characters consumed on success making it possible to skip successfully parsed objects efficiently). For example:This is a generator function, so you can either iterate the objects one by one e.g. for obj in get_all_json(mystr): or if you need them all at once for indexing, iterating multiple times or the like, all_objs = list(get_all_json(mystr)).
