I've spent hours googling this, but haven't been able to find any answers.  I'm trying to install a package for Python 3.4, but keep running into problems.  First, I tried just running "python setup.py install":After a long time of searching, I downloaded mingw, added C:/MinGW/bin to my path, made sure MinGW has gcc, and made my distutils.cfg file with [build] and compiler = mingw32 in it.  On running python setup.py install again, I got the same error.I tried what it suggested, passing -c mingw32 to setup.py.  It can't do it for setup.py install, so I did setup.py build:That all seems well and good, but when I try to install after building it tries to build it all over again, and because I can't pass in the compiler for some reason it fails.How can I get setup.py to work?  If it helps, I'm trying to install the noise package, and am using Windows Vista 64-bit (I don't have much money...).
I had similar issues recently.Some tips for Windows builds:Check your Python binary at a Windows command prompt: where.exe python.exeDid you forget to activate a virtualenv?Check your env vars: %PYTHONPATH% and %PYTHONHOME%Ref: https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#environment-variablesClean-up a previous build: python setup.py clean --allIf you forget the --all, it is useless for most use cases.  (More like a dusting.)View setup.py online help.For setup.py: python setup.py --helpFor build command:  python setup.py build --helpFor install command:  python setup.py install --helpFor clean command:  python setup.py clean --helpOrder of operations should be: clean (optional), build, installClean: python setup.py clean --allBuild: python setup.py build (Optional argument: -c mingw32)Install: python setup.py install --record files.txtThe optional arguments --record files.txt help to uninstall if you broken something.After install, check the folder Libs\site-packages for the Python installation.  Do you see the package?  Usually, you can see *.pyd files, which are similar to DLLs.Never underestimate the complexity of build and run environments.  (I often make this mistake.)  It is easy to have a single, errant environment variable break a build or run.Open a new command prompt before the build.Open a new command prompt for the test run after install.
