I am using Python to implement the following equation:S[n+1] = (k * S[n]) MOD m The values of the variables are: S[0] = 1111  k = 16807 m = 2147483647 I have calculate 10000 values (so S[0] to  S[9999]).I am using lists to calculate and append the values.This is what I am doing:While the code works perfectly for smaller values of k and m, I am getting incorrect results S[2] onwards.I manually calculated S[2]=1417880224, however my code is generating S[2] = 297389177.Is this happening because the numbers I am trying to append in the list is going beyond a certain range? Do I need to type cast to a different data type (like double)?Where am I going wrong?
Let's do it by hand using your definitions with a calculator:These are the same results your code produces.So, it seems like either your hand calculations or the recursive formula you are providing is wrong.
