Natural Text
I've got this bit of code for class I'm in but I can't figure out why I'm returning NaN.I've never used the math module before.Here is the code:
You pass low = 0 and high = 99 so the equation is lower than zero: 0 - 99 + 1 = -98.The logarithm of negative numbers is in the complex number plane, which is not supported by the math module (it deals with real numbers only).So what you get is a value error:If you wanted to work with complex numbers, you could use the cmath module:But I doubt that is really what youâ€™re going for here ;)
