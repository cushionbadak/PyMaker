I have a quicksort program here, but there seems to be a problem with the result. I think there must have been some issue in the areas highlighted below when referencing some values. Any suggestions?
Please check this. I think you find your answer.
You seem to be assuming that the values equal to the pivot element are already consecutive. This assumption is probably wrong for your current implementation. Test it e.g. by outputting the full list before recursing.To make the assumption true, partition into three instead of just two groups, as described at Wikipedia.
