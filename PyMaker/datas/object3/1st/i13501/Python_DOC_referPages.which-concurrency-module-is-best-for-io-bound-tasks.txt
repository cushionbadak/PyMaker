I need to make many DNS requests. I'm looking at the Python concurrency library, which says in the introduction:https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/concurrency.htmlThe appropriate choice of tool will depend on the task to be executed (CPU bound vs IO bound) and preferred style of development (event driven cooperative multitasking vs preemptive multitasking).My task is IO bound, but the docs don't advise which module to use.Which module is best for IO bound tasks (e.g., DNS requests)?
If you're not bound by CPU, i'd recommend giving a shot to the standard library asyncio module for I/O bound operations.https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.htmlhere's a third party module for asynchronous dns requests that relies on asyncio:https://github.com/saghul/aiodnsCheers!
