I have a long list of integers:I want to calculate the averages of first i numbers, for all i in 0<i<n.I can basically do:which gives me the correct results, but I think there should be a faster way of doing this since I can use the previous sums in the following calculations.I guess there should be a faster solution with numpy, maybe?
How about using numpy.cumsum
You can simply create a generator function that would also allow lazy evaluation or generation of the list in one go by casting the result into a list, and use the enumerate generator to generate the count of the current element over time.You don't always have to rely on numpy for simple things like this.
If you're using Python 3.2 or higher, see itertools.accumulate (and itertools.islice if you're trying to get a running average for a subset of the inputs). For example, in your case (getting the running average for n - 1 values in the input):
