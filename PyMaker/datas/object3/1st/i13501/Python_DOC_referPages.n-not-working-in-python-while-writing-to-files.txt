Natural Text
I wrote python code to write to a file like this:The list1 is of type (char,int)The problem here is that when I execute this, file doesn't get separated by "\n" as expected. Any idea what is the problem here ? I think it is because of the Any help is appreciated. Thanks in advance.(I am using Python 3.4 with "Python Tools for Visual Studio" version 2.2)
If you are on windows the \n doesn't terminate a line.Honestly, I'm surprised you are having a problem, by default any file opened in text mode would automatically convert the \n to os.linesep. I have no idea what codecs.open() is but it must be opening the file in binary mode.Given that is the case you need to explicitly add os.linesep:Obviously you have to import os somewhere.
Figured it out, from here:How would I specify a new line in Python?I had to use "\r\n" as in Windows, "\r\n" will work.
Per codecs.open's documentation, codecs.open opens the underlying file in binary mode, without line ending conversion. Frankly, codecs.open is semi-deprecated; in Python 2.7 and onwards, io.open (which is the same thing as the builtin open function in Python 3.x) handles 99% of the cases people used to use codecs.open, but better (faster, and without stupid issues like line endings). If you're reliably running on Python 3, just use plain open; if you need to run on Python 2.7 as well, import io and use io.open.
If you are on windows, try '\r\n'. Or open it with an editor that recognizes unix style new lines.
