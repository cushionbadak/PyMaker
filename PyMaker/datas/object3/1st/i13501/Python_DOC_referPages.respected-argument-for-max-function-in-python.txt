I have this code:Where I'm getting the radius of the farthest point in list relative to the smallest_circle.centre. But actually I need to get the point itself. How can I do that in the most pythonic way?
The max function allows you to provide a custom ordering function (via the key argument):And please don't use semicolons. And you shouldn't use names of built-in types/functions as variable names.
