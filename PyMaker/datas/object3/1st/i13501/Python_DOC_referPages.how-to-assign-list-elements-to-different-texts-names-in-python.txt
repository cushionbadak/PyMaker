Natural Text
I am trying to solve this issue.I have a list like that:and i want 3 different text files like "hey.txt","man.txt","sup.txt".I used;but is there a way to do it like that?;
you are almost thereInstead of this Do this:The actual problem is 'g[x].txt' it is a string and it's value does not change during each iteration where as to get g elements we use g[x] which return a string which then can be appended with '.txt' to form the file name You could use context manager to open the file objecti.e)If you want both index and value then you could use enumerator i.e.)
Use string formatting:
