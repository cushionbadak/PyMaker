What is the pythonic way to set a maximum length paramter?Let's say I want to restrict a list of strings to a certain maximum size:And I want to functionalize it and allow different maxlen but if no maxlen is given, it should return the full list:And I want to set the maxlen to the max length of element in alist, so I tried but I am torn between using None, 0 or -1.If I use None, it would be hard to cast the type later on:And I might get this as the function builds on:If I use -1, it sort of resolve the int(maxlen) issues but it's also sort of weird since length should never be negative. If I use 0, I face the problem when I really need to return an empty list and set maxlen=0 but then again, if I really need an empty list then I don't even need a function to create one.(Note: the ultimate task is NOT to filter a list, i.e. (filter(lambda k: len(k) <= maxlen, lst)) but it's an example to ask about the pythonic way to set an integer variable that sets a maximum)
Let's say I want to restrict a list of strings to a certain maximum  size:And I want to functionalize it and allow different maxlen but if no  maxlen is given, it should return the full list:And I want to set the maxlen to the max length of element in alistTo address all these requests, the best answer I can think of is something like this...edit:If it is important to handle negative maximum length (who knows why) or 0 length, then a function like this can be used. (Though I am against duck-typing)
How about the following approach, this avoids the need to use max:Giving you the output:
What about some tricks?.. Operator or returns first value, if both values are True. And, if first value is False and second is True, or returns second value.I think it's just what you need. :-)Ough... I forget about -1 and None. Result will be the same:
As you said: "I want to allow different maxlens but if no maxlen is given, it should return the full list".An approach would be a definition of a maxFilter() function which uses Pythons default argument values:Examples, using x = ['foo', 'bar', 'a', 'rushmoreorless', 'kilimangogo']:Note: In my opinion it would be better to ask about a way to set an optional length parameter to list elments .
