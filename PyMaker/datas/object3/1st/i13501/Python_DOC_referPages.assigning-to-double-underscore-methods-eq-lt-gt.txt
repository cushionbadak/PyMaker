In this example, I am trying to assign new __eq__, __lt__ and __gt__ methods and invoke them by comparing the object to the literal 3. Why is bar(...) never called?In this answer I found the hint you can't assign new __eq__ to the object. I can't find any official source for this statement though. Any hints and help is appreciated!Edit: I am aware that there is the option of defining __eq__ in the object itself, but this questions is specifically about assigning it after instance creation.
Special Method Lookup:implicit invocations of special methods are only guaranteed to work correctly if defined on an object’s type, not in the object’s instance dictionary.If the goal is to use bar for comparisons, assign it at the class level, not per instance (which will also save memory by not bloating the per instance attribute dictionary):
