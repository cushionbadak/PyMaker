I have three lists:How do I make a nested list where column1 = EX_Num, column2 = Height_str and column3 = total_carbon?
It's not clear what you are asking... but if you just want a list of lists, just append them.If you want all the values put into one list, just concatenate them.If you need something different, you need to make your question more clear.]EDIT based on comment:If you know that all the lists are the same length:
You can use the built-in zip function to join multiple iterables together into tuples:Note: please don't use "hungarian notation" for your variable names (_num, _str, etc.) -- they're just clutter, specially in a dynamic language like Python.If you need to keep related data grouped together, it's more readable to create a simple container type for it. namedtuple is great for this:Now you can refer to stuff by name -- for example, my_things[0].height -- instead of needing to remember the index positions of each attribute.
