I have written a for loop which gives me all the values of a specific letters place in the alphabet.For example the word hello will give me the numbers 8, 5, 12, 12 and 14. Now I want to add them to another word which is the same length for e.g abcde, which would be 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. Now I want to add the two numbers together but keeping the individual numbers for example 8+1, 5+2, 12+3, 12+4 and 14+5. This is the code I have so farWhen I try adding x and y, I get a single number. Can someone help? 
If you are planning to do further calculations with the numbers consider this solution which creates a list of tuples (also by using zip, as @Kashyap Maduri suggested):Each tuple in the sums list consists of both operands, their sum and a string representation of the addition.Then you could for example print them sorted by their sum:Editwhen i run the program i want it to give me the answer of those sums for e.g 14+5=19 i just want the 19 part any ideas? â€“  Shahzaib Shuz Bari This makes it a lot easier:And you get a list of all the sums.
You are looking for zip function. It zips 2 or more iterables together. For e.g. andSo here is a solution for your problem:
