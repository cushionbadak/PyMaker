Natural Text
I have text file which is made up with several sections. Sections always started with non-space. And sub-section always started with space. Based on input.txt, following is my expected result. in this example i am trying to search for “101” and if 101 appears either in section or subsection. i want to display section with subsection. i am trying to parse the section and store in dynamic variable. But i am not sure how to store section dynamically in a variable.Input.txtPython 3.0 code:Output:
I'd suggest something else which is IMHO more pythonic solution to the problem: Divide the file into sections and filter out unwanted content. The algorithm is something like this:Read the whole file (with read function) to a variable (let's say content). It will be a string variable. Refer: DocSplit the string with the appropriate regex (divided by no-white space starting lines) into sections including the subsections. Refer: How to use regex to split string. You'll have a list of strings.Use list comprehension to filter out unwanted content. You'll have a list. Example: HereConcatenate the list with new line character using join string function. Example: HereGood luck.ps. I can provide the code, but you may want to wrestle with it first :)
