I'm working on examples from book wrangling with Python.Trying to read data from a CSV file into a dictReader object named header_rdr.When I try list comprehension to read all dict values in a list, usingError message i get is: 'dict' object has no attribute 'decode'.How do I proceed without decoding the string before passing into a string.Also, without decoding the elements, I got the error as :UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xe2 in position 2807: ordinal not in range(128)
On iteration, a csv.DictReader yields dicts - hence its name.Each dict represents a CSV record in the style {<column_header>: <column_value>}.To decode the file's contens as UTF-32, you can specify the encoding as argument of open.
