I've recently constructed a piece of python code which finds the least commonly repeated number in a list! Here is my code...from collections import Counterleast_common()However as you can clearly see, this uses a list to call the numbers which will be compared. I'm now trying to get it to do the same task, but instead of using a built in list, I want it to use an argument of integers. For example LEAST COMMON BEING 2Is any of the code which I've already created reusable for what I now need to create? Apologies if this is a stupid question or comes across as really simple as I'm a little stuckAny advice is much appreciated!
Since you're using Counter, there's a builtin method - most_common - that returns a sorted list of elements and their counts, starting with the most common first. You can query the last element of this list.Your function would look something like this:If your data can have multiple integers with the same least count, and your function needs to return every one of them, you can iterate over most_common:
