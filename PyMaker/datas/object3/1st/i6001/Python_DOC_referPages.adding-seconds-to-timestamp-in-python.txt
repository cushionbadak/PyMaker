I have tons of timestamp strings like this one 2017-04-18 05:03:40.966084 and the script needs to add seconds to the timestamp. I have been trying to turn the string into a legit timestamp object and then add seconds to it with timedelta but for some reason it isn't working.This is what I have so far:Am I going at this the right way?
Yes timedelta is a good way to adjust a timestamp. However note that your duration variable is a string. As per the documentation it should be an integer or float:All arguments are optional and default to 0. Arguments may be integers or floats, and may be positive or negative.
