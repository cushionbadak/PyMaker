this code is used to convert hexadecimal to (decimal)i am not understanding how to only allow the program to continue if the the letters are up to f  
Open an interactive python shell (i.e. run 'python' in a terminal without arguments), and input "1" or "3" or "4" or "5" or "6" or "7" or "8" or "9" or "a" or "b" or "c" or "d" or "e" or "f".What do you see?Exactly. The expression a or b evaluates to a if a can be converted to True, and to b otherwise. Thus your if check reduces to if hexa == "1":You should have written the longer hexa == "1" or hexa == "3" or .... Or use the in keyword like hexa in ["1", "3", "4", "5", ...]. Or, since the righthand side is all single character strings, you can use hexa in "134567..." because a string is also iterable by character, and a character is a string itself.If you want to parse any hexadecimal number recognized by int(), you can simply catch the ValueError exception:
I guess you have coding with Python 3.x, I'm using Python 2.7, so my code as below show. it's work for me!
