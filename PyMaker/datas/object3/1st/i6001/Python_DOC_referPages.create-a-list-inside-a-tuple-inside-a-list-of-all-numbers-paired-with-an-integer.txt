a 'one liner' nested list comprehension, with a line break[*zip(*tpls)] is an idiom that 'transposes' the sub iterable  giving [(0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1), (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9)] so set([*zip(*tpls)][0]) is set((0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1)) which gives the unique items in the 1st position of the tuples in tpls: {0, 1}which the outer for k in ...  iterates over, providing k to the list comp inside the result tuple[tp[1] for tp in tpls if tp[0] == k]
