Assuming you have already imported your data, as defined in your MCWE:Then, you are looking for Pandas json_normalize method for data normalization:It returns a normalized DataFrame version where your column of json is expanded into eponymous typed columns:Now, you would pivot your DataFrame to convert Type modalities into columns:It leads to:Finally, you can clean and reset index, if they bother you:Which returns your requested MCVE output:Not columnIn this final DataFrame the first column seems to be called Type, but it is not. It is instead a Integer Index without Name:And Columns index is called Type which does not hold any modality called Type (therefore no column with this name).This is why you cannot remove the column Type (column used in pivot_table), because it does not exist.If you want to remove this fake column, you need to create a new index for rows:If Column index Name bothers you, you can reset it:It leads to:It is a good practice when you create a new index to always check it is unique:Data from fileIf your data are in a file, you should first import it into a variable using PSL json module:This will do the trick, then come back to the beginning of my answer.
