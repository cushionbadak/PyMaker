Natural Text
I want to create a GUI module that I can import in my main program without having to import tkinter there, letting just the module handle everything. Here's how I imagine that it might work:main.pygui.pyEdit: "Don't ask for opinion"How do I make this work?The above is what I don't want.
I used a workaround that seemed plausible to me:main.pygui.py
