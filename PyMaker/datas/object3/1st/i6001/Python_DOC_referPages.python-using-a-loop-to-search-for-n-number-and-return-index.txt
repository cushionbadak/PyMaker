I have been programming for a total of three weeks.  I am stuck on this problem right now: We will pass you 2 inputs:A list of numbersA number, N, to look forYour job is to loop through the list and find the number specified in the second input. Output the list element index where you find the number.If N is not found in the list, output -1.This is what I have so far: import and N were providedthis is also providedmycodeThis outputs the following for the random number inputs: Program Failed for Input: 1,3,11,42,12 2Expected Output: -1Your Program Output: -1-1-1-1-1This is not working and returns -1 for every number N that is not in the list numbers.  I have tried using a break statement before and after print, but that stops it from printing at all.  Any suggestions? 
Thank you for your comments and answers.  After messing around with it a bit, this is what ended up providing the proper output: My Code:Output:Program OutputInput: 1,3,11,42,12 42Your Output: 3Challenge FeedbackWell done!
run this with python program_name.py [,x,y,z,l,m,n,] N where x,y,z,l,m,n are the numbers in the list and N is the number you search ( note the [, and ,] )
