So, i am trying to write the values to each list from the loop...multiply hours by 20 and then write out to file "workers.txt".The file is created by the script, but no data is written to it. I'm at my wits end, which is fairly common.   
Creating empty lists in the with statement doesn't map them to the file. You still need to actually call filet.write.
The print function, by default, writes to sys.stdout. If you want it to write to the file you opened, you should use the file keyword argument.Also, note that context manager will close the file on exit - that's why all your file-related operations have to be within the with block.
