Natural Text
I would like to know how to add user input to this code so the user can choose the topic (there will be more topics added) and difficulty instead of it having to be called at the bottom. Any explanation is much appreciated as I am quite poor with user input.
For adding inputs into code use a format such as (Variable) = input("(Input text here)")I'll be able to give a better example later.
This is further explained here: https://www.python-course.eu/python3_input.php
