I am pretty new to Python and I am just doing a bunch of exercises.This is one of them, a simple DiceRoller.It works perfectly fine in ATOM, the issue arises when I try to run it in IDLE. I am unable to figure out why the issue happen. Pretty sure this is a noob question.The code:Errors whit IDLE after the program ask me if I want to roll again (input y or n):Errors whit IDLE after the program ask me if I want to roll again (input Y or N):Thank you for your patience!
That's because in the atom editor, you use python3 and your IDLE uses python2. In Python 2, the function for reading user's input was called raw_input(); it was renamed to input() in Python 3 (section starting with PEP 3111: raw_input() was renamed to input()).You can either ensure you are using python3 by default or make the code python2-compatible: add a code blockand replace all usages of ... = input(...) in your code with ... = compatible_input(...).
