I am trying to send a value over serial port. I am unsure how to convert it into the correct format. I tried bin() for binary and format() but it didn't work. The first write operation sends '1' as binary string. Now I want the variable to be send as binary string as well.
write() requires a bytes object.To convert an integer to bytes, call int.to_bytes().
Like this :Important point: Which number system used on device (8,16,32,64 bit) ?8 Bit = 1 Byte(0-255) 16Bit = 2 Byte(0-65535) 32Bit = 4 Byte(like upside)(0-4294967295) All ranges are UNSIGNED(look up), but float  got extra definition !You can't type binary 1 value with keyboard :binascii.unlexlify("%01X"%1) so equal to \x01 (of course you can use struct package)
write() method accepts a string parameter. You can convert result to string with str() builtin function like this.result = str(result)Python 2:Python 3:You have to encode string in bytes.
