My sample code is below: I want to know the execution flow. Can anyone help me to understand?
Old school debuggingMy FORTRAN teacher would be proud!It outputs:So here's the order:Start of the scriptclass Foo is definedclass Bar is definedone Foo is instantiatedthe Foo is printedFoo's Age is printedScript continuesone Bar is instantiatedthe Bar is printedBar's Name is printedScript finishesSpyder + pdbFor more complex scripts, it might be a good idea to use specialized tools. For example spyder with pdb.If you installed Python with Anaconda, you don't need to install anything else.Run your script with Debug > Debug (Ctrl + F5), press Ctrl + F10 multiple times to see the execution, press Ctrl + F11 if you want to step into a function or method.
