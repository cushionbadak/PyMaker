I am using ElementTree to parse XML files.I was using Python 3.6, but now I have to shift my code to a machine having only Python 2.6. I made some of the necessary changes in syntax, but I am stuck at ET.iter(), which does not exist in Python 2.6, and which I was using with no arguments to recursively parse an ElementTree object.I tried to change iter() to findall(), but that asks for a parameter specifying a match to filter elements by. I also tried simply doing… but that only returns the children at the first level under element, not all of its descendants (which is what I need).How can I recursively get all the elements in Python 2.6?
ET.iter() was introduced in Python 2.7, to replace ET.getiterator() … which, although deprecated since then, remains available up to and including the current Python 3.x release.In many cases, ET.getiterator() can be used as a drop-in replacement for ET.iter() if Python 2.6 compatibility is required.However: it's important to note that, although they're often interchangeable in practice, these methods are not the same: ET.iter() returns an iterator, while ET.getiterator() returns a list:… with all of the potential implications for performance and functionality that this difference implies.
