Im trying to find out a way to which value occurs the most often in a list of lists. I tried using Counter and that gives me the counts for each different occurence. I would like a solution that was not using Counter since i am unfamiliar with it but if someone can help with it im not opposed. List of lists of colors:Using Counter
To get the most frequent colour use the most_common() method of the Counter. The first item is the most common:If you wanted to do this yourself you could use a dictionary:
You can use dictionaries:To get max color and count:
I would first flatten the list of lists, like this:Then iterate through the list using a dictionary comprehension to create your frequency dictionary, like this: Then get the largest value out of the dictionary, like this:Also, the nested if statement probably doesn't need to exist in your code.  In the first if statement, you're ensuring that newCard.rarity is equal to "Mythic Rare," so the second if statement would always return true, since newCard.rarity would always be "not equal" to "None" at that point.  You could get rid of the second if statement and your code would work the same.
You could also just use a defaultdict to collect the counts:Which yields:Then get the max with simply itemgetter:
