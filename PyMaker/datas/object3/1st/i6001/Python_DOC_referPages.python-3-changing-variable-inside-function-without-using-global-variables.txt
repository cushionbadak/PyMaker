So i am currently working on a university project, therefore i can't really paste my code to be more specific, but we have this stupid rule that global variables are not allowed and using them would lead to points removal. So my question is:I am making a  roll the dice game, where a couple of players take turns and i need a variable that identifies which player is on turn. I have a function, which represents each turn and a second, which calls the first function multiple times, which is equal to the number of players. Lets say i have 3 players:So this variable player_on_turn has to change 3 times, meaning for each call of the function. The first call it is equal to 1, the second to 2, etc.I've done this already with global variable, but apparently i can't use them, because "it makes the code hard to read". In the first function i am already using return for a one value which changes inside the function and is being reset each call. Is there a way i could probably do this? Thanks in advance!
You can use Function Parameters to pass data between functions.You can also use a Class to create objects that store data without global variables.
