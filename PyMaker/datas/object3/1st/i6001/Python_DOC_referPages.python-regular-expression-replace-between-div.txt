Natural Text
I am trying to replace all text between the div class="one" tagWhat I have so far works, but only if everything is on one line.text_msg is the I have tried re.MULTILINE, got nowhere.  What am I doing wrong?
I went and modified your re.sub.  The problem with your current code is that you aren't using the flags key word arguments to specify flags.  I also changed your regex to look for a precursor pattern (?<=<div class="one">) and post pattern (?=<\/div>).Output:
Just replace . with [\s\S] in your regex as shown below:<div class=\"one\">[\s\S]*?<\/div>Click for DemoExplanation:<div class=\"one\"> - literally matches <div class="one">[\s\S]*? - matches 0+ occurrences of any character(include the newline character), as few as possible<\/div> - literally matches </div>
