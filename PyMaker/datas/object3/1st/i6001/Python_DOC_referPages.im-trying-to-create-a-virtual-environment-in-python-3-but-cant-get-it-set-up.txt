So basically to create the virtual environment I'm running:$ virtualenv -p python3 ve But when I run this I get: "The path python3 (from --python=python3) does not exist"So I tried to do a mkdir ve and that doesn't work either. I'm not very familiar with virtual environments so I've tried a bunch of things and nothing seems to work. Any help would be much appreciated!
It means that python3 is not on your path. You can test that with ...If you get an error your virtualenv creation will fail as well. Just use the full path of your python executable with the -p flag i.e.:In Windows this will be probablyAnd of course make sure python3 is installed in the first place.Alternatively, you can also symlink your python executable in /usr/bin but that will affect the global settings.Virtual environments are not much more than alternative path settings in the shell where they are activated plus a clean python installation in the folder that you create by invoking virtualenv.
I usually create virtual environments with python3 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment (here's the documentation https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)To be able to do this you need to have installed python 3 globally.Also if you want to use that environment you may need to activate it:source /path/to/new/virtual/environment/bin/activateThese commands work on Unix based systems.
