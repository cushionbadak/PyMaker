I am writing a program to create a dictionary in python were the key will be the lenghth of words and the value will be the words itself. So therefore, if i have say a word like "in" and "to", i expect the dictionary to print dict_value = {2:["in","to"]}. To further clarify my problem here is my code:This is what my code is printing:This is what i want it to print:So, if a word has the same length it should be printed under the same keys.Thanks for your help in advance. This question is about displaying words with the same length under one key and does not involve refactoring. I have reviewed similar questions but no perfect fit for mine. They are either too advanced or too basic
You can replace your length[len(i)] = [] with an if statement to prevent it from being executed on every execution of the loop:Not very efficient, but a simple answer.
There is a pattern for this type of problem:Let's solve your issue in two steps:first split() the string:Second step just follow this pattern:Final code:output:if we have :then one line apporach:
