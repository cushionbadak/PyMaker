I am using 64-bit 3.6.3 python on a 64-bit windows 10 laptop, with 12 gigs of RAM.I have python code that can extract a zip file (tar.gz). If I use the code, it takes a really long time (~1.5 hour) but if I unzip it directly using 7zip it takes less than 5 minutes, so I am guessing there is something impeding the processing power of python. I am trying to run this code https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/examples/udacity/1_notmnist.ipynbfor convenience, here are the specific commands for unzipping. Here is full code. I am using 64-bit 3.6.3 python on a 64-bit windows 10 laptop, with 12 gigs of RAM. 
Tarfile module is implemented in pure Python. 7zip is implemented in C++.Tarfile in Python is 60/5 = 12 times slower than 7zip.Extracting too many files is normally slow.To be honest, Tarfile is doing a pretty good job. There are over 500000 files to be extracted.
