How can I configure rst2html to run on a full Python project instead of a single file?I'm used to epydoc generating my docs, but thinking to use reStructuredText because it's PyCharm default (I know we as well could change PyCharm to epytext)
rst2html cannot do that by itself. It's a ridiculously thin wrapper over docutils.core.publish_cmdline. Check it's source:https://github.com/docutils-mirror/docutils/blob/master/tools/rst2html.pyIf you want to process several .rst files, you could write a short shell script that calls rst2html on each file.Alternatively you can write a Python script. Here is an example:A useful reference could be:http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/api/publisher.html
