I downloaded a dataset from Kaggle and am trying to execute the following code:Curiously, when I'm trying to run it inside Sublime Text or the Terminal (I'm on a Mac), it won't work and the following error gets thrown out:I googled this error message and tried to find a fix, for example by including the "encoding = 'utf-8'", but this didn't fix it. I then tried to run the same code in jupyter, and it works flawlessly. I get exactly the output I want.Does somebody have an idea what causes this and how I could get the same code to work in the terminal also?Additional info: I'm using the same Python version in terminal and jupyter, and I saved the .csv specifically with utf-8 encoding.
You just have to do:Since info() is a method.There's also no need to wrap it in a print call as  info() already outputs to sys.stdout by default.The reason why print(movie_data.info) worked on Jupyter and not on your terminal is likely due to encoding issues. When you try to print a non-string type, print will essentially attempt to convert the object to a string with str() or repr(). Since movie_data.info is a MethodType, i.e. a bound method, repr(movie_data.info) will look something like <bound method DataFrame.info of ...> where ... is the string representation of your dataframe. And because your dataframe contains some unicode values, so will its string representation; which if not properly encoded before piping to stdout, might give you an encoding error. (see also)The general summary output of info() doesn't appear to include any cell or index values, but just column names. Unless your dataframe columns might also have unicode characters, you can just do movie_data.info(), otherwise, something like this to encode the columns first should also work:
