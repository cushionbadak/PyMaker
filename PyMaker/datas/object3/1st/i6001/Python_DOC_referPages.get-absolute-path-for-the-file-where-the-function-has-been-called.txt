I wanted to make a util function that returns the absolute path for the file, where the function has been called, however I did not found a way to do so.For a better picture, this is what I'm trying to achieve.Suppose I have the following directory structure:where files.py containsand service.py containsThe expected results are not the desired ones. What I wanted to achieve: /usr/src/app/core The actual output: /usr/src/app/core/utilsI've been looking for on many answers here, but none of them has an example where a function is used to determine the path.Are there any ways or is it at least possible to achieve what I'm looking for?Thanks!
You could simply pass __file__ as a parameterin files.pyin service.py
