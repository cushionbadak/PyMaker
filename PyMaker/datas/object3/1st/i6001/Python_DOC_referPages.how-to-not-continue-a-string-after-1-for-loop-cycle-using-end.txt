I have been working on some code within python, and im trying to have a end="" print out a whole list on the same line. the list will then receive more values and delete the old ones. i want these new values to be printed on a new line, and i want to print the whole list on one line. then once again i would like the values to be deleted and new ones to be added, in a loop until all the values have been used. heres the code i wrotewhen i run my script i get everything on one line, though im trying to only have 4 values from the list per line. here is the outputking of Spades   King of Clubs   King of Diamonds   King of Hearts   Queen of Spades   Queen of Clubs   Queen of Diamonds   Queen of Hearts   Jack of Spades   Jack of Clubs   Jack of Diamonds   Jack of Hearts   Ace of Spades   Ace of Clubs   Ace of Diamonds   Ace of Hearts   2 of Spades   2 of Clubs   2 of Diamonds   2 of Hearts   3 of Spades   3 of Clubs   3 of Diamonds   3 of Hearts   4 of Spades   4 of Clubs   4 of Diamonds   4 of Hearts   5 of Spades   5 of Clubs   5 of Diamonds   5 of Hearts   6 of Spades   6 of Clubs   6 of Diamonds   6 of Hearts   7 of Spades   7 of Clubs   7 of Diamonds   7 of Hearts   8 of Spades   8 of Clubs   8 of Diamonds   8 of Hearts   9 of Spades   9 of Clubs   9 of Diamonds   9 of Hearts   10 of Spades   10 of Clubs   10 of Diamonds   10 of Hearts  I would like it like this:king of Spades   King of Clubs   King of Diamonds   King of HeartsQueen of Spades   Queen of Clubs   Queen of Diamonds   Queen of HeartsJack of Spades   Jack of Clubs   Jack of Diamonds   Jack of HeartsAce of Spades   Ace of Clubs   Ace of Diamonds   Ace of Heartsect ectAny help would be amazing, ive been sitting here for the past 4 hours trying to figure this out.               
I think what you wanted was something like this:also the if j < 53: is unneccessary as the previous line sets j value to zero
