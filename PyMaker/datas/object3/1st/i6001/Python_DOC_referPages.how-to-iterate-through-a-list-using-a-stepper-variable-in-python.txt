Natural Text
I am trying to write a function that returns a hangman style output given an input of guessed characters and a secret to be guessed. I start by making a new list aset to - as many times as the length of the secret. I then iterate through this variable and test if a[stepper] == letter where letter is the walker as we loop through. Currently to keep track of this stepper I am using this codeIs there a built in functionality for letter_count as I am using here?
Use enumerate() builtin function like this:
You could create the displayed word dynamically with join and a comprehension. The guesses are stored in a set and a ternary operator checks if the letter or - should be displayed:
