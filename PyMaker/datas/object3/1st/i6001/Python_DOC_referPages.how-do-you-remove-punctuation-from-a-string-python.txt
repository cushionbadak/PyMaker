Natural Text
I need some more help. Basically, I'm trying to return the user input with all non-space and non-alphanumeric characters removed. I made code for this much of the way, but I keep getting errors...I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong. Any help is appreciated!
I guess that's will work for you !
Can you use the regular expression module? If so, you can do:
I added the space character to your punctuation string and cleanup up your use of quotes in the punctuation string. Then I cleaned up the code in my own style so that can see the small differences.
There is an inbuilt function to get the punctuations...You will get the string without punctuationsYou can find more about string functions here
