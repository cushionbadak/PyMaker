I'm using python tensorflow to train a model to recognise images in python. But I'm getting the below error when trying to execute train.py from github Below is the code for create_bottleneck_file()I tried reducing the file names so that bottleneck_path will be a small value but that did not work. I tried to search online for this error but did not find anything useful. Please let me know if you have a fix to this issue
If you're unable to migrate to 3.6 or from Windows like me, install the win_unicode_console package, import it and add this line at the beggining of your script to enable it:This issue appears to be generally unique to pre-3.6 Python as the code responsible for handling text output was rewritten for this latest version. This also means that we will most likely not see a fix coming for this issue.Source: https://bugs.python.org/issue32245
I think this is a bug on the stdout/stderr streams introduced by the November's creators update, it happens in both powershell.exe and cmd.exeIt seems to only happen on Windows 10 Version 1709 (OS Build 16299.64). My guess is that it is unicode realted (output size is twice the length expected)A (very) quick and dirty fix is to only output ASCII on your console :mystring.encode("utf-8").decode("ascii")https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/39149#issuecomment-347260954
Adding more to @AMSAntiago answer. You could run the win_unicode_console.enable(). But instead of using it on every file, you could run it on every Python invocation (docs). That works for me.
