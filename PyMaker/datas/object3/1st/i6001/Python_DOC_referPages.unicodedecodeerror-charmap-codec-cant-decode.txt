Natural Text
I want to take the text of a file, each new value on a new line, for example hi /n this is my question /n can u answer it?My_list should look like this My_list[0] should be equal to hi, My_list[1] should be equal to this is my question and My_list[2] should be equal to can u answer it?I tried doing so using the following in an approach like the one i found in here How do I read a file line-by-line into a list?Then i got a Syntax error for unicode do i referred to this link Why do I get a SyntaxError for a Unicode escape in my file path? added r at first and solved it for the first iteration then got this error that i referred to this link to solve UnicodeDecodeError: 'charmap' codec can't decode byte X in position Y: character maps to <undefined> and added encoding="utf8". Still not working .EDIT: I changed the encoding to "Latin-1" but i didn't get the output i want from print (content) instead i got stuff like that ['PK\x03\x04\x14\x00\x06\x00\x08\x00\x00\x00!\x00\t$\x87\ , again what i want and expect is a list where each line of the .docx file is an element(seperated by /n).
Your input file is a docx file, which is a pkzip compressed archive.You can't open it as though it is a text file.Instead you could look at an external package such as python-docx. Something like this might work for you:
From the last link you give, I think the problem is that the file you are trying to read is not UTF-8 encoded.  Have you tried with another encoding? There is a list here.
