I want to write 4 numeric values to a file using one thread and read the same values in an another thread. All of this should of course be simultaneous. The second thread will only read values not modify them. Can it be done? 
First of all, if you want to transfer data among threads which belong to the same process - you don't need to do it using files as a communication point. The easiest way is to use queues which are thread safe python mechanisms to send data from one thread to another using a FIFO style.You will get the following output:This is very simple, isnt' it?Ok, if you really need to use a file to send data between your threads, I can suggest the following:And you'll get the following output:In this case you need to use Lock - built-in mechanism to synchronize threads to avoid data corruption.As I said, please consider using Queue rather than using a file for thread syncing.
