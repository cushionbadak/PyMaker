Suppose you have a dict like thisAnd I want to iterate over it like thisIs there any way to do that in one line? I looked through itertools to see if there was something but came up with nothing.Ideally something likeIn both cases, I'd want the output to be 
You can create a generator expression which does this:If you use this generator, you have one line:If you need this several times, you can of course build a function out of it:and then use it as you suggested.Note that you can write the function as a generator function on its own:The first one creates the generator object from a generator expression, the second one is a "proper" generator function which exactly does the same.Both versions are functionally equivalent. The only visible difference is the generator object's __name__s, which is '<genexpr>' in the first case and 'iter_keyvalue' in the second case. This difference is also visible in the repr of the objects.While the second one looks cleaner, the first one is closer to the OP's request to have only one line.
You could use a list comprehension or a generator expression combining the nested loops, e.g:That said, in code that will have to be maintained, you should really favour readability over brevity.
This works for your situation:This solution make use of a List Comprehension.More info on List Comprehensions here, here, and here.Also, Google str.join if it's new to you.
One line would be:
