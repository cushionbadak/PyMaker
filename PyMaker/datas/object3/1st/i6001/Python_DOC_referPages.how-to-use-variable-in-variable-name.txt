I have a class Character with attributes:How can I call variable play_level in the attributes of Character? The code I write is not working. Thanks!
Instead of that, try using a dictionary:
getattr should do this for you. It allows you to build a string, and fetch the attribute off the object with that name.If attribute_name is not the name of an attribute on your class, then it will raise AttributeError just like it would if you called Character.not_an_attribute, so behaviorally it's identical.You can also override the default behaviour of rasining an exception by giving getattr a third argument;
While you can set up your class that way, I think an easier, more readable way would be something like this:Here, you are storing the relevant instance variables, the skill level and what skill pertains to that level, and providing class methods to interact with this data.  I think using a dictionary to define the skills at each level is cleaner than defining a different instance variable for each skill because it offers you the flexibility of passing the skill list in as an argument to the class, or reading it from an external source, such as a database, file, etc.
