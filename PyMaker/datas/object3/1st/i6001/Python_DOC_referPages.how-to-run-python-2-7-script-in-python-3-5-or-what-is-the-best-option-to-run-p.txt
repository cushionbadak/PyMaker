To use Python 2 and 3 both on my PC. Or to try looking for Python 3 code only. Or to modify somehow Python 2.7 code?These are the errors:
You cannot run your present code with Python 3 interpreter, so you have two options: translate this code to Python 3 or run it with Python 2.Porting 2 to 3There is some materials about porting from python 2 to 3:Official docsDigitalOcean tutorialAlso there is a tool for automated translation: 2to3.I haven't use it by myself so I cannot recommend it, but you can have a look and decide if it suites your needs.Running with python 2I think the best way here is to create a virtual environment with python 2. Something like thisFor the further reading, there are a techniques to write python 2/3 compatible code. See this.
