Natural Text
when user runs script.py -r sampletext I want this to remove that text from the file. What I'm trying to do here is after the above code has read the file then the code below will re-write the file and leave out the args command :
When you specify action="store_true", that means that args.r will be stored as a boolean (True/False).If you want ro retrieve the argument after the -r option you have to use:Then you can access it with args.to_remove.Please read more about the add_argument method.
