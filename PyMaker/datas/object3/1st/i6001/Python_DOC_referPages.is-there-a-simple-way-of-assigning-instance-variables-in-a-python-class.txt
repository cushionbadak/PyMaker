When defining a class in Python 2.7, you feed in variables to an init() function, then assign these to instance variables using e.g self.xIf using a large number of variables, is there a way to simplify this process i.e. not have to explicitly define each instance variable?Or is there a good reason why they are explicitly defined?
collections.namedtuple is useful if you want something immutable:
You can use __dict__:
but the whole idea is kind of smellyyou could additionally have a static set with admissible  kwargs keys and validate would check if passed kwargs contain a subset of that set
