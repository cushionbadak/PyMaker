a bit of hints for how to use zip to merge data as well as transpose lists.it sounds like how to transpose a csv is you actual question. The answer to how to transpose a csv is to get it into a list of list (via for example the csv module) and then transpose that and write back to file (if wanted).or if you have numpy or pandas installed, both of those will do the job in max 3 lines of code with the workflow read_file/transpose_matrix/write_transposed_to_fileSo based on your code, I would read all files put them in memory and then do the transposed writing. I think if you change this portion it will do it (I did not test it myself).You will get funny results if you don't strictly have 1 row per original file.Update:I made a small example that does work.after doing that test code I adjusted original code a bit to make it list in lists, that's the only thing. So if you after that change still get funny results it is now because you don't have uniform input data, in that case you need to decide how to deal with that. zip for example will silently only output the length of the shortest list for all original rows. To fix that you need to codewise add to so that all lists have the same length as the longest row.
