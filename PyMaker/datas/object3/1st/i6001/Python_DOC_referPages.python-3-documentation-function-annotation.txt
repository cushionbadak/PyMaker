I use the following format to document my Python code:I can't figure out how to document a function passed to another function.For example:How do I make a function annotation?
First Thoughts: "Everything in python is an object"I couldn't find anything in the docs, but as everything in python is an object i would shoot for object.To proof it:Anyhow, this might not be too explicit, therefore:Seconds thoughts: Using proper type hintsBased on what COLDSPEED commented, a more explicit type hint would be using typing"The only way that annotations take on meaning is when they are interpreted by third-party libraries". Which means, for your source-code itself, it doesn't change anything. Just wanted to mention it.
