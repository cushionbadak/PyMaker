That's expected. I haven't imported urllib.error module.This one too. urllib.request imports urllib.error:So the names are available via urllib.request.But not this one. What makes me able to access HTTPError via urllib.error? I've read the docs, but saw no clues there.
OK, let's see:You will see an item:Then, try dir(urllib), you will see:So there is a parse in urllib, but not request or error. Because parse doesn't import them.Now let's go to urllib.request:Get an item:It is the same as import urllib.parse.Then try dir(urllib) again:There are 'error', 'parse', 'request', 'response' in it. Why? Because urllib.request imports them.Let me try and explain it in more details. Importing urllib.request first imports urllib, then urllib.request. Importing urllib gives us urllib symbol in local scope, representing module having been imported. Importing urllib.request imports urllib.error among other things. Which adds error symbol to urllib module. And since we have reference to urllib, that makes us able to access urllib.error after importing urllib.request. Consider the following example:./main.py./a/b.py./a/c.py./d/e.py:
Unsure whether it is what you expected, but this is by design. Is you look at the sources of urllib/parse.py and urllib/request.py you will see an important difference: the former only import the re, sys and collections modules when the latter (in addition to other unrelated modules) also explicitely imports symbols from urllib.error, urllib.parse and urllib.response.That is the reason why you find them available even if the import was not in your own source file.A more detailed answer would require a detailed description of Python import machinery and is far beyond what is appropriate in a SO answer. Please refer to the official documentation for a more in depth explaination.
