If a value for one of the keys in my dictionary does satisfies a condition, I want to break out of the loop and set a property to True.what I'm doing so far is:Do I need to use a for loop and iterate through all items in the dictionary, or can I use a while loop?
You don't have to continue iterating over the entire dictionary - you could just break out of the loop:
The pythonic variant would be to use any:As an example, if you want to check if there's any pair of (key, value) with a sum larger than 10:As mentioned in the documentation, any is equivalent to:which very much looks like your code written as a function.
In the case of linear search like this, looping & breaking with a a flag set is a classical technique. Reserve while to cases where you cannot predict when the loop is going to end at all. However, a more pythonic method than setting a flag (like we'd have to do in Java or C) would be to use else for the for loop. just my 2 cents, though: iterating on a dictionary should be done without break to process all items. a potential break means that there's a linear search somewhere that could be faster if the data was organized better (for instance with values stored as keys to other dictionaries depending on what you're looking for so lookup is faster)
