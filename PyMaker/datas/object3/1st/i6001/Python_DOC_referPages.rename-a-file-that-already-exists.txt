Natural Text
I'm learning python and also english. And I have a problem that might be easy, but I can't solve it. I have a folder of .txt's, I was able to extract by regular expression a sequence of numbers of each one. I rename each file with the sequence I extracted from .txtI need to check if the file already exists, and rename it by adding an increment. Currently to differentiate the files I am adding a random number to the name (random.randint(100, 999))PS: Currently the script finds "7526/2016" in .txt, by regular expression. Remove the "/". Rename the file with "75262016" + a random number (example: 7526016_111). Instead of renaming using a random number, I would like to check if the file already exists, and rename it using an increment (example: 7526016_copy1, 7526016_copy2)
Replace:With:
The code below iterates through the files found in the current working directory, and looks a base filename and for its increments. As soon as it finds an unused increment, it opens a file with that name and writes to it. So if you already have the files "foo.txt", "foo1.txt", and "foo2.txt", the code will make a new file named "foo3.txt".
