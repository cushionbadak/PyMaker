I have a form in my Django app where one field is called url. The user can add a youtube url.On submit, I want to save only the video id.My views.py look like this:When I output youtubeId in the console, I actually see the full Url.So I guess I'm not using re.sub correct.How to use it correctly ?
You can using this function to get the id from complex youtube urls. source: https://gist.github.com/kmonsoor/2a1afba4ee127cce50a0In your case;
You don't need the leading and trailing \s in your pattern. Besides YouTube urls cannot be trivilally parsed with one pattern as there is also a short form for every url in the form https://youtu.be/....Better to use urllib.parse.urlparse for parsing the url:In Python 2, you'll use from urlparse import urlparse instead.
