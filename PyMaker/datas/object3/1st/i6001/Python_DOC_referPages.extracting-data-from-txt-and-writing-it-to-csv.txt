Try this:
When using with take care to see until when you need that object, Python will then execute the code body, and no matter what happens in that code, call the guard objectâ€™s exit method.So you have to do everything in the body of the with statementyour code should look like this:Sources:http://effbot.org/zone/python-with-statement.htmhttps://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-with-statement
This process can be made simple by using Pandas.Consider you have a valid json file at /path/to/input.json or /path/to/input.txt, file extension doesn't matters as far as a valid json is present.
