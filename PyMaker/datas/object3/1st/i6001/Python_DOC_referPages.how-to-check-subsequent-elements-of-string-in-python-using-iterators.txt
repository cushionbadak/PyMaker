Natural Text
I have a sentence that I want to parse to check for some conditions:a) If there is a period and it is followed by a whitespace followed by a lowercase letterb) If there is a period internal to a sequence of letters with no adjacent whitespace (i.e. www.abc.com)c) If there is a period followed by a whitespace followed by an uppercase letter and preceded by a short list of titles (i.e. Mr., Dr. Mrs.)Currently I am iterating through the string (line) and using the next() function to see whether the next character is a space or lowercase, etc. And then I just loop through the line. But how would I check to see what the next, next character would be? And how would I find the previous ones?Any help would be appreciated. Thank you.
Regular expressions is what you want.Since your going to check for a pattern in a string, you can make use of the python's builtin support for regular expressions through re library.Example:Similarly generate patterns for the conditions you want to check in your string.You can generate and test your regular expressions online using this simple toolRead more extensively about re library here
You can use multiple next operations to get more dataYou can get previous ones by saving your iterations to a temporary list
