I'm learning python and also english. And I have a problem that might be easy, but I can't solve it. I have a folder of .txt's, I was able to extract by regular expression a sequence of 17 numbers of each one.I need to rename each file with the sequence I extracted from .txtthere are .txt where the sequences appear with spaces between characters, and my regular expression can not find them (example: 00372.2004 .442.02.00-1, 00572.2008.872.02.00- 5)edit: They are serial numbers, were typed, so sometimes they appear with "." and "-" and other times without them. Sometimes spaces appear because of typos.
You want this regex:Dot . is any character. By putting \ in front of the dot you escaped it and searched for dots and not any character. 
You can use \D in your regular expression to match any non-numeric character (including white space) and + to match one or more (or * to match zero or more), so you could rewrite your expression as:Note I am using re.findall to find every match in the string and return them in a list.
