So I am trying to make a sort of quiz with different categories you can choose from. It works all fine but I cant get the score function working properly. If I print(score) after three correct answers (the score should be 3) it still says 0.If I put the return score after the score += 1 it will automatically stop after one correct answer but I want to be able to give 3 correct answers.Below is a part of the codeone of the categories:If you need more of the code to help me please let me know
The score can be a keyword argument. That way it has a default initial value. Here is a working example derived from your code. Note: For testing purposes,  I replaced slow_type with print, good[random.randint(0,7)] with "\ncorrect", and wrong[random.randint(0,7)] with "\nwrong\n". This works, the correct score is returned.You can pass in the score from a previous round of questions like follows:quizquestion(question_category, score=<current_score>).You can learn more about keyword arguments here.
