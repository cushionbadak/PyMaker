I would like to perform addition of 2 integers, which can also be None, with the following results:What is the most pythonic, concise expression for this?So far I have:orIs there any shorter way to achieve it?
This is reasonably compact and can handle different numbers of terms:
With boolean logic:Here's a Pythonic method, using lazy or:With filterFor an arbitrary number of summands, you could use filter and sum:With an exceptionNote that the previous implementations will return 0 for add(None, None). This is the expected mathematical result of an empty sum.Returning None is suprising and might lead to TypeErrors when you use the output of add.One way to achieve the desired behaviour when users don't input any valid summand is to throw an exception:
Try this
