content of my python fileOutput on executing file Query 
The class body executes at class definition time, and that's how the language is designed.  From section 9.3.1 Class Definition syntax:In practice, the statements inside a class definition will usually be function definitions, but other statements are allowed, and sometimes useful.That is simply how the execution model works in Python, so there's not much more to say about it.  as per my understanding...anything class can not run until we call it by creating a objectSimply a misunderstanding.  This applies for def, i.e. function blocks, but not for class blocks.
It will get a call, as python work like that. Your code will always return output.hello worldIf you want to avoid it you have to add print statement inside the method.
