In the if and the elifs when i put for example, chance == 10, that means there is a 10% chance of that function being activated.Any help will be much appreciated
This approach uses only Python standard libraries.First convert percentages to probabilities.Then obtain cumulative probabilities. It's necessary to perform these preliminaries only once.Make a random selection from the unit interval, [0, 1].Starting on the left, find the first probability interval in which this random number belongs, then stop.This is the number of the function to perform.These lines are just to verify that the random number selected is in the required interval.You can assign functions to intervals in an array.More likely, you would put them in a dictionary. (I'm using your names.)Then you would call the desired one like this.
An example with three functions: Note that for this to work, weights has to add up to 100.
If you pick a random number between 0-100, and you want a 10% chance of something happening, you can do:The doSomething will happen for the numbers 0-10, but not for the numbers 11-100, giving you a 10% chance. Repeat as needed for other functions / probabilities.
