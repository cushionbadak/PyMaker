So I'm given a dictionary containing people's friend's circle, and I'm supposed to create a dictionary organizing these people based on their lastnames i.e. a lastname to firstname dictionary.This is the code I have so far which isolates the lastnames of the individuals in the first dictionary:The lastnames_to_firstnames should look like this:I can't figure out how to organize the values of the first dictionary. Any help?
Use a defaultdictEdit:As TitanFighter points out below, if you want to avoid duplicate name pairing, you can use a set instead by replacingandEdit the Second:If you can't use defaultdict you can roll your own like this3dit:The problem is that some people in your dictionary have three names: Haley Gwendolyn Dunphy.  So what we'll do is collect all of the names except for the last one into a list, then join that list again into a string
