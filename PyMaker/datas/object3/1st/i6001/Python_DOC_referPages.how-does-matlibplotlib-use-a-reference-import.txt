When I draw lines and rectangles using Matplotlib I usually use:But I also find somebody simply use:I found plt.Line2D is in fact <class 'matplotlib.lines.Line2D'>, which means matplotlib.pyplot.Line2D is a reference to matplotlib.lines.Line2D?I am curious in:How does it work? some python tricks?I would use dir(plt) to view but not in The Pyplot API, should I know they are designed on purpose, or deprecated?
Inside matplotlib.pyplot there is a line saying Hence, if you import matplotlib.pyplot, Line2D is available from the pyplot namespace,Because the availability in the namespace itself is not a documented feature, one should probably not rely on it. Also it is better style to use the functions/objects imported from their original submodule.On the other hand it is very convenient to just write plt.Rectangle instead of having to import the patches module first.I guess at the end you need to decide for yourself which case applies.
