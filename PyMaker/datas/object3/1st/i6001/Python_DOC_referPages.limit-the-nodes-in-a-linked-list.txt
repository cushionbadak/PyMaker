Is it possible to limit the nodes kept in a linked list?  For simplicity, take the example below:Pretend the 'data' is quite large or the range is indefinite.  Is it possible to limit the nodes kept in memory?  For simplicity, say I only need the latest 3 nodes or 30%.  I guess I have 2 questions. First, how can the above question be done, maintaining the linked list approach.  Second, is there a better approach not using a linked list.  I guess I could use a queue/deque or heapq with a limit, but it'll be kind of harder to get the data in relation to the other, right?
Removing the last element of the linked list means you either have to keep track of the second-to-last node in the linked list (not a very natural thing to do), or traverse the whole linked list every time. You can get around this by using a doubly linked list and doing something like self.tail.prev.next = None, or just using the built in deque which makes all this a breeze
