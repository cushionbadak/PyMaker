I have to replace every element in the list by sum of all other elements in the list.I have done so far:But I'm keep getting TypeError
Elegant way to achieve this will be:OR, even better to calculate sum outside the list comprehension so that you won't have to calculate it each time (as pointed by @Jean):Issue with your code: You are not making call () to sum, instead trying to access it's index using [..] resulting in TypeError. Also, you are modifying the original list while iterating which will result in different result (which is unexpected result for you). You should be placing these values in separate list.
