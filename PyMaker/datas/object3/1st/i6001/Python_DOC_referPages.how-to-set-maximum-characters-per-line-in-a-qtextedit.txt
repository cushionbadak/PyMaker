Natural Text
Is there an option to set the maximum characters per line in a QTextEdit?I have an app that opens a template and pastes fetched QLineEdit strings into specific lines in the QTextEdit.I have tried:This does the job visually in the app, but when saving the text to a file, the word-wrap settings in the QTextEdit are ignored (and those lines mentioned can be 1000 characters long).I see that:has it, but not QTextEdit.
If you need to fix the width of the text when saving, you can use the textwrap module from the stdlib:The format of the text can be modified in various other ways by using the keyword arguments specified for the TextWrapper class.
The answer to my problem was partly solved by using textwrap, and pasting it to the QTexEdit box before saving, or it wouldent work properly.this textbox searched another textbox and replacing flagged words.and with just saving the final textbox in the end that one string would not be wrapped when using texwrap save.this code worked.Thank you ekhumoro for setting me on right track.
