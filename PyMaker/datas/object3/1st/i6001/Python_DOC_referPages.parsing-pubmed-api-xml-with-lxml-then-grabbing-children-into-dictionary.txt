I am try to re-learn python so my skills are lacking. I am currently playing with the Pubmed APIs. I am trying to parse the XML file that is given here, and then run a loop to go through each child ('/pubmedarticle') and grab a few things, for now just the article title, and enter them into a dictionary under the key of the pubmedid (pmid).i.e. the output should look like:Later I will add in more factors like author and journal etc, for now I just want to figure out how to use lxml package to get the data I want into a dictionary. I know there are plenty of packages that can do this for me, but that defeats the purpose of learning. I've tried a bunch of different things and this is what I'm currently trying to do:I probably have a misunderstanding about how to go about this process, but if anyone can offer insight or lead me in the right direction for resources, that would be greatly appreciated.Edit: My apologies. I wrote this far quicker than I should have. I have fixed up all the cases. Also, the result it throws seems to combine the PMIDs while just giving the first title:Ta
code.py:Notes:I structured the code a little bit and renamed some variables for clarityids holds the list of PMID nodes, while titles holds the list of (corresponding) ArticleTitle nodes (notice the paths!)The way to join them together in the desired format is using a [Python]: PEP 274 -- Dict Comprehensions, and for iterating on 2 list at the same time, [Python 3]: zip(*iterables) was usedOutput:
First of all, xml is case-sensitive, and you are using lowercase tags in xpath.Also i believe pmid should be some number (or string representing number), and in your case this seems to be something different: In my testsproduces string of concatenated numbers, which is not what you are looking for.
