Natural Text
For my assignment I'm writing a program that will take the contents of a file, store it into a dictionary, count and output the number of occurrences of each word in the file, and output the ten most frequently occurring words in descending order.Here is my code. I didn't want to use import operator, but I'm trying to sort the contents in my dictionary. Right now I have the values printing in sorted order but not with the key in front. How do I print the key words from the dictionary, with the number of occurrences attached, in descending order?
Something like this?And then to print,
Python 2Python 3Printing for both python 2 and 3
