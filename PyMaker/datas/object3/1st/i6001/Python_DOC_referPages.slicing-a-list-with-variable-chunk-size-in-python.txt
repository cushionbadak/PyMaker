This question already has an answer here:Understanding slice notation                    31 answers                I worked in Python 3.6, and I am a beginner. So can anyone give me a true way of how can slice a list into variable size sub-list. I tried this solution from this site, but it gave me fixed size of sliced list. To clarify:if I have this list:I want the output to be like e.g.:each time it depends on (for example) user input or some variable size.
Just use itertools.islice(). This has the added advantage that if you request a slice that you would normally take you out of bounds, you won't get an error. You'll just get as many items are left as possible.For example, if you had slices = (3, 2, 1, 3, 2), your result would be [[0, 1, 2], [3, 4], [5], [6, 7], []].Basically, iter(input_list) creates an iterable of your list so you can fetch the next k values with islice().
You can do this in a loop making use of python's [:#] slice notation:Let's say the user's input for slicing chunk sizes is stored in a list. They want chunks of 3, 2, 1 and 2, so the user input defining the chunks gets stored into a list that has has [3,2,1,2].Then, loop through that list and use it to get your slices:Prints:
Probably you just want to learn about slicing. See Understanding Python's slice notationTo get your example output, you could do
