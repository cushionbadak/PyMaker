I'm having trouble finding clear and concise methods of removing a select row from a CSV using the CSV module (not the Panda since it's required to be installed). I would also like to remove a range of rows separately. Every article and every question I've seen either or abroad are not clear at all and tend to include specific logic people are asking about. I just want a clear cut answer that is very simple. I would like to use argv to provide a filename, beginning row number, and end row numbers. So something like python Script.py /CSVfile.csv 1 5, meaning the file name and remove rows 1 through 5 (beginning and ending). I'm new to Python scripting and I get halfway there, but there is always some logic people include that isn't relevant to what I need to do. I just keep getting blocked (as I typically do when trying to code), any help is appreciated. 
Just enumerate the lines and do not copy them if their index is in the range you want to exclude:If you want to filter the file in place, you would write the selected rows to a temporary file and finally rename to new file to the old name, but here there are no valid reason for parsing the rows
similar question here go to line number using seek and add '\n' or whatever.
