I'm trying to reproduce the above code in python, but I'm not sure what I'm getting wrong. I'm not sure how to start at a number, then decrement until the condition is met. Here's what I have so far:What am I doing wrong?    
range solves half of the problem itself. Rest of the thing is just formatting and inputting the number.range(n,1,-1) means the range starts from n and ends in 1 and there is a step of -1 in between them.n, n+(-1), n+(-2),...,1.Your C++ program generates wrong output:-/n 1+4=4/n 2+3=4/n 3+2=4Correct code:You meant \n (newline) in C++ not /n.
You need a for loop that decrements.
