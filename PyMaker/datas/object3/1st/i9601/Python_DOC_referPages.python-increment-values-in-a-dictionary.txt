Natural Text
I am trying to count every word from text files and appending the word and count to a dictionary as the key-value pairs. It throws me this error: if key not in wordDict:TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'Also, I am wondering of .split() is good because my text files contain different punctuation marks.
out:
key is a list of space-delimited words found in the current line. You would need to iterate over that list as well.This can be cleaned up considerably by either using the setdefault method or a defaultdict from the collections module; both allow you to avoid explicitly checking for a key by automatically adding the key with an initial value if it isn't already in the dict.or
key is a list and you're trying to see if a list is in a dictionary which is equivalent to seeing if it is one of the keys. Dictionary keys canot be lists hence the "unhashable type" error.
str.split return a list of words and lists or any other mutable object cannot be used as a key of a dictionary, and that is why you get the error TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'. You need to iterate over it to include each one of those, also the recommended way to work with a file is with the with statementthe above can be shortened with the use Counter and an appropriate call to it
