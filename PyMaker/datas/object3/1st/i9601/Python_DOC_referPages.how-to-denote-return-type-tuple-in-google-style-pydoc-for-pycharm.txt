Natural Text
In Pycharm I want to have a documented function that returns a tuple so that I can get code completion on it. The style of comments is Google-style.This works correctly:Typing func(). correctly shows methods for str.However, typing this does not work anymore:Typing b. does not offer anything.I know that PyCharm is capable of parsing tuples, because this code works:However, this is not according to the Google style.How do I document a function according to the standard so that Pycharm will pick up on the return types?
from doc pages of sphinxcontribThe Returns section supports any reStructuredText formatting,  including literal blocks::Documentationthis says that Google style supports the reStructuredText formatting inside, and using below format returns me the tuple autocomplete options.can this be the solution you were looking for?
