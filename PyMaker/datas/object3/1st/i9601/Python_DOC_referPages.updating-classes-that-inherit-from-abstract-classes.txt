I have an abstract class ship.  I have multiple classes that inherit from it (destroyer,cruiser,patrol_boat, etc...) Currently, if I were to add, let's say def do_more_stuff(self): to shipThe changes would not affect any of the subclasses until I reentered them into the console.  How do I change this?
If you actually redefine a class from scratch, it's a different class; the subclasses are still inheriting from the old version of ship. You can't just define a new class named ship and expect the subclasses to find it magically.Normally, if you wanted to monkey-patch ship after creation to add new methods, you could just do something like:But unfortunately, abstractmethods for ABCs are an explicit exception to this rule:Dynamically adding abstract methods to a class, or attempting to modify the abstraction status of a method or class once it is created, are not supported.You must either define the abstract base class completely up front, or redefine the entire class hierarchy later if you want to add new abstract methods to the base class.
