For example, depending on the user input, I am trying to get record to print out as shown below and also trying to get all the values for test to be saved under the names specified.or
I see a few problems here:Your record parameter is instantly overwritten by the method, which may lead to strangeness down the roadYou're attempting to encapsulate multiple values in a data structure which only handles key-value relationshipsYou're not really taking advantage of a useful design element with Python - class abstraction.My recommendations:Create a class for Students and have all of their information referencable in there.Here I'd recommend you define a suitable __str__() value, but I leave this as an exercise for the reader.Create a list of records somewhere which is simply a list of students.Adjust your newRecord method to make use of the class (and rename it to better describe its purpose).
use list as your tags imply:
You should keep a list as values for each of the dictionary key items where keys will be student names and list will contain the test scores. See an example below.It outputs:
You can keep using a dictionary if you'd like:This will log:Or you can do it in-place with:This will ask you for the test scores first though and then the name.
