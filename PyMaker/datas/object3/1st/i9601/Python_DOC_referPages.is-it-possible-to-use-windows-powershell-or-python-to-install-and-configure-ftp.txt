I was wondering if it is possible to write a script to remote into numerous servers to install FTP and then configure the setting? Thanks in advance!  
One pretty simple way of doing this would be to use ansible (python) https://github.com/bertvv/ansible-role-vsftpd that said ansible support for windows is a bit iffy. Or maybe you could just use Python standard FTP lib to do what you need (it's already part of Python install)https://docs.python.org/3/library/ftplib.html
