I tried methods like encode using "unicode-display", raw string, But it didn't work. I am writing a module for a chat bot in python which involves getting a character from the user and showing it in the "\uXXXX" format instead of it turning into the respective character.Here's my code:
If all you need is the Unicode code point, get the ord() value and express that as a hex value:This will use at least 4 hex digits (uppercased) for a given character, more if the character is outside the basic multilingual plane. I picked the widely accepted U+hhhh format rather than the Python / JSON / Javascript escape sequence format here.Demo:You could also encode the data to a JSON string or use the ascii() function to create a string (with quotes) with \u escape sequences:This has the downside that you now have to remove those quote characters again (use str.strip()).The difference between the two approaches is that encoding to JSON produces UTF-16 surrogate pairs for characters outside of the BMP, using ascii() you'll get \Uhhhhhhhh Python escape codes:
