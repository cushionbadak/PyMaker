I am creating a thread and after that thread finishes I want to refresh the users page and send him to another page. But I am really new to python and flask so I have no idea how to do that. This is my code so far:The homepage template has just 1 button that redirects to start_thread.The reason why I start a thread is because I dont want the windows to freeze while the program runs (it takes about 5 minutes to finish). for now the user has to refresh the page manually to see if the process has finished but I want to be able to do it myself.Does anyone have a solution? ( Or any idea that I can research ?) 
As stated in the documentation, wait can cause deadlock, so communicate is  advisable.  subprocess.html#convenience-functionsPlease tryTo
