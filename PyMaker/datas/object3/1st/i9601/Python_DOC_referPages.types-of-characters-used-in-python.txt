Natural Text
I am new to python and trying to get better at it.I have very little experience in Programming.What is the best way to know which characters are used for a function.Example:what is the difference between  (, {, [ .Why I have to use the different brackets.Is there any place where I can learn the very small detail also in Python. Your Help is highly appreciated.Thanks all
() are for tuples.{} are for dictionaries.[] are for lists.You have to use different brackets because they are different data types.You can learn Python with the python website:Python
(, ) typically denotes tuples[ ] typically denotes lists and indices{ } are typically used for dictionaries (like JSON in javascript) and setsi should note that that may not be the correct output for my_set, since sets remove duplicates and store them without order. read more here: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html
