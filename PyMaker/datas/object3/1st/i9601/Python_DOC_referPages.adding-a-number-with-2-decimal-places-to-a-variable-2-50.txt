How do I add 2.50 to the cost? Right now it just prints it out as 2. 
There are two problems:You loose the decimal places as soon as you convert it to an int in int(current).If you always want two decimal places you have to use some sort of string formatting.I would advise just to use str.format with "2" decimal places (here enforced by the .2f):If you're working with "money"-like variables you should use decimal.Decimal instead of floats, just so you don't need to take care of the "inexactness" of floating point numbers.
You are converting your float current bill amount to int in this lineInstead use this command to print your current bill amount.output
int turns a number into a whole number. For example,int(2.1) = 2 Your last line should have just str(current).
