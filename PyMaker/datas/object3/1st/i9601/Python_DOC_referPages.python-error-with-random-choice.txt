I'm making a small program (quizz) to test this language and i'm stuck in a functionSo let me explainI want to receive values from my database, then use only 5 of them, so for every question, the user answer, and move to the next question until reaching the last one.The code i have so far is But i receiving this errorTypeError: choice() takes 2 positional arguments but 3 were givenany help regarding this function?
It looks like you want to be using random.sample instead, because that allows you to return more than a single randomly selected item from your list, like:
From the documentation of random.choice() you have:random.choice(seq)Return a random element from the non-empty sequence  seq. If seq is empty, raises IndexError.To select more than one element, you can either use a list comprehension like this:Or random.sample() to select unique elements:Output:
random.choice takes only 1 parameter. In your codewhat is the 5 supposed to do? The documentation states for choice: "Return a random element from the non-empty sequence seq. If seq is empty, raises IndexError."so change the line to use only 1 parameter and assign the value to use it later (aka adjust the rest of your code).
