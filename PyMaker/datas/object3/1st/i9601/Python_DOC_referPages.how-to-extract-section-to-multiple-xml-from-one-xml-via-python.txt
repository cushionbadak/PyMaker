Natural Text
source.xmlthere are many among pppI want to extract it to single  files :1.xml:2.xml3.xml and so onI know it can be achieved by xml.etree.ElementTreepls kindly give me an example for this, the confusing part is it has double ppp.
The solution using xml.etree.ElementTree module:root.findall('./test/ppp/ppp') - finds all matching elements by pathtree.write() - writes the element tree to a file, as XMLThe above code will parse the needed elements and write them into files 1.xml and 2.xml respectivelyhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html
In the docs (https://docs.python.org/2/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html) I found the following sentence:Children are nested, and we can access specific child nodes by index:>root[0][1].text      '2008'So you should be able to simply call them by Index after getting them out of your first big xml. Hope this is somehow helpfull :)
