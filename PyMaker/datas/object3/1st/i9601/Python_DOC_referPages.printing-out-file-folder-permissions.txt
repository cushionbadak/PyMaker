I need a solution how to print out file permissions in a python script. The idea is to pass shell command $: ls -l to a python script, from where I'll print out the lines with "additional explanation". For example-rwxrwxr-xThe additional explanation would be:Owner of the file has reading rights, writing right, but doesn't have execution rights.Group has reading rights, writing right and execution rights.So, instead of covering all the possible cases of who has what rights, is there any easier way to do this besides checking each case with an if conditional?
Here's some code to get you started.We first create a list named modes containing all the combinations of who has the permission and the kind of permission they have. Then we loop over the mode string and our modes list in parallel, grabbing the associated combination from modes if the mode string doesn't have a - in that position.output
