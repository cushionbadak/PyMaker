Natural Text
I read that sys.maxsize is the largest value Python 3's int can hold.However, it seems not to be the case; I can put much bigger number and it still does not overflow.What is the limit that int can hold in Python 3? I am asking because I am converting a string to an integer and I am wondering if I need to worry about a possibility of overflow when doing the conversion.
From the docs what's new page: The sys.maxint constant was removed, since there is no longer a limit  to the value of integers. However, sys.maxsize can be used as an  integer larger than any practical list or string index. It conforms to  the implementation’s “natural” integer size and is typically the same  as sys.maxint in previous releases on the same platform (assuming the  same build options).
