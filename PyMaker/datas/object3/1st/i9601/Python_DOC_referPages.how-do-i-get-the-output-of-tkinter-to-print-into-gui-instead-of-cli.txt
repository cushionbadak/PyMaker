I have been working on with this code and I get my output to the terminal. How do i get the output to print in the tkinter GUI window insted? Here's the code:
Use subprocess instead of os.system. There are many functions to work with external command.I use subprocess.check_output() to get result of executed command. Command has to be as list ["ping", entry.get(), "-c", "2"]. Command can be single string if you use shell=True.BTW: because ping takes some time so tkinter will freeze for this time. If you need non-freezing version you will need other functions in subprocess or threading module.
