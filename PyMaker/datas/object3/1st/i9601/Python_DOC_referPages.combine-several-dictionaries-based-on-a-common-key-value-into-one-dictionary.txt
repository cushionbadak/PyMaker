Basically I have a list of OrderedDicts;I want to change that intoI thought of having a list of type values ['character', 'integer'] and go through all the dictionaries to try grouping the letter/number in a list, then creating a new list of dictionaries to be filled in with the data I got.  Not sure whether this is the best approach thoughAppreciate the help
Considering your list of dictionaries is already sorted, you can use itertools.groupby directly. A mapping between items and their related strings in the dictionary helps avoid calling d.items multiple times and makes the code extensible to new types:
That should work:outputs:
For an answer with less list comprehension (which helps withreadability sometimes.) See:I'm assuming, for the above, that the following is important:You might have other 'type' entries than 'character' or 'integer'; so you want an open-ended solution.You want the original order found in lst to be maintained.Your production code might have missing keys; or more keys than expected.This was written with Python 3.5. For some older versions, you might have to substitute '.items()' with '.iteritems()'.
