I would like to make an n x n matrix of boolean values (0 or 1) with a given density d (percent of non-zero entries). I believe one can do this with the random module and list comprehension.For this question lets not consider sci.py or num.pyTo make a list of lists:and we have a matrix. The problem is the density will always be â‰ˆ .5So how do we change the inner list comprehension to give us the value one with a probability equivalent to the density?
I suggest 0 if random.random() >  d else 1
Use random.random to return float between 0.0 and 1.0:
