I am writing a MadLib program in Python from the "Automate The Boring Things in Python" book. I am sure my program is going to but I keep getting this strange "NameError" when the user needs to enter input.Here is my code. My plan is to write the contents to the file once I see the message has joined successfully.
I think the issue is that the code is actually running in Python 2, where the input function actually tries to run the user's input as if it was code. Compare the input() documentation for Python 2 and Python 3. So you get a NameError because Python tries to treat whatever you type in as a variable, which doesn't exist. If you want it to work in Python 2, just replace input with raw_input.Another issue you'll encounter is thatwon't work, since word is a string and chunk requires an number as an index in the list. To fix that, you can simply keep track of the current index in your for loop. A particular Pythonic way to do it is with the enumerate function, as shown below:Now everything should work! The fixed Python 3 version is below:
