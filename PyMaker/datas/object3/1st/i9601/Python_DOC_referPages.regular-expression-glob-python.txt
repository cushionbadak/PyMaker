For this specific case, glob already supports what you need (see fnmatch docs for glob wildcards). You can just do:If you need to be extra specific that the two trailing characters are numbers (some files might have non-numeric characters there), you can replace the ?s with [0123456789], but otherwise, I find the ? a little less distracting.In a more complicated scenario, you might be forced to resort to regular expressions, and you could do so here with:but given that glob-style wildcards work well enough, you don't need to break out the big guns just yet.
