I am attempting a practice task I found in an old programming book to increase my knowledge of classes in Python. The task is to create a program which allows a user to set up a series of tests for a school. Each test must contain no more than 10 questions. The task stated that the best way to do this was to use containment, and have the class 'Question' inside the class 'Test'Basically, I should set up a class called Test which dewfines the basics of the whole test, and then a class called Quesion which sets up the question and passes it back to Test to be included in the array there. I'm having 2 major problems. Firstly, how do I get the setQuestion object in the Question class to pass data in to the Question array in the Test class. Secondly, how do I have the setQuestion object iterate the variable numberofQuestions since that's contained in the Test Class.Here is the code. Not sure it's clear from the formatting but the Question class is inside the Test class:
This is how I would do that:Now you can put question objects into the __question array of Test like that:
