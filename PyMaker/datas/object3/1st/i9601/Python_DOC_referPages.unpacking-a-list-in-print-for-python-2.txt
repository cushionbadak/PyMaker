I'm having problem with understanding why unpacking does not work with list and print statement in Python 2.7:Python 3.x works fine and prints:Python 2.7, however, raises an error:How can I make it work for Python 2.7?I know I can alternatively code it using join with: ''.join(l) 
Because print isn't a function in Python 2; unpacking a list and providing it as positional args isn't possible if it isn't a function. You'll need to import the print_function from __future__ in order to support this:Now unpacking is possible:
You have two options:Convert to strings and join with spaces manually:Use the print() function, by using the from __future__ import that disables the print statement:or directly call the function by accessing it via the __builtin__ module:The same function is available in both Python 2 and 3, but in Python 2 you can't use it directly without first disabling keyword.
