I tried moving the variable Intadd outside of the function, but then it says that Intadd is already refferenced before assignment (the only time Intadd is run in my whole code is in this function).Thanks for the help, you guys are lifesavers!

This could be solved with the global statement or by returning the value.
I may have the wrong end of the stick here but you can simply return Intadd from the function.For example:Result:
