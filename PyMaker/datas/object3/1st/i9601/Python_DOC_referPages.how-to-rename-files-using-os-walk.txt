I'm trying to rename a number of files stored within subdirectories by removing the last four characters in their basename. I normally use glob.glob() to locate and rename files in one directory using:But now I want to repeat the above in all subdirectories.

You have to pass the full path of the file to os.rename. First item of the tuple returned by os.walk is the current path so just use os.path.join to combine it with file name:
