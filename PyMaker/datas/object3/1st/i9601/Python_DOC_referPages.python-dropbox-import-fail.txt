I'm trying to use the implementation of Dropbox in python but I can't get the import line to work.  gives me the following error.  I have tried using the installation included with Raspbian and installing from source (git).  Any ideas?
dropbox requires Python 3.5, as it requires the typing module, which wasn't introduced until 3.5. You're trying to use it with Python 3.4.
