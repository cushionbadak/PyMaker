I'm working on a small practice project and I couldn't find an answer for this. I'd like to roll 4d6, drop the lowest, and add the remaining three together. I've found that heapq.nlargest can find the highest N numbers for me, but I can't figure out how to sum the output of that into one number.So far, my unfinished code looks like this:
The sum function:
Add this line to the end of your loop:The Python sum built-in will sum the values of an iterable. The heapq.nlargest method returns an iterable.
