I have an image, and I collected some points that represent the centroids of areas that represent vertices in my graph.My list of points looks like this:Now I look for some edges, and doing some manipulation in my code generates this type of list of (p1,p2) where p1 ---- p2 is an edge:Now I want to implement some algorithm, like Dijksra or BFS.Looking in other SO questions and implementations, I notice that most of that graphs are represented as adjacency matrices.I thought about just instead of adding the edges like I did, to add them directly into hash table or dictionary object. The problem is - what name do I give a vertex? lets say I have (343,472), I do not understand how to go about and turn into a dict that looks like this: {A : [p1,p2...], B: [p3,....], ... }What would be a good method to do this? I add a code that shows how I create the edges representation at the moment:
If your graph is unweighted and doesn't have multiedges you could just use defaultdict with set values:Output:There's no need to name the vertices unless you explicitly need name for some specific purpose.
