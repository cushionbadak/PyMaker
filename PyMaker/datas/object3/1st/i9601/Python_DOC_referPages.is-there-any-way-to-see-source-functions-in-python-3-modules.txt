I'm fairly new to the language and am wondering if it's possible to see the functions that are being used in a certain Python 3 module?Specifically the ones in the "ipaddress" module, thanks!
Is this what you are looking for? https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipaddress.htmlGenerally, this type of information can be found in the languages docs.As mentioned by John in the comments, implementations can be found here:http://hg.python.org/cpython/file/3.5/Lib/ipaddress.py
In addition to getting the source code online, if you have a standard Python install it should be already sitting in an easily found location on your hard-drive. In my case it is found as a file in C:\Python34\Lib. Needless to say, if you go this route you need to be careful to not modify (or, even worse, delete) the file.
