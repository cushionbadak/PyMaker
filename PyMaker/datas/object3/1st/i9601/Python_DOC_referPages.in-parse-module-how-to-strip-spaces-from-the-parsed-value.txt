The parse module is a useful as an inverse of format. Its documentation mentions (referring to the format specification mini-language) thatThe align operators will cause spaces (or specified fill character) to be stripped from the parsed value. The width is not enforced; it just indicates there may be whitespace or "0"s to strip.I would like to do something like this, but I wasn't able to find any examples of how to get this to work. For example, in its normal operation, if I use a template "{}{}" to match "ab", I get a Result object which contains 'a' and 'b':However, if I put a space between a and b in the string, then that space alters the Result:I would like the parse.parse method to ignore this space and still return 'a' and 'b'. Is this possible and if so, how can I do it?
You'd just need to replace {} with {:^} to parse format string.  Based on your examples, this worked based my testing.{:^} strips leading and trailing whitespace
If you scroll down in the documentation you linked there are explicit examples:And messing about with alignment:Note that the "center" alignment does not test to make sure the value  is centered - it just strips leading and trailing whitespace.
Specifying a string length (and the space between the values) seems to work:
