I've got a list of functions, each of which can return None or a valid value. I want to take the result of the first not None response:This works, but I don't like that I've had to execute the function twice to perform the test and generate the result. Is there any way to only execute f() once and maintain the solution?PS. I know I can do this in a for or traditional loop (that's how the code currently is), I'm looking for a nice one liner :)
Use the filter() function to remove any falsey results (including None) as you iterate:To make sure you use the iterator version of filter() in Python 2 as well I used the filter function from the future_builtins module.Just a demo to show that this won't execute more functions than needed:
