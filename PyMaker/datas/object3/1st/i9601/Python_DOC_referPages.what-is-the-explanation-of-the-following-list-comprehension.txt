I am new to python and don't understand what's happening there.As I see it is possible to be some analog of C's int a = 5 > 2 ? val1 : val2;, but I can't figure it out.I tried to separate it on small parts to understand, but it still makes no sense for me.Like that:
You were almost there with your separation. The inner part (what if) is the expression you noted being wrong (i), it actually goes inside. And what it does with it is expressed by being inside brackets []; it puts those things in a list. spectras' answer shows how this works using a variable to hold that list. The construct is called a list comprehension. 
Items that fail the test (that are None here) will be skipped by the loop.Conceptually the same, except the list comprehension will be faster as the looping is done internally by the interpreter. Also, it will not leave a result variable around, obviously.
the i for i part can be anything, x for x, y for y, or even Kosmos for Kosmos.Here you can see, it converted my list to a tuple by looping over each item.Look into a thing called list comprehension, as I am having a tough time explaining it
o/pas @spectras pointed, Items that fail the test (that are None here) will be skipped by the loop.
The following is a list comprehension:It returns only elements that are not NoneThen, you call tuple() to convert the resulted list to tuple.You can achieve the same result by using an ordinary for loop like below:Now, we convert result (of type list) to tuple like this:
