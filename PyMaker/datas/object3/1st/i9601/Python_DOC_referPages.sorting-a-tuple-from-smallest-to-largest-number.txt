I am trying to sot the following 'tupled' list from smallest to largest:tuple1:I like to sort the tuple by integers, in ascending order - I have attempted the following:However, I receive the following output:My expected output would be:
You can use sorted built-in function.key=itemgetter(1) means the same thing as key=lambda x:x[1] that is to say the second element of your tuples will be used as keys for sorting. But it's supposed to be faster.If you want, here is a discussion about using itemgetter(x) instead of [x]: Why should I use operator.itemgetter(x) instead of [x]?
Use sorted() like this:sorted() takes a second argument, which is key, in this case, we use lambda to sort our list based on the second item (item[1]) of each tuple. By default, the first item (item[0]) would be used.
simple, like this.    considered,Output:
