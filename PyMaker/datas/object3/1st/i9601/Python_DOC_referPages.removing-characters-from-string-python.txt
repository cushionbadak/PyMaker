Natural Text
I'm trying to write a function that gets rid of the vowels in a given string, but it seems to not behave the way it should do...so instead of printingIt printsThanks (in advance) for helping    
The problem is that no_vowel only has the value of the last time that text.replace(c, '') was executed. Another issue is that no_vowel only gets a value when there is actually a vowel to remove; the code would fail on anti_vowel('vwllss'). Furthermore, you don't have to check whether a character is contained in the text before calling str.replace().This should work:As others indicated, another approach would be to write code in a different way:Please do use a generator expression in ''.join() and not a list comprehension; such a list comprehension would allocate memory unnecessarily.
You can use string.translate() for this. For example:With Python 3 the delete argument is gone, but you can still do it by mapping a character to None.
Your code doesnt work because every iteration you assign no_vowel with the text all over again and you iterate the text's letters what you shouldnt because replace already does it. You should write it like that:Or, you could use a list comprehension. More Pythonic and faster to run:
In every iteration of the loop, text is "Hello World", and the last vowel of text is "o", so at the end of the loop, no_vowel is "Hell Wrld".In python2.7, use method translate instead. Here is the official document:translate(...)"Hello World".translate(None, "aeiouAEIOU") gives the correct result "Hll Wrld"Also, re.sub('[aeiouAEIOU]', "", "Hello World") works for both python2.7 and python3
