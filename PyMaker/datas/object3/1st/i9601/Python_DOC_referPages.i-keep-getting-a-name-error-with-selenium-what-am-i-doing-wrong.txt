What have I done wrong? I keep getting this error:============== RESTART: C:\Users\Redacted\Desktop\Autonav_1.py ==============  E      ======================================================================      ERROR: test_autonav_1 (main.Autonav_1)      ----------------------------------------------------------------------      Traceback (most recent call last):        File "C:\Users\Redacted\Desktop\Autonav_1.py", line 8, in setUp          self.selenium = selenium("localhost", 4444, "*firefox", "Redacted")      NameError: name 'selenium' is not definedRan 1 test in 0.003s       FAILED (errors=1)Code:
selenium is the library. You need to use webdriver
You are importing webdriver from the selenium library so the name selenium is not bound to anything.orAn import directive introduces a name binding for whatever is to the right of the import keyword.  In the first example, two names are bound -- selenium and selenium.webdriver.  In the second example only a single name is bound.  See the python docs on import for more details.
