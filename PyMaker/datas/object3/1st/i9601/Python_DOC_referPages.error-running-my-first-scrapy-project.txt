Hello after trying to instally scrapy for a whole day now. It's finally working.However as I am totally new to Python. I don't think I've installed it correctly.I tried to run my first scrapy project off of the scrapy.org manual (page 9)but I got an error when I tried running the project.Here's the error that I encountered :and the version of python that I'm using is :Thank you. Any help is appreciated.
It doesn't look like Scrapy issue to me. You probably need to explicitly install libsqlite3-dev (assuming you're on Debian based system) or sqlite-devel (if you're on Redhat family)
