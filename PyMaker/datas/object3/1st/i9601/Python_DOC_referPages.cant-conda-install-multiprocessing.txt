I am trying to install multiprocessing in my conda environment. From anaconda's website: https://anaconda.org/auto/multiprocessing, to install multiprocessing I ran in my conda env:However, I got this error:Why is this so? Is multiprocessing not compatible with python 3.5? If so, is there a way to install a specific version of multiprocessing in conda environment that is compatible with python 3?Thanks in advance.
According to https://anaconda.org/auto/multiprocessing/files , that version of multiprocessing was indeed not written to be compatible with Python 3.The fact that its page links to Google Code also means that it's long abandoned since that site has closed down a few years ago, and it's luck that even the archive is still there.Speaking of which:https://code.google.com/archive/p/python-multiprocessing/:This is a back port of the multiprocessing package introduced via  PEP-371 and Python 2.6. This is essentially for meta-fork of the  original pyprocessing project found at:  http://pyprocessing.berlios.de/So, it's functionally equivalent to the multiprocessing in the standard library introduced in Python 2.6, and you should use that.The conda info for it says the same:Summary: Backport of the multiprocessing package to Python 2.4 and 2.5
