I have a dictionary of commits over a week. I want to print them out in a weekly calendar style of columns.It seems like using numpy is the way to go to print this out in columns. I've also been able to "even out" the lists by adding some dummy strings, and turning the dictionary into an array of arrays. The thing I'm struggling with is how to convert the array of arrays into a proper numpy array."Evened out" array of arrays:What I've tried:Which always errors IndexError: too many indices for array. I think what I need to do is to go in and turn those inner arrays into numpy arrays then vstack them, but I'm pretty unclear on how to handle numpy. I also wonder if I shouldn't be so quick to trash the dictionary from the start.Here is a foreshortened version of what I'm looking for:
I think you can solve this without numpy and using only stdlib modules!zip_longest obviates the need to "even out" your arrays...it just returns None where there was nothing to put. You could also pass fillvalue='' or similar to set the default value.You could also use an ordered dict to avoid manually specifying the order of the days as I did.Now that you have the individual rows, all that's left is an exercise in pretty-printing. The textwrap module is probably your friend here.EDIT: This took a bit of doing, but here's the pretty printing taken care of as wellHere's the output from that:
