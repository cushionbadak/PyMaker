I'm working on a little pet project in python, and I want to be able to write external modules and dynamically import them. So far, I've got something like this:I'd use import module, but that just gives a Syntax Error.
You can use importlib.import_module() like this:Example:Let's say we have a module a that contains the following function:The following is the result:
You should use the __import__ function. Something like this will help,A still better choice would be importlib.import_module() which is a wrapper around __import__. It's got a similar syntax to __import__. Of course, you need to import importlib.
