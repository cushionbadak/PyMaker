Iam using this program to measure time taken by two funcitons along with the memory requirements of the two functions and compare which is the best for the situatio when large data is used. But for using the memory computations we need mem_profile module but during the pip install mem_profile  it gave me error No module named mem_profile.   Any alternative packages i can use here.Please help.
Use this for calculating time:As referenced by the Python documentation:time.clock()On Unix, return the current processor time as a floating  point number expressed in seconds. The precision, and in fact the very  definition of the meaning of “processor time”, depends on that of the  C function of the same name, but in any case, this is the function to  use for benchmarking Python or timing algorithms.On Windows, this function returns wall-clock seconds elapsed since the  first call to this function, as a floating point number, based on the  Win32 function QueryPerformanceCounter(). The resolution is typically  better than one microsecond.Reference: http://docs.python.org/library/time.htmlUse this for calculating memory:Reference: http://docs.python.org/library/resource.htmlUse this if you using python 3.x:Reference:  https://docs.python.org/3/library/timeit.html
1)First import module2)include it in your code like this3)change code mem_profile.memory_usage_psutil() to memory_usage()4)convert you print statements like this5)you will have something like this code:Now it work fine i m using python 3.6 and its working without any error.
Was going through the same tutorial and encountered the same problem. But upon further research, I discovered the author of the tutorial used a package called memory_profiler, main file of which he changed to mem_profile. that he imported in the code tutorial.Just go ahead and do pip install memory_profiler . Copy and rename the file to mem_profile.py in your working directory and you should be fine. if you are on Windows, make sure you install the dependent psutil package as well.Hope this helps somebody
Adding to Adebayo Ibro's answer above. Do the following :In terminal, run $ pip install memory_profilerIn your script, replace import mem_profile with import memory_profiler as mem_profileIn your script, replace all mem_profile.memory_usage_resource() with mem_profile.memory_usage().Hope this helps! 
That module is hand written (not in python packages).I got this from Corey Schafer's comment in his youtube video.Just save this code as the module's name:
I just encountered the same problem. I solved it installing memory_profiler ($ pip install -U memory_profiler), and them modify the program as follows:
Much simple with sys
during the pip install mem_profile it gave me error No module named mem_profile.by default, pip will download packages from PyPI.  No package exists on PyPI named "mem_profile", so of course you will get an error.for timing blocks of code, the timeit module is what you want to use:https://docs.python.org/library/timeit.html
