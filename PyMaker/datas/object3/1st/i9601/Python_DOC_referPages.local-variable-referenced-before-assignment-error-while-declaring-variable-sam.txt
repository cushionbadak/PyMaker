I keep on getting this variable unbound error but i do not seem to understand why.Importing it seems fine. I am using django 1-10
The problem is that you just redefine Document inside SaveDocument() function.Just rename local variable to document instead of Document:
When Python parses the body of a function definition and encounters an assignment such as Python interprets foo as a local variable by default.Hence, when you mentioned:The Document you imported was no longer accessible within your SaveDocument() function. In order to make this work, change it to:and use the referrence of document in rest of your code.You may verify this via telling Python to use the global reference of Document (which will let you execute your current code) as:As per the Python's The global statement document:The global statement is a declaration which holds for the entire current code block. It means that the listed identifiers are to be interpreted as globals. It would be impossible to assign to a global variable without global, although free variables may refer to globals without being declared global.
