Now, I want to make it clear that I do not want to include the variable b as an argument of the function g. Is there any other way I could go about rewriting this code, given that g is called recursively? Even mentioning b = 0 and calling it as a global does not seem to help with the reference assignment error.

global is used when you explicitly want to use and update a global variable. So you need to use global b inside your function instead of outside:Because you use b += 1 inside your g function you need to declare b as global. Otherwise you get a UnboundLocalError:UnboundLocalError: local variable 'b' referenced before assignmentSee also the Python FAQ:What are the rules for local and global variables in Python?In Python, variables that are only referenced inside a function are implicitly global. If a variable is assigned a value anywhere within the function’s body, it’s assumed to be a local unless explicitly declared as global.Though a bit surprising at first, a moment’s consideration explains this. On one hand, requiring global for assigned variables provides a bar against unintended side-effects. On the other hand, if global was required for all global references, you’d be using global all the time. You’d have to declare as global every reference to a built-in function or to a component of an imported module. This clutter would defeat the usefulness of the global declaration for identifying side-effects.
It might make people's hair stand on end but you could add b as an attribute to g.
