I have this:query='id=10&q=7&fly=none'and I want to split it to create a dictionary like this:How can I do it with little code?
By splitting twice, once on '&' and then on '=' for every element resulting from the first split:Now, d looks like:
In your case, the more convenient way would be using of urllib.parse module:The output:Note, that urlparse.parse_qs() function would be more useful if there multiple keys with same value in a query string. Here is an example:The output:https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.parse.html#urllib.parse.parse_qs
This is what I came up with:dict_query returns what you want. This code works by splitting the query up into the different parts, and then for each of the new parts, it splits it by the =. It then updates the dict_query with each new value. Hope this helps!
