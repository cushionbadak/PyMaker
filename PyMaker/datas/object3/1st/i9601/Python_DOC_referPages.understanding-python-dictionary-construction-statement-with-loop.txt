Hello I not new to Python but I am in the habit of reading long code rather than short, smarter code. Could anyone help me understanding the format of data this statement is going to produce? Is it a dict of dict?accounts = [dict(Name="Account%d" % idx) for idx in xrange(5)]Could you explain how it is? Like in Json rep? I would like to see it in pictorial represenataion and if you could explain the code itself thanks
It is a list of dicts, built using list comprehension.
