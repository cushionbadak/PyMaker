Natural Text
I am a beginner in Django as well as Python.I first generate 50 random numbers and store them in a list and then in a text field in model User.But when I try to retrieve the value from field I get only 0.When I try to use it as a list it shows an error of "int object cannot be subscript".This is the code to retrieve it:I have used the answer to this question given by mindthief to store a list in a table.Edit:My main problem is that the list is not getting stored in database. Any ideas why?
You need to add a .save() call to save the data to the db:BTW, you can also use random.sample():and json.loads():If you use PostgreSQL (highly recommended) you can even use a JsonField.And finally, if the questions are stored in another model (Question), consider using a ManyToManyField instead.
