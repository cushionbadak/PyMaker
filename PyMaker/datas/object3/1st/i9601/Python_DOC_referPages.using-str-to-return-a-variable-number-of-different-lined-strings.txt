I'm working on a project that creates "Facebook" in Python 3.x. The part I am currently stuck on is using the str function to return strings on different lines.The code I am using for this is:andThe problem that I am running into is that there can be a variable number of likers and a variable number of commentObjs. What would I have to implement to make it so if there is only one value such as: It returns in the terminal:But if there is more than one value in each list, such as:It returns:The only way I could think to possibly do this would be something with a for loop and len(likers), but I don't know how I would be able to do that while still returning the constant values of the name and status.
You are looking for str.join() here. This lets you join several strings with a joining string between (which can be empty):You probably also want to learn about str.format() to interpolate values into a template string:This joins your likers value with commas, and the comments with newlines.You should not use this as your __repr__; that should produce debugging output, helping you distinguish between two instances of your class, optionally with the contained values part of that output.
