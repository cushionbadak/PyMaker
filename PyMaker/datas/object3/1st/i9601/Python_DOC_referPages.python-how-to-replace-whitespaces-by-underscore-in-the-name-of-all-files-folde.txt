How can we replace the whitespaces in the names of folders, subfolders and files in a given parent folder?My initial attempt to replace up to level 8 is given below. I am sure there are better ways. My code looks ugly.Better solutions are more than welcome.
You could use os.walk that allows you to change the names of the iterated folders on the fly:os.walk iterates directory tree starting from parent in top-down order. For every folder it returns tuple (current path, list of files, list of folders). Given folder list can be mutated and os.walk will use the mutated contents in the following steps of the iteration.Folder before run:After:
You need a recursive solution. Rename all files in the current directory; then for each subdirectory (if any), descend into that subdirectory X (with os.chdir(X)), call the same function again, and ascend back to the parent directory (with os.chdir("..")).
Following the exact idea of @niemmi I ended up with this:Warning: Never run this script from HOME directory or from some important directory, it will RENAME all files including HIDDEN files.
