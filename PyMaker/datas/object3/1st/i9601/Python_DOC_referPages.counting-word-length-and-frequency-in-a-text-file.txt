I am running Python 3.4.XI would like to create function which takes a string as input (where the string is the name of a file) and returns a dictionary. The dictionary should have key/value pairs where keys are integers that correspond to word lengths and the values are the number of words that appear in the file with that length. I just really have no idea how to do this and I would greatly appreciate any help with this. Thank you!I want the final output to look something like this { 3:5, 4:2, 5:1, 8:1, 10:1}
Here is a quick example that you can try. The example assumes that the file read has a new word at each linereturns {8: 1, 2: 1, 4: 2, 5: 2, 6: 1} for the following inout file data
If you read through the Tutorial and practice the examples, you will start to get ideas.  You will need to open a file, iterate over the words in it, determine the length, if the length is already in the dictionary then add 1 to it, if not make a new key:value pair with the value = 1.
