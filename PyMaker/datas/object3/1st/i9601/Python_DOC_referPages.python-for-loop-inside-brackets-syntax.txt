So I'm trying to convert this Python function into Javascript. I'm new to Python, so some of the syntax is difficult for me to cipher. Here's both the original code and my attempt at JS-conversion. I know I've interpreted something wrong, because what I have now is an infinite loop.Python:And here's my attempt at its conversion to JS:I got the Python code from this question.Edit: I'm working in an ES6 environment.
They're both List comprehensions in pythonThe closest you can get to a list comprehension in python in Javascript (Without ES6, babel and its relations) is to use Array.Map (Similar to python's map)Example in pythonIn Javascript:With Arrow functions in ES6, you can get rid of the function(){}So your code should look like this
It would be better to use:As this cuts out the useless Array creation that N does.Also ~~ doesn't properly convert -1 to false and 0 .. n to true. Use !!~ instead.
