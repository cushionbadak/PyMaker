So I need to match strings that are surrounded by |. So, the pattern should simply be r"\|([^\|]*)\|", right? And yet:It's only matching on strings that begin with |? It works just fine on regex101 and this is python 2.7 if it matters. I'm probably just doing something dumb here so any help would be appreciated. Thanks!
re.match will want to match the string starting at the beginning. In your case, you just need the matching element, correct? In that case you can use something like re.search or re.findall, which will find that match anywhere in the string:
Python offers two different primitive operations based on regular expressions: re.match() checks for a match onlyat the beginning of the string, while re.search() checks for a match anywhere in the string (this is what Perl doesby default).Document
