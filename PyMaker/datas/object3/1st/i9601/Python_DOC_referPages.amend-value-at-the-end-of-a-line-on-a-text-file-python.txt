Natural Text
I have this text file and I want to take the value on the end of each line, do something to it and then write it back without changing the formatting of the text. So basically just amend the last value on each line. My current approach is to split the line up into a list of values using the spacings/tabs, but I don't know how I can put the spaces/tabs back in after as it was before.Any suggestions? Also here's my mock up code..

You may use a regex to match 1+ tabs and then 1+ digits at the end of the line withHere is a regex demo.See  a Python demo that - for the demo purposes - just adds 30 to the value found with the regex:
