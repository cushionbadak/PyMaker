I have a list of lists that I want to make into a dictionary.  Basically it's a list of births based on date (year/month/day/day of week/births).  I want to tally the total births for each day to see in total how many births on each day of the week.List example:Here's the code so far:So basically I want to iterate over each day and add the birth from duplicate days into the same key (obviusly).EDIT:  I have to do this with an if statement that looks for the day of week as a key in the dict.  if its found, assign the corresponding births as value.  If its not in dict then add key and value.  I can't import anything or use lambda functions.
Use a collections.Counter() object to track the counts per day-of-the-week. You also want to use the csv module to handle the file parsing:I've used a with statement to manage the file object; Python auto-closes the file for you when the with block ends.Now that you have a Counter object (which is a dictionary with some extra powers), you can now find the day of the week with the most births; the following loop prints out days of the week in order from most to least:
Without using external libraries or if statements, you can use exception handling
Ok, after playing around with the code and using print statements where I need them for tests, I finally did it without using any external libraries.  A very special thanks to Tobey and the others.Here's the code with tests:Code without tests:
