Natural Text
I want to replace each instance of a character in one string with a character at the same index in another string. If no character exists at that index, leave it as it is.Here's my solution with a list comprehension (Python 3):ResultIt feels like there should be a better way though, for example using str.replace somehow. Any ideas?
You can itertools.zip_longest to iterate both the strings, till the longest of the them is exhausted. The smaller string will be filled with fillvalue
The shortest solution i found:Note that the result string will have the length of the shorter of the two, because otherwise it would be undefined what to replace the remaining os with.
