So I'm trying to make a web crawler in python using HTMLParser and urllib3 in python. Currently I have two different import problems the first beingand with this code it returns an error in the visual studio error boxand the second option is the exact same but with import HTMLParser instead of html.parserwhich returns the error I'm losing my mind with the packages. Does anyone know a fix or see a problem.Ps. I'm running this in Visual studio 2016 and am in Python 3.5
I am also following the same tutorial that you are following to learn web crawling. I also got those issues yesterday when I run that code. After a few google search I resolved those. I am new to python and web crawling, so correct me if I say something wrong.If you are using python 3.5 you should import HTMLParser from html.parserand urllib.request. At line 7 you have to inherit just HTMLParser instead of HTMLParser.HTMLParser.At this point your code should be look like this Now if you run this code you will this error TypeError: Can't convert 'bytes' object to str implicitlythat's because HTMLParser.feed() only takes string and urllib.request.urlopen().read() generates raw data as bytes. So we are going to decode this raw data as utf8. At line 19 we add .decode('utf8')after read().The final code will be look like Converting bytes to sting also works with this at line 19 but if i use this handle_data won't recognize any whitespace such as '\n'.So the code works fine without removing any '\n'.
