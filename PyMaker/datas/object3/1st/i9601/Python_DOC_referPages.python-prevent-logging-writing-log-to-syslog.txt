This is my logging setting. It works fine and I can find log in test.log but I also find log in /var/log/messages something looks likeI don't want to log to /var/log/messages maybe other path is better because the log is too big#UpdateThis code is in my twisted service I use systemctl to start this service
Refer below links. Explained with examples.https://docs.python.org/2.7/howto/logging-cookbook.html#logging-to-multiple-destinationshttps://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging-cookbook.html#logging-to-multiple-destinations.In the example (Explained in the link), they have redirected output to a file and console. If your requirement is to redirect to some other file instead of /var/log/messages; pass "test.log" as parameter to basicConfig() function and create one more handler for syslog as below. 
is what obviously sets a standard handler that logs to /var/log/messagesTry removing it or simply remove all handlers before adding yours. I have never used python :)
