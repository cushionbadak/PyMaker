I believe my program is freezing after:Basically, what I'm trying to do is when the mouse point is on stopImage the timer will stop, and when the mouse click is on lapTimer, it will reset. When I take outthe program will run through the while and then break. My stop and start button work, but not my lap button. How can i make it NOT stop the program after the stop button is pressed? So that I can hit start again or reset?
Your timeFormat function never returns, so the calling code can't continue.Your main loop has the condition while sec < 60, but every time sec is incremented to 60, it gets reset to zero again. This means the loop will never end.It's not clear to me when you expect it to end, so I can't necessarily tell you how to fix the issue, but generally it's a bad idea when writing an interactive program to have multiple event loops unless you have a well defined structure for switching between them.You have a lot of loops, and when one of them is running, all the others will necessarily be stuck waiting. Try moving some of the logic from separate loops into other functions that can be called from a single main loop.
All I had to do was switch some if statements around.
