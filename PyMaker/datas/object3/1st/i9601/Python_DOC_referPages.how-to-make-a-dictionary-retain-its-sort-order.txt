This returnsI want to get this dictionary back to a dictionary that is in order. How do you I sort it and return a dictionary?
An ordered dictionary would get you what you needIf you want to order your items in lexicographic order, then do the followingContents of od:If  you want to specify exactly which order you want your dictionary, then store them as tuples and store them in that order.od is nowIn use, it is just like a normal dictionary, but with its internal contents' order specified.
Dictionaries in Python have no explicit order (except in 3.6). There is no property of 'order' in a hash table. To preserve order in Python, use a list of tuples:unordered = (('climate', 10,), ('ecosystem', 1))  # etcCalling sorted(unordered) on the above will give it back with the 'key' being the first item in each individual tuple. You do not need to provide any other arguments to sorted() in this case.To iterate, use for x, y in z: where z is the list.
