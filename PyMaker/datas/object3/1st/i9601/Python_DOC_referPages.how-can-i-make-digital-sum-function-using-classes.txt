We just started learning python this year in school, and so far we are only doing basic stuff with tkinter canvas (drawing houses, flowers etc.) and our teacher kinda sucks so I had to learn everything I know by now myself.I've been thinking about this idea of writing a function to find the digital sum of a number (without recursion preferably) so I came up with this:But then, I had an idea about using recursion to find the "absolute dig. sum of a number", for instance 99=9+9=18 =>1+8=9and I came up with thiswhich basically makes a sum of n, checks if it is lower than n, if it is not it runs it again (basic recursion), but it uses a bunch of variables and global variables (which are for some reason bad as I've heard) and I am well aware it could be done much more efficiently using classes and objects, but I've only watched couple of vidoes on that so I'm not very good at it.Could someone please edit my code and paste it here with some notes to help me understand it?      
Recursion is often overused. I believe you can write suma() much more clearly without it. Build on what you have already created.
Here's my solutionYou can think of map as taking map(function, [input1, input2, input3]) and returning [function(input1), function(input2), function(input3)] 
Instead of saving a variable and updating it with each iteration of a loop (the normal way to do this):Send it as an argument to a new function call:You can also make a recursive function to do the initial summation, and use that in the function that keeps doing so until it's only one digit:
