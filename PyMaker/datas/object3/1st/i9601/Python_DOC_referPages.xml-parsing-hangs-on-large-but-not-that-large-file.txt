I am using python's excellent xml module to handle some xml files I have.  One of these files is 250+ MB.  While parsing, it appears to hang.  Running top shows that it is slowly filling my memory, then starts swapping, but does not return for over an hour (at which point I kill the process and search SO).I am staring the process like so:But that's as far as any of my attempts go.  Smaller files are working just fine, but this one large file is breaking things.What is filling all (4 GB) of my memory, and how can I avoid this?
The xml.etree.ElementTree documentation has this paragraph documented:If you don’t mind your application blocking on reading XML data but  would still like to have incremental parsing capabilities, take a look  at iterparse(). It can be useful when you’re reading a large XML  document and don’t want to hold it wholly in memory.Consider using iterparse() to process your XML file incrementally.Plus, you should consider switching to lxml.etree as it is generally faster and more memory-friendly in general, source:http://lxml.de/performance.html
