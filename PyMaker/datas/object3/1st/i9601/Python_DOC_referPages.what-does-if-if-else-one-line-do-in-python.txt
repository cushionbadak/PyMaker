This question already has an answer here:Does Python have a ternary conditional operator?                    28 answers                I ran into this expression in a question here about knapsack problems:When I try to write out line two if i >= len(v): return 1 if S == 0 else 0 in a more general form I get an error:
I feel it is important to point out that what you describe (if-if-else) is not a conditional expression per se, but it does include one: 1 if S == 0 else 0 is a conditional expressionif i >= len(v): return 1 if S == 0 else 0 is a compound statement which comprises a simple if statement with a conditional expression.So, if the first if evaluates to True, then the conditional expression will be  evaluated and the appropriate element (in this case 1 or 0) returned to the preceding statement (return, here).
You have found the ternary operator, which is known as a Conditional Expression in Python. The expression x if condition else y means that if the condition (which can be a complex statement or function) evaluates to True, the expression returns x, and if the condition evaluates to False, the expression returns y.It works like the following if-statement:Your error stems from not wrapping the print function arguments in a parentheses. This is a change made to Python 3, whereas in Python 2, your syntax would have been fine. Rewrite it to look like:if test1: print(x if test2 else y)and your error will go away.
It is an if-expression: a if condition else b means: if condition is true, then the expression has value a, otherwise bYour problem is unrelated, Seems you are using python 3, you got the example from python 2. In python 3 print is a function, so just add parentheses 
if you are using python of version >3, then print should have parenthesis i.e ()
