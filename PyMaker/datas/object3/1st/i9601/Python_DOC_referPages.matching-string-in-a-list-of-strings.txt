Natural Text
I basically want to create a new list 'T' which will match if each element in the list 'Word' exists as a separate element in the list 'Z'.ie I want the output of 'T' in the following case to be T = ['Hi x']I tried the following code but it gives me all sentences with words having 'x' in it however I only want the sentences having 'x' as a separate word.
Just another pythonic way
You can do it with list comprehension.Edit:Or you can do:
if you want to print all strings from Z that contain a word from Word:Notice the break. Without the break you could get some strings from Z twice, if two words from it would match. Like the xo in the example.The i.split() expression splits i to words on spaces.

If you would store Word as a set instead of list you could use set operations for check. Basically following splits every string on whitespace, constructs set out of words and checks if Word is subset or not.In above <= is same as set.issubset.
