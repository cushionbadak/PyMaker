I'm having trouble of finding a way to randomly retrieve a specific object from a list which contains multiple lists. I have tried from random import choice but I didn't manage to get "b" for example, instead I got the whole list with index 0. Second question, how do I count how many "b" there are in the list l? When I use l.count it always says 0 since it counts how many "b"s there are in the list l and not the lists in the list l, as I understood it.For example:
From choice method in the standard library random.
