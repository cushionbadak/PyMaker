I have two CSV files of unequal length that have a column that looks like this:CSV 1CSV 2I'd like to compare the two files and return the dates that they have in common. I started with this in Python 3 to create two data frames of the columns in pandas.I tried pd.merge and difflib, but it didn't work. I've tried others with no luck as well. Help or direction appreciated. 
Assuming both files are sorted.preps:Open each file, file1 and file2call next on the files to skip the headercall next on the files to get the first line from each filethe rest:convert line from each file to a datetime object so they can be comparedif the dates are equal,save one in a container, maybe a listcall next on each file to get the next lines from eachif file1 line is greater than file2 line,call next on file2 and get its next lineif file1 line is less than file2 line,call next on file1 and get its next linerepeat till StopIteration raised by one of the files
