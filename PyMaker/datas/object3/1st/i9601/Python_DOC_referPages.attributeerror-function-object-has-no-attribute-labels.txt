When I execute this code I get the following error: AttributeError: 'function' object has no attribute 'labels_'I understand that this message is triggered by the method:clusterWithFewestSamplesby lines like: minSamples = len(model.labels_)Any hint on what's wrong or what's lacking?Many thanks in advance.Jordi
Where does model come from?In doKMeans() nothing ever gets assigned to model, I'm surprised it doesn't throw a NameError exception.  Maybe it should be An sklearn.cluster.KMeans object does have a labels_ attribute.You expect model to have a labels_ attribute but you have defined model as a function that returns NoneWhen doKMeans is called, it returns the function named modelSo the statement model = doKMeans(user1, 2) does nothing:Neither the function, model, or its return value, None have a labels_ attribute.
