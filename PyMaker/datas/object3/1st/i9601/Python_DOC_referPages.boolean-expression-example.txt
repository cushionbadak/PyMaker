Given variables model, year, and make, write a boolean  expression that evaluates to True if make contains the value  'ford' and year is greater than 2013 or if model holds  'mustang' and year is greater than or equal to 2012, False  otherwise.I am confused on how to represent the 'contains' and 'hold' in the expression.My answer:
