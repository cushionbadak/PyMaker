I am adapting Schorsch's answer in While loop inside for loop in Matlab to use in Python 3.5 for my problem.I want to iterate over values in my t array. For each value, if the result of my calculation z converges (or doesn't converge after a maximum no. of iterations) I copy this to an array. Then I plot the results.I get an error: VisibleDeprecationWarning: using a non-integer number instead of an integer will result in an error in the future  lines = """Does this mean I have to change how I index the while or for loops, and if so how should I do this?
The issue is related with the lines x[ii] = and cvec[ii]. As you are trying to access non-integers indexes.Those indexes were generated on the following line:To solve the issue, there are several ways to do it, but the easiest is simply to access the same index the value from the t variable is on.Using the while loop to iterate the maximum times a value, while it doesn't converge
