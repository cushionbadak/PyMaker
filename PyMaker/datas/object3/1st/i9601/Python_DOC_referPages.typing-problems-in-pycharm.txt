I have the following function:I'm using PyCharm to edit my code (love it). It tells me the type Generator[Tuple[int], None, None] was expected, but instead got no return ? When I change it to Generator[Tuple[int], None, bool] and add a line return True, as in the documentation example, the IDE highlights True and tells me Expected Generator[Tuple[int], None, bool], got bool. How do I fix this?Here's a simpler example that does the same thing:It highlights Generator[int, None, None] and tells me got no return.
mypy accepts your sample input without issue. This is an issue with PyCharm from what it seems. Scaning through the bug tracker for JetBrains, I found an issue that deals with what you're experiencing, see Return type hint messes up with 'Generator' type.
