I am experimenting with packaging of data, and since most of my data is stored as image/graphs and other similar data; I was planning to find a more efficient way to store these images.I did read about saving them in a DB as blob; and some others are more inclined to save them in the file system; but what I would like is to have the images to not be visible outside the application. This is essential because when I run analysis on instruments; I am not interested in showing users all the images, but only the ones related to their particular instrument.Plus it is convenient to pack data in one single file, compared to a folder with 20-30 images in it.I was thinking to store the images in a custom structure, a sort of a bin file, using python; unless there is something that already cover that functionality. In my search I didn't notice any specific struct to save images, while the most common solutions were either a folder in the file system or the DB approach.
If you can convert your images to raster arrays, you can store them in an HDF5 file: Add raster image to HDF5 file using h5py
