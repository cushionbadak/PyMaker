Yes, modules are searched on this path, see the documentation on PYTHONPATH:Augment the default search path for module files. The format is the same as the shellâ€™s PATH: one or more directory pathnames separated by os.pathsep (e.g. colons on Unix or semicolons on Windows). Non-existent directories are silently ignored.You'll need to provide the full path to open in order to find it (granted you don't change the current directory).
