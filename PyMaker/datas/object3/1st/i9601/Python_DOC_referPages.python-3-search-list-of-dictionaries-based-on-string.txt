Say I have the stringororor evenAnd a list that contains dictionarys, where each dictionary may or may not have the specified attribute in the string. Is there an easy way in Python to filter the dictionaries that match this type of string query?
Disclaimer: This is a very lazy and insecure solution that uses two of the most inglorious functions of Python, eval and exec, but can work if the output has exactly the same shape as the one that you provided.Our strategy is to edit the inputs to look similar to the syntax that Python understands naturally, instead of creating our own parser. Doing that, we will use the dis module (Disassembler for Python bytecode) to get all names in the string.TestingResult
ONLY DO THIS IF YOU'RE SURE YOUR QUERY STRING IS SAFE.(EDIT: You really should use something like pyparsing instead of doing something quick and dirty.)Do not use exec on the query string if the source is from untrusted input.Example:
