I want to apply a function (len) over each element in a vector. In R I can easily do this with sapply(cities,char). Is there an alternative like this in Python WITHOUT writing a loop?
The syntax is map(function, list).Example:Output:
The R sapply() could be replaced with a list comprehension, but fair enough a list comprehension doesn't strictly avoid the writing of a loop. In addition to map() you should take a look at Pandas, which provides Python alternatives to several of the functionality that people use in R.The above code results in a new list with the square values of the imput:Here, I passed the vector to a series constructor pd.Series(vector) and apply an anonymus function apply(lambda x: x**2). The output is a pandas series which can be converted back to a list if desired tolist(). Pandas series have a lot of functionalities and are ideal for many data manipulation and analysis tasks.
You can use function map that receives a function to apply to an iterable. Documentation to map map: hereFor example, you cans pass an anonymus function (using lambda) to apply to each element to the list by this way:
