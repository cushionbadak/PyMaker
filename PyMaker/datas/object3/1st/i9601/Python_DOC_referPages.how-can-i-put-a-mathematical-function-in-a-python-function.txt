I made a Runge and Kutta algorithm to solve differential equations of the type dy/dx=f (x,y).Instead of having a def f(x,y) in my code, I would like to enter it in the arguments of my Runge and Kutta function like knowRK4 (x0,y0,xmax,f (x,y)).How should I write it to make it work ?I think it must be something like float(...) but I do not know at all...
Using lambda functions you could do something as the following:Although I am not quite sure whether this is what you require exactly. The question is somewhat unclear to me.
