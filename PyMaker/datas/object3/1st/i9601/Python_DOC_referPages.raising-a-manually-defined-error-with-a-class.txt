If I want to access this Error and raise it from a different class, how do I do it??Say I am defining some function inside a different class, I will be for looping over a list of animals but if the animal is not found I will need to raise the above error. How do I access it and get it to print the str : forma???example: How do I raise this Error correctly, through accessing the class above and printing the str???
You just raise it, supplying an instance to raise with the appropriate required argument (num as defined in your __init__):If no handler is specified Python will simply __repr__ it and return the message as specified:Two additional notes:Don't use type as an argument name. type is already used by Python for another purpose and you mask it inside the method body.CheckError should inherit from Exception, this is required by any object you supply to raise.
