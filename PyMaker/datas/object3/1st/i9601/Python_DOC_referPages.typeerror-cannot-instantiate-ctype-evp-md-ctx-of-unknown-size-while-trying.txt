Below is the codeBelow is the errorTypeError: cannot instantiate ctype 'EVP_MD_CTX' of unknown sizeBased on this blogUsing this google-api-python-client
I found this post oauth2client relating the problem, in my case the problem was solved updating to latest version of pyOpenSSL, 16.2.0 at the time of writing.
The google-api-python-client that I installed (link above) only works with python2. As of today, it doesn't work with python2 inside of conda env, only outside of conda env, and doesn't work with python 3.5.
I don't have the points to upvote but Chemary's answer worked for me. I am using python 3.5. I faced the same issue and it got resolved when I installed pyOpenSSL.
