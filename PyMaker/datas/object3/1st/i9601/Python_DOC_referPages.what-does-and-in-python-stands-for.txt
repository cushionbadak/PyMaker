I try some samples in python console. And was confused for the following:I was confused for what is the why (1 and None) does not return any thing is line 1? It should be None? And why (2 and 1) equals to 1 but not 2. Sorry for new with Python.
In python, empty string, dict, tuple, list are False.The others are True(1 and None) is same as if 1 is False return 1 else Nonethat is why (1 and None) return None same reason == > (2 and 1) return 1 so, it's not 2.My English isn't good, you can find more information from below linkshttps://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#truth-value-testinghttps://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#boolean-operations
