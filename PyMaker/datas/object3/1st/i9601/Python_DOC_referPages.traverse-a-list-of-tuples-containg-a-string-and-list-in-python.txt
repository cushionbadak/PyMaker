I have a list of tuples which contains a string and another list. It is as follows:I want to traverse such that comparison is done as follows:and so on...That is the get_mapping() written below will call the values for prev2 and prev1. I have implemented the following code:I know the first condition is wrong. I am stuck a little as to how to traverse to get above comparison. Any help will be appreciated.  
You could write a generator yielding pairs:Output:In above zip_longest will yield items from state as pairs. Since first parameter is longer than second one on last iteration None is used as fillvalue. Then the loop will first yield from generator that returns (key, list item) tuples and finally yields current and next key.Update For Python 2 minor modifications are required since it doesn't have yield from and zip_longest is known as izip_longest:
So this is very specific kind of traversal, which can be done through a generator.Update: initially tried with a complex generator expression but missed the tail so had to end up with a generator function similar to @niemmi but with a slightly different approach.
