I have this dictionary:From the above dictionary, I want to create a new dictionary that consists only 'car%s'I'm using this code snippet (from another question)It returns {}I expect to get:What am I missing here?
If you want to add keys which contain word car in it, then it will work:
You're checking the prefix the wrong way and you're not storing the result. You could use str.startswith and dict comprehension to generate the result:Instead of inserting a number to the format string your current check inserts the range object there which probably isn't the result you expect:
This works:result:
You never do anything with the keys you validate but print them. You need to add them to your new dictionary:Your code is would still be broken however. You need to make some changes:The only prefix you need to check is "car". Forget trying to match the whole string.This entire for loop could be made into a very simple dictionary comprehension:
what do you expect from range(4)?It returns [0, 1, 2, 3]OR you want to get items only starts with car,read this linkhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.startswithoutput
