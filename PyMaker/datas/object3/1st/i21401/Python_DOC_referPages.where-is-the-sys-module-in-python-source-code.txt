I have found most python modules in python source directory, under Python/Lib or Python/Modules ,but where is the sys (import sys) module ? I didn't find it .
The AnswerI find it here: ./Python/sysmodule.cIf you're on Linux or Mac OS X, and in doubt, just try find . -name 'sysmodule.c' in the Python directory.Other StuffThe way I found it was by searching for the string "platform" throughout the Python directory (using TextMate), as I've used e.g. sys.platform before from the sys module... something similar can be done with grep and xargs.Another suggestion could be : for i in ./**/*.c ; do grep -H platform $i ; doneThis will loop through all *.c files present in anywhere up the file tree you're currently located at, and search the file for "platform". The -H flag will ensure we get a filename path so we can trace the matches back to the files they are found in.
It's in Python/Python/sysmodule.c.
Then you will see something like the following:In my working environment, sys is built into python itself.
