I'm working on the default python interpreter on Mac OS X, and I Cmd+K (cleared) my earlier commands. I can go through them one by one using the arrow keys. But is there an option like the --history option in bash shell, which shows you all the commands you've entered so far?
Use readline.get_current_history_length() to get the length, and readline.get_history_item() to view each.
Code for printing the entire history (just for future reference):python2python3Edit: Note get_history_item() is indexed from 1 to n.
With python 3 interpreter the history is written to~/.python_history
Since the above only works for python 2.xfor python 3.x (specifically 3.5) is similar but with a slight modification:note the extra ()(using shell scripts to parse .python_history or using python to modify the above code is a matter of personal taste and situation imho)
If you want to write the history to a file:
A simple function to get the history similar to unix/bash version.Hope it helps some new folks.Snippet: Tested with Python3. Let me know if there are any glitches with python2.Samples:Full History : ipyhistory()Last 10 History: ipyhistory(10)First 10 History: ipyhistory(-10)Hope it helps fellas.
In IPython %history -g should give you the entire command history. The default configuration also saves your history into a file named .python_history in your user directory.
This should give you the commands printed out in separate lines:
@Jason-V, it really help, thanks. then, i found this examples and composed to own snippet.
