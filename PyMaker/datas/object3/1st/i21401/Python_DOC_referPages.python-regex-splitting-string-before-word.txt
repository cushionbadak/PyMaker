I am trying to split a string in python before a specific word. For example, I would like to split the following string before "path:". split string before "path:"input: "path:bte00250 Alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism path:bte00330 Arginine and proline metabolism"output: ['path:bte00250 Alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism', 'path:bte00330 Arginine and proline metabolism']I have tried This does not split the string anywhere. The trouble is that the values after "path:" will never be known to specify the whole word. Does anyone know how to do this?
using a regular expression to split your string seems a bit overkill: the string split() method may be just what you need.anyway, if you really need to match a regular expression in order to split your string, you should use the re.split() method, which splits a string upon a regular expression match.also, use a correct regular expression for splitting:the (?=...) group is a lookahead assertion: the expression matches a space (note the space at the start of the expression) which is followed by the string 'path:', without consuming what follows the space.
You could do ["path:"+s for s in line.split("path:")[1:]] instead of using a regex. (note that we skip first match, that has no "path:" prefix.

This can be done without regular expressons.  Given a string:We can temporarily replace the desired word with a placeholder. The placeholder is a single character, which we use to split by:Now that the string is split, we can rejoin the original word to each sub-string using a list comprehension:
