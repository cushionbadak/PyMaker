I'm trying to encode non-ASCII characters so I can put them inside an url and use them in urlopen. The problem is that I want an encoding like JavaScript (that for example encodes รณ as %C3%B3):But urllib.quote in python returns รณ as %F3:I want to know how to achieve an encoding like javascript's encodeURIComponent in Python, and also if I can encode non ISO 8859-1 characters like Chinese. Thanks!

in Python 3 the urllib.quote has been renamed to urllib.parse.quote.Also in Python 3 all strings are unicode strings (the byte strings are called bytes).Example:
