I am trying to convert a time duration, stringified as "3h30m" (for example), into the individual hours and minutes component. I want to allow hours to be greater than 23The above returns a time.struct_time where tm_hour=3 and tm_min=30.If I try:I get a ValueError. Is it possible to run the above and get a tm_hour=25?
No, you can't use time.strptime() for that, %H can only represent a number between 0 and 23. The time tuple format doesn't support tm_hour values > 23 either.You could use a regular expression instead:The above pattern works for any hours and minutes combination, with minutes up to 59 and hours unlimited (and omitting them altogether works too).
I did end up using a regex:
Just because you want it does not mean it is possible in this framework. As @Psidom said, you will need to do the work to parse out what you care about.The regex for your hour would be:And minute:Using regex in py can be found here.
