I tried to use the python calendar module in version 3.5.2 with:but every time I try to run it, crashes and says:Conversely, I tried this in terminal (using Python 2.7), and it does what it is told...!Just unsure why this doesn't work in one of the latest version of Python
From this answer here. You probably calling another file called calendar. Use this to find where that file is: print(calendar) Hope this helps! EDIT: also according to the documentation, I think that you are looking for the function monthdatescalendar(year, month) not calendar.month(). please read over the python3 documentation for calendar. Thanks!
