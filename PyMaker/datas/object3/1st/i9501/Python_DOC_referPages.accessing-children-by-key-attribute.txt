Using xml.etree I need to access an element by a key identifier. Having as an exampleHow can i access the elements according to the id value? If the argument 2 is passed, whats the most direct way to access all the attributes for model fooname?I've tried to use findtext, find, and get methods with a variation of arguments but i cant access the desired element. 
xml.etree.ElementTree supports a limited XPath language functionality, but this is enough to get an element by a specific value of an attribute:It prints:Note the use of .attrib to access the element attributes.
