I am trying to write a program that checks the avg speed of a road. This program will be where you input two times point1-point2.  Then the program works out the difference. This all works. The only thing I need is the difference output in HH:MM:SS and I need it in seconds or minutes. This will collect the time to convert from the difference. My code so far is:this all works and gives me what I want I need to convert diffrence to secondsthanks Adam
Since diffrence is of timedelta type, you should be using datetime.total_seconds() method as:
You can simply do it by calling seconds:
This gives you the time difference in seconds:Example:Output:Looks alright:From the docs:Total seconds in the duration.
