Natural Text
I was trying to create a name(string) function which prompts user for "name" and stores it in a variable of named string.  Though I know the above code won't work since a variable can't be passed as an argument to the parameter. So is there any way yo do this?Sorry, for the typecast I am new to Python as well as Stackoverflock.
If you're trying to abstract out the prompt and underlying input() call, the above would be the recommended way. The function returns the value, and you can store or utilize the return of the wrapper however you choose.
Python does give you the ability to manipulate the symbol table via globals() and locals(). By using these you can create a variable with an arbitrary user supplied name and attach it to the global scope as follows:You might also want to look at what locals() does too.
Maybe you want something like :
If I understand correctly you want the text entered by the user to be the name of the variable in the Python code. So if I give my name 'Chris' there should be a variable created called Chris.The only reason I can see to do this is that you are trying to get your program to pick from variables that already exist in your code, since otherwise what value do we assign to the variable?I can see four ways to do this.1) Use a dictionary:2) Use an object (if you are writing this code into a class even better):3) Use exec (https://docs.python.org/2.0/ref/exec.html) (Warning: Dangerous if used incorrectly)4) Use eval (Warning: Ridiculously dangerous, especially if the user cannot be 100% trusted, this could be used to do almost anything by the user)Hope one of these is helpful.
