Natural Text
I'm a bit confused about Python's regular expression. Specifically, why doesn't the following line return True? Code:bool(re.search(r'ab\n^c$', 'ab\nc'))
$ matches the end of the string, so c must be at the end. Your matched string ends in c$ however. Next, you also included ^, which matches the start of a string, but you put it in the middle of the expression.Either escape ^ and $ so they match literals, or make ^ match the start of each line in the text with the re.MULTILINE flag, and remove ^ and $ from the text to match.Demo:
