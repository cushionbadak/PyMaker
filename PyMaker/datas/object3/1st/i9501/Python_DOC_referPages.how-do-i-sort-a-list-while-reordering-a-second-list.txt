I am currently having a problem, which i have to sort a list of path. the file which the path lead to is named as such a-b-c.wav.These path are given to a function which outputs two list, a list of the sampled_sounds - (raw_sounds)a list of the file_names_of_sampled_audio - (data_name).The function: The function start by sampling the audio.After the audio has been sampled, is the name renamed tob-c-a.wav.The sampled audio is appended to the list raw_soundsthe new name is appended to list data_name. The problem here is that i need to sort the list data_namebut at the same time ensure that the list with the raw_sounds is still listed correctly according to the name in data_name.. I guess i would have to implement sorting manually, example of the name:How do i sort something like this, while also reordering raw_sound, so both entries in data_name and raw_sounds contains the correct data. Edit: The solution i ended up using was this:I will keep this open, in case there is a builtin solution, that i didn't know of. 
I would rather have both in the same list as a tuple or use a dictionaryalso if that find_all is what I think it is, then the os.path module have a function for just thatthen your function can be rewrite as also notice that you can use negative indexes some_list[-n] which is equivalent to some_list[len(some_list)-n]with the suggestions of EvensF, you can include the file extension and/or work with files which have extension of different length like .midi, to mention one, without needed to modify the code. Like this for instance(that way you don't need to later add the extension, or worry about what that is later in case you have multiples ones)
If I get it right you just want two sort the to lists:This gives you a sorted zipped list.can undo the zipping.If you use python 2.x consider using itertools.izip to work with iterator instead of lists.
