I was debugging my python script and came across traceback object, which is present at 2nd index in result, returned by sys.exc_info() function. However, I tried to google out information related to traceback object, but everywhere i got link to traceback module in standard python lib. Then, I tried doing dir() on traceback object, which gives me a list of attributes. In that list, following attributes looks interesting :-I know about tb_frame and tb_lineno, but what rest of other attributes indicates ? Apologizing for bad English. Thanks in advance.
As specified by in docpage specified by @vaultah,These all are special read-only attributes.1. tb_next is the next level in the stack trace (towards the frame where the exception occurred), or None if there is no next level; 2. tb_frame points to the execution frame of the current level; 3. tb_lineno gives the line number where the exception occurred; 4. tb_lasti indicates the precise instruction. Note :- The line number and last instruction in the traceback may differ from the line number of its frame object if the exception occurred in a try statement with no matching except clause or with a finally clause.
