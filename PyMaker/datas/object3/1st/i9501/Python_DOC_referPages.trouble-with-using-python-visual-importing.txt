I'm trying to use the visual function in python which I have imported but I am still getting an error saying "no module named visual".What can i do to fix this?My code: The error:
This means that you don't have the module 'visual' installed. Have you installed the module? If you have installed it that means your IDE isn't finding the module.
In python from something import * probably means one of:You are trying to import things (functions, variables, classes) from another module in the current path, something.py, or something/__init__.py. You are trying to import from the module something found in the standard library.You are trying to import from a 3rd-party module probably installed from the python package index with pip install something.So.... what is visual in your case?
