Having a list or str, like this:Indexing with i=4 value[4] gives me 'r'.How can i turn my indexing to use larger (unlimited range) values like 16 to get 'r', or 40 for 'W'?
You could use modulus:
I think you should use remainder operator:
Here is an itertools solution, but it's not pretty...itertools.cycle will repeat your input iterable ('Water' in this case) infinitely. itertools.islice allows you to slice an iterable as if it were a list. Calling next once just returns the first value from the slice.
