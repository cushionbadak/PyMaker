I am trying to make an exit function in my calculator, I tried many ways but it does not work. I don't understand how to loop my code and no website explains what to do.Here is my code:Can someone explain to me why it's not working?
close can't be 'No' and 'no' at the same time, so it is always false.So you probably meant close == 'No' or close == 'no'. But better way to do it is close.lower() == 'no'And what you are doing is not a loop but a recursion (function main calls itself). If you need loop then try this:
Replace your main() function with the following one:close is initialized with 'no', so the loop is executed at least one time.Instead of close == 'no' or close == 'No', you can use lower() like this: close.lower() == 'no'You should use:Instead of:
I would like to exit even if the user said 'yea' or just 'y'It should deal with the empty string as well, when the user just hit enter.
The variable close can't be 2 strings at the same time. I suggest just changing:if close == "Yes" and "yes": to if close == "Yes "or "yes" if you don't want to change your code much
