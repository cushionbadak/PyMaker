Natural Text
I am using this code to follow a twitter account and if a specific word is tweeted it prints the text and the tweet id then deletes the tweet.  The code below works as in it finds the word 'hi' when tweeted, prints it and the id, and deletes the tweet. The problem is that immediately after it deletes the tweet I get the error- KeyError 'text' . and the script stops. I'm new to python and don't know much about dictionaries, exceptions, or KeyError.  How do I make an exception to ignore this error and continue or create a dictionary and additional code so no error happens? Full error:  
You try to get "text" from data but data doesn't have key "text"You can check if data has key "text"or shorteror use data.get("text") (or data.get("text", "default text")) to get "text" or "default text" (or None)
