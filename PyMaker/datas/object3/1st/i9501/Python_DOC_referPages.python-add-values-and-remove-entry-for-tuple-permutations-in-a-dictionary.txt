Natural Text
I have a dictionary where the key is a tuple. Some of these tuples are permutations of each other (e.g. (1, 2) vs (2, 1)). I want to add the value of one permutation to the other, and then get rid of the second permutation. should be I thought about sorting them and then doing something based on position in the dictionary, but this is not very easy to scale up. Input is welcome!
As @wim suggested, you should probably use a frozenset, then you can use collections.Counter and sum to cumulate the values into a new dictionary:You may turn the Counter object into a vanilla dict and the keys back to tuples if you so wish using a dictionary comprehension.
Use a frozenset for the dict key instead of a tuple.  Then you can just add them as you go along, without worrying about ordering.
