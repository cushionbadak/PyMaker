I have this:Is there any way to do something like?as opposed to this:As you can see, func2() is called anyway, by func1() only when the condtion is true.
The best solution remains separating out "lots of stuff" into a separate function. However, you could handle something like this using contextlib.ExitStack (requires v3.3+).
you could create a conditional context manger with dummy context manager when condition False.and you can merge both your var1 and var2 context manager with a comma
