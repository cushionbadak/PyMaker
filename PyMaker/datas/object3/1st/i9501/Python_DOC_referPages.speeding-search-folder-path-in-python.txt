I am using python 2.7 and trying to search folder not file. We have specific project number for every project and evry documents goes to project folder under any project. So , we have to search the project folder if it is exist or valid.My script can find the specific folder but it takes long time (about 11 to 13 minutes to complete the process)I would like to share my script work to have some better ideas. 
why no just this?and if you have a chace to use python3: there is os.scandir which does similar things as os.walk but is a lot faster on NTFS.
Why not execute linux find command or tree commands (FIND in case of windows) in python . Commands like find would use system indexes and probably give a faster result.Something like:-    find . -type d -name "A9901001"Python code should look something like thisNote:- Follow this solution only if you are getting some performance, since your initial approach is certainly more elegant.
