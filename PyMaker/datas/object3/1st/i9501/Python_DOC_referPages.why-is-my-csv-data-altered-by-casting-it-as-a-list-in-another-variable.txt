If I runIt works as I would expect and prints out the csv file. However if I add the lineIt now does not print anything out. Why does assigning the data variable to a list of the input_file, alter input_file? 
input_file is an iterator. Your call list(input_file) exhausts it.That is, it iterates through all lines and yields each one of them to data, after which it has no more lines to yield.Try:to see that the data is still there.
