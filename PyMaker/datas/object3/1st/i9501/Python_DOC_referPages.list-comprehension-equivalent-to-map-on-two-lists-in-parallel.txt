This question already has an answer here:How to iterate through two lists in parallel?                    8 answers                I understand that with one list argument map() can be replaced by a list comprehension. For examplecan be replaced withNow how would I do something similar for two parallel lists. In other words, I have a line of code with the following pattern:where func() takes two arguments.How can I do the same thing with a list comprehension?
map() with multiple arguments is the equivalent of using the zip() function on those extra arguments. Use zip() in a list comprehension to do the same:Generally speaking, any map(func, a1, a2, .., an) expression can be transformed to a list comprehension with [func(*args) for args in zip(a1, a2, .., an)].
