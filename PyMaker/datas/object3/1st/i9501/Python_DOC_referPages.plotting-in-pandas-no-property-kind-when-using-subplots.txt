I'm an absolute pandas/matplotlib beginner and I can't figure out this issue after quite a few searches.Just learned that in order to format dates (basically space them out), I need to work an additional thing called fig (for figure):However, when I try to change my data kind to `bar, I'm getting the following error:AttributeError: Unknown property kindIt worked perfectly when I simply didBut then mdates.DateFormatter wouldn't work.I'm missing something. What is it?
Pandas DataFrames, such as pandoc, have a plot method with a kind parameter.So it is possible to make a plot usingNotice that ax=tg is used to tell pandoc to draw on the matplotlib Axes, tg.In contrast, matplotlib Axes, such as tg, have a plot method, but tg.plot does not have a kind parameter. Instead, to make a bar plot with an Axes object, call its tg.bar method.Using the pandoc.plot method, you could make a bar plot using something likeNote that tg.set_xticklabels is used to set the xticklabels instead of mdates.DateFormatter. When making a bar plot the underlying bar plot xtick values are integers:You can only use mdates.DateFormatter when the xtick values are dates.Since a bar plot has a fixed number of bars, there is no advantage to using a dynamic formatter like mticker.FuncFormatter; you are best off simply setting the xticklabels using the Axes.set_xticklabels method.creates a list of N empty strings. For example, ['']*2 evaluates to ['', ''].is equivalent toSo labels, skip = ['']*N, 10 is equivalent to Python slice notation, e.g. x[start:end:step] is explained here. For example,So in the code above, pandoc['date_time'].dt.strftime('%Y-%m-%d') is a sequence of strings and if we call it x, then x[skip//2::skip] is a new sequence which starts with x[skip//2] and then steps by skip amount. skip//2 divides skip by 2 using integer-division.labels begins as a list of N empty strings. With skip=10, the assignmentreplaces every 10th element (starting at skip//2) with a date string from pandoc['date_time'].dt.strftime('%Y-%m-%d').pandoc['date_time'] is a time series. pandoc['date_time'].dt.strftime('%Y-%m-%d') uses the Series.dt.strftime method to format the dates into date-strings in %Y-%m-%d format.
