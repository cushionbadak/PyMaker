When I inherit Atom from atom.api, I can not create a member variable.What mechanism explains this?When b.init() is executed, I get the error msg:AttributeError: 'B' object has no attribute 'var'
Atom has overridden descriptors. They are responsible for the different behavior of the use of getters (self.x) and setters (self.x = 42). That's why you've got the error. For more information read:1) About descriptors in Python: https://docs.python.org/3/howto/descriptor.html2) About Atom framework: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/atom/0.3.6
Declare the variable like you would a static member of the classIt will then be considered by atom as a valid class field.
