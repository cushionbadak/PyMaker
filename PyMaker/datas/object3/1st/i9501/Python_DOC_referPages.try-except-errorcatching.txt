I'm trying to force the user to input a number using try-except in python however it seems to have no effect.
Actually, if the user inputs for example a string, "hello"/5 yields a TypeError, not a ValueError, so catch that instead
You could try to make the input value an int int(value), which raises ValueError if it cannot be converted.Here's a function that should do what you want with some comments:Once defined, call the function to get input from the userYou should also be sure to except and handle KeyboardInterrupt anytime you're expecting user input, because they may put in ^C or something else to crash your program.
