consider I am having a following code in my bin as follows(filename: emp_dsb):In my command line I will execute the "emp_dsb", so that above code will execute the main function from "employee_detail_collector.EmpCollector"Code in (employee_detail_collector.EmpCollector) main():Now I need to add some argument here for emp_dsb, that is like "emp_dsb create_emp" should invoke a new set of functionalities for creating a employee, which is also needs to be added in same main()someone look and let me know your ideas, If not clear let me know so that i will try to make it more clear.
the standard way to use command line arguments is to do this:read up on the doc of sys.argv.then there are fancier ways like the built-in argparse and the 3rd party docopt or click.
I would personally use 'argparse' module. Here is the link to a dead simple code sample.
