I am trying to implement multiprocessing in my code, and so, I thought that I would start my learning with some examples.  I used the first example found in this documentation.When I run the above code I get an AttributeError: can't get attribute 'f' on <module '__main__' (built-in)>.  I do not know why I am getting this error.  I am also using Python 3.5 if that helps.
This problem seems to be a design feature of multiprocessing.Pool. See https://bugs.python.org/issue25053. For some reason Pool does not always work with objects not defined in an imported module. So you have to write your function into a different file and import the module.File: defs.pyFile: run.pyIf you use print or a different built-in function, the example should work. If this is not a bug (according to the link), the given example is chosen badly.
