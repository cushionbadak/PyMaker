First, make sure you use unicode strings: add the "u" prefix to strings:Then you can write or append to a file:I recommend you to use the io module which is Python 2/3 compatible.To read your text file in one piece:The result content is an Unicode string.If you decode this string using UTF8 encoding, you'll get bytes string like this:Edit using writelines. The method writelines() writes a sequence of strings to the file. The sequence can be any iterable object producing strings, typically a list of strings. There is no return value.
