I am writing a Pokemon game and I want to make folders to save different types of Pokemon, as well as other sorts of information, in. I want to use folders because it would be really messy if I were to save all my data into a single file.Is it possible to create folders with a Python program?  This would make it easier and cleaner for me when I try to import the Pokemon data from external websites.
You can run any command that you want with python by doing:You can run any command that you would usually run in terminal inside the popen.You can use the popen() command in both UNIX(Linux, macOS) as well as Windows OS.You can learn more regarding this by taking a look in the python documentation.https://docs.python.org/2/library/subprocess.html
You can use open with the a mode, which opens a file in append mode, and creates it if it does not exist:
If you'd like to create folders (or directories), you need os.mkdir:To create some deep folders at once, use os.makedirs:Then all that structure of three folders will be created. Tutorialspoint has a short tutorial about os.mkdir. 
You can use with statement like this:The above will just create an empty file, if you want to write something to the created file, you can try:When you use with statement you do not need to close your files explicitly because they are closed autmatically at the end of the block.
