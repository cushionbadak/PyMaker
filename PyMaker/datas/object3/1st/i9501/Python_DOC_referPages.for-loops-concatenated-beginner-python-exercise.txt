Hi everyone I’m writing because I’m stuck with an exercise in which I should only use for loops and if/else statements. I found a way but practically I’m iterating the same block of code four times and I’m really looking for a way to automate it.I know that probably this is not the best way to solve the exercise but now I’m not looking for the most efficient way (I already found on the solutions of the exercise), I’m asking you how can I use for to iterate the block of code The exercise tells me to create a program that takes an IP address from the keyboard and validates that it can be interpreted as a valid IP address.An IP address consists of 4 numbers, separated from each other with a full stop. Each number can have no more than 3 digits. (Examples: 127.0.0.1)ImportantThis challenge is intended to practise for loops, and if/else statements, so although it would probably be written for real using regular expressions we don't want you to use them here even if you know what they are.This is what I made:
I would also say, split() is the way to go. Your question was if there was a way to use your logic and still not have to repeat code 4 times. To achieve that you could do something like this:As i said, i would also recommend using split() - this is just to try and provide an answer closer to your question. Also please note that this code (same as yours) will mark ip adresses containing letters, not only numbers, as OK.
Well, you have to ask yourself the right question: "can I do better?". Please always do that. Yes, in fact, you can. The code that deals with numbers validation between dots is essentially the same. So you should split the string on dots and use for loop to validate each group:
how about that? split the string at the dots . and check if between the dots there are numbers in the valid range (that would also accept '255.255.255.255')
