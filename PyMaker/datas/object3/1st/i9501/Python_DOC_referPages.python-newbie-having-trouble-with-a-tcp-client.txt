Basically I'm just starting out with python networking and python in general and I can't get my TCP client to send data. It says:The code is as follows: Thanks for your help in advance!
You are probably using Python 3.X. socket.send() expected a bytes type argument but data is an unicode string. You must encode the string using str.encode() method. Similarly you would use bytes.decode() to receive the data:
If you are using python2.x your code is correct. As in the documentation for  python2 socket.send() takes a string parameter. But if you are using python3.x you can see that socket.send() takes a bytes parameter. Thus you have to convert your string data into bytes using str.encode(). So your code might look like this instead.
So I encoded the data with utf-8 as was suggested by a few people and rewrote my code which fixed the odd syntax error. Now my code works perfectly. Thank you to everyone who posted but especially to @FJSevilla. The working code is as follows:
