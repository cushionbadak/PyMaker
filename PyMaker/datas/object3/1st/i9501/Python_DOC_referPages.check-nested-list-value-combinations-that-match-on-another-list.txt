I have a list that represents a tic tac toe board.I have a list of win combinations that are on a nested list.I have a function that iterates the wins list. If a combination from the wins list exists on the board list, the function should return true.Example:This should (i think) return True, cause 3 digits from the win list are on the board list but by some reason it keeps returning false.Am I missing something on my code?Thanks
First of all, it checks only first 'win' combination ([7,8,9]) and then just returns false. Second, you can't check it using in operator like so.So if you want to check if the combination is on the board (in the same order):if the order does not matter:
There are two problems with your code:w in board does not check whether the individual elements of w are in board, but whether w, as a whole, is an element of board, which is not the case for any wyou return False as soon as the first w does not work out (assuming that the first check would work), instead of after you tested all the wInstead, you can use a nested any and all to check whether for any of the winning combinations, all the elements are in the board.Alternatively, since order does not matter and each of the elements should appear only once, you can use sets instead (note the inner {...} in wins) and use issubsetof:
You need to dedent your return false, because you end cycle after first iteration
You need to check if elements in board match an element of win. Your current code would always return False since it checks if [4, 5, 6, 9] is in an element of win. One way to check if elements in board matches a winning combination is to intersect the sets of board wth all elements in win:
