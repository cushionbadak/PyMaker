Recently I've deployed a python bot on Heroku and every time I try to run it, this error pops up. 2016-12-28 T04:32:08.770156+00:00 app[worker.1]:File "bot.py", line 432016-12-28 T04:32:08.770168+00:00 app[worker.1]: else:2016-12-28 T04:32:08.770171+00:00 app[worker.1]:^2016-12-28 T04:32:08.770172+00:00 app[worker.1]: IndentationError: expected an indented blockHere's the code block it refers to. I do understand the error they throwing but can't see the cause? (Code was from a Git repository.) Can someone help? Give me an eye? or do roast me XD
First, you cannot have no code under the if statement. That is the most likely culprit and you can fix this by adding pass in that block. If you want to test this for yourself, you can run the following very simple example and verify that the interpreter gives an error when you try to run it.Second, it is difficult to tell because of re-encoding on SO, but you may also have mixed spaces and tabs incorrectly. If you are using vim, you can do set list to show the invisible characters and make sure you are consistent.
Your code has an if statement with no instructions:Python expects an indent, but since everything is commented out, there is none.This is basically what the error indicates:2016-12-28 T04:32:08.770168+00:00 app[worker.1]: else:2016-12-28 T04:32:08.770171+00:00 app[worker.1]:^2016-12-28 T04:32:08.770172+00:00 app[worker.1]: IndentationError:  expected an indented blockYou cannot have an else statement that is not following an indented block (that is, an if block, or even a for).If you want to keep the if in plain code, add a pass statement, as for the following else:Then, the code will not raise any IndentationError.
You need to include something in the if statement. Just type Or set a useless variable for now.And also, indent everything by one indent I think (because of the first line, correct me if I'm wrong.)
