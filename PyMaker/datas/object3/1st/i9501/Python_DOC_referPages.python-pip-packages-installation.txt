I have both python 2.7 and python 3.5.2 installed, both open IDLE just fine, my question is, if I go into the Cmd on Windows and type python it goes for the 2.7 version, how do I set it up so I have something like python2 and python3? And finnally if i run python pip install package how do I know if it's installing for python 2.7 or 3.5.2.
You can use Python Launcher in Windows CMD.Execute script:or:You can use pip the same way:for install NumPy in Python 2.7 or:for install NumPy in Python 3.5
Rather than using pip, use pip2 when targeting Python 2, and pip3 for Python 3.Windows does have these pip2 and pip3 version-specialized commands.If you already installed a package and want to know what Python version of the package you installed, run an interpreter and import it.
