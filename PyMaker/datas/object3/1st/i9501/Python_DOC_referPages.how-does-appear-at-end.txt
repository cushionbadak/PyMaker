I am trying to understand pos,endpos and slice which using RegexObject in Python.My Code is as following:My question: As string abcd.. is not sliced in >>> pat.match('abcd..',0,4) How does $ appear at endpos ? 
The match method docs:The optional pos and endpos parameters have the same meaning as for the search() method.refer to the search method, which saysThe optional parameter endpos limits how far the string will be searched; it will be as if the string is endpos characters long, so only the characters from pos to endpos - 1 will be searched for a match. If endpos is less than pos, no match will be found; otherwise, if rx is a compiled regular expression object, rx.search(string, 0, 50) is equivalent to rx.search(string[:50], 0).Providing an endpos of 4 is equivalent to slicing the string to a length of 4, so endpos is considered the new end of the string, and $ matches there. This is a bizarre contrast to the interaction of pos and ^, which explicitly does not work that way:the '^' pattern character matches at the real beginning of the string and at positions just after a newline, but not necessarily at the index where the search is to start.
