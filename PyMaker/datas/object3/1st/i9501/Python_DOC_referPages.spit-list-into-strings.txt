I have a list of strings: And I want to test if a string is present in this list: So test for example if 'GTA' (= subsequence) is present in my list I tried: But it doesn't work. Can somebody help me? 
This is not correct, as it will compare the entire element of the list with subsequence. Instead, do this,You can compress this into one line using the any() function. Do this using,
You are looking for a sub-sequence, sodoesn't work because it checks against the whole list.You should do:Note: I don't recommend using "list" as a variable name, as it's a preserved keyword in Python.
You can try with a list comprehension like this:This will return True if there is any sequence inside the array that has "GTA" in it.

Just a sample code for your reference, please help to check whether it is for you.It is the for compare one list in another list.
One way to accomplish this task is by using regural expressions.That way you can search within strings in the list for your pattern.Below is a simple example:Note the re.compile compiles the pattern so futher searches are much faster.
