I have a data dictionary with eeg, gyroscope and other data. For processing, I want to extract eeg and gyroscope data in seperate dicts. Therefore I have two lists with the keys of eeg and gyroscope. I made it work with two dict comprehensions, but maybe there is a smoother solution to this.
Minor modifications, but this should be only a little bit cleaner:Or, if you prefer an one-liner:
No, two dict comprehensions are pretty much it. You can use dictionary views to select the keys that are present, perhaps:Use data.viewkeys() if you are using Python 2 still.Dictionary views give you a set-like object, on which you can then use set operations; & gives you the intersection.Note that your approach, using key in eegKeys and key in gyroKeys could be sped up by inverting the loop (loop over the smaller list, not the bigger dictionary):
