I'm writing the file to csv, but it says list index is out of range. Here is my code. I have a directory with 85 files.Here is the error.
finditer() returns an iterator and it's always truthy:In other words, the if iter: check would always pass - even if there are no matches. And, when there are no matches, you are getting an IndexError while accessing the first element of an empty list here: [i for i in iter][0].
Iterator should not be used as test condition, it will always return True.You should change you code to:findall will return a list which can be used as test condition.
