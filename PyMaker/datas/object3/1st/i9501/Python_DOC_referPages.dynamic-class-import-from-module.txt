In Python, I have to import a class from a module in a package. I am trying to make my program extendable without editing the source code by having apps in a directory. For Example, I have the following directory structure:In both a.py and b.py, there would be a class that I would like to import directly into main.py as though the class was in main.py all along. I don't know the names of these apps or the classes inside them. Is there a way to do this?I have also googled around for an answer to no avail.EDIT.I forgot to explain that I needed the imports to be dynamic. Sorry for the trouble.
I fixed this with help from a friend. Thank you all for your suggestions.
I think this should work, in main.pyor alternatively you can also
If you just want the class in main's namespace, then (in main.py):You'll need to put an __init__.py file in the Project directory as well.
