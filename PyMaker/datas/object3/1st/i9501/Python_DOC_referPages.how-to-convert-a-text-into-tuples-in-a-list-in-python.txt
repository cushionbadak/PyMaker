You can use list comprehension like below:split() is used to form a list of strings using space separator in the first time and slash in the second time (to split each sub-item to two elements)tuple() is used to transform each sub-item (which contains two elements) to a tuple.
Output:[('The', 'DT'), ('Fulton', 'NNP'), ('County', 'NNP'), ('Grand', 'NNP'), ('Jury', 'NNP'), ('said', 'VBD'), ('Friday', 'NNP'), ('an', 'DT')]
