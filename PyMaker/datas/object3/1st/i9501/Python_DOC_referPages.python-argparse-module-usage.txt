I have a program which is called like this:The problem here is that depending on the add/remove/show command it takes a variable number of arguments, just like this:So, 'add' command would take 2 string arguments, while 'remove' command would take 1 only argument and 'show' command wouldn't take any argument.I know how to make a basic argument parser using the module argparse, but I don't have much experience with it, so I started from this:But I don't know how to continue and how to implement this functionality depending on the command. Thanks in advance.
