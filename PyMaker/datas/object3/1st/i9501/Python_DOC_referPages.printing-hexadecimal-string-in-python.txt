I'm on x86, little-endian. So I got this data from a udp packet. gives something like '\xfe\x15'which I understand to be the little-endian layout in memory. The value should be represented as 0x15feIn C i do, and it gives me 0x15fe straightaway. How do I get Python to print the hexadecimal value out properly? Many thanks. 
You can convert the bytestring to an int using struct, like this:Here <h represents a little-endian 2-bytes signed integer. Use <H if your data is unsigned. Check out the documentation for more.Then you can print it using print(hex(num)) or similar:As a side note, remember that sock.recvfrom(1024) may return more or less than 2 bytes. Keep that into account when parsing.
