Natural Text
As a research case I have a literary novel that consists of three main characters who each have their own chapters in the novel. That is: the first chapter is for character X (Aaron), the second for character Y (Sigerius) and the third for character Z (Joni), the fourth for character X, the fifth for character Y, the sixth for character Z, and so on... I want to count the amount of words of all the chapters that are dedicated to character X, character Y and character Z. This is the Python code I am currently working on with regards to the chapters of one specific character (Aaron):I have manually decided on which lines of the txt-file the different chapters (per character) begin and end. I use islice to split the txt-file into specific chapters (contained between specific line numbers) in order to calculate the amount of words contained between those line numbers (i.e. the chapters). However, I don't seem to find a way to operationalize islice for this purpose in the right way. I get this AttributeError: 'tuple' object has no attribute 'split'. What I want is to store all chapters of a specific character in one variable (e.g. chaptersAaron), so that I can do stuff with with it, e.g. count the total amount of words and search the occurence of specific words in it.Does anyone have a suggestion with regards to the correct usage of islice for my purposes? Alternative options to split the text into chapters are also very welcome. 
The solution should be:the problem with you code example is, that you mix iterators, lists and tupels.islice(f, 1125, 1249) is an iteratorchaptersAaron = (chapterAaron1, ...) is a tupeland you want to use both as a listThe idea in my solution is to start with an empty list chaptersAaron=[].Transform all iterators into lists by [elem for elem in islice(f, 0, 123)] and connecinate the lists with chaptersAaron+=chapterAaron1
