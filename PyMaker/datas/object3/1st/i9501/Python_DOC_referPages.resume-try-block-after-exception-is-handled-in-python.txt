I have a script in python which works as shown below. Each function performs a completely different task and not related to each other. My problem is if function2() is having an issue during the execution process then function3(), function4(), function5() will not execute. I know you will say to handle this by catching the exception (try..except) but then i have to catch every exception which is not i am looking for. In a nutshell how do i code where my other functions are not impacted if any of the function is having issue. Ideally it should exclude that problematic function and let the other function to execute.
No need to write multiple try/except. Create a list of your function and execute them. For example, you code should be like:OR, create a decorator and add that decorator to each of your function. Check A guide to Python's function decorators. For example, your decorator should be like:Now add this decorator with your function definition as:Functions having this decorator added to them won't raise any Exception
You can use exception and catch all sort of exceptions like thisfor large number of functions you can usethus you can iterate over the keys of the dictionary for the function and iterate on the parameters 
As of Python 3.4, a new context manager as contextlib.suppress is added which as per the doc:Return a context manager that suppresses any of the specified exceptions if they occur in the body of a with statement and then resumes execution with the first statement following the end of the with statement.In order to suppress all the exceptions, you may use it as:
