In /var/www, when  I try to import a python module, let's say Library, located in /root/anaconda3/lib/python3.5/site-packages, it gives me an Internal Server Error. But, it works well when I run the same script in the root directory.How can I make it work in /var/www? Any suggestions?Edit:
You need to add the path to your 'Library' to your Pathon search path. You can do this from within you Python script.Also you can add the path to your PYTHONPATH environment variable.
