Natural Text
I have written the following code and have executed it several times:However, only the 'some text' is written to the file. I have printed the row text and it produces the correct output. What am I doing wrong?
Open the file in as open("Output.txt", "a") instead of just "w". This will allow you to append the rest of the text.https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#reading-and-writing-filesHave Fun!
