I have a list of tuples like this (generated from a select statement with sqlite3):And the list carries on. It's a list of tuples and its got a product name and the quantity bought of that item. I need to create anoter list of tuples of the top 5 items from that list of tuples with 5 of the items with the highest quantity bought. For example with the list above it would turn out like this:Is there any way to do this?Thanks for any answers.
Just use sorted and slice the first 5 items:
You can use heapq.nlargest():heapq.nlargest(n, iterable[, key])Return a list with the n largest elements from the dataset defined by  iterable. key, if provided, specifies a function of one argument that  is used to extract a comparison key from each element in the iterable:  key=str.lower Equivalent to: sorted(iterable, key=key, reverse=True)[:n]Output:
Output:Only drawback: It sorts the whole list
Hope it will help you
