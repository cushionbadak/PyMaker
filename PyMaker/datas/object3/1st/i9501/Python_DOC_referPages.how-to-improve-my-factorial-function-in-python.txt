I am new to python and I am required to create a factorial function. I have created a function that gives the factorial of a number but I want some help from stackflow community.Here is my codeAnd this is my output:I am getting 120 (factorial value) but I am also getting other values like 1, 2, 6. How can I only print factorial value and not other values.
You can just use the Math library in the Python, Try this following codeAnswer : 120Or, In your Code, you are trying to print the 'b' inside the loop, So your getting prints in every loop time, just put the print b in the out side of the loop
Unindent the print statement so that it is only executed after the loop instead of within it, for every step.
Just to show you a different approach:
If you need to write a function then you'll want something more like this:This calculates the factorial recursively. If you want an iterative function then the following will do it:Otherwise, you could just import the math library and use math.factorial(n) if you don't need to create the function yourself.
Factorials are best calculated with a generator function. To retrieve the last item you can use deque.
