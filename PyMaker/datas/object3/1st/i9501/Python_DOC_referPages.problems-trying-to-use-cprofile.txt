I am trying to run the code below at Python 2.7 GUI:However here is the error I have:Any idea how can I solve it?
You need to run this from the command line, not a GUI or the interactive Python prompt. Seeing the >>> means you are on the interactive Python prompt.On the command line a.k.a terminal window, change to the directory in which abc.py is located and enter:I get this:The option -m does this:-m mod : run library module as a script (terminates option list)The Python version is 2.7.12.EDITIf you want to do it from the interactive prompt, probably the easiest way is to use IPython or Jupyter Notebook. Then you can do this:
python -m ...  is not itself Python syntax: it's a syntax for starting Python from outside.   Therefore, the Python interpreter (GUI or not) will fail to process that command.  (We know you're working from inside the Python interpreter because of the telltale >>> prompt.)What does "from outside" mean?  It means you need to type that command at the > prompt in the Command Window (in Windows) or at the $ prompt in a terminal window running the bash shell (in other likely OSes).
