Natural Text
I have a list of tuples [(ID,date),(ID,date),...]. The same ID can occur many times or only once. If ID occur more than once i only want the most recent one. I want this:One of the tuples look like:The ID field has index 2 and date field index 4
You can use a defaultdict() with an empty string as the default value:If the elements in each tuple are too many to unpack as above, you can capture the tuple with a single variable and then use index to access it, for instance:
Use itertools.groupby to group your tuples by the first element, then select the last element from each group:
An approach is using filter() like below:Output:
Output
If you don't want to use any library, this should work:Thus, if the ID is not in list2, it will append the touple, while if it is and the i date value is higher than the one in list2, it will replace it.If your touples have other values, then just adapt it for your ID and date positions. For the case (value,ID,value,value,date,value,...) it would be:Hope this helped!
