You are not loosing the precision. Python is just changing it's representation by making precision. If you want to display the value as it is, you may use repr() as:which will print your number as a string:

Instead, just specify the desired precision when formatting. For example:Also, resist the urge to round floating-point numbers to "fix" perceived accuracy problems. For example, you might be inclined to do this:Source
Of course, you can use string formatting tools, as @parik and @Molnuddin hoted. Also you can use decimal arithmetic module decimal for operations for Python 2 or Python 3 .
