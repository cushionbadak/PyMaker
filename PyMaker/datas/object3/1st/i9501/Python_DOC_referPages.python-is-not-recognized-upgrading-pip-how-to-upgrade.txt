This question already has an answer here:“python” not recognized as a command                    11 answers                I tried to upgrade pip in Python with command python -m pip install --upgrade pip, but I get this error in the command prompt on Windows:Kindly help.
You don't have Python in your PATH environment variable. You should add to your PATH environment variable ;C:\Python27;C:\Python27\Scripts (or wherever you installed your Python).Alternatively, use py -m pip in place of python -m pip. If you have a late version of Python installed, py launcher will be in your path already.For more details, read up on using Python in Windows.
