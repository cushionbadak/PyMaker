I just learned async with python 3.5 yesterday.here is what I want to accomplish today.Is this possible using python async/await?
You have a few issues in your code:  requests does not support asyncio, use aiohttp instead.  Your couroutines will run only when the loop is running:  Call loop.run_until_complete() only once in your code, and schedule many (short or long) tasks using await (or asycio.ensure_future() or loop.create_task()).Here is an example doing something similar to what you were trying to do:
your time.sleep() is blocking; you need to use asyncio.sleep().and why do you run your loop inside while True?also note that asyncio will only help speedup io-bound tasks (e.g. get data from the net). it will not help you speed up cpu-bound tasks. for that you need threads or multiplrocessing.seeing that you have updated your question, here a small update in my answer: also requests is blocking and does not play nice with asyncio. aiohttp is similiar in its functionality but does play nice with asyncio
