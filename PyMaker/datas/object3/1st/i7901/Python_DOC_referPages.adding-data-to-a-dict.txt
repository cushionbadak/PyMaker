So, I'm trying to build a Flask app that keep track off my TV shows (just doing for fun)... but right now I'm trying to deal with the API itself (TVmaze), I'm gonna use "Arrow" as an example. What I want to do is create a dict like this all_seasons = {season_number:{'ep_number':{'ep_name':'Exemple...', ep_num: ep_number}}} so for example if I want to get the name of the season 4 22th episode I would do like this all_seasons[4][22]['ep_name']and somehow I manage to do that (sort of), but that is what I'm getting:I'm only getting the 23th episode of each season. The code that I'm using:I put the print statment just for debug, and with the print it works. Shows all of the episodes per seasonand it goes on.
You are replacing the dictionaries on each iteration instead of adding the new data. Try something like this:all_seasons.setdefault(temp, {}) will add a new entry in all_seasons with key temp and value {} only if it didn't exist already, and then return all_seasons[temp] (either the already existing value or the newly set one) (see dict.setdefault).
