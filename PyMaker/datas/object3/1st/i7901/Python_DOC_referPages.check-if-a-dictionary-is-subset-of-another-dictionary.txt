I am trying to compare 2 Strings and check if all characters in String a are present in String b. I am currently using the following method by converting the string into a dictionary and comparing it with the other. But there are many chances that it gives a false positive.Please suggest any better way to do this
If I understand your problem correctly, you don't need to compare dictionaries, but sets:And if you want a case-insensitive compare, you can call lower() on both strings:You could also compare whole words by using split():
I would use the set object. Documentation can be found here.The < operator is overloaded to be is_subset.  To get the answer to print "Yes", I've also converted the strings to lowercase.
You can use the builtin all function for this. all() will return true if every element is true and false otherwise. We use in to check if a character is in the string y and we will do this for every character in x.
