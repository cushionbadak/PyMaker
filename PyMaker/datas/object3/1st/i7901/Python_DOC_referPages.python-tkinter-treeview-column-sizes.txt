I have a Treeview in tkinter (Python 3.6 on Linux, but the same happens on windows) which I'm using to emulate a sort of spread-sheet layout.  My problem is that, if I run the example code, below, and resize say "Column 1" then as "Column 1" gets bigger, "Column 2" gets smaller.  However, if I drag out the final column to the right, the scroll bar expands, and now I can resize column 1 without changing the size of column 2 (instead the whole tree view expands).  If you then resize, say, column 1 again, until all columns fit in the view, the behaviour seems to revert to the original.What causes this change of behaviour?  Both, how can I stop it, and how can I ensure it's the default?Minimal working example:
The best control you have in a Treeview is using the stretch attribute of columns. If you make all of your columns' stretch and minwidth attributes.
