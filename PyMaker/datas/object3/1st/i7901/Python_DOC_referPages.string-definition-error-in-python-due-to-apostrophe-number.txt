In codefight, there is a question:Which of the given string definitions are incorrect?s = 'abacaba's = "abacaba"s = ' 'abacaba' 's = ""abacaba""s = ' ' 'abacaba' ' 's = """abacaba"""The definitions in 3 and 4 are wrong.My question is if 3 and 4 are wrong way of defining string, shouldn't 5 and 6 be wrong for similar reasoning?
To Answer your question When you use 3 single quotes or 3 double quotes you can have a string that spans multiple lines. That is the reason why you have it for your doc strings. Please see the below example.However when 2 single quotes('') are used or 2 double quotes ("") are used and if you need the string to be encapsulated inside they quotation it should be like below.If you don't do this python interpreter expects a value for 'Hello' instead of considering it as a string.
3 and 4 are wrong because '' is empty string and abacaba will be treated as variable so you need to write it as '' + str(abacaba) + '' which will concate your string and also you have to assign value of abacaba before use.Now your answer when you use """abacaba""" python will find three different strings "", "abacaba" and "" and your result will be 'abacaba'.this happen because you need + sign to concate string stored in variable but for string like "abc" and "xyz" if you write s="abc" "xyz" or s="abc""xyz" you will get result 'abcxyz'Here is few examples for you:
Triple quotes are used most commonly for method descriptions in python.  These method descriptions are called docstrings and are represented as multi-line string literals """ """Here is a sample in python.The output of this print statement will be:EDIT : As @Varad and @abccd have mentioned, it is also used for multi- line string literals.
