So inspect.getdoc should be the preffered option.The following is based on your original question:To get the documentation of PIL functions you could use:To get the documentations of all functions in a module you need to use getattr:To get a list of all docstrings:Or if you need to corresponding name then a dict would be better:However not everything actually has a documentation. For example the PIL.Image module has no docstring:and when attempting to get the docstring of an instance you might get surprising results:That's because PIL.__version__ is a string instance and simply shows the docstring of its class: str:
