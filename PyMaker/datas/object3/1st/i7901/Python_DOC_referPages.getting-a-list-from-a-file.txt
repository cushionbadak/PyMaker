Natural Text
In a hangman game I am making, I have a text file containing this:So using file io, I wrote this:But all I get is:How can I make it a list divided into the 4 subgroups, which are also in 4 sublists, and lastly how I remove the '\n's?
If you change the single quotes to double quotes on lines 3, 4, and 5, then your file would be valid json, in which case you can easily parse the whole thing with the json module:data.json:Your script:Result:If you're absolutely committed to not changing a single thing in your file, including quote marks, then I suppose you could also use ast.literal_eval. But this is not the idiomatic solution.Incidentally, ['apple ios,a useless operating system',1] is valid syntax, but if you want this element to have a length of three like its siblings, you probably meant to write ['apple ios','a useless operating system',1]
The file contains a valid Python literal, so you can use the ast..literal_eval() function to parse it directly into a list:You could also change the first line of the file to cat1 = [ and then use astatement instead of doing all that.
