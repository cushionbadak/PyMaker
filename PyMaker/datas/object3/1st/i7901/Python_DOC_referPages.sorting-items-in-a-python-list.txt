I want to create a function that takes the following arguments:  my_list: a list of values which can be empty strings, null, floats, int or str zero_val the value that should be the 0th itemSomething like:with args: So in this example, the list should be returned with "bonjour" as the 0th item:
You can try this:This algorithm filters my_list by removing all instances of zero_val after assigning zero_val to the first position in the new_list and then extends new_list by the filtered list. 
You can use index() to find your first match, and then also for slicing like:Code:Test Code:Results:
If there's just one occurrence of zero_val in your list, the solution is as simple as
This works if the item occurs only once: Use remove() to remove the item from the list, which raises a ValueError if it didn't exist in the list, otherwise reinsert it at index 0:
if you have more than one occurrence you can use:input:output:
I guess you can use remove, sort and insert, i.e.:demo
