how do you add value to a key without overwriting the first value? Here is an example of my code:The output is TrueLet's say if a student ID maps with the same key and I wanted the output to be the expected:
You need to either detect that the key is already present in course_to_dict_id and add to that set, or use dict.setdefault() to give you an empty set whenever you try to retrieve a key that isn't set yet.The latter is more concise:This produces {'MTH001': {2763358, 2763567}, 'EMT003': {2788579}} as the output (each value in the dictionary a set with 1 or more integers).
