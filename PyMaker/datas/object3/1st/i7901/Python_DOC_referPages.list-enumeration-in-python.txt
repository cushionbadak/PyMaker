The snippet below is from a code tracing exercise. The part I'm confused about is the enumeration used in the for loop. From the documentation for enumerate() it looks like pair should had have values like:during the iteration, which means 'L' should have values from 0 through 7 and 'M', the tuples ([0, 1, 2], [1, 1, 2]) through ([0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 2]). However when I run this code through the debugger, I see both L and M are lists instead. For example, when i = 0, L = [0, 1, 2] and M = [1, 1, 2] and so forth. Can someone please explain what is going on?
With the line for i,pair in enumerate(pairs):, i gets the index values in the list pairs and goes from 0 to 9 while pair gets the values from the list pairs one by one. So for i = 0, the pair is ([0, 1, 2], [1, 1, 2]). Then you call (L, M) = pair and this means L get the first list while M gets the second list in the tuple. Hope this helps.
Of course L and M are lists. If you runyou will get the desired result. So the tuple you are looking for is saved in pairs. With the lineyou split up the tuple referenced by pair into its elements, which are – in the first iteration – the two lists referenced by A and B.The above line essentially means which is equivalent towhich in turn means "assign A to L and assign B to M".
