Take a random DataFrame:Pandas allows defining new columns in two ways:As the DataFrame name gets longer, this notation becomes less readable.And then there's the query function:It returns the slices of the df that match the condition. Is there a way to run something like DataFrame.query() but for operations on the frame?
Function DataFrame.eval() does exactly this:And warning-free assignment:More generally, pandas.eval():The following arithmetic operations are supported: +, -, *, /, **, %,  // (python engine only) along with the following boolean operations: |  (or), & (and), and ~ (not). Additionally, the 'pandas' parser allows  the use of and, or, and not with the same semantics as the  corresponding bitwise operators.Pandas docs say that eval supports only Python expression statements (e.g., a == b), but pandas silently supports abs(a - b) and maybe other statements. The rest throw an error. For example:returns NotImplementedError: 'Delete' nodes are not implemented.
Here's a way using assign and add:Note: The assign creates a copy of your dataframe, therefore you aren't distorting the original data. You'll need to reassign to a different variable or back to df.
Consider the dataframe named my_obnoxiously_long_dataframe_nameIf you want cleaner code, create a temp variable name that's smaller
