I currently finalising a Scrapy project however I have quite a lengthy pipelines.py file.I noticed that in my settings.py the pipe lines are show as follows (trimmed down):I have tried the following ways to rectify this.1.) I created a new file/folder and tried referencing it from pipeline in the same manner.Folder was myPipelines/Test.py with a class name TestPipeline then referenced in pipeline settings as proj.myPipelines.Test.TestPipeline': 100,.This threw me errors.I then thought I could export the module and import into my current pipelines.py and it would take the reference from that. I added an empty __init__.py in my myPipelines directory and then added from myPipelines.Test import TestPipeline but scrapy still throws an error of...Many thanks in advance!
When you start a scrapy project, you get a directory tree like this:And the generated pipelines.py looks like this:But your scrapy project can reference any Python class as item pipelines. One option is to convert the generated one-file pipelines module to a package within its own directory, with submodules.Notice the __init__.py file inside the pipelines/ dir:The individual modules inside the pipelines/ dir could look like this:You can read more about packages here.The __init__.py files are required to make Python treat the  directories as containing packages; this is done to prevent  directories with a common name, such as string, from unintentionally  hiding valid modules that occur later on the module search path. In  the simplest case, __init__.py can just be an empty file, but it can  also execute initialization code for the package or set the __all__  variable, described later.And your settings.py would contain something like this:
