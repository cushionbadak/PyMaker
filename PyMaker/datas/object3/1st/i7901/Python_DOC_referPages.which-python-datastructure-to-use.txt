So I have a huge structure in MATLAB containing every single player in the english premier league (688 of them). Inside the section on a single player there are more arrays containing various statistics (tackles, crosses, goals etc) for every single game played in the season.So to clarify, I have a 688 length struct, containing around 40 elements. Each element is an array with 38 entries.What data structure would you use to store this data? I've been reading about relational databases and think I should start learning about PostgreSQL.. I just wanted to ask on here what you would use?
You definitely could use an SQL database, but if you wanted to stick with strictly python, you could take advantage of Python's object oriented programming style. I would define an object class as so:Then, when you make the object, you can access each of the values below a self defined name.Hope this gives you an idea.

In terms of built in data structures a dictionary sounds like your best bet.You can export it with the json module if that's necessary.For an external databases, SQLite is probably your best choice. It requires a lot less setup than other SQL databases. As in you can just make a .db file and start sending data to it without any administrative work.
