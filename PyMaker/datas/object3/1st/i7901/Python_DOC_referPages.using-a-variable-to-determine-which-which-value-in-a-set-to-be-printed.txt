I'm looking for a bit of help on a piece of python code I've been writing for fun, the troublesome piece of code is thus:My aim is to use randint to select a random value from my set, however, when running I get the error that 'set' object does not support indexing. I suppose then that I need to replace my use of set with something else, but I am unsure as to what would work.
The problem is that a set is an unordered collections of unique element. You should have a look at data structure for Python : You can try :
You could also use random.choice. This has the same problem where a set doesn't support indexing but you can simply convert the set to a list (which does support indexing).
