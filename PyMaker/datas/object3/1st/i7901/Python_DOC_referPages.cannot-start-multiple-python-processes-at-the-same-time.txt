I am trying to run a multiprocessing program but for some reason the processes do not start at the same time, they wait for the other one to finish. Below is a piece of the code and some outputs. Could you please advise?I am running python 2.7 on windows 10 but i tested on python 3.5 Ubuntu as well with the same results.Even though both processes are running the same function it doesn't matter for me which one finishes first because their results are not tied, I just want to use better the CPUOutput(I have to wait until P1 finishes and then P2 starts):P1 startedprocess id: 4520Match found in: 30401191 tries('done by P1 in: ', 1072.0950000286102)P2 startedprocess id: 4520Match found in: 8665524 tries('done by P2 in: ', 298.375)
You are misusing the multiprocessing.Process class interface. You need to pass the function as a target and the arguments in a list.Your logic is calling the function and passing its results as a target to the process.
