Please help, I am using extend list to append multiple values to list. I need to extend to list as a new line for every extend.I need to provide this list to csv and It has to print like two lines.
If you wanted separate lists, make them separate. Don't use list.extend(), use appending:Now list1 is a list with two objects, each itself a list:If you are using the csv module to write out your CSV file, use the csvwriter.writerows() method to write each row into a separate line:
Your desired result, list1, should be a list of two elements, that each one of them is a list by itself.
