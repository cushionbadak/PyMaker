This question already has an answer here:How can you dynamically create variables via a while loop? [duplicate]                    8 answers                I have variables text1, text2, text3. I want to print them.This code prints stringstext1text2text3, not the content of them.
While I concur with the other comments, there is a way.But please try to find a better way to do this.
The correct way to do this is python is to use dictionaries. At the moment you are taking a string object, referenced by the variable text which contains the string 'text' and concatenating it with string object 'i' to make a new string object 'texti' and making the text variable reference that. Ie all you do is make a new string object and reference it with the same variable.What you want to do is make a dictionary where the keys are the variables and the values contain your referenced objects.now if you want to get 'Hello' you would 
You don't want to do this, try using a list or a dictionary instead.
If for some reason you need to do this, you can use the function eval to parse a string as a python expression. Just replace your print(text) line withBut as James Lingham said, this is not a good idea. It's confusing to read and prone to error, and much simpler solutions exist. For example, you could just create a list [text1, text2, text3], and then loop through them.
