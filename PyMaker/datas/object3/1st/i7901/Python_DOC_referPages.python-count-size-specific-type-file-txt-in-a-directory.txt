Natural Text
In my folder, there are two types of files: html and txt. I want to know the total size of the txt files.I found this code, but how do I apply it for my needs?
You can qualify which files by adding an if to the comprehensions like:
better use glob (https://docs.python.org/3/library/glob.html) instead of os to find your files. that makes it imho more readable.
