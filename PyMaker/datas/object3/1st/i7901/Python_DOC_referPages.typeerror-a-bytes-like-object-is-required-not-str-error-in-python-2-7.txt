The following code works just fine in python 2, but spits out the following error in python 3.6.1Error Output:A little guidance would be most appreciated.
One of the major differences between Python 2.x and Python 3.x is that the latter makes a strict distinction between strings and bytes.  The recv method on a socket (I'm assuming that's what ssh is, because your code doesn't show it being assigned) returns a bytes object, not a str.  And when you split() a bytes object, you get a list of bytes, so each item in your loop is also a bytes object.So, when your code gets to the line if 'Model:' in item:, it's trying to find a str within a bytes object, which isn't valid.There are two ways you can fix this:Change the substring to a bytes object: if b'Model:' in item:.Decode the bytes read from the socket to a string: output = ssh.recv(5000).decode('UTF-8').
