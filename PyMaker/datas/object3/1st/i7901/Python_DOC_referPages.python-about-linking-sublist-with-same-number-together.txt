I need to group sublists with the same elements togetherFor example:would link [1, 0] and [2, 1] together since they both contain 1 and those two would combine into [0, 1, 2] So after linking, the new list should be like:IE: there shouldn't be same number inside a sub-list and order is not important.A longer example:after linking, it would be So how can this be done in a general way?
To group the sublists in a general way you can:Code:How:This function uses sets and an index dict to group any list with matching elements into sets and track which elements are already in a set.Test Code:Results:
One way of seeing this problem is to think of each sublist as a node in a graph. Two nodes share an edge if they have common items.The islands ("connected components" or just "components") of the graph can then be used to construct the new lists. The graph for list2 would look like this:Code sketch (untested):The above can be improved, both the way the graph is built and the way components are found can be made more efficient.This kind of thinking can be used to solve many different problems. That said, I like Stephen Rauch's solution more because of its simplicity.
