I get the error - TypeError: 'list' does not support the buffer interface   -when trying to run the following code using Cython :I'm new with Cython. It seems rather simple to me but I don't know why it is not working...
Lists aren't guaranteed to have all their entries being of the same type, therefore their memory isn't arranged as an array of C integers, which is what your memoryview expects.The Python array library should be compatible:The easiest option though is probably to use a numpy array. The arange function gives you an integer range:A few notes on data types: the type of the array and the type specified in Cython need to match. On my PC the array code works as written and the numpy code needs int32 to match with cdef int[:] and int64 (or unspecified_ to match with cdef long[:]. The best thing is to specify the data type exactly for both parts.
