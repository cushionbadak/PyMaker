I’m struggling with urllib.request and unicode. I have a script that gets a list of city names, builds geonames.org API-request URLs from them and parses the output XML Data to display geonames information exactly in the way I need it. The script works fine as long as the cities names don’t contain any non-ASCII character like ö in Köln (I have to use german city names).When I switch Hamburg with Köln the Script exits with the error message UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character '\xf6' in position 18: ordinal not in range(128). One other thing that does not work is city names with blanks in it like Bad Godesberg. Am I using the wrong method to request the XML or is it that I have to decode my city names before building the URL (which is nearly definitely the case for two-word cities as when I use Bad%20Godesberg it works)?Thanks for your help! 
You have to use urlencode, for instancePython » Documentation 21.8.4. URL Quoting Here is an example session that uses the GET method to retrieve a URL containing parameters:urllib-examples
