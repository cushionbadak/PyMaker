Natural Text
I am a just starting with coding and I am trying to solve a challenge. The challenge is to write a function that when given an key value pair with a title and url, the function will print a linked title.If the title is longer than 50 characters, truncate the title to 50 characters followed by 3 ellipses.I am trying to do this in Python. Below is what I have so far. I realize the last part is just floating there. I wasn't sure where to put it though.I was trying to create a class that I could add the key-value pair to as i will have to add more in the next challenge.Any help would be appreciated. 
My intuition is that all you want is something simple, like this.
You might want to create a different variable for the displayed truncated title and then use @property to return the property attribute. Hope this helps!
