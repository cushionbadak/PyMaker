Following a tutorial where indentation level of second return statement (return False) is right below for loop, so outside of loop.Shouldn't it be inside the for loop?I have another snippet where same indentation level results in incorrect output:When I run above snippet, result is "word list has no o in it"Why not put the return statements all under conditional checks?
So let's go through the logic of has_o_in_it(words):There's multiple words so we need to iterate them: for word in words:for each word we need to check if it contains 'o': if "o" in word:If word contains "o" we know the list does: return TrueIf word doesn't contain "o" we need to keep checking: continueIf we get through the entire list without returning True we can conclude the list does not contain "o": return False.So the code should look like:There are other (more concise ways) to write this code as well (first one is best):
I have another snippet where same indentation level results in incorrect outputThe output is only incorrect because the logic is flawed. Step over the list yourself. It'll immediately return False at three and claim no words contain an o. You shouldn't have a return in the loop. And you could keep track of it instead assuming you are wanting to see all the elements However, that's very verbose, and could rather be Or
