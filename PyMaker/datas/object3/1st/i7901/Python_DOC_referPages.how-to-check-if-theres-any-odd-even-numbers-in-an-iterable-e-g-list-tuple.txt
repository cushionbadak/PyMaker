Suppose we're checking if there's any odd numbers in a list. The most direct way is:The has_odd function checks if there's any odd numbers in a list, once an odd number is found, it returns True. But this seems a bit verbose. A more concise way using reduce is as follow:But this will iterate through all elements and is unnecessary, because once an odd number is found the result is surely True.So, are there any other ways to do this?
You can use the any() function to reduce the verbosity:Note however, any() is pretty much the same as you had originally just generalized, so don't expect a speed improvement:
first of all let's write small indicator function for "oddness" likethen we can write our indicator for "has at least one odd number" using any with imap/mapPython 2.*Python 3.*or with generator expressionExamples:
Another way. you can use not all()
