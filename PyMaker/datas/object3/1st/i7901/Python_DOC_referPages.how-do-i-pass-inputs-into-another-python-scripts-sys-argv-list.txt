I have a Python script I wrote to be called from the command line.  I am writing a GUI wrapper but do not want to change the main function.  In the GUI code, I am calling the script using subprocess.run(['./executable.py', input]) but the input is not visible in executable.py's sys.argv list.  How do I pass the input such that it would be visible to sys.argv?Here is a test script I have saved as test.py (made it executable chmod +x test.py):Here is what I get when calling this from the command line:Here is what I get when calling this from within a python shell:How do I get input.txt to show up in sys.argv?
The safest way to do this is to simply remove shell=True:The other option is to combine the list of inputs into a single string:I am not completely sure why the original method (with a list of inputs and shell=True fails) fails.  Regardless, to avoid running unintended commands/code it is best to avoid using shell=True (note on when you should use shell=True).
