In Python 3.5 this returns a generator, but there is no yield:Apart from being more apparently a generator function, is there a reason to prefer a yield'ed version, likeTo me they seem to work identically. 
Your function is indeed not a generator, but this expression is: It is a generator expression, see the reference documentation.Both a generator expression and a function body containing yield result in a generator object. Since both are an object, you can pass it around and return one from a function.A generator function and the equivalent generator expression are functionally exactly the same. They produce the same bytecode. Pick the one you feel is more readable for your use case.
