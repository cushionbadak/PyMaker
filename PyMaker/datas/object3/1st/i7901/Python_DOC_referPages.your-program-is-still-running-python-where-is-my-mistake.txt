Natural Text

First and foremost, you could have found this info in any tutorial, book, or question searched on here. Anyways....Input takes the text which will be displayed to the user when prompted in the console.Then, I could type in the number I wanted and hit enter. (Reverting to previous line)Then, the value you assigned input to would have "4". Note that this is a string.Hence, int(input(1)) isn't doing what you think it is. Your program is still "running" because it's waiting for user input.Output:
It keeps running because x and y are inputs. Inputs ask you to type in something to give them a value. Remove the input(...). Also, int() is unnecessary because 1 and 2 are already integers.
