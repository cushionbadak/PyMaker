So I have this site where I am trying to extract the values from the table below (e.g. revenue).I've tried this tutorial using Selenium, but it seems that it is unable to read the webpage's value, and displays some JavaScript instead. Any ideas how I can extract these values?
Inspected the page code and saw that the table is inside of an <iframe> tag. Take a look on: http://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/navigating.html?highlight=frameHope this helps you.
Try urllib.request library, it's very easy to use; https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.request.html 
So this is what i followed https://dvenkatsagar.github.io/tutorials/python/2015/10/26/ddlv/1) I basically installed selenium,2) extracted phantomjs3) installed beautifulsoup4) Use selenium to load the website to get the html. 5)then parse the lxml into beautifulsoup. 6) Then just work your magic!
