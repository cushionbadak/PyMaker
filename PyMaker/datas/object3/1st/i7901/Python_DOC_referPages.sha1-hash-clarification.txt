I have the following python code:Now if i send out the publicData and hash for public consumption. Is this safe? I want to check that when the user provides the publicData back it matches the hash i originally sent with my secretKey.I just wanted to check that I'm doing this correctly
It looks like you are trying to do HMACYou should try using something like itsdangerous
Well, SHA-1 isn't considered a safe hashing algorithm, so no, it isn't safe.SHA-1 is no longer considered secure against well-funded opponents. In 2005, cryptanalysts found attacks on SHA-1 suggesting that the algorithm might not be secure enough for ongoing use,[4] and since 2010 many organizations have recommended its replacement by SHA-2 or SHA-3.[5][6][7] Microsoft,[8] Google,[9] Apple[10] and Mozilla[11][12][13] have all announced that their respective browsers will stop accepting SHA-1 SSL certificates by 2017.source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1more reading: https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2005/02/cryptanalysis_o.html
