I cannot seem to get pyinstaller to correctly package a module.Example module structureExample __main__.py contentIf I run python -m myapp it runs with no errors and prints Done. If I run pyinstaller myapp I get errors stating it's a directory.If I run pyinstaller myapp/__main__.py it builds but when I execute the dist/__main__/__main__ which is generated I get ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'myapp'.How can I get pyinstaller to include myapp as a module so it can be imported?
Add an __init__.py otherwise myapp it is not a valid module/package.The missing file is:myapp/__init__.pyEDIT:You can leave __init__.py empty.Read the documentation here.The __init__.py files are required to make Python treat the directories as containing packages; this is done to prevent directories with a common name, such as string, from unintentionally hiding valid modules that occur later on the module search path. In the simplest case, __init__.py can just be an empty file, but it can also execute initialization code for the package or set the __all__ variable, described later.
