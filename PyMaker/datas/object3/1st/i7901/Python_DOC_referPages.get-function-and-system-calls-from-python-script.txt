Is there any tool, package or module available which give me details of caller and callee function, all function call and system calls?
You could use the inspect module:The inspect module provides several useful functions to help get  information about live objects such as modules, classes, methods,  functions, tracebacks, frame objects, and code objects. For example,  it can help you examine the contents of a class, retrieve the source  code of a method, extract and format the argument list for a function,  or get all the information you need to display a detailed traceback.There are four main kinds of services provided by this module: type  checking, getting source code, inspecting classes and functions, and  examining the interpreter stack.
If you want to profile your application you can write your own Stack sampler in less than 20 lines in python.Calling Sampler.start() will set the Unix signal ITIMER_VIRTUAL to be sent after the number of seconds specified by interval. This will essentially create a repeating alarm that will run the _sample method.When the signal fires, the _sample function will save the application’s stack, and keeps track of how many times we’ve sampled that same stack. Frequently sampled stacks correspond to code paths where the application is spending a lot of time.Code borrowed from here
