My code:What is supposed to happen:What happens:Where it probably goes wrong: self.map = self.orig_map[:]The above would have worked (tried and tested) for a single list, however, it doesn't seem to work for nested lists.
By saying self.map = self.orig_map[:] you are indeed making a copy of self.orig_map. However, this is a shallow copy, and the elements within self.map will still be the same objects as the elements within self.orig_map.What you need to do instead is make self.map a deep copy of self.orig_map in your __init__. E.g.
You should use deepcopyIt will recursively copy your object.
