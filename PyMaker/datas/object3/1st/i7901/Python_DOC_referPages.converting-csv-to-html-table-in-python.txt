I'm trying to take data from a .csv file and importing into a HTML table within python.This is the csv file https://www.mediafire.com/?mootyaa33bmijiqContext:The csv is populated with data from a football team [Age group, Round, Opposition, Team Score, Opposition Score, Location].  I need to be able to select a specific age group and only display those details in separate tables.  This is all I've got so far.... 
Before you begin printing the desired rows, output some HTML to set up an appropriate table structure.When you find a row you want to print, output it in HTML table row format.
First install pandas:Then run:You'll get something like:
First some imports:Now the building blocks - let's make one function for reading the CSV and another function for making the HTML table:Now just put it together :)A few notes:csv.reader works better than line splitting because it also handles quoted values and even quoted values with newlineshtml.escape is used to escape strings that could potentially contain character < or >it is often times easier to worh with dicts than tuplesusually the CSV files contain header (first line with column names) and could be easily loaded using csv.DictReader; but the Crushers.csv has no header (the data start from very first line) so we build the dicts ourselves in the function read_csvboth functions read_csv and html_table are generalised so they can work with any data, the column names are not "hardcoded" into themyes, you could use pandas read_csv and to_html instead :) But it is good to know how to do it without pandas in case you need some customization. Or just as a programming exercise.
Below function takes filename, headers(optional) and delimiter(optional) as input and converts csv to html table and returns as string.If headers are not provided, assumes header is already present in csv file.Converts csv file contents to HTML  formatted tableIn your case, function call will look like:
