I have a list:where the first item inside each sublist is the name and other two number are marks (sub1 and sub2)The nested lists can be dynamic, i.e the number of nested lists can change according to function.What I am looking for is to find I tried:but this is not correct.Is there any optimal way to do this? Since the number of subjects in my nested lists can also change.
You could just use sum and a generator expression:Or even do that inside a list comprehension:Similarly for the average of one sublist:When you have python 3.4 or newer you can replace the sum / length with statistics.mean:You asked about the best way so I probably should mention that there are packages dedicated for tabular data. For example If you have pandas it's even easier using DataFrame and mean:
A fucnitonal approach:This way will work for any sublist length
