I have a list_of_lists and I want to create a single list with all the elements of all the inner lists. I don't understand why can't use sum to achieve this.If I use reduce it works fine:
Because sum initializes with a default 0. Initialize with an empty list instead:However, it is not a good idea to flatten lists with sum (horrible performance), you could use a nested comprehension or itertools.chain.from_iterable which was created for this.
I am going to elaborate on @moses-koledoe answer. In order to flatten these lists (effectively, that's what you're trying to achieve), employ itertools.chain.If you want to avoid the unpacking syntax (*list_of_lists), use the from_iterable variation of the same functionality:Actually, the second method might be a little more performant on large lists since it doesn't construct an intermediate tuple of args required to call the chain function but works on the provided iterable (which could be a generator) directly.
