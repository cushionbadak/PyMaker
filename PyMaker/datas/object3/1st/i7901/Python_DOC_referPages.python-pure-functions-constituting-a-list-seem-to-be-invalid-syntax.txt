I am drawing dozens of functions as subplots, by storing pure functions as list. I find many different functions are considered the same. Here is a simplified example, where two cosine functions are drawn.The plot shows both $\cos (4\pi t)$ functions, but one should be $\cos (2\pi t)$. I guess the list formed by several pure functions are invalid in python, is it so? If so, is there an alternative syntax? I am new to Python so there may have been some glaring errors.
Your list_fun list contains two identical functions because of how you defined it. Both functions return math.cos(2*math.pi*i*t), where i has its final value, 2. You could copy i to another variable to get this to work:
