I want to group similar strings, however, I would prefer to be smart to catch whether conventions like '/' or '-' are diverged instead of letter differences.Given following input:I want to group strings with respect to restricted set of letters, where output should be:I'm aware I can get similar strings using difflib but it doesn't provide option for limiting the alphabet. Is there another way of doing this? Thank you.Update:Instead of restricted letters, alphas are simpler to implement by just checking for occurrences. Therefore, I've changed the title.
Maybe something like:
Here is an idea that takes a few (easy) steps:1. Index all of your strings so you can refer back to them by index later:2. Store all strings with restricted characters in a dictionary using index as the key, string as the value. Then remove the restricted chars temporarily for sorting:3. Sort the cleaned list of strings by string values, then iterate over the strings once more and replace the stripped strings with their original values:Result: ['ca...t', 'ca..//t', 'cat', 'm/oose', 'moose', 'mouse', 'm.ouse']
Since you want to group words, you should probably use groupby.You just need to define a function which deletes alpha chars (e.g. with str.translate), and you can apply sort and groupby to your data:
