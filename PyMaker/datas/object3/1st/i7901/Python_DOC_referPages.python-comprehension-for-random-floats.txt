So this prints 20 random numbers shortened to 3 decimals.How would I write the code so that it writes only random numbers higher than 0.4 but lower than or equal to 1?Any combination of if statements I try yields an error.
Use random.uniform().Here is the documentation.Why do you round the values? You can also use random integers divided by 1000:The lowest you will get is 0.401 the highest is 1.0
