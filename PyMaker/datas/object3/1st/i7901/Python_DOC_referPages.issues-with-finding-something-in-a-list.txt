I have a program that retrieves messages from my email (via POP) and I want to retrieve the subject of the emails, I'm using this:but when I run it I get thissomeone plz tell me what I'm doing wrong...
Have you tried casting it to a string?messages = [parser.Parser().parsestr(str(mssg)) for mssg in messages]It may result in an incorrect string, but this way you can check if mssg is indeed a bytes-like. If the error disappears, you can cast it in a way that works for your program.
I found that email module has message_from_bytes function. Have you tried using it? I may be misunderstood in below code. Please verify at your side : More on : parsing email contents from poplib with email module (PYTHON)
