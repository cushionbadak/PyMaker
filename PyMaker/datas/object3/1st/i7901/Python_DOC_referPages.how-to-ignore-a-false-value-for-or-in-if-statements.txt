I have a line like:Because I am reading the user's input after a space, but sometimes the user inputs a hashtag symbol, and sometimes not (but there's always a space). If the user types in a hashtag it is fine, but if the user doesn't, I get an error IndexError: list index out of range I'm assuming because if the user doesn't type a hashtag, nothing gets split so there's only one element in the list so [1] is not a valid element in the list. However, that's why I put an or thing, so it can check either or. But I guess Python reads the statement from left to right, so depending on how I switch the two statements around the or or how the user types it, I will always get a list index error. How can I stop this?
What about aI would need more information to write you a full answer, but that's the concept.
I would go for a regex which just looks for and picks out the digits.http://pythex.org/ is good to test out the expressions before implementing them.
User a regular expression:
First do a check if the "message" has '#' in it, then you can proceed with splitting the string.Orstore the split of "message" with # in an array, and then check the size of array to be atleast 2 as you are accessing the second element of array
