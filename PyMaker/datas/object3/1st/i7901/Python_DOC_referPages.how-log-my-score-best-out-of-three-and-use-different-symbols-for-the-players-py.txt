I'm making a 2-play Battleship game in python and have been struggling with this for a while now:I apologise if the question is poorly worded but I was to know how I can make my game log the match score at the end of the three games with something like:I'm not entirely sure how to implement this myself I have a range for games in range(3), but I don't know how to log the final score.Also, how can I change the symbol for player_two so that I am not using an 'X' for both players? I've tried changing the input_check() but I get more errors than I did before.
You can use style string formatting to print the log.For more information about string formatting, check this link.To change the symbol for Player 2, you can change the following code.
