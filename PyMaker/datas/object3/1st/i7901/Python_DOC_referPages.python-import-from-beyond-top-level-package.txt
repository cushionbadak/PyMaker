I am developing a Django project for which I wrote some non-web related libraries.My directory structure looks something like this:Main folderTheorem proverhere are the things I want to importwebapphere's where I want to import things fromThe place where I'm running the app is the web/ folder. What would be the proper way of doing this?
You can add Theorem prover folder to your PYTHONPATH. Either setting the environment variable prior to app launch, or by Before importing the theorem related modules.
Use importlib.Import a module. The name argument specifies what module to import in absolute or relative terms (e.g. either pkg.mod or ..mod). If the name is specified in relative terms, then the package argument must be set to the name of the package which is to act as the anchor for resolving the package name (e.g. import_module('..mod', 'pkg.subpkg') will import pkg.mod).
Make sure, that your settings.py which located at the project root directory, has sys.path.append(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)))from web -> app -> here's where I want to import things from:import Theorem_prover.here_are_the_things_I_want_to_import
