I have generated all possible combinations using elements in a list, as explained here. Now, I would like to know how to save each combination as a list.I get this output:I would get something like this:Is there a simple way to implement it?
You could use map like so:Which would return a generator (Python3) or a list (Python2). If you want a list just cast it to list:This would convert the inner tuple structure to a list:If you want to also flatten the tuple to get the following result:You should change the first argument of the map for this:

Following the example linked by the OP:gives EDIT:The same as one-liner:
You could use a list comprehension with str.join:Instead of the list-comprehension you could also use a generator expression:
