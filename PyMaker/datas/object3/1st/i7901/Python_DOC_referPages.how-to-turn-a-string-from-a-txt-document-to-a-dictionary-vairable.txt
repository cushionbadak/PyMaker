It looks like you have a typo at the beginning of your dict definition. The correct syntax should be: h = '{"1":{"Name":"Teddies","Amount":6,"PPU":int(6),"CPU":int(4)},2:{"Name":"WoodenToys","Amount":0,"PPU":int(15) * int(1),"CPU": int(10)}}'You can use the eval() function for this, but beware cause it's not safe and hence not recommended. Check out the literal_eval() function from the ast module instead. You will have to lose the int() parsing or do it somehow before...
