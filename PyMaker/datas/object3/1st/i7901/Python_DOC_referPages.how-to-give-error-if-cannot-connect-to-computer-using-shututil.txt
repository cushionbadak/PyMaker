In my program I use shutil to copy files to several computers in a list.  I am wondering what's the best way to give an error and move onto next computer if one of the computers happens to be turned off.My original code: What I am trying to do:Does this seem like it is implemented well?
While your idea of using a try-catch block is correct, you should definitely be much more precise about which conditions you consider to be forgivable. For example, you would not want to continue if you somehow got a MemoryError or KeyboardInterrupt.As a first step, you should trap only OSError, as this is what shutil.copy uses to indicate all sorts of read/write errors (at leastthat is what the documentation for shutil.copyfile says). According to this post, your error is most likely to be a WindowsError (which is a subclass of OSError):If there are likely to be other causes for the exception, you can further narrow down the exact cause by testing the error object itself using the extended form of the else clause. For example, WindowsError, has an attribute winerror, that contains the system-level error code for the exception. Likely candidates that you might want to forgive:ERROR_BAD_NETPATH (53)ERROR_NETWORK_BUSY (54)ERROR_DEV_NOT_EXIST (55)ERROR_ADAP_HDW_ERR (57)ERROR_UNEXP_NET_ERR (59)ERROR_NETNAME_DELETED (64)ERROR_SHARING_PAUSED (70)ERROR_NET_WRITE_FAULT (88)Your code could then look something like this:You may also want to check the filename2 attribute of the exception. This will tell you if the file you were expecting caused this exception. This check is not related to the one on winerror and can be done along with or in exclusion to the one shown above:
