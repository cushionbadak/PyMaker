This code outputs:I only want to print perfect squares. What do I need to add to code?
This will also do the trick:
how about this?:
since simple list comprehension looks ugly we can define utility function likethen using built-in filter function likeon Python 2 perfect_squares will be a list of desired objects,on Python 3 filter returns iterator and we need to convert it to list manually:finally:
add a condition to the list comprehension, to make a one liner (without creating the list first, and then checking it)
