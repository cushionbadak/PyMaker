Here is my code:The problem begins when i design an algorithm (on paper) based on special (and strongly wrong) assumption and when i start coding in python, problem appearsConsider that x contains ["One" , "Two", "Three"] at start moment (get from stem).I want to impress x on for next iteration after first iteration. i want below result:not this result which happens:
But you can do the same thing using enumerate function tooBascically this function takes an iterative object and allows you to loop with the elements and their indexes at the same time
Your index is wrong. Index finds the index of a string(str) and you are trying to add 1 to that. So move the +1 outside of the parenthesis. It should be:Here it is working.From documentation:Return zero-based index in the list of the first item whose value is x.
