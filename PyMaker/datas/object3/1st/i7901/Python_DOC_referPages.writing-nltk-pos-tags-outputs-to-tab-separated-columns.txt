Natural Text
I have to copy information from a pre existing text file and add pos tags on the same line and write it to a new file, but I have no clue how to get the correct output, thanks in advance.My current output:Code:I want NNP on the fifth column in 0 5 1001 China and POS on the same line after 5 7 1002 's, etc.Desired output:
Instead of throwing away the numbers (which will also discard numbers in your text!), collect everything and extract the fourth column for tagging.You can then put the pieces back together like this.(In relatively new versions of Python, you can compact the above even more). An alternative would be to use a library like numpy or pandas, which let you add a column to your data. But I think this approach is simpler and therefore preferable.
Using the latest nltk release (v3.2.4), there's an align_tokens function that might be helpful for tokens offsets (your first two columns).As for printing the POS as the last column, simply putting the elements you want per word into a list and use the str.join() function would do, e.g. :Specific to your code:[in]:[code]:[out]:
