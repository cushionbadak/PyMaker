The output of this code continues to be 4. However, the output should be 3. The set intersection is present because I believe that is the key towards the answer. The reasoning for the answer being 4 instead of 3 comes from the number of 2 qs and 1 r that match s2 in s1.Any help is much appreciated.
If you want to maintain a count of the number of characters in common, you should use collections.Counter instead of set. 
I replaced your original chunk of code to:It outputs, it is the letter with occurrence counts:It is correct, string s2 is qsrqq and you check set(s1) which is set contains r and qThe counts are correct. Similarly, If check the 2nd for-loop, the outputs are:therefore the minimum count is 4.
Here is a solution that doesn't involve sets:
Here is another way to do it using no modules.
This results in;Analysis, 2 is the correct answer (q and r are the only letters common to both), 3 is the lower number of either sets unique values.
Do a count for each letter, and take the minimum to find out how many of that letter are common to both strings. Then sum that up, and that's your answer.
