I am trying to use pandas.read_csv to get data from some .csv files. This works fine as long as there is no accent (e.g. ä,é,ü) in the file name or file path. As soon as I use a file name such as düm1.csvI get the following error: OSError: Initializing from file failed. My code is:dum1 = pd.read_csv(r"C:\Users\MyName\Desktop\dumm12\düm1.csv", sep = ";", decimal = ",", encoding = "utf-8")I am using pandas 0.20.1 and python 3.6.0. I have found that this has been an issue in previous versions but I thought it had been resolved. Any ideas on how to fix this? I also found this:https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/15086output of pd.show_versions():INSTALLED VERSIONScommit: Nonepython: 3.6.0.final.0python-bits: 64OS: WindowsOS-release: 10machine: AMD64processor: Intel64 Family 6 Model 78 Stepping 3, GenuineIntelbyteorder: littleLC_ALL: NoneLANG: enLOCALE: None.Nonepandas: 0.20.1pytest: 3.0.5pip: 9.0.1setuptools: 27.2.0Cython: Nonenumpy: 1.11.3scipy: 0.18.1xarray: NoneIPython: 5.2.2sphinx: 1.5.1patsy: 0.4.1dateutil: 2.6.0pytz: 2016.10blosc: Nonebottleneck: 1.2.0tables: 3.2.2numexpr: 2.6.2feather: Nonematplotlib: 2.0.0openpyxl: 2.4.1xlrd: 1.0.0xlwt: 1.2.0xlsxwriter: 0.9.6lxml: 3.7.3bs4: 4.5.3html5lib: 0.999sqlalchemy: 1.1.5pymysql: Nonepsycopg2: Nonejinja2: 2.9.5s3fs: Nonepandas_gbq: Nonepandas_datareader: None
I had a similar problem. It's look like the problem occurs with pandas.read_csv with Python 3.6 in a Windows system.Python 3.6 change Windows filesystem encoding from "mbcs" to "UTF-8". See Python PEP 529. You can use the command sys.getfilesystemencoding() to get the current file system encodingI get two solutions around this:1.- Use this code to change all the app to works with the prior Python <= 3.5 encoding ("mbcs")2.- Pass a file pointer to the pandas.read_csvYou can see this post: pandas.read_csv can't import file with accent mark in path
I tested the name in creating a fake file 'düm1.csv'. when I run : I haven't an OSError and the file is open in my Ipython. Have you tried without encoding ? Without accent ? C. 
The  issue hasn't been resolved till now. Wait till a PR. Or try it with Python 2.7 I guess that might work
