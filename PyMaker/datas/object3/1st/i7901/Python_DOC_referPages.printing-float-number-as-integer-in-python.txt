So I want to print a float number as an integer. I have a float called "percentage" which should be like percentage=36.1 and I want to print it as an int number, with digits after comma missing.I use the following code, which is more like using C logic:But that gives an error. How would I have to reform it so that it works in Python? What I want to print is:"The moisture percentage is 36%."

the string format specification has a percentage already (where 1.0 is 100%):where the % is the specifier for the percent format and the .0 prevents any digits after the comma to be printed. the %-sign is added automatically.usually the percentage is just a fraction (without the factor of 100). with percentage = 0.361 in the first place there would be no need to divide by 100.

You can see the different formatting options in the python docs.
In python3.x
