I have a dict like this:and I want to find first non-empty value (and it's name, in this example 'third'). There may be more than one non-empty value, but I only want the first one I find.How can I do this?
You could use next (dictionaries are unordered - this somewhat changed in Python 3.6 but that's only an implementation detail currently) to get one "not-empty" key-value pair:
Use an OrderedDict which preserves the order of elements. Then loop over them and find the first that isn't empty:
Like this?
Edit 1from the comment if the value is None or '' we better use if v: instead of if v!=''. if v!='' only check the '' and skip others
