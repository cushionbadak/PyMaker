i am following a tutorial here which is about implementing a simple stack based python byte code interpreter . i am having problem in this funciton :what exactly is dis.HACE_ARGUMENT ? since its a big function i thought not to post it here rather give link to it.if its required let me know
In the context of the function you are defining, you're trying to process an opcode (instruction) which may or may not have arguments associated with it.If you look at the Python disassembler documentation for HAVE_ARGUMENT, you'll see that dis.HAVE_ARGUMENT is used exactly for this purpose.That is, if byteCode >= dis.HAVE_ARGUMENT, the the opcode has arguments and you need to figure out what to do with them.  Otherwise, the opcode has no arguments and there's no extra processing required.Take care, because according to the documentation I linked above, this changed slightly as of Python 3.6
