This question already has an answer here:Python TypeError: 'str' object is not callable for class                    4 answers                I'm using Python 3.5 for this. So the title is very confusing, I'm still new to python and don't really know how to solve that problem, nor how to give it a proper title as you can see. I do see where my logic flawed me (how the heck did i intend to just replace that argument with another word so easily is beyond me) but I still don't know what the solution is. So basically my problem is trying to run something like this:This obviously doesn't work when I try to call it from my permanent game loop:And I get a error of:I'll paste the entire code just so you guys can have a better look at this. Also, I'd appreciate any tips to what else can be adjusted in the code to make it better. There it is, thanks in advance!
Oh, I see what happened. You declared both an attribute self.attack and a function self.attack. When you initialized self.attack in the constructor, you overwrote the function -- when you write player.attack(opponent), Python is trying to call a number, which results in an error.To fix this, just rename either the attribute or the function.
You could do it by making attack a property. Then inside the class you'll need to reference the value as a private attribute self._attack, but users/clients of the class can continue to use attack as an Enemy instance method.Here's what I mean (with comments to further help explain):
Rename self.attack to something else. E.g., self.attack_points.
