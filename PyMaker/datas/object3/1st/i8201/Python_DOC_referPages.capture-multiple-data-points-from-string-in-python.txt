I'm extremely new to Python, and have tried in vain to search for this exact problem - I can find several similar issues but none that quite fit, and I think I'm now getting further away from it.My overall goal is to collect specific data points from a large number of forms for export into csv. I've started by bringing the .txt file into Python as one huge string (maybe not the best), but now I'm stuck on collecting those data points. They can all be located between static language, but so far I've only figured out how to capture single instances rather than multiple. It's an extended version of this:I can collect "first data to collect" but my amateur code ends there - I need to get both "first data to collect" and "second data to collect" out of this string (and ideally put them in some format that I can later export to csv).There will be several / many data points (in the above example, different "Known Starts" and "Ends") I need to collect, but I assume if I understand the core code I can expand it out to capture those points, and not waste everyone's time. Is this something that will require me to learn RegEx, or is there a more straightforward method I'm missing?
Learn regular expressions.They'll help you all your life as a developer.So just import re And really, it's not that hard : https://docs.python.org/3/howto/regex.html
