Natural Text
I wrote the following python code. It takes a list of English words I found on the internet and makes them a list so that I can use them for hangman. Well my problem is that every time I run this program and successfully guess the word, it doesn't break out of the while loop. It just keeps going. I can't figure out why for the life of me. Anyone have any clue as to why it isn't printing the final message to the winner? 
isGuessed in your top-level code and isGuessed in isWon function are two different variables. A function is a separate namespace (else a function using a variable with common name like i would wreak havoc in other code).This can be solved by a global declaration, but it's a very bad style. Same applies to variables like mysteryWord and lettersGuessed.Instead, you should return the value from the isWon function:BTW your check for all letters being guessed can be made a one-liner:
The immediate issue is that isWon() is not setting isGuessed regardless of the input. If you guess with the string "foo" thenwill make lettersGuessed a list with one item, which is a string. I think what you were trying to do wasWhich will add each letter in guess to the lettersGuessed list.Two points also worth mentioning:isWon() will consider the game won if you guess an anagram of the word in in questions e.g. "oof" will be considered a correct solution if the word is "foo"words.append(word.rstrip(wordFile.readline())) is reading every even line of the input file, and adding it to the words list after removing any characters it has in common with the following word. You want to do words.append(word.strip()) instead.
It's all about scope. isGuessed used in isWon() is define in the local scope. If you want to affect isGuessed declared in the global scope you will have to either pass it to isWon() as a parameter or use the global keyword before modifying isGuessed. See below: Output with this change:
You're trying to communicate using the global variable is_guessed, but the isWon function doesn't gave a global is_guessed line, so it is setting a variable local to isWon named is_guessed rather than the global variable.My suggestion would be, rather than adding global is_guessed to isWon(), to return either True or False from isWon() (based on whether or not the user has won) and use that to end the loop.Here is an alternative version of your code:
Well, I know that my answer is a little late but here's my solution:Key points:A list comprehension is used to put the words in a listSets are used to keep a group of letters without duplicates.A conditional expression is used to choose if a letter will be shown or or a ? Truth testing can be used to simplify the verification of certain informationYou are using expressions like isGuessed == 1 like in C where True equals 1 and False equals 0. In Python, a variable can be a boolean. You can use it directly in a if statement
