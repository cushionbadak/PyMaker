Natural Text
I wrote a python script, where I need to read and write a file. I first wrote it on Windows, and the when I tried to execute the same code on Ubuntu(Linux), using the same Python Shell (Spyder), I got this message error "No such file or directory:"data.csv". I had many attempts to fix this trouble, at the end, I found out that I need to change all '\' by '//' inside my code. So, everything is working well right now, but WHY!?
Because Windows uses backslashes as directory separators, and POSIX systems (including Linux) use forward slashes. See the os.sep constant:The character used by the operating system to separate pathname components. This is '/' for POSIX and '\\' for Windows.Always use the os.path module to construct paths; it'll take care of platform differences.
