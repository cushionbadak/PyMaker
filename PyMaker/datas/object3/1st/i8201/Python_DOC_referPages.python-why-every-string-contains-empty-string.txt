"ABCDE" msut have no empty character. But when I typePython interprater will return a TRUE result.Why?is there any empty character in "ABCDE"? I don't think so.And I also found when I use these code:returns 0 instead of -1any one please tell me the reason with thanks.
For people with background in languages where string objects represented as arrays of characters it may be surprising, but if we try to follow such approach likethenwill be False statement.Empty string probably came from mathematics, where it is a neutral element for binary operation of string concatenation, i. e. for every string awhere + is a string concatenation symbol. Then "substringing" can be defined as follows:for every strings a, b we say a is substring of b iff exists strings c, d such thatLet's denote a is substring of b as a in b.With these definitions of empty string and sustringing relation can be proved lemmaempty_string is a substring of any string a:then if we define c = empty_string and d = a:and by definition empty_string in a.
