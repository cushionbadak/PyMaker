I am looking for a simple way to compare the content of multiple lists and find the one with the fewest variables.Then I want to set the new variable to be added to that list.Example:In this I would want it to find list3 to be the shortest and append the new value to it.
Due to pythons min, max, and sort's key keyword argument this is fairly simple to do in python key corresponds to the function applied to each element and whose result is used for comparison in both min and max.  in this case the function len (which retrieves the length of sequence objects like list and tuple and any class that defines __len__ ) is used. from min. The key argument specifies a one-argument ordering function like that used for list.sort()from list.sort()key specifies a function of one argument that is used to extract a comparison key from each list element (for example, key=str.lower). example
You could write a small function that checks the len of each list, then append to that list.For example
