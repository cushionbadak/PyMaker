My code is below. Can anyone help me understand why I'm getting this error:"TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable" regarding my "for i, crp" line?
I don't think the error is in the for statement, but in the lineSws_removed must be a list of unicode characters. If it is not a list, but an int, it might give you that error. In fact, this code gives that error     from collections import defaultdict    import gensim    from gensim import corpora    lofs = 13    dictionary = corpora.Dictionary(lofs)    corpus = [dictionary.doc2bow(text) for text in lofs]    ldamodel = gensim.models.LdaModel(corpus=corpus)    document_topic = defaultdict(list)    for i, crp in enumerate(corpus):        probs = ldamodel.get_document_topics(crp)And this is the stacktrace (which is always useful to post)Traceback (most recent call last):    File "D:/python/stackoverflow/numpcorpora/numcorpora.py", line 9, in       dictionary = corpora.Dictionary(lofs)    File "C:\Users\Admin\Anaconda3\lib\site-packages\gensim\corpora\dictionary.py", line 58, in init      self.add_documents(documents, prune_at=prune_at)    File "C:\Users\Admin\Anaconda3\lib\site-packages\gensim\corpora\dictionary.py", line 111, in add_documents      for docno, document in enumerate(documents):  TypeError: 'int' object is not iterableNow replace lofs = 13 with lofs = ['list of words'.split()] and it will run fine, giving the following output:So check your sws_removed. It is an int, and not a list of unicode characters, as it should be.
is type(corpus) an int?it needs to be an iterable:https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#enumerate
