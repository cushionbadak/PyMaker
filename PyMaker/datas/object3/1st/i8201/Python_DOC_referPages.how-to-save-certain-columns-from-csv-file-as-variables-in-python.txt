This question already has an answer here:Read specific columns from a csv file with csv module?                    9 answers                I want to save and graph certain columns in Python using matplotlib. The argument for the columns will be obtained from the cmdline, so I'll have to use sys.argv to obtain them. Here's what I have currently:EDIT: I should also mention that the column numbers can vary depending on what the user chooses. For instance, they could do just columns 1, 2 or just columns 1. But this returns an empty list [].As for the output, I'd like to graph each column as a one-dimensional array. So for instance, with a csv file of the form:If a user inputs '1', I want my code to save only column one variables in an array:data = [[1, 1, 0, 0,..]]plt.plot(data) I know pandas is a valid option, but I like to learn it this way first. Thanks!
You can get the first column in the row
Here is a method that saves the headings and data in separate arrays. To get each column we take the transpose of the data array and select whichever columns we are interesting in.Here is data.csv:And here is the code:And the plot:
Well you could try something like that:Or even simpler:Key points:zip()Unpacking function argument listThe return value of csv.reader() is an iterable of iterables
