Natural Text
I want to find all four-letter strings in a sequence. The first letter is 'N', the second one is not 'P', the third one is 'S' or 'T' and the last one is not 'P'.Here's my code:and the result is:['NNST']However, the expected output should be:['NNST','NSTQ']I think the problem is that these two strings have overlapped part, and re.findall() just skips the second one. What can I do to solve it?
You should use the (?=...) (lookahead assertion) instead, since findall only matches use the part of the string only once, with means, ignores overlapping:This will match everything even if it overlaps. As the doc stated:(?=...) Matches if ... matches next, but doesn’t consume any of the  string. This is called a lookahead assertion. For example, Isaac  (?=Asimov) will match 'Isaac ' only if it’s followed by 'Asimov'.You can also check this for more info:http://regular-expressions.mobi/lookaround.html?wlr=1
findall() does not return overlapping matches, but there is nothing to stop you from explicitly searching for them, for example with:
