I found (lambda **x: x) is very useful for defining a dict in a succinct way, e.g.Is there any pre-defined python function does that?
The dict function/constructor can be used in the same manner.See help(dict) for more ways to instantiate dicts. You are not limited to just defining them with {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}.
Try the {} literal dictionary syntax. It is quite succinct. See 5.5. Dictionaries in the Data Structures tutorial.
