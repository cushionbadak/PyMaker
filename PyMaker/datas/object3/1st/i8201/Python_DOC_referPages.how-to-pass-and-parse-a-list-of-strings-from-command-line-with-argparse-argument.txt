I want to pass a list of names into my program written in Python from console. For instance, I would like to use a way similar to this (I know it shouldn't work because of bash):So, I tried this code:That led to the error:I know I could pass the names with quotes "name1 name2" and split it in my code args.names_list.split(). But I'm curious, is there a better way to pass the list of strings via argparse module.Any ideas would be appreciated.Thanks!
You need to define --names-list to take an arbitrary number of arguments.Note that options with arbitrary number of arguments don't typically play well with positional arguments, though:
You need to use nargs:https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html#nargs
