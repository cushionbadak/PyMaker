I have this xml file and I want to extract the values associated with certain specific elements. More specifically what I want is when the element value is Marks then check if next element value is Marks of Student(They are towards the end of the in the sample xml I have shown below ). If it is then extract/print these two tags and next 3 tags(which would be Minimum,Maximum, and Mean values):Currently I have this code where I am using ElementTree as to parse the xml file but it is not producing any output(it doesn't print anything).I am trying to look for lxml and XPath but don't know how to do that. How can I modify my current code to use lxml and XPath to parse the xml file and get the output I want?
Here is a way to extract the wanted information with ElementTree:Output:The default namespace is urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:spreadsheet, and the elements you are interested in are in this namespace. That's why we need to use the NSMAP dictionary. See https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html#parsing-xml-with-namespaces.
