I have a string of a python module stored in a variable (creds) that looks like this:(Many more lines than just the 2, but all the same convention)I'd like to import the values of that module into another class like so:A limitation is that I cannot write these contents to local storage. (I'd prefer not to do string disection based on /n and =)Can I import these values directly from memory?
Yep, you can use the exec function to execute a string of Python source code (by default it's executed in the current scope so those variables will be set globally):
