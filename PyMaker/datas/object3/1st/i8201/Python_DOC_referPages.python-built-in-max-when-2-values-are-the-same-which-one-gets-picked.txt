I have a code that processes data based on some dates. Lets say:I need to get the most recent record. Everything works fine when my values have different dates, but when records have the same dates max(date1, date2).Question. Which max value is returned when the values are equal, like in case 2? 
For multiple values that are all the maximum, the first such value is returned:This is explicitly documented:If multiple items are maximal, the function returns the first one encountered.
"If multiple items are maximal, the function returns the first one encountered."Source: https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#max
