I'm following the answer on Is there a simple process-based parallel map for python? using Python 3.6.1.  I'm trying to use it the same exact way as I would use the regular map function.  Why does this happen?  How can I create a parallel map function for use with lambda? 
multiprocessing pickle objects to pass between processes. lambda is not serializable (See What can be pickled and unpickled?); it can't be passed between processes.You need to define a function, and pass that.Or for this case, you can use functools.partial with operator.add:
