I need write a function could repeat another function many times. I am using threading.Timer but it could not work.Here ismy code:
To make it repeat, you need to setup a new timer after each interval.One way to do it, although its a bit functional. It may not be the simplest way.In repeat call your function, then setup the timer. You need to provide the correct arguments  to interval, so we need to partially apply it to already have the first two arguments.
