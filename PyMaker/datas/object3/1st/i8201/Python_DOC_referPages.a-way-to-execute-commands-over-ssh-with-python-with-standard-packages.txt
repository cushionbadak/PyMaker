I'm trying to find a way to execute commands with python over ssh. I did find this answer, however I'm working on an embedded platform and can't install new packages. In other words I can't install paramiko. Is there a way to do what paramiko does but with standard packages?
Is it a Unix based system with an ssh client? If so, could you use subprocess, https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html, to spawn another process and run ssh commands?If not, have you tried to see if you can package paramiko itself with your code and deploy everything together to the target system? I'm not sure if this works, but it may be worth a shot.
