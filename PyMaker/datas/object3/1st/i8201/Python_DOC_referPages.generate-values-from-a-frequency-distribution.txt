I'm currently analyzing a 16 bit binary string - something like 0010001010110100. I have approximately 30 of these strings. I have written a simple program in Matlab that counts the numbers of 1's in each bit for all 30 strings.So, for example:1 302 153 14 10etcI want to generate more strings (100s) that roughly follow the frequency distribution above.
