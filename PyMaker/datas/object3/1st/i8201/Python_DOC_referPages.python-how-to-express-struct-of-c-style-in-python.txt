I want to use struct on the python as like below C style.Could you translate above C style code to python script?Thank you.
You could make a class in python instead of a struct
Use a class:Then you can create members of that class on the fly:Then, once you create all the members necessary for each instance, you can pass the instances of this class around etc. Be aware that newly initialized instances do not have any members except some default ones.
