Suppose I have a list Q. In the following code:in the while Q statement, what method of the list Q is invoked? Is it the __len__ method? 
In Python 3.x, it's __bool__ or __len__:object.__bool__(self)Called to implement truth value testing and the built-in operation  bool(); should return False or True. When this method is not  defined, __len__() is called, if it is defined, and the object is  considered true if its result is nonzero. If a class defines neither  __len__() nor __bool__(), all its instances are considered true.In 2.x it was named __nonzero__; see what's new in 3.0.
From python's documentation:Any object can be tested for truth value, for use in an if or while condition or as operand of the Boolean operations below. The following values are considered false:(...)any empty sequence, for example, '', (), [].(...)instances of user-defined classes, if the class defines a __bool__() or __len__() method, when that method returns the integer zero or bool value False. [Additional information on these special methods may be found in the Python Reference Manual (Basic customization).]All other values are considered true â€” so objects of many types are always true.Operations and built-in functions that have a Boolean result always return 0 or False for false and 1 or True for true, unless otherwise stated. (Important exception: the Boolean operations or and and always return one of their operands.)
Yes, __len__ does get called in this case.Let's see this code snippet:Output:But, if I remove the method,  the code will run just fine, but won't print anything. So yes, __len__ does get called.
