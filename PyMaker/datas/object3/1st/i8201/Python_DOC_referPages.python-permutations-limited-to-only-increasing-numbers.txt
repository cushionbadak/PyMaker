This question already has an answer here:Python - get all combinations of a list                    3 answers                I'm trying to create a function that will produce all permutations of a list but limited to only sets of len(n) and only increasing from left to right. For instance, if I have list l = [2,4,6,8,10] and n = 3, the results should beI've seen plenty of variations of permutation functions but none with this kind of restriction. 
From itertools docs:Combinations are emitted in lexicographic sort order. So, if the input iterable is sorted, the combination tuples will be produced in sorted order.So if you have a sorted list, then using itertools.combinations you'll get your desired result. If not, you can call sorted()  first.
