I'm new to python. I want to access baseURL and eventually get a list of files in one of the sub-directories so I can download/unzip this file. The specific file extension can change so I'm hoping to find a match to the file by just the date (yyyymmdd). Thanks in advance for your guidance! My code so far is: 
You could use Python ftplib, https://docs.python.org/3/library/ftplib.html, as a ftp client. I don't think wildcard downloads are support, so you'd have to do something along the lines of...Login to the FTP serverNavigate to the desired directoryGet a listing of the files, iterate thorough the files and match according to the desired file formatDownload desired files
