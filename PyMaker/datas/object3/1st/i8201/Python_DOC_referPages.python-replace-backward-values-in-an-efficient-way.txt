Natural Text
Suppose I have the following string (it is NOT a dictionary)Which is, in your opinion, the most efficient way to look for "Value:x" where x is any number and replace only the previous Name1 with "test"?For instance if x is 2 I will have in the end:They are strings and cannot be expressed as dictionarys or other python objects.
I would suggest re.sub() function with specific regex pattern (just for your test case):The output:(?=...) - positive lookahead assertion, ensures that Name1 substring is followed by Name2 and Value(with needed value) substrings/attributes
