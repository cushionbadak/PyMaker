I have a list of object named person with id and their countries:The list looks like the below, where id is just UUID and country being country codes, I have sorted them by country:Now I would like to split them into different lists by country.This is what I am doing now:I get what I want with the above codes.But I would like to know if there is a better or more efficient way to split the list according to country?
You can use itertools.groupby (https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/itertools.html#itertools.groupby) to achieve what you want:There are a few gotchas to keep in mind:groupby returns an iterator, so you can only iterate over it once.the items in my example above is an iterator, too.  So you'll need to cast it to a list if you want to access the individual items by index later.
You can use itertools.groupby. Given persons_data is already sorted by country, the following code does what you want:
Another approach to consider if I'm understanding you correctly:Or if you want to avoid defaultdict for some reason,Either way, the result would be:Main downside to this is that all of the data is stored in memory twice.
