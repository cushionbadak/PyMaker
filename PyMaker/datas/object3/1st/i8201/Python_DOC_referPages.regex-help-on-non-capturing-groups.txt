Must be a duplication but I can't seem to find it...I am using a group to match a repeating sub-string. However, I do not want the group to be captured. This seems to be a contradiction.To be explicit suppose I want to find any character that follows 3 exact replicas of an all capital subset strings. Forit should return I can find very well the repeating strings and following character bywhich givesI can easily parse the resulting list and get just the 2nd items. But is there a regex way to get just the 2nd items to begin with? If I try to doI getI'll appreciate a short verification that the issue is indeed a collision between the non-capturing requirement and the capturing that is needed to detect repetitions. Then a clever idea how to achieve the goal neatly.
The reason this won't work is that when you write \1 you basically say "the content of the first group", which is of course undefined if the group is non-capturing.
As re.findall will always fetch a list of tuples once you define several  capturing groups in the pattern, you can't use "regex-only" approach here.Use re.finditer to get all match data objects and get Group 2 contents from each match only:See the Python demo
