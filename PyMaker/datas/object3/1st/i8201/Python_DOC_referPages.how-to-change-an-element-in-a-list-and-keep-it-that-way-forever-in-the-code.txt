I already know how to change an element of a list into another one:and the output is:but the item in the code I'm writing still hasn't changed; it still is "foo", the only change I can see is in the output.I have a much bigger code which needs to change an item on the list based on user input. How do I keep a huge list and keep changing it (without actually touching the code)?
The easiest way to do this, without diving too deeply into self-rewriting code, or databases, or having to care about data structures, is to use the pickle module.
When you are running a program, the program never actually changes.What you are searching for is file IO.You can read and write files to load and save results of your program:You can open this file with any text editor and see it contains the text useful data. To load the file, use read()Of course it would be useful to write more than one line:Again, open it in a text editor to check the results.To read the data, use readlines:if you want to save more complex data as you mentioned in a comment you need to use a more complex file format or database. The file formats included in python are: JSON, CSV. sqlite is a database included with python.Another option is pickle, but it has many drawbacks and should only be used for temporary storage.JSON:CSV:For pickle and sqlite I encourage you to read the documentation 
In the the normal operation of your python application you will not see a case where user input will change the entry in your python file.I added some line numbers to your code snippet above.There is not sane way where you will take in user input and change the value as seen when you open the file at line 1. That doesn't mean that your list hasn't changed. Lists are mutable objects in python - this means their value can change. And you have done this in line 4 above. So you could have code that looks something like:The user IS changing your list. But, this isn't long term. This exists only as long as your program runs.As a short mechanism you could make a file where each entry in your list is on a single line in your list:So the first time the program is run you would prepopulate the list from this file:file.txt  foo  bar  bazThen your line 1 would look slightly different:And, you know what, this totally works. For a simple enough situation this can be a solution. But a better solution is looking into persistent datastores like a database because that's what larger applications use to solve this problem.
