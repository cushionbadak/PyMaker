This works, according to the documentation:Now I want to do something similar, for a list of dicts:I was expecting:But it seems attrgetter does not work for dictionaries (only for classes?). How can I setup an "element getter" for dictionaries?
Well, the item you want to get is 'xxx'. (In both cases, you want to call the object's __getitem__ method for each object in the list.)Think of attributes as anything you access via the dot notation, i.e. mydict.xxx in your case. You should see why that fails.
As mentioned in timgeb's answer, you should be calling itemgetter with the key (because attrgetter are used to get the class attribute which are accessible by . like class_obj.<attribute>).In order to achieve your desired result, usage of list comprehension is a easier approach:Also, please note that map since python 3.x returns a generator object instead of a list object.
