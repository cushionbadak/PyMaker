I have a csv file containing two columns. The first one is a stringID whereas the second one is a list of stringIDs. Column1 | Column2aaa    | [u'xxx', u'yyy']My question is how to create a new csv with the stringIDs in pairs (two columns with duplicates)? For example, Column1 | Column2aaa     | u'xxx'aaa     | u'yyy'Thanks a lot for helping me! I know this problem should be simple but it has been bothering me for days...
Thanks for the constructive answer! Although it didn't quite work for me specifically, I was definitely inspired by it and came up with some functional code! 
This code ignores the possibility that csv-style processing could be used, since I wasn't sure exactly how fields are delimited. I've assumed that they are separated by a '|' character and that it could be necessary to strip blanks. I have taken advantage of a comment in using ast.literal_eval for safe processing of the lists.
