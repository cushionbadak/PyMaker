I'm currently developing a very simple phone troubleshooting system with python which should include 10 possible outcomes. I have created the flowchart below to help me with the process but I'm still struggling with asking many questions which lead to another question etc.Flowchart: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9kYvbwMV4pzczJoUUZLcW1mWmc/view?usp=sharingCurrent python code:Can someone lead me in the right direction, thanks.
It seems you just are not implementing the proper control flow in your file. If you want another question to occur depending upon a previous one, then you just encapsulate that question in that conditional. Looking quickly at the diagram you shared, this seems to be what you are looking for. The documentation for More Control Flow Tools provides nice documentation on this subject.
