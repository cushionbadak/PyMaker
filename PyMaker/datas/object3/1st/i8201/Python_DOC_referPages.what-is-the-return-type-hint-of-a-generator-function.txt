This question already has an answer here:Python's PEP 484 type annotation for Generator Expression                    1 answer                I'm trying to write a :rtype: type hint for a generator function. What is the type it returns? For example, say I have this functions which yields strings:The return type isn't just a string, it's some kind of iterable of strings? So I can't just write :rtype: str. What's the right hint?
GeneratorGenerator[str, None, None] or Iterator[str]
The generic type for annotating generators is Generator[yield_type, send_type, return_type] provided by the typing module:Alternatively you can use Iterable[YieldType] or Iterator[YieldType].
