Natural Text
I am trying to write a program that runs a command on Cisco router and writes list of IP on a text file. I am able to write all IPs to the file and then grab all IPs successfully.  Now the part where I am having trouble is that I do not know how many IPs I will get from the list.  As I would like to compare each IP I get from file against user's defined IP, I would like a way to either create dynamic variable based on # of IPs or somehow iterate through all IPs and compare it against user's IP.This is what I get when I run it:Now the hard part where I am struggling is how can I compare each of these with variable userIP dynamically.ThanksDamon
You can compare each IP address with the user input subnet one by one like this (and it actually uses less memory than your code):
I think you can avoid a lot of complexity once you take into account that re.findall will pull out all IPs over all lines of the file itself, you don't need to have your own loop. For example:The overlaps() function is just a made up example, to help illustrate the rest of the logic.
Could this be what you want?Change append to extend so that the resulting list is something like ['10.10.20.192/27', '10.10.40.0/24', ''].Ask whether userIP matches any of those found:
