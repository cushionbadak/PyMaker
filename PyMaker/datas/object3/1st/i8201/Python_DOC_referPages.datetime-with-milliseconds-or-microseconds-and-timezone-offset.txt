This is the representation desired for dates:This is how it's logged (Python 3.6.0 on Linux):It's not filling the microseconds properly.  I've tried changing the logrecord_format to a few other things, but I could not figure it out - how to configure the logger to show microseconds and timezone in the correct way to match the strftime output exactly?Edit:
Personally, instead of integrating the timezone into the date format, I add it directly to the logged message format. Usually, the timezone should not change during the program execution.
