This question already has an answer here:struct.unpack with bytearray's                    2 answers                Suppose I have a byte-packed message with the following schema:What is the recommended pythonic way to convert the byte sequence into a python variables? Would the "struct" module work well for unpacking byte arrays that have arbitrary bit length fields?
What is the recommended pythonic way to convert the byte sequence into a python variables?this question will get closed pretty soon. What you want is to read this python doc page about struct and bytearrays.It will show you how to pack and unpack data using format.Would the "struct" module work well for unpacking byte arrays that have arbitrary bit length fields?It will show you how to pack and unpack data using format.Yup, as follows:Check the format characters to define the format string and you're done.You could use more bloated libraries like construct, but TBH, this format is super simple and if you unpack early and pack late, you're free to organize your data as you want in your code.e.g.:
