I have functions like thisCan I make flags for these functions using argparse like Rightnow I have tried with this codeCan I add flags in the same code??
The end of https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html#sub-commands has an example like yours, but with expressions like add_parser.set_defaults(func=add) (using the actual function instead of the name).  This lets them replace the if/else stack with args.func(args).But if you want to use the flagged/optionals style of input rather than subparsers, I'd suggest the following:producesIf the '-a' flag already means add, you don't need to include the extra string.  I also used nargs=2 instead of the separate 'x','y' arguments required by the subparser.  The is None or is not None is a handy way of testing whether a flagged value has been provided.  The user can't enter None, so testing for this default default is foolproof.
