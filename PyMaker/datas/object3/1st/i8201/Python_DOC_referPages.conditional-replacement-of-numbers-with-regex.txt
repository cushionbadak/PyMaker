Input:Desired Output:In other words, the replacements should be the number of zeros contained in the matched numbers. The examples already contain all possible numbers: {none, 10, 100, 1000, 10000} .Is there a way to do it with one regex statement? (Side info: I want to implement a rule for the RegReplace package for Sublime Text 3)
You can, as re.sub accepts a function as replacement. See re.subThe replacement function takes a match object as parameter, and must return a string.Note that in the last case, there's no number to replace, so there is no logical place to insert a 0, as in your last desired output.
