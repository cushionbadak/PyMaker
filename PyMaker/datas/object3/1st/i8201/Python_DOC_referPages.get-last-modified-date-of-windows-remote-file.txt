The above code gives me error as I am trying to get the last modified date of some files from a Windows server to a remote Windows server.I am on Windows using psexec but maybe they are other solutions to get such information.I tried using subprocess.call, subprocess.popen, subprocess.check_out and all give me errors, but when I tried to type directly the command on cmd it is working fine.
In order to get the last time a file was modified in windows ,you can use the code belowfirst you get the time stamp and readable converts it into date
