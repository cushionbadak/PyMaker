I will write an example so you can understand me :For instance, I have these 3 points : (0, 1, 244) - (0, 1, 255) - (1, 2, 133)Actually I need to average the Z when 2 points have the same (x, y). My idea is to store them in something (an array, a dictionary ?) with a double index/key where the value is an array of the Z.So I basically want to have this : [0, 1, [244, 255]] and [1, 2, [133]]My problem is I don't know what to use to store them the simpliest way to do so...Thanks in advance !
Tuples can be dictionary keys:is perfectly valid.Another approach would be to use itertools.groupby, but make sure that your list is already sorted by they key you want to use for your groups (https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.groupby):
Using a dictionary:For the mean values:
Here are a couple of ways of doing this:As Geotop suggested, use a dictionary indexed with a tuple.This according to me is an elegant solution.  Depending on the purpose and ease of traverse, you may convert the same to a nested list as follows:  a = [ [ (1,2), (3,4), (5,6) ],      [ [123,234,345], [567,678,543], [433,645,754] ] ]Now you may access the list of z values corresponding to (x,y) using a[1][i], where the tuple (x,y) is stored as a[0][i].The second method seems much better to me as it avoids dictionary use and makes indexing much easier (as it is indexed with integers.). But at the end, it all depends on your purpose.Storing it randomly in a list and getting the values by a search is a bad idea if you look up the data frequently or if the data is huge.
