Natural Text
I was trying to make my own way to solve finding product of a,b,c for a+b+c = 1000 and a^2 + b^2 = c^2.I did end up finding the method by myself, however it lead me to another question about how this thing is working.My first attempt didn't includeFor some reason, my code won't finish and run forever. so I just decided to add it at the end it worked. That is great. but, I'm wondering why a break is necessary there. Doesn't first break stops the loop after finding the answer? why is it necessary to put second break with the same condition?. even without the break, isn't it suppose to end naturally when a becomes > 333?I just started learning python yesterday, please help me improve :).
From the docs:break terminates the nearest enclosing loop, skipping the optional else clauseThis means only your inner while loop gets aborted, your outer while loop would continue endlessly.Regarding your question:even without the break, isn't it suppose to end naturally when a becomes > 333?The problem is, when you break out of the inner loop, the else part does not get executed, so your a stays the same. On the next run of the outer loop, the solution is found again, breaking the inner loop, not incrementing a...
break breaks the inner loop, it's like saying: we found what we need, stop calculating more values.. The outer while loop will continue looping after exiting the inner while loop. If the condition of if is false inside the inner loop, then deduct 1 from c and b. This deduction will continue up until the condition: a**2 + b**2 == c**2 is satisfied (true) and hence break gets executed or the condition in the inner while loop header becomes false. Clearly, whenever product is greater than 0, break the outer loop.
