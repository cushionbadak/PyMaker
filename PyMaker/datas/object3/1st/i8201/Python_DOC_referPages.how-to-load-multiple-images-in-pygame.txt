I need to load around 200 images in pygame to be blitted at various points in my game. I tried writing a function for this but kept coming back with NameError: name 'tomato' is not defined.All of the image names are what the variable of the loaded image is stored under: tomato = pygame.image.load("tomato.png")Would using an array be better, if so how would I do that?The code:The NameError occurs only when the condition leading to the blitting of tomato.png is met: when I hover over the tomato image i.e. color redIf I write load(tomato) instead of with "", NameError comes up as soon as I run the code, and highlights load(tomato) instead of gamedisplay.blit(tomato) as for with load("tomato").
You do load the image by calling load("tomato"), but you ignore the return value. Tryinstead.
If you want to load so many images, use os.listdir and put all the images in the directory into a dictionary. Also, use convert or convert_alpha after loading the images to improve the performance.If you want to load all images from subdirectories as well, use os.walk:
