I have a function:each model has unique=True so I'm using try, except to skip over the error I get when its trying to input a data that's already in the database. How can I condense this code? I feel like its a lot of unnecessary lines of code.
Django is smart: like stated in one of the comments, it's only gonna raise an error when the save() method is called. Until then, Article is a normal Python object. What you should would look more like this :Another (more advanced) option is to override the save() method and put your logic there.That said, you could also use get_or_created to do that. It looks like this:However, there are a few things I would suggest. My feeling is that you are diving into Django without really knowing Python. Django is a big beast that makes a lot of things really convenient (almost magical) but it's still Python. If you dive too deep and something breaks, it will be very hard for you to know what's going on. I would suggest furthering your knowledge of Python (it's an amazing language so it's gonna be fun) and then go back to Django or maybe start with a smaller framework like Flask which does less magic! For now, here's a link to the official doc on error handling so you can learn a bit more about it. Also, Django has really good doc so I would first look there if a problem arises.Cheers and happy coding!
