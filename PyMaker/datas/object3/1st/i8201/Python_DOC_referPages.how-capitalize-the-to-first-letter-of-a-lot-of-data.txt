Natural Text
I am pretty new to Python, barely 20-25 days old, I have researched a lot and though I have found a way to capitalize (first letter), the name and address data by using the following python code , I used 'atom editor' to write the code, and  'Powershell' to check it.Raw data:CodeResult:Now suppose if I have to capitalize the first letters of such names & addresses which are in 'Note Pad' and twenty at a time, how can I do that and how can I input the data and how can I get it back on 'Notepad' as output. I would be very grateful if anyone can guide me.This is how the data appears in Notepad   so on and so forth....
This should work.
If you don't want to overwrite contents of actual file then you can write the output to a new file. However using same file, let's say file name is data.txt.
The simplest way to do it is to use the fileinput module. It makes it very easy to process a file in-place and will even optionally create a backup file. Here's how use it to solve your problem:However, using the string .title() method isn't always going to work correctly because it will do things like turn something like "sak's 5th ave" into "Sak'S 5Th Ave" since it recognizes words as simply any group of consecutive letters.One workaround for those kind of issues is by using Python's regex (regular expression) module, named re, to define your own custom word pattern matching logic.To illustrate how to do this, here's the previous code modified to use re and a custom regex pattern that will avoid the two problem cases previously mentioned:
