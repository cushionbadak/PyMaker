How do you kill PDB and the program it's running, similar to LLDB's proc kill; exit or exit (y) commands?Ctrl+D isn't working and all the questions I see on here are how to exit while keeping the program running. However, I'm sitting in a PDB session and I found a bug that is causing an endless loop, and while there are indeed other things I can do to kill the program I figured I'd ask what the PDB command is to do it.
The pdb command to kill the program is q, or quit. Quoting the docs:q(uit)  Quit from the debugger. The program being executed is aborted.When q is not enough to stop the loop (perhaps you have a misbehaving except block), you may need to use os._exit(), a low-level command which terminates the process immediately. (q and sys.exit work by throwing exceptions - bdb.BdbQuit for q and SystemExit for sys.exit.) os._exit will prevent any finally blocks or __exit__ methods from running, so you may have to deal with data corruption or data loss.Ex: import os; os._exit(0)(https://stackoverflow.com/a/38511414/2036148)
