You will have to install pip for /usr/bin/python and install protobuf via your new pip installation.
Use the versioned Python commands in combination with the -m switch to run the appropriate copy of pip.python2 -m pip install SomePackage  # default Python 2python2.7.10 -m pip install SomePackage  # specifically Python 2.7.10 check thisBest practice is to use virtualenv,If you want to install a package to a particular location using pip,you can simply do pip install --install-option="--prefix=$PREFIX_PATH" package_nameusing --target option,pip install --target=<path> package_nameyou also need to add the <path> location  to PYTHONPATH
