I get some data like thisI want to have a result like this,This means the the name,the min number, the max number.I have 1 million data like this.I tried in this way:As you can see, it do not work, I get problem to get data together.Any suggestions?
You could iterate over your list and derive the min and max values using an OrderedDict. At the end you can re-create the string as I show, but actually you might be better off keeping the dictionary data structure (depends what you want to do next):Example:
A defaultdict with a list as default value could help you a lot:It's probably what you wanted to write with set and multiple loops. defaultdict is a standard structure and should be fast enough, even with many values.Here's a beginning of a solution with this data structure:For each letter in A, you now have a list of corresponding values. It shouldn't be too hard to extract min and max and write the desired list.
you can try this:['A,1,5', 'B,2,5', 'C,2,200']
You can achieve what you intented to do using groupby from itertools module and using list comprehension like this example:Output:
Might not be the fastest but I think this is easy to read. Can't offer formatting since I'm using Python 3.4.
Basic idea is to split the list on the basis of it's headers i.e. A, B, C...and find the min and max for each of them. Below is one way to do so:#!/usr/bin/pythonA=['A,1','A,2','A,4','A,5','B,2','B,3','B,4','B,5','C,2','C,20','C,200','C,2']
