When I try to unpickle pickled complex enum instance, I always get "ValueError: BLUE is not a valid Colors".Is there any way how to pickle and unpickle?I am using Python 2.7.
Don't use a custom class as the enum values; there is no need here.  Your specific example doesn't need a separate class at all, you could just use:This has better str() and .counter behaviour; your code requires str() to be applied to Color.<name>.value rather than directly to Color.<name>.For other custom methods and attributes, put those directly on the Enum subclass and they'll be part of the enum members too. If you need more values per entry, set a tuple and pull that tuple apart in a __init__ method. The documentation has an excellent Planet example that illustrates this further.Demo:
The issue here is basic equality:So when Colors is trying to find a match for the unpickled value of ColorType(2, 'BLUE') it is failing.The solution is simple:  add the __eq__ and __ne__ methods to `ColorType':NB I agree with @MartijnPieters that in most cases you should just add the needed functionality to the Enum itself.
