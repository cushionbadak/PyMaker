Suppose I have a set and I do while set: like the following, when does the loop stop?
while over any non-empty variable will never stop if you never modify that variable within the while body.
Never.Because while evaluates the truthiness of x, which is True - and so you have an infinite loop.You can try it yourself with bool(x) or have a look at the docs: https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#truth
to understand what your code is doing you need to understand how a while statement works.The while statement is a Boolean statement.What this means is (True,False)for example:The above code will run the commands inside of it until x == False.So the code will run one time because I have said x = False at the end of the statement.the above code is the same as saying.In your example:x will always be True if you do not change it to be False or something that is equal to False.Therefore your loop will never end "MUAHAHAHAHAHAHHA"For example:Or:This will print out the number 1 only one time because x has been assigned 0 and is the equivalent of False for the while statement.
