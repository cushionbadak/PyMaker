I have two strings that I compare, but I am not getting the result I want. Here's how I do it, with Python 2.7:I have also tried with the is comparison:Can someone explain why I am not printing true when I do this?  I come from C#, and if you do it like this you should print the true value.
The code you posted is not valid Python.This will do:To elaborate:booleans start with capital letters: True and False (not sure why you had the exclamation)blocks need to be consistently indented (unlike C# where you separate them with {})else needs to finish with a colonedit: my answer was based on OPs original code, which was not valid Python. I can't help if someone then changes the code into valid code after.
is will return True if two variables point to the same object, == if the objects referred to by the variables are equal.
In Python, 'true' and 'false' booleans need to be capitalized at the 'T' and 'F', respectively. Also, when printing, whatever you want to print needs to be surrounded in double or single quotes.
