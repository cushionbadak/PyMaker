I'm working on a new project but I can't fix the error in the title.Here's the code:
The error occurred because of .encode which works on a unicode object. So we need to convert the byte string to unicode string using       So the code will be:
Try this
The error message is self explainatory: there is a byte 0xf0 in an input string that is expected to be an ascii string.You should have given the exact error message and on what line it happened, but I can guess that is happened on info = urllib.parse.parse_qs(source_code), because parse_qs expects either a unicode string or an ascii byte string.The first question is why you call parse_qs on data coming from youtube, because the doc for the Python Standart Library says:Parse a query string given as a string argument (data of type application/x-www-form-urlencoded). Data are returned as a dictionary. The dictionary keys are the unique query variable names and the values are lists of values for each name.So you are going to parse this on = and & character to interpret it as a query string in the form key1=value11&key2=value2&key1=value12 to give { 'key1': [ 'value11', 'value12'], 'key2': ['value2']}.If you know why you want that, you should first decode the byte string into a unicode string, using the proper encoding, or if unsure Latin1 which is able to accept any byte:
This code is rather weird indeed. You are using query parser to parse contents of a web page.So instead of using parse_qs you should be using something like this.
