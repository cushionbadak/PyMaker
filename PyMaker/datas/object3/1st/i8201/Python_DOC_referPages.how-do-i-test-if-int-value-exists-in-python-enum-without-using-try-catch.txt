Using the Python Enum class, is there a way to test if an Enum contains a specific int value without using try/catch?With the following class:How can I test for the value 6 (returning true), or the value 7 (returning false)?
you can list the values like this:or (probably better): use a set; the in operator will be more efficient:then test withyou could also add this as a method to your class:if you want to test for the names (and not the values) Reda Maachi's answer covers what i would do.
You could use Enum.__members__ - an ordered dictionary mapping names to members:
Just check whether it's in Enum. _value2member_map_
