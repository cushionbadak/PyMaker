I am currently working in the following project, and running into some difficulty with imports. I previously came from a Ruby background before Python, so I suspect I'm just missing something.Some of the actions I'd like to do are:import src/project/config/file.py from run.pyimport between second level folder in project (ie. file in actions imports something from config)import any file into a testWould anyone have any advice on how to accomplish this?
So it's quite easy to reference something going deeper into the directory . For example, from run.py, you would be able to use something such as:It's easy to access something in the same directory as well, say you're in src/file1.py  trying to access src/file2.py, this would just be:This works too. However if you were trying to import upward say from file.py to run.py and tried running something like this:You would get the following error:The problem is that Python is assuming that your top-level package is wherever the file being run is located. That's why you can import everything on the same level and deeper but can't get at anything above.An easy hack to get past this is to just append the path to your file to your sys.path so:So that's the answer to you question.Based on the way your project is setup though it seems like you want to make a module and that's a bit more hands on, I suggest reading the documentation it's pretty good.
