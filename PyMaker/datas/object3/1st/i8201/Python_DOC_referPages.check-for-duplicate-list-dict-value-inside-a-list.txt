Natural Text
If I have a list of dictionary or a list of list where each elements are equal sized, e.g. 2 elements â†’ [{1,2}, {3,4}, {4,6}, {1,2}] or [[1,2], [3,4], [4,6], [1,2]]How do I check for duplicate and keep count of repeated times?For list, something like this would work but I can't use set directly in my case.

You can use Counter from collections:
