Two .py files, the to_be_imported.py has:The import.py has:But when I try to access variable b I got error AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'b'.. How to get the value of b after I give the function value "hey"?
to_be_imported does not have a variable b.  The only b in your program is local to func, and disappears when you exit the function.  The canonical way to do this would be:There are other ways to do this.  For instance, you could be make b a global variable of to_be_imported and then access it with something likeHowever, this is generally not a good idea.  Also, note that it's not really a good idea to have a remote function both print output and return a value.  Modules and passing information are really cool, but make sure you follow recommendations in the textbook or tutorials you're using, so you don't have debugging troubles later.
You might consider returning the value, like in this example:Also note that it's generally bad practice to do from module import *, as it can overwrite functions in the module that does that import.You might try importing just what you need, like: from mymodule import func, func_two, func_three
