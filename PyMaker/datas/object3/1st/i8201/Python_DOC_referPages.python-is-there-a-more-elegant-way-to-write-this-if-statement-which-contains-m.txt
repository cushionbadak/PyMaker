You could just use the element in list syntax. Also, there's no need to use an if else statement if you only want to print true or false. You could just print the boolean directly:If you want a lowercase string:Finally, if you often need this test, you could pack the values into a set:You'll invest some time to create the set, but the query 5 in all_values should become faster, especially if there are many variables.
This would be preferable in my eyes.You can take a look at the documentationSimilarly if you want to do multiple and checks you can use all() with the same syntax.Finally, for your special case, and since the only thing you want to do is a membership test I would go with the answer posted by @Eric. My approach is more generic.
You could use if 5 in [a, b, c,d]:In case if you want to check equality of variables with different number any() is a safe betif any([a == 1, b == 2, c == 3, d == 4]):
Perhaps by just using in:or just
