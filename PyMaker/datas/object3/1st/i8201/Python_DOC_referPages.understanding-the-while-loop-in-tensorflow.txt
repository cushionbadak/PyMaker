I am using the Python API for Tensorflow. I am trying to implement the Rosenbrock function given below without the use of a Python loop:My current implementation is as follows:I have tried implementing the summation in a tf.while_loop(); however, I found the API somewhat unintuitive when it comes to using an index integer that is meant to remain separate from the data. The example given in the documentation uses the data as the index (or vice-versa):
This can be achieved using the tf.while_loop() and standard tuples as per the second example in the documentation. It is important to note that the index increment should occur in the body of the loop similar to a standard while loop. In the solution given, it is the first item in the tuple returned by the body() function. Additionally, the loop condition function must allot a parameter for the summation although it is not used in this particular example.
