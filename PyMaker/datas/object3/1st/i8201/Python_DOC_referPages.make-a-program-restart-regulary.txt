I'm currently working on a project that I want to restart and rerun every 10 minutes. So I created this test file to see if I could get it working. So I want this program to restart every 5 seconds. In this case it would print "Hello!". But when i run it, it just prints once and never restarts.How would I make it restart regulary?
I don't get what exactly are you looking for but below are the 3 possible cases.1: If the program is running (perhaps as a daemon?) and you want to keep calling a particular method after some interval then you can use apscheduler.2: You can use Cron which will execute your python script at defined time. Note that Cron can not be set for less than 1 minute. So for eg if you want to run your script through Cron every 5 seconds then you'll have to use below hack.If you are on Windows then you can use Windows Task Scheduler. See Schedule Python Script - Windows 73: You can use loop with timeout (as suggested by Sneh)
Besides some possibilities for better choices, I think your code does not work because of the behaviour of os.execl:These functions all execute a new program, replacing the current process; they do not return.check out subprocess.Popen
