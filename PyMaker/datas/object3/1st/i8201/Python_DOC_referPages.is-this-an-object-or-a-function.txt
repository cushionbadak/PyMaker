I'm following a tutorial on machine learning, and learning python at the same time. There is a part of code which I don't understand:I don't understand the second line. Is it a new instantiated object and the brackets are there because it's a constructor? If it is, how can I differentiate it from a function being assigned to a variable? I know that in this example it's rather clear because of this line clf.fit(X, Y), but I want to know what to do in other cases.
Everything in Python is an object. GaussianNB is callable. Adding the () calls it. The return value of that call is entirely up to the object. In this specific case, GaussianNB() instantiates a new GaussianNB object and returns it.
In this example you can use and see that his is a class. You can also use to get more info.Python guidelines recommended  Class names should normally use the CapWords convention.and for functions Function names should be lowercase, with words separated by  underscores as necessary to improve readability.You can read more here 
It is an object.  The third line is a method you can always do 'type(object)' to see what type it is so try type(clf)
