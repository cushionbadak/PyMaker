This question already has an answer here:Convert string representation of list to list                    14 answers                I am trying to convert a list enclosed in a quotes to a list. Is their any optimal way to do this.
I'd, personally, use JSON for this as it would be the appropriate library for storing and retrieving lists and dictionaries:Alternatively, you could use eval, but it's not recommended:
You can use ast.literal_eval() to safely evaluate the string:Safely evaluate an expression node or a string containing a Python  literal or container display. The string or node provided may only  consist of the following Python literal structures: strings, bytes,  numbers, tuples, lists, dicts, sets, booleans, and None.
eval is evil use ast.literal_eval:
You can do lst=eval("[1,2,3,4,5]")
Most direct:list is a reserved keyword, don't use it as a variable name.Only use eval if your string comes from a trusted source; if you call eval on a string like "import subprocess;subprocess.run('rm -rf /')", you're going to have problems.
for me most simple way is:l=eval("[1,2,3]")
