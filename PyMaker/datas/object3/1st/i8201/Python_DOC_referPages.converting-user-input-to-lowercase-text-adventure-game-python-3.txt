I apologise for another simple question but I truly am stuck...I'm trying to add a .lower() method to convert any user input whether it be upper case, lower case or combo, into lower case. I just can't figure out exactly where to add the .lower()?This is the main function of the game:So I think this is the line of code to add it too...but it doesn't work...this doesn't work...do I need to add another loop or change the line of code somehow? Thank you in advance.
Any string is an instance of the str class. So you can use .lower(), .upper(), etc on any string. The type returned by input() is a str. So you want this, right above your if statements that begin by checking if the command is quit:    cmd = cmd.lower()You might want to check out python's tutorial or standard library reference so you can look at examples and see what the standard library and types (like str!) have to offer.
Solution: Instead of using "cmd = input("Enter your command " + str(turn) + "> ")", use below one:Explanation of using raw_input() instead of input():1) input() is equivalent to eval(raw_input()), so it parses and evaluates your input as a valid Python expression.2) eval() interprets a string as code. And if you write any command which it fails to parse, it gives error.   
You are trying to set the input lowercase.You need to set the var "cmd" lowercase
