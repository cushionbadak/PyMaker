I have a csv with some data and I want to made a dictionary in Python.I do thisbut althougth the file is I only achieve thiswhy is missing the first line?
The dict constructor doesn't use the line in the for loop - it consumes the entire file in its constructor. That first line is ignored and when the loop comes back to the top, the file is exhausted and it exits.
You're looping over f twice. First you do:which sets line to the first line of the file. Then within that loop, you use the list comprehension:This reads the remaining lines of f, and passes the resulting list to the dict() constructor. But since the outer loop read the first line, it's not included in the dictionary.Then it goes back to the top of the outer loop. Since the file has been read completely, that loop ends.The solution, as others have pointed out, is to get rid of the outer loop.
You are trying to do something very complicated, you can do the same, simply with csv module.For better undersanting:Is the same as:Or:
