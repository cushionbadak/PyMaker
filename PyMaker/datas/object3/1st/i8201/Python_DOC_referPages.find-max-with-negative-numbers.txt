I am working on this code to find the maximum of numbers entered by a user.  As it is, if I enter all negative numbers, the program returns 0 as the greatest.What do I need to add to handle negative numbers? For instance, if a user enters -3 and -1, the program should print -1.
I see three general possibilities:Set m to a ridiculously small integer to start; I think that your current code will work from there.Read the first input number before the loop; make that the starting value of m.Don't use a value of m at all: append all of the input numbers to a list, and simply take the max of the list after the user enters 0 to stop.Also, please learn to use descriptive variable names.  finished is good, but m is semantically useless, and num is questionable (although it is rather non-descript).
Consider the following approach using built-in max() function:
Hey you should try to assign the maxelement initially to list[0] i.e first element of the list and then start comparing with every element of the list. This should work-
