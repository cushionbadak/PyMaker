Natural Text
I'm trying to write a piece of code that multiplies certain numbers from lines in a text file by 3. However, each line has string characters and each number is separated by commas. This is for a game leaderboard, I'm just trying to learn and practice Python. Each line has the player's nickname, matches played, matches won and matches lost listed respectively, each item is separated by a comma (no spaces) and each player has played 24 matches.A sample of a line from the text file is:The Objective:Read the text file into the code (done)Take the matches won from each line and multiply it by threeHere is the code I have already:The problem with the code is that it doesn't actually print anything from the actual text file.
Instead of using a RegEx, you can use split():Return a list of the words in the string, using sep as the delimiter string.For instance:With Python 3.5 you can use Unpacking Generalizations to separate the name and the points, for instance:Before Python 3.5, you can write:The conversion to int and the multiplication by 3, can be done with a comprehension list:Here is the resulting code:Prints:If you really want a RegEx, you can use re.findall():Return all non-overlapping matches of pattern in string, as a list of strings.You'll get:
Here is a start:now, you have a two-dimensional list which is storing all of your data atributes. If you just want listing of all the players and their scores multiplied by 3:If you only want to show players how have not scored zero in any matches:
