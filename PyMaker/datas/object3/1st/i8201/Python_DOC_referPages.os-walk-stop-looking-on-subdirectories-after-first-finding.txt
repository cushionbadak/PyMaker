I need to get the first appearance of the repository.config files in a directory and stop looking in the subdirectories. Here is my directory tree:I need the ones in bold and stop looking in the subdirectories.I started tinkering with this code, but I couldn't figure it out.
this should do what you want:whenever you encounter a 'repository.config' file, set dirs to [] in order to prevent os.walk from descending further into that directory tree.
First, you have to make sure that topdown is set to True (this is default) so parent directories are scanned before child directories.Create an existing set() to remember which directories you traversed when successfully found a config file.Then, when you find your filename in the list:check if the directory of the file isn't a child of a directory you registeredif it's not, just note down the path of the file in existing (add os.sep, so you don't match substrings of directories starting with the current dirname at the same level: ex: path\to\dir2 should be scanned even if path\to\dir is already in the set. But path\to\dir\subdir will be successfully filtered out).code:
