I have a simplified python code looking like the following:Is there a way to access the maximum amount of iterations inside a for loop?Basically the code would change to:where thisloopsmaxcount is some fancy python method.Another option would be to implement a whole class for this behaviour.
Yeah, you can..but if the range isn't counting 1,2,3... then the stop won't be the number of steps, e.g. range(10,12) doesn't have 12 steps it has 2 steps. And range(0,100,10) counts in tens, so it doesn't have 100 steps. So you need to take into account (.stop - .start) / .step as appropriate.And it only works for range, in general a for loop could be reading from a network, or something based on user input, where the only way to know when the loop stops and how many loops is when it happens to get to the end.
There's nothing built-in, but you can easily compute it yourself:
In your example, you already know the number of iterations, so why not use that.But in general, if you want the number of elements in a (Python 3) range(), you can take its len():You still need the temporary variable since it's not the loop itself that knows the length, but the range object. len() also works on Python 2's xrange.
