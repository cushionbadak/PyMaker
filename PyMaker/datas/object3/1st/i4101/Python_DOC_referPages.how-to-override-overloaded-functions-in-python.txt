(Python squish)I am overriding the following methods-In my method, I am not sure what should I  define in my function, so that I can override all the methods. When I try to pass *args, its considered as tuple and does not match any of the above methods.The overloaded methods are that of squish. I want to override the above three methods and I am unable to find any solution to this.
Looking at these examples, it appears that calling installEventHandler(*args), where args is a tuple of suitable arguments (2 or 3), is sufficient. If you want to create your own installEventHandler which uses other parameters, just create what you want to create and do it so that you may call the original installEventHandler. A note about overloading:Built-in Python does not allow to handle overloading. However, you may want to use a single dispatch, which allows you to handle simple cases depending on the type of the first argument. The singledispatch decorator is implemented in functools.The package overloading provides you a more complex support for overloading functions by looking at the types of your arguments. Depending on your Python version, you might need to change some lines in order to preserve typing compatibility.In your case, it would be impossible to apply these solutions, for your original methods are not decorated with the suitable decorators.
