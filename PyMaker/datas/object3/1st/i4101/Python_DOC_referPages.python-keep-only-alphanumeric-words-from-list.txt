Use str.isalpha()Ex:Output:
You can use a list comprehension in combination with isalnum() function.OutputFrom python documentation:str.isalnum()  Return true if all characters in the string are  alphanumeric and there is at least one character, false otherwise. A  character c is alphanumeric if one the following returns True:  c.isalpha(), c.isdecimal(), c.isdigit(), or c.isnumeric().
You can also use filter with re:Output:
Better you go for isalnum or regex , Here i tried a little different approach just for fun, This is not for production code it will take time, I just tried to show you a different way :output:
