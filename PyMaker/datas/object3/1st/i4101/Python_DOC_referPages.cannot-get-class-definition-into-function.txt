Natural Text
I want to have a function in a central package that can create an object given the string name of the class.I'd like to have something like this:And then utils looks something like this:But, of course this doesn't work because my_class is defined in my main module and I'm trying to find it in the utils global()I was hoping there was a way to import make_class() and have it access the namespace of the main module, but this doesn't seem to work. Am I missing something how can I create this centralized factory?
You can pass references into your imported callables like thispass_global.py:pass_global_utils.py:outputs<__main__.A object at 0x7fbeba50e278>
