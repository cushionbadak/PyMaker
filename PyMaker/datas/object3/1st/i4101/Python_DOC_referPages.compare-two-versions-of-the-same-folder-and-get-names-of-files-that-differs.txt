Suppose I have following simplified files structure I have two copies of the main_folder, e.g. main_folder_v1 and main_folder_v2I want to compare both versions and get names of all files that differs (for example, get "foo.json" in case its content was updated in main_folder_v2)And I use below codeThe problem is that I will get ["foo.json"] in case it was updated in main_folder_v2, but I will never get ["bar.json"] as it seem that comparison of files in sub_folder not performedIs there any possibility to compare folders recursively using filecmp and get names of files that differs or os.walk() is the only solution?
[Python]: filecmp - File and Directory Comparisons supports recursive traversing via dircmp.subdirs. No need for os.walk (or any other similar functions).code.py:Output (for a dir structure similar to yours):@EDIT0:Modified the traverse_dircmp function to return the list of files, instead of printing them, as requested in one of the comments@EDIT1:Added generator functionality (as a personal exercise) which is the new (and preferred) style, and doesn't consume memory in case of huge dirs (!!requires Python3.3 or higher!!, or yield from statement can be replaced by the 2 commented (for and yield) lines below it)
