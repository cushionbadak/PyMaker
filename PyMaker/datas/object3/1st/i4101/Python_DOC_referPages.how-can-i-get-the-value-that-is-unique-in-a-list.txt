If there's a list the elements of which are [2,2,3,2,2]. I want to find the element that is unique, which is 3 this time. I think I could do this with count() method and a few loops, but I wonder if there are simpler and efficient ways to do this.
You can use collections.Counter:
Without any modules, you can simply perform xor of all elements to get the unique item.This outputs 0, if there is no unique item as noted by @KeyurPotdar.
You can use Counter and then min,
