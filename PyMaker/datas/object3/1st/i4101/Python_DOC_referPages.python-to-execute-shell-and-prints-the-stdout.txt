printing stdout[1] prints only single character. How to print single line instead of single character?                          
Depends on how your check.sh looks.  But if it's something simple, say:Then you can decode() (from bytes to string) and split on newlines (\n):
An alternative way that could be faster on large outputs, or when streaming output is to consider itertoolsThis will keep feeding characters into the join function until it finds a newline character, or the end of the output.It's worth noting that this specific implementation of the solution will only work with the first line of the output - so adjust accordingly.
