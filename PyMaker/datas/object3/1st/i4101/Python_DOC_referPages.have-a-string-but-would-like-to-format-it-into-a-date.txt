This question already has an answer here:How do I parse an ISO 8601-formatted date?                    24 answers                so I have a script that is pulling data out of our Zendesk(support CRM) installation and it's grabbing a couple of date fields via their REST API. The date fields come out like this: 2018-04-21T21:41:09Z and when I try to format it via Python, I get an error that the field itself is a string and won't accept strptime or strhtime.

Python novice who is self-taught, so I'm probably missing something very obvious or basic.
Use strptime:
