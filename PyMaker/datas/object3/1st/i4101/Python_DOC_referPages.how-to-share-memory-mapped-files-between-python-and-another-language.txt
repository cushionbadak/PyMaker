How to use the memory maps in Python to share data between Python and a C process whilst not storing anything on disk.How do both programs read make sure to read from the same location in memory?If the data is shared with C, is it best to use ctypes from Python, or parse the python objects in C?
I don't think this is directly possible with the mmap module. It wraps the file-oriented mmap functions, but not the POSIX SHM APIs. You can call them via ctypes though, check out shm_open which returns a file descriptor for a purely-in-memory SHM segment, which you can then mmap.
