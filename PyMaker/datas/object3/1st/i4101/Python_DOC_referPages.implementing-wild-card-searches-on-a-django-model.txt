I have a model called Host where I store all the information about all my servers. In the model I have a field hostname.I would like for the user to be able to specify wildcard searches like: *one where they'd get all the hosts with hostnames ending in one orone* where they'd get all the hosts with hostnames starting with oneand one*two and *one*two and *one*two* and *one*two*three and one*two*three and so forth.I have tried iterating over the results of hostname.split('*') but I end up with confusing if/elif continue mess.  Does anyone know a more elegant way to handle wildcards?
Are you looking for fnmatch ?GivesYou still have to iterate, but have to handle a single one if.
