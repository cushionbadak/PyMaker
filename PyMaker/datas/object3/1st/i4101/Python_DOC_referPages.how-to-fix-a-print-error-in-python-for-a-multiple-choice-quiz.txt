I apologize in advance if a topic like this has already been made, if so, please link me to it, thank you.So, I have been trying to create a multiple choice quiz in python (yes, very iconic) but when I try to run it, I get a syntax error which is common I suppose, however, it seems to have an issue with the print variable:the print variable for showing the score you get out of 10 doesn't seem to work.Am I doing something wrong?It'd be a great help if someone could tell me, I'm not very good at coding.
Take a look at printf-style string formatting for details on formatting and inserting other types of data into a printed string.
