I currently have this dict:And I`m looking for the more efficient way to add a new 'foo' key to all keys to get:
I believe you want dict comprehension 
If you really wanted to, you could re-build the dictionary using a comprehension:To index, you would now use new_dict[('foo', 'val_1')].However, it appears you're trying to build a multi-indexed dictionary. Why not make it a nested dict instead?Now, you'd just need to do new_dict['foo']['val_1']  to achieve the same effect. This is a lot faster and cheaper to construct because you re-use what you already have instead of re-creating it from scratch.
