I've already been able to load data from a YAML document into a configuration file.YAML:Python script:Config file:The issue I'm facing now is that I can't load the same YAML to multiple config files. I have a second config file that I would like to fill at the same time.Config file 2:How can I add this in the same python script? I also do not need to set the config files on the console, I can simply put their path into the script.
Since you want to process multiple templates, you need to make your load_args capable of handling multiple --template= arguments/options. I adapted your load_args to return a dict with values that are lists, but the check on number of arguments allowed (multiple templates, single YAML file) is crude. For processing your commandline you should look at the standard arparse module, where you can indicate per  argument/option that it can occur multiple times. Since you are going to reuse the data from YAML, load it only once, outside of the call make(). There is no excuse for not using safe_load() instead of the documented unsafe load().With:And the appropriate files you get:When you import argparse you can drop AllOWED_ARGS, print_usage and load_args, and do then do the following:(BTW look up the conjugation of to split, there is no such thing as "splited" (or "splitted"), i.e. something "has been split", )
