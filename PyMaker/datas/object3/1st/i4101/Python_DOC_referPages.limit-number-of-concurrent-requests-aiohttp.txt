I'm downloading images using aiohttp, and was wondering if there is a way to limit the number of open requests that haven't finished. This is the code I currently have:The problem is, I threw a print statement in to show me when each request is being made and it is making almost 21 requests at once, instead of the 3 that I am wanting to limit it to (i.e., once an image is done downloading, it can move on to the next url in the list to get). I'm just wondering what I am doing wrong here. 
Your limit setting works correctly. You made mistake while debugging.As Mikhail Gerasimov pointed in the comment, you put your print() call in wrong place - it must be inside session.get() context.In order to be confident that limit is respected, I tested your code against simple logging server - and test shows that the server receives exactly that number of connections that you set in TCPConnector. Here is the test:
asyncio.Semaphore solves exactly this issue.In your case it'll be something like this:You may also be interested to take a look at this ready-to-run code example that demonstrates how semaphore works.
