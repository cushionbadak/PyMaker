Is there any alternative one liner for this simple code block:I tried:It takes an input, but gives the following error:My problem is a little bit different than this qs. That qs helped print items in a list whether I need print them in newline.
As Jon and Patrick mention, that's not an error, it's what happens when you print the __repr__ of a generator expression.So you just need to "splat" that generator. :)demo outputIn that demo I entered 10 at the input prompt.In the comments I wondered how the speed of i * i compares to i ** 2. On my old 2GHz 32 bit single core machine, running Python 3.6.0, i * i is around 3 or 4 times faster than i ** 2. Here's some timeit code.output
You should wrap the expression into [] in order to have a list comprehension.If you want to print the results line by line just use extended iterable unpacking operator.
This is no error. Your statement inside the print(...) is a generator expression - the string representation of it is printed - thats what you deemed an "error".You can convert it by feeding it into a list:or by iterating it:The last one will lead to an output (for input() = 5) of:as each result of the generator is passed to print and printed with the default sep=' ' which you could change to '\n' - see PM 2Ring's post
This prints each i**2 on a separate line as your code does:
