This is a part of our assignments for Computer Programming in high school. These are the instructions. https://prospect.schoolloop.com/file/1407107943880/1376109333800/2888156401519472863.pdfFor example:The last line "No matches" is unexpected when the input is 7.
Try this:
If you find the value in the list, you should stop searching.You could then improve this by using python's for-else clause:
Think about what happens if you enter a number that isn't 11. Let's say you pick 2.The final item is reached. At this point, n == len(myList)-1) is True, and since 2 != myList[n], that condition is True as well, so "No Matches" is printed.You could use another variable (e. g. found = False) that is set to True as soon as the first match is found, and then check for that at the end of the loop.
You iterate over the list, for each value it checks if it is equal to your looked for value, if it is, it prints the one thing, else the other - hence you get one output per element in the list.Edit: reread and saw you need to find all, not only the first:If you had to only get the first, simply get the index of the element in the list and capture the error if it is not in it.That fits with pythons ask forgiveness not permission:
