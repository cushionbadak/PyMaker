I have a list in python that might look something like this: As you can see, all the numbers are close to their adjacent list items, except for the jump between 2 and 20. How would I get Python to notice this larger jump and store the list item's index?
You can use zip() to iterate through every i and i+1 element, and then compute the difference between the two adjacent elements.But then, it is up to you to define what is exactly a "jump".If you need the index, you can make use of enumerate():
You could get the average distance between elements and then output those indices where the distance to the last element is larger than that average.
You need a set number that is the number that will set a jump off.This means looping over comparing the current number with its neighbour and alerting whenever the numbers have a difference of your set jump number.This is assuming your list is already sorted.
Assuming that the values are arranged in ascending order (like your example), you could created a sorted list of (DIFF, INDEX) pairs.
