Natural Text
When I print out sys.path in python it apparently always starts with apostrophes denoting an empty string '', why is that?
From the documentation,As initialized upon program startup, the first item of this list,  path[0], is the directory containing the script that was used to  invoke the Python interpreter. If the script directory is not  available (e.g. if the interpreter is invoked interactively or if the  script is read from standard input), path[0] is the empty string,  which directs Python to search modules in the current directory first.
