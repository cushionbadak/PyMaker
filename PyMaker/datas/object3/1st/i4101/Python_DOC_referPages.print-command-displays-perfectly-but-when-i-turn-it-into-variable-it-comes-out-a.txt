I am trying to learn python, so I downloaded aptanaStudio3 and this happens. Code:Output:it should print just 
Python 2 has print as a command, so all you need isIn Python 3, print is a function, so the parentheses are required for the call.In most contexts, the series of values in parentheses is a tuple; this is just like a list, except that you can't change the individual elements (i.e. a tuple is immutable).
'One', 'Two', 'Three' is a tuple. You need to do 'One' + 'Two' + 'Three', or you can just keep it in one string like One Two Three, so that you are printing a string.A tuple is a group of strings, and you just need to print a single string. You probably typed , which defines a tuple, instead of +, which concatenates strings. Make sure you are using print("") for Python 3, and print "" for Python 2.Read this and this to learn more.
If you want the python3 style print function in python2, you can use the following:The sep keyword is the separator used between arguments and defaults to ' '.By doing this, you can write print related code that will work in both python 2 and 3.
