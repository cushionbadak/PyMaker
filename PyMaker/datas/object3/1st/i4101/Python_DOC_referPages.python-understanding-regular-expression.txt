So, I'm taking a list of usernames from a Linux server at school, this top code opens the directory where they are kept and saves it as informationthat works just fine and list the users like this... where it list them 1 per line. (there is atleast 100 usernames) my problem is, I want to create a "look-up" for these usernames, this is my code to search for usernames that only start with the letter j (so should only list jaxe32 from this list)but when I run this I get this error, and if I get rid of .group() it then just states "none", but no error. So i'm not sure if the list is getting saved to a string right, or if I'm just missing something obvious. I only want to use regular expression for this, not anything else.
From the documentation on re.match:If zero or more characters at the beginning of string match the regular expression pattern, return a corresponding match object. Return None if the string does not match the pattern;re.match is only useful if the match starts from the beginning of the string, it does not find all matches in a string.This leaves you with two main options:Split the input file by line and use re.matchUse multiline matching and re.findallOption 1:Output:Option 2 (using (?m)^j(?!j)\w*$):Output:
The problem is that when the match method doesn't match anything, it doesn't return an empty match object, on which you could call the group method, it returns None. Which does not have the group method. Just check for None before you call any methods.
