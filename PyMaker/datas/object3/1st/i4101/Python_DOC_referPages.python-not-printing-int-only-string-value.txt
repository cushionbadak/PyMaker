The range() function will include the first value and exclude the second.
Read what range() does. First argument is a starting number, you can't start from smaller if you want to print from bigger to smaller. You can do range(2, 11, 2) for increasingly list or range(10, 1, -2) for decreasingly.There's also reverse range(2, 11, 2)[::-1] option, but its better to just use it as planned.
Since your range starts at 2, and ends at 11, this code won't work since you are stepping down by -2. You will have to START at 10 and then step down negatively instead of stepping down from 2. Below I have an example that gets you the output that you are seeking:And here is your output:
