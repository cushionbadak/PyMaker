I am new to web scraping and for practice I am trying to web scrape a website and turn the results into a csv file. When I come to the part to turn the results into a csv file, it doesn't put the address in the address column. I want the data to go into the address column. The code is as follows.Any help is appreciated. Thanks you in advance.
it seems like in your address data new line character is present try to replace below line for address in your code and try running again
