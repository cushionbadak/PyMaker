This is my implementation of a MinHeap and MaxHeap in python. This uses a comparator to reverse the sequence of storage in the MaxHeapThe MinHeap seems to work fine, however the MaxHeap throw up the following error.I don't quite seem to understand what am I doing wrong here. Can someone help me with this.
I've added __repr__ and __gt__ methods to your Comparator class, so the code now runs, and the Comparator instances display their val when printed.The important thing is to get those comparison methods to do the comparisons correctly between two Comparator instances.You'll notice that I've eliminated most of the methods from MaxHeap. They aren't needed because the methods inherited from MinHeap work ok. You may wish to restore this one to MaxHeapdepending on how you intend to use MaxHeap.outputIt's probably a Good Idea to give Comparator the full set of rich comparison methods. They aren't needed to make the above code work, but they will make the Comparator instances more flexible. So in case you want them, here they are:
