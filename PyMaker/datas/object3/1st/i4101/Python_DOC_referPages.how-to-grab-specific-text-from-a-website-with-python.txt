Natural Text
I was wondering how could I make a program that will grab information from this webiste: https://growtopiagame.com/ (Or any at general), But I don't want to grab every text from it: I just want to grab Part where it says "4231 Players Online",And store it in variable that I can use later on...
Extracting data from website are generally called web scraping. Glad to have such powerful packages in python to do this task , such as Seleniumand  BeautifulSoup. Please check this for more details how to do web scraping.
Use a web scraping library. For Python, we can use BeautifulSoup.What you'd want to do is first get the whole page and parse the HTML you get. You'd do something like:After that, you will continue using BeautifulSoup. But how do we get the online player count?Simple! We just need to check the HTML code of the website first. From the website, open1 "Inspect Element" on the text you want to parse. In your case, you we'd get the following HTML snippet:I left out the unnecessary HTML code as far as your problem is concerned.From the snippet we get, notice that the online player count (40961, as of current writing) is inside the <span> element with the "counter" class.From there, we can now extract the online player count by just instructing BeautifulSoup to get the text of span.counter. To be more accurate, we can , instead, get the text of div.server-status span.counter.I'll leave writing the rest of the code up to you.Footnote    I'm not sure if it is the proper term. Is "open" the proper term?
