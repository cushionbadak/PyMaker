I'm just starting to use Asyncio and I'm trying to use it to parse a website.I'm trying to parse 6 sections (self.signals) of the site, each section has N number of pages with tables on them, so essentially I'm trying to async the loop that calls what section, and async the pages in each section. This is what I have so far.This does do the job successfully, but it somehow does it slower than if I were to do the parsing without asyncio. Any tips for an asynchronous noob?Edit: Added full code
Remember python has a GIL, so threaded code will not help performance.  To potentially speed things up use a ProcessPoolExecutor however note you'll incur the following overhead:pickle/unpickling data to sub-process workerpickle/unpickling result sent back to main processYou can avoid 1. if you run on a fork safe environment and store the data in a global variable.You can also do stuff like share a memory mapped file...also sharing raw strings/bytes is the fastest.
