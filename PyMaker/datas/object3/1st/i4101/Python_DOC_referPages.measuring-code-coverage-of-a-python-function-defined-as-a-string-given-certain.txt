The second assertion fails, indicating that importlib.reload silently failed to reload the modified module, can anyone explain why?demo: https://ideone.com/wtaENFEDIT:- python 3.6.1- archlinux (linux 4.10.13)
The following code, extended with time.sleep(10) doesn't throw the assertion error (the safe threshold appear to be one second). This provides the explanation why the reload didn't work as expected. So the answer to the question why the assertion error is raised isimportlib.reload() uses file timestamp to decide about re-compiling the cached file.If the code update/change happens very fast, the cached and the script file are considered to be the same version and there is no re-compiling of the cached files from which modules are re-loaded.
