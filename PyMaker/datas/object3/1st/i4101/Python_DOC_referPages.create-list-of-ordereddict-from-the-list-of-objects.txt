I have a code where i created the list of dict from list of objects using list comprehension.Sample code:How to change this to OrderedDict, because i want to maintain the order of the elements.I'm using Python 2.7
Here are a couple of solutions:Both versions use the basic constructor of OrderedDict, which accepts an iterable of pairs. The first version is direct and hard coded, the second one uses a list comprehension to select the values based on a list of attribute names.
