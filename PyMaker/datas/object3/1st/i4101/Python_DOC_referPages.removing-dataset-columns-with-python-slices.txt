I have the following dataframe:The output of dataframe is this:I want remove or select just the Luminosity column, then, with python slices I have the following:And the output of X is the following numpy array:I have the same situation, but a new dataframe with 76 columns, like thisThis is the output when I read it. In total, the dataframe have 76 columns, I just want select 25 columns which are the columns named PORVL2N1 , PORVL2N2, PORVL4N1 and so successivelyuntil arrive to the end column named PORVL24N2 which is the 76th columnFor the moment, the solution that I have is create a new data frame only with the columns of my interest, this is:And the output is:I want make the same, select just the columns of my interest, but using python slices with iloc to indexing and selecting by position, such as I make in the beginning of my question.I know that this is possible with slides, but I cannot understand good the slices sintax to get it.How to can I using iloc and slices python to select my interest columns?
Considering you have your data in dataframe df, you can do the following: Alternatively, you can use .filter() with regex.Have a look at docs for more information.
Use regular slice notation...slice objects also workSelection By Position
