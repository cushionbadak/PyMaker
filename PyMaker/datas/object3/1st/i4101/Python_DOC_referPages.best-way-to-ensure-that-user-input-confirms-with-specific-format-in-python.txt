I am new to python and I am trying write some code that ensures user input follows the following format:(Integer):(Integer):(Letter)So this would be valid:'3:2:H'What is the beginners approach to achieving this? Many of the solutions to similar problems that I have read on stackoverflow are a bit too advanced for me. Any help would be greatly appreciated! Thanks
regular expressions are the general answer, but for this specific instance you could write:Essentially: do a bunch of things that will throw exceptions if the user input is wrong, wrap it in a try, and catch any exception with a return False. If no exceptions are thrown, well this must be valid so return True.Note that this validates input like:654412:89777056444.12:the entire written works of Shakespearebut if you're restricting this to one-character only, you could do:The general solution, as I mentioned above, is regular expressions.The pattern here is:We try to match against this pattern, and simply return whether the match was successful (a failed match leaves m = None, while a successful match returns a match object that we don't actually need, so we can safely throw it away. This can be equivalently spelled return bool(m), but that's less explicit about what m can be!)
I suggest using the argparse package for getting inputs. Here is the package link argparse.Below is a sample code I've written using argparse and the regex module of Python. I used Python3 for running the script.
