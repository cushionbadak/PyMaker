Is there a way to use sockets to send/review data from a website like a Google search. Make it so you run a program and it searches some fixed value, then outputs the results in a Python shell.
Yes. Try sending a HTTP GET request, e.g. bare minimum request to a HTTP 1.1 server:That's a lot more work than you need to do however. Consider using a library such as requests:Or the standard library urlopen() function.
