I am beginner in Python and I have learned most of the basics of the program. So I decided to create my first project in order to test my skills and understanding. My project involves parsing images for a certain manga chapter from a website called https://bato.to/. Upon looking at the html code, I notice the image code is hidden and is put in a format I never seen before.I tried using BeautifulSoup to find the var images tag to extract the directory with image links but I was not able to get it. I have never worked with "var" tags. Can someone tell me how to extract var images tag?This is code I have written so far, but I am stuck. I cant figure out how to extract the tags.
