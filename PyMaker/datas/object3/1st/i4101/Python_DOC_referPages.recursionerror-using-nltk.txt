Natural Text
I run this code in purpose to processing text before feed it in my modeland got RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded in comparisontrain_text is a python series with textstem is PorterStemmer object from nltk libraryWhat can I do to solve this?Thanks.
It looks like it can be won by Docs:setrecursionlimit().But remember, that recursion is not free - it consumes memory_of_function_consumes * amount_of_circles_of_recursion - so you can run out of memory when you have a huge amount of recursion runs. Thats why that limit is hardcoded in Python, and I think it is bad idea to overwrite it.
You can manually set the recursion depth  But do so with caresys.setrecursionlimit(n)  #replace n with the depth you want to achieveCause: It occurs when the stack exceeds its limit(Stack Overflow)Workaround: Or use a iterative as opposed to recursion techniqueEDIT:From the Python Dochttps://docs.python.org/2/library/sys.html#sys.setrecursionlimitSet the maximum depth of the Python interpreter stack to limit. This  limit prevents infinite recursion from causing an overflow of the C  stack and crashing Python.The highest possible limit is platform-dependent. A user may need to set the limit higher when she has a program that requires deep  recursion and a platform that supports a higher limit. This should be  done with care, because a too-high limit can lead to a crash.
