I'm currently trying to find the good way to stack some information to process them later. But I need to process that information with a delay. For now, I use the Queue library to stack all the information. I need to set a timer or a thing like this, to control more or less the execution after the information was stacked.Thanks in advance, hope I was clear enough
Could sleep fit your need?This will add a 100 milliseconds delay
