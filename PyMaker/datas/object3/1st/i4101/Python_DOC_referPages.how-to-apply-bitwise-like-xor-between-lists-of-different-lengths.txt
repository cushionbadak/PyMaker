What i would like to do is to initialize an array which has 5 elements set to 0 and then copy the other array to the first one, something like this:Is there any pythonic way in doing so except:Edit:I forgot to mention that buffer a will always be filled with plain zeroes at the beginning and condition len(b) < len(a) is always true, also in each case buffer a will always start getting overwritten from index 0.Ill explain why i need this kind of behaviour in the first place, basicly I have a raw 256-byte UDP frame. Buffer a corresponds to bytes 16-31 in the frame. Depending on some conditions, those bytes will either be overwritten or be set at 0, length of b is always 12.

This works in Python 2:And this in Python 3:I created a generator g but if you know in advance you want all values of it already, then it's okay to have a list comprehension right away instead.This is the doc for zip_longest: https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.zip_longestDirectly with the list comprehension (py3):
Why waste time defining a in the first place? You can simply append the correct number of 0s to b instead:
Something like this (Note: XOR operator is ^ ?
