I would like to give slice string as argument, see belowIt works fine with positive index, e.g., -s 1:10, -s -5 (which gives rise to slice[None, -5, None]) is also fine, but errors out with negative index as first parameter, e.g., -5:How should I support negative index as first slice parameter?
Fortunately, argparse by default does understand the = tokenThe reason why -5 works directly as one might expect is due to argparse having implemented some heuristics, which are detailed in the linked documentation (basically -5 looks like a number, -5: does not).This issue is caused essentially by argparse treating all - (by default) as flags.  This can be redefined using prefix_chars.
