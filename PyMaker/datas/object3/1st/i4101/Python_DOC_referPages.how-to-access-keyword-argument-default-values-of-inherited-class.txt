I'm trying to make some modifications to the seaborn.JointGrid class. My plan was to make a child class and inherit most methods from the JointGrid class, like so:If I do this, I do not have access to the variables size, ratio, space etc., which are part of the __init__ method of JointGrid: I noticed that these variables are not initialized in JointGrid class with the usual self.size = size in the __init__ method. Perhaps this is why I can not access them from my child class? How can I access these variables size, ratio, space etc?  
You can use inspect.getfullargspec to do this:Note that your code would only need to do this once, since the signature of the imported class won't change.
Why don't you just use the same arguments as the class you want to subclass?Else you could set some default yourself,
