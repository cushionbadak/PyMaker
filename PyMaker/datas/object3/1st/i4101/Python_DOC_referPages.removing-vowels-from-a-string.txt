Natural Text
I'm suppose remove all the vowels from the any string that would be entered. I'm trying to make the code as simple as possible.Thank you for the help.
Two problems:strip is the wrong method; it only removes from the beginning and end of a string. Use .replace(something, '').Strings are immutable; a method cannot modify a string. strip returns the modified string.
So you call strip on each character.... and then what? You don't update the string, because strings are immutable and i.strip is not an inplace operation. A naive improvement over your solution would filtering characters out inside a list comprehension and then doing a join on the result:A small note: if your string contains mixed case, you may want to eitherLowercase text, orAugment vowels to contain uppercase vowels: vowels = set('aeiouAEIOU'), orUse str.casefold (as per @Adam Smith's comment)â€”augmenting vowels is no longer needed in that case: You can get even better with str.translate (this works on python-3.x):
This code worked too! The dude who wrote the anwser deleted their post. Shame it worked really well. 
str.strip is not an in-place operation and takes a string as an argument. Therefore, your code will not work as desired.You can use bytearray to efficiently remove certain characters from your string. You may see an order of magnitude better performance for larger strings.Character removal can be performed with bytearray.translate directly, without the need to use str.maketrans.
