I have a array contains file names like below:I want to quickly group these files into multiple arrays like this:Could anyone tell me how to do it in few lines in python?
Something like that should work:If input list isn't sorted, than use something like that:
If your data is already sorted by the file name, you can use itertools.groupby:Otherwise, you can base your code on this recipe, which is more efficient than sorting the list and then using groupby.Input: Your input is a flat list, so use a regular ol' loop to iterate over it:Group identifier: The files are grouped by the first 3 letters:Output: The output should be a nested list rather than a dict, which can be done withPutting it together:Read the recipe answer for more details.
You can do it using a dictionary.Then you have to sort the dictionary by key value.The last step is to use a list comprehension in order to achieve your requirement.Output
Using a simple iteration and dictionary.Ex:Output:
If your list is ordered like this here is a short script for this task.
The code above will cut the initial list into sub lists and append them as individual lists into a resulting, larger list.Note: not a few lines, but you can convert this to a function.
