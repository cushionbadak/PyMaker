It's easy in python to calculate simple permutations using itertools.permutations().You can even find some possible permutations of multiple lists.It's also possible to find permutations of different lengths.How would you find permutations of all possible 1) lengths, 2) orders, and 3) from multiple lists?I would assume the first step would be to combine the lists into one. A list will not de-dup items like a set would.
Like you suggested, do:and then use your solution for finding permutations of different lengths:would find:If you want to distinguish e.g. ('d', 'e', 'f') from ('f', 'e', 'd') (thanks @Kefeng91 for pointing this out) and others, replace itertools.combinations with itertools.permutations, like @YakymPirozhenko suggests.
