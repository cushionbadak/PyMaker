Code below, gets the answer through get request and writes the result to the list "RESULT"I use the code below to exclude duplicate entries:It seems to me it is not optimal since it is necessary to get a list of all the rows to exclude duplicates.How can I find duplicates before loading a rows into the list RESULT?for example, the rows I write to the list RESULT:
Instead of use another method to exclude duplicate entries, append item to the list if item doesn't exist in the list RESULT. Then you don't need method unique_items(). You can find duplicates before loading a row into the list RESULT using this:
Just use a set instead of a list.Above code will exclude any duplicates. The only difference from your case will be that elements of result will be tuples instead of lists.At the end, you can recast the set to a list by:result = list(result)
