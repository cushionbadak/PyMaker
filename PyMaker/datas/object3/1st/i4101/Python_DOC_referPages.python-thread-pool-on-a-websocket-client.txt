I have a web socket client that is receiving messages from a websocket server using asyncio. The messages from the websocket server come in very quickly and it runs indefinitely. I want to setup a thread pool to ensure I have enough threads. All the examples I have seen setup a queue (here is one example: Thread Pool with Queue. The examples that I have seen all have a predefined array of tasks then it starts processing them using the thread pool.In my example above I don't see how I could implement this? As messages are coming in every second and I want to start a thread to process each message as it comes in. Is there a way to achieve what I am trying to do with a thread pool when I don't have a predefined array of tasks? 
Would run_in_executor() do?
