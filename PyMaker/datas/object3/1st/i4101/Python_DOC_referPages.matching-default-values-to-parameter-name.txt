How do I match my functions variable names to the default values using python and inspect?I can get the args and get the defaults, but the aren't 1:1 when you try to line them up.If you were to zip the two arrays into a dictionary, the x would get mapped to 4 and y isn't mapped to anything.  But the result should be y=4.Thanks
You can use inspect.signature() which returns a Signature object for your function. Then you can easily access to the arguments with their respective annotation and default values.Or separately access to annotation or defaults:
