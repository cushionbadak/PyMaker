Natural Text
I have a seemingly simple problem, which I cannot seem to solve. Given a string containing a DOI, I need to remove the last character if it is a punctuation mark until the last character is letter or number. For example, if the string was:I want the following output:ie. remove .',I wrote the following script to do this:However, this produces 10.1097/JHM-D-18-00 but I would like it to produce 10.1097/JHM-D-18-00044. Why is the 44 removed from the end? 
Corrected code: This gives the output you want, while keeping the original code mostly the same.
The string function rstrip() is designed to do exactly this:
This is one way using next and str.isalnum with a generator expression utilizing enumerate / reversed.The default parameter 0is used so that, if no alphanumeric character is found, an empty string is returned.
If you dont wanna use regex:Removes the last character until it's no longer a punctuation character.
