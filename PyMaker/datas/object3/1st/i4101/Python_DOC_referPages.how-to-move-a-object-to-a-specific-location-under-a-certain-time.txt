This question already has an answer here:How to make a proper server tick?                    1 answer                I have tried to make my objects move down for a certain time period, but the code I have now did not show the animation which the object floats down or up.I am wondering if there is a correct way to move an object or image to a location under a certain time?
You could use the time module to execute code every second for a certain amount of time. Particularly time.sleep()I see nothing wrong with using your method. Although I do think it makes more sense to use < in this scenario:You could also consider using a for loop with a range instead of a while loop:Change time.sleep(1) to time.sleep(0.001) if you want milliseconds.Another method:Or if you wanted milliseconds instead.
Sometimes it can fail to check properly when you use '!=' rather than less than. If you use '<', it will cease to evaluate even if the number goes over 400.
