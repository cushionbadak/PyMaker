I am fairly new to python and was looking for solutions to generate random MAC addresses when I found this:what I am trying to understand is the use of '%02x'% in the code. Is it related to how mac addresses are represented which is a 48 bit hexadecimal value separated by :? 
https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#string-formatting'%02x' is a format string for specifying a zero-filled two-digits hexadecimal number.'%02x' % number will create the actual string with the number in such format.
If you don't understand a list comprehension then the best tactic is to unwind it.
