Natural Text
I need to parse the JSON file which looks like the same as in the example below. I need to add each properties values with other properties values to club everyone together like p_30_34_yrs with other properties p_30_34_yrs and so on. I need JSON file as an outcome with these added values- p_30_34_yrs together, p_tot together and so on. Please help me out as I am very new to Python. I am able to parse it through load() and giving me dict as well but when I go like dict["features"] it converts it into list and even in list I am unable to get each properties keys-values, on which I apply sum().
Something like this (test code)?
