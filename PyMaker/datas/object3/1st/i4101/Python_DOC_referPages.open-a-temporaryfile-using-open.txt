Natural Text
I'm trying to interface with an existing library that uses the built in open() function to read a .json file using either a str or bytes object representing a path, or an object implementing the os.PathLike protocol. My function generate a dictionary which is converted to json using json.dump(), but I'm not sure how to pass that to the existing function which expects a file path.I was thinking something like this might work, but I'm not sure how to get a os.PathLike object of a TemporaryFile.
Create a NamedTemporaryFile() object instead; it has a .name attribute you can pass on to the function:Opening an already-open file object does have issues on Windows (you are not allowed to); there you'd have to close the file object first (making sure to disable delete-on-close), and delete it manually afterwards:The with statement causes the file to be closed when the suite exits (so by the time you reach the open() call).
