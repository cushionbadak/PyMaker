/Users/smcho/Desktop/bracket/[10,20] directory has "abc.txt", but when I run this Python codeIt returns an empty list. Can't Python's glob handle the bracket letters or others?Is there any way to solve this problem?
The brackets in glob are used for character classes (e.g. [a-z] will match lowercase letters). You can put each bracket in a character class to force them being matched:[[] is a character class containing only the character [, and []] is a character class containing only the character ] (the closing bracket can be placed in a character class by putting it in the first position).Additionally, since brackets aren't escaped in string literals, your code will look for a backslash as well as a bracket.
glob uses fnmatch under the hood. You could use it directly:Or using (non-public) glob.glob1() (it is present at least in Python 2.3+ including Python 3):Here's the implementation of glob.glob1:
In Python 3.4 you can use glob.escape.
You could use path.replace('[', '[[]') to have arbitrary input paths handled by glob correctly.
