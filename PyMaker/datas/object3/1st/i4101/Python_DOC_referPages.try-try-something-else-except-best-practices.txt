I'm writing a Python script that uses requests but depending on where the script is run, requests may already be available on the path, it may be only available by the file system or it might not be available at all.I have written the following:This does what I want it to do but I have read that nesting Try/Except statements is not a good idea so I am wondering if there is a best practice here that I should use instead? Is there a better way to Try import requests first (as if this is available it could be a new version than on the file system)If that fails, then add the predefined dir to the path and retry the importAnd if that fails then sys.exit(1)
Its better to use virtual environment to handle required packageshttps://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html
