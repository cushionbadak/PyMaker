I'm doing this project where I have to make python password generator which should be between 12 and 30 characters long, the characters should be a combination of letters and numbers and the letters should be both capitalized and lower case. I have code that gives me a password, here's that code:However, when I run it, it gives me something that looks like this:    encinntgl.iieil.crggei_gng.t_nsi.itiltr.itsgagtrgtedldtsn.Not only does it not contain a combination of uppercase, lowercase, and digits, it exceeds the range needed, I don't know what I'm doing wrong, so if someone could help me I'd appreciate it a lot.
The biggest issue in your current code is that you assign strings to letters and digits, instead of the actual items you want to access from the string library.  Try instead:but...You should not be using the random library to generate passwords, as it is not cryptographically secureInstead use the secrets library.In particularly, secrets should be used in preference to the default pseudo-random number generator in the random module, which is designed for modelling and simulation, not security or cryptography.
Couple of issues:As mentioned by others, you were using the string.ascii_letters and string.digits wrong.  Second, in your loop you were doubling the number of characters generated by random because you were adding both letters and the digits... so you can either divide by 2 or you can go from 6 to 15 as shown below.However, please note that this gives you a password that always alternates between letter and number.  Better way to do it would be:In this solution I combined your strings of digits and letters and made them almost the same length (multiply by 5) so there is an equal chance of getting either a letter or number.  Then I selected from that joined up string.
