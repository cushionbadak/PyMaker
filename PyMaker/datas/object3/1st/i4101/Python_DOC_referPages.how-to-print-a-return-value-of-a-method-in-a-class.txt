I was working on an online tutorial on class in python, then I wanted to try to make a function that print out the value in the return of the other functions. Here is the code:This is what I get: This car should sell at:  <bound method Truck.sale_price of  <__main__.Truck object at 0x10666da50>>This car should be bought at:  <bound method Truck.purchase_price of <__main__.Truck object at 0x10666da50>>What am I doing wrong? how do I make the return value of the methods to show up?? 
it looks like you have a typo in def sale_price(self):return 5000.0 * self.wheels not return 5000.0 * self_wheelsin def spec(self): you are not calling the class methods, you want.
