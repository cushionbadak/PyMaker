Got a CSV which I am selecting a random sample of 500 rows using the following code:what I'd like to do is update a column called [winner] if they exist within the sample and then save it back to a csv file but I have no idea how to achieve this...There is a unique identifier in a column called [ID].how would I go about doing this?
Starting with a CSV that looks like this:You could use the following approach. The whole file is read in, rows are chosen by a randomly selected index, and written back out to the file.This will give the following output:EDIT: It turns out that having the first column of the CSV being called ID is not a good idea if you want to open with Excel. It then incorrectly thinks the file is in SYLK format.
First, why are you using csv and not a db? even an sqlite would be much easier (builtin - import sqlite3)Second, you'll need to write the whole file again. I suggest you use your lines as lists and just update them (lists are like pointers so you can change the inner values and it will update)lines=[list(line) for line in source]and thenfor choice in random_choice:    choice[WINNER_INDEX]+=1and write the file
