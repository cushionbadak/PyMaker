I have a class, which contains some data. Operator + for two objects of such class should merge data from both objects and returns a new object. However, it should be much better if in the case of += operator would append data from the added object and return self. Here some pseudo code to demonstrate what I want to achieve.If these two case of usage __add__ function can be distinguished, Python code would much better read and understand! Consider this:
No, it is not possible.But if you implement __iadd__() then += will use that instead.
object.__iadd__(self, other) for +=object.__radd__(self, other) for +see datamodel for reference
