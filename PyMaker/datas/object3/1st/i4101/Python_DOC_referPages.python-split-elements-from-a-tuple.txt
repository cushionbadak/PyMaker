Natural Text
I have tuple in Python that looks like this:and I wanna split it out so I could get every item from tuple independent so I could do something like this:or something similar to that, My need is to have every item separated. I tried with .split(",") on tuple but I've gotten error which says that tuple doesn't have split optionAny help or advice is welcome
Python can unpack sequences naturally.
Best not to use tuple as a variable name.You might use split(',') if you had a string like 'sparkbrowser.com,0,http://facebook.com/sparkbrowser,Facebook', that you needed to convert to a list. However you already have a tuple, so there is no need here.If you know you have exactly the right number of components, you can unpack it directlyPython3 has powerful unpacking syntax. To get just the domain and the text you could userest will contain [0, 'http://facebook.com/sparkbrowser']

An alternative for this, is to use collections.namedtuple. It makes accessing the elements of tuples easier.Demo:
