What is the meaning of the following line in Python? 
Let's resolve it from the inside out. Firstly, dict is the dictionary type. Like other types, calling it creates an instance (also known as object) of that type. A defaultdict is a type that takes a callable parameter: something that, when called, produces an item to put in the dictionary. This happens when an entry is accessed that was not present, instead of producing a KeyError like an ordinary dict. Thirdly, lambda is a way to create unnamed functions based on a single expression, so these two are similar (the second holds a function that knows its own name, the first doesn't):And finally the whole thing is wrapped in another defaultdict. So the result is that x is a defaultdict that produces defaultdicts that produce dict instances. At the third level there aren't defaults anymore.
