I am writing a dictionary in a CSV file using this:While reading this file, I get a list of length = 1. I get the whole dictionary that I saved by writing row = info[0]. But when I get the type(row), it is str and not the dictionary. Why is that and how can I get the dictionary?
Using csv.DictReader and csv.DictWriter, look at the sample code
