I apologize for the seemingly confusing title, hope the code will help clarify the question.I have a python data structure that looks like this:I want to achieve the following:Without having to address each dictionary key like person['key'] but rather by just key; something like this:(which curiously prints name, id, age)Thanks in advance!PS: Bonus question! Is there a specific name for list/arrays of homogeneous dictionaries/objects (also outside of Python)? List of homogenous dictionaries seems quite a mouthful.
You an use operator.itemgetter() and map().But note that if you want all the values from all the keys you could simply use dict.values() in a list comprehension to get all the respective values. 
You can just d:In Python 3.6 you could also do (provided that values are defined exactly in the same order you shown us in the original question):However, this relies on the fact that the dictionary is defined exactly as it is in your example. If the order of the values changes, the code will break, as values will get mixed as well.Hint: I deliberately named my variable person_id instead of id, because It's an anti-pattern to shadow built-in variables and/or functions, and it happens that there's a built-in called id.
that will work
You could build a small class with an __iter__ method:Output:
