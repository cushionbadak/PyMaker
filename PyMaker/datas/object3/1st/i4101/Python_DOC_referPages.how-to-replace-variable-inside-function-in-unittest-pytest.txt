I have a problem with replace variable inside method which i have to test, namely:and for needs of test I have to replace path_dir from real result of os.listdir to some test list i.e. ['whatever1.txt', 'whatever2.txt', 'whatever3.txt']How to do it?BR, Damian
You can use mock.patch to set return value for your variable.For exampleor alternatively you can set a side effect
You should try mock os.listdir to return the mock test data.
