When I try to convert timestamp, I used 2 method and their outcomes are different from each otherMethod 1:Method 2:Could you please help me to understand why?Best regards,YX
In repl which internal time is UTC the result is the same: https://repl.it/repls/IndolentBurlywoodAddonsOn my local machine (UTC+2) two values differ exactly for two hours. So looks like the explanation is the timezone.
The fromtimestamp returns the local time so if you're in a timezone that isn't UTC, then you'll get a different result.You should use utcfromtimestamp instead.
