In a list = [1,2,1,1,1,2,3,4] I would like to print the output as [1,1,1,2] which is to print the duplicates in the list without printing the first time they occurred in python. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks. 
A simple solution is to define a function which uses set to track seen items. If an item is not seen, add it to the set. If it is seen, yield that item.If you wrap this in a generator, you have the benefit of making this process lazy, which is useful with large lists when you only need to iterate results.
One way to achieve that would be:[1, 1, 1, 2]
