I have a dictionary with favorite colors assigned to each person:Firstly, I just want to make sure if this is the right way to assign values in a dictionary! I'm pretty new to python.Then I have thisIn this function I want to see how many people's favorite color is green. I thought of creating a for loop and then increasing the count by 1 for every "green" in fav_color, but I'm not quite sure how to execute this. I also have to create a main function which uses this use_favcolors function and prints the number of "greens". Could anybody help out? Thanks in advance*How is this too broad??? I've seen other questions asked THE SAME WAY? I would use those threads but the answers aren't the ones I'm looking for. 
Using sum(), iterating over dict.values():The boolean color == fav_color gets automatically converted to 0/1 in the sum.
you can use the dicts .values() the method.Outputs:.values() will return an iterator over the values:['green', 'blue', 'yellow']Other useful methods are .keys() and .items.keys() will return an iterator over the keys:['John', 'Bobby', 'PapaSanta'].items() will return an iterator over the key, value pairs:[('John', 'green'), ('Bobby', 'blue'), ('PapaSanta', 'yellow')]
