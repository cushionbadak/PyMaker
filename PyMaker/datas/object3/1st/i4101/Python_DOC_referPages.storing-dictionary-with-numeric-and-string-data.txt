I have a Python dictionary with some keys/values integers, others strings.I am looking for a way to store this dictionary as a single file, with the following conditions:Type sensitivity of keys and values are maintained.I can view the mapping outside of Python.I tried the following solutions, but with no success. Is there a way to do this, preferably without additional storage requirements / manipulation?JsonType sensitivity is maintained for values, but not keys:HDF5HDF5 dataset names must be strings, so this has the same problem as Json:
You can use Yaml. Install pip install pyyaml.Output file:Reading the file:
You can write the file as stringThen read is back using ast.literal_eval
