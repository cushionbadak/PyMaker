Given the following example:I would like to write another method which uses f above but adds a constant, i.e.This would be one way. However, this smells very much like decorating! What would be the proper pythonic way to do this?
You can write a simple function outside the class:Output:Edit: you can utilize functools.wraps with a classmethod in Python3. The wrapped function f will return x*2 and the decorator g will add 10 to the returned result of the function passed to it. However, to be able to save the original functionality of f, you can utilize the __wrapped__ attribute:Output:
