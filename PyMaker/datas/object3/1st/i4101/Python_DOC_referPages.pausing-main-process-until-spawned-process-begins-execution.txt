How can I keep the main process from continuing until a spawned process has begun its execution?Suppose I had the following simple example:As I understand it, when a Process.start() occurs, the process has to "reimport" everything from __main__, and because of this, in my program there is a delay from when foo() would begin, yet __main__ continues while the new process is starting up.The only working method I have is using a multiprocessing.Pipe():But this seems clunky since I dont even use the Pipe() for what it is meant for. Another method I thought would work was to use a multiprocessing.Lock(), but because of the "reimport" delay, the target method does acquire the lock before bar() is executed on __main__.Is there a better way to handle this?
You can use Event. You can make you main process wait for the event to be set before continuing. And your child process will set the event when it start in your target function.
