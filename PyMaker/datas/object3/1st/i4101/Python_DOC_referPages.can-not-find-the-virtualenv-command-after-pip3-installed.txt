I use the pip3 install the virtualenv in my CentOS7.2:But I can not use it, there do not find the command.
Instead of using virtualenv, try running python3 -m venv. So to create a new virtualenv, just do python3 -m venv ~/.virtualenvs/my_virtualenv.As for why you can't find virtualenv by just typing it in, I guess that it's because virtualenv.py script is somewhere in /usr/local/Python3/lib/python3.5/site-packages - probably at /usr/local/Python3/lib/python3.5/site-packages/virtualenv.py - try running it directly.pip is just a Python packaging utility. It's not responsible for adding tools into your PATH environment variable, or for installing utilities in your system. If you want virtualenv command to be present in your system, I would recommend to install it using your system package manager instead. I would recommend to just use the built-in venv module instead.
