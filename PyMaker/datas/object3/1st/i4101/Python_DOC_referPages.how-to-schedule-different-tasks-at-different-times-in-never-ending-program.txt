I'll preface this by saying I'm not an advanced programmer and I have only written programs that run sequentially and exit.  What I'd like to do now is write a python script that I'll launch and it will run a function every 5 minutes and another function every 10 minutes and do so indefinitely.  Here's some pseudo-code:So is this threading?  It really doesn't matter if the tasks line up or not as they're essentially unrelated.  I would venture to guess that this is a common type of programming question, but I've never really understood how to accomplish this and I don't even know what to search for.  Any helpful examples or links to basic tutorials would be much appreciated!Thanks!

You can use sched from Python standard library.
