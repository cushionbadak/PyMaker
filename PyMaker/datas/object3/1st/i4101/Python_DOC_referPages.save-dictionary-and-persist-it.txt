I am trying to make a word dictionary. I want to save the added word into the dictionary word so when I run it again I can lookup the added word.  
You will have to persist the dictionary to a file. I recommend to use JSON for this.
You can use pickle to store files on the local disk.It is used for serializing and de-serializing
If you want to your dictionary to persist even after you close and open your program, I may recommend two ways of doing this.1- You can use the shelve module. This module helps you store your variables (even file objects) into a file and you can read the file afterwards.Close and open file again2- You can just use pprint.pformat to arrange your variable into a meaningful format and save it to a .py file. Afterwards just import this file and you are ready to go. Beware that you can only use this method for specific objects and not complicated objects like files.Close and open file again
