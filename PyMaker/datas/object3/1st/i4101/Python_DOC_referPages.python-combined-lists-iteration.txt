I've got two lists:synonymes = ['verb1', 'verb2', 'verb3']phrases = ['blabla verb blabla', 'blibli verb blibli', 'verb bloblo bloblo']and I would like to combine them to obtain this result in another list:liste = ['blabla verb1 blabla','blabla verb2 blabla', ... 'verb3 bloblo bloblo']the following code works but it's not very elegant, and I would like to give the 2 lists as entries of the function that's doing this job, which is impossible with this solution:I can change the structure of these two lists if need be, as long as I can obtain this final listWhat would be a proper way to do so in python?Thanks!EDIT : to make myself clearer, here is the exact output that I want:With the length of synonymes and phrases both variable.
