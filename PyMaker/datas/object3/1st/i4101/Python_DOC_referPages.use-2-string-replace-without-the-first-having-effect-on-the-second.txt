This question already has an answer here:How to replace two things at once in a string?                    6 answers                Because of this answer, it might be necessary to do this:However, the first replace gets mixed up with the second replace, and the result is not what is expected, i.e. D:\Temp\abc[[]def[]]\.The only solution I found is to use a temporary character ~ to avoid the 2 replace to be mixed up with each other:Is there a nice way to use 2 replacements without the first having effect on the second?
You don't need to replace ].Special characters to replace are only '?', '*' and '[', and are handled by glob.escape.
