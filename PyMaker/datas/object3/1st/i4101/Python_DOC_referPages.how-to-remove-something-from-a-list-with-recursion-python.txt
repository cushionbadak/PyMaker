I have this exercise:You have a tree graph as input, and you need to remove its leaves. So you need to remove the empty lists from a list of lists.For example this:[[[[], []], [[], []]], [[], [], []]]becomes this:[[[], []], []]I tried to use pop and del, but the teacher said to use recursion. Also it gives None as an output. But I can't figure out how to. Can you explain it how to or can you help to solve this question? 
The solution:uses a list comprehension to iterate, filter and transform nodes in the tree.Can be written also in terms of map() and filter():The if x part tests if the list is not empty.
