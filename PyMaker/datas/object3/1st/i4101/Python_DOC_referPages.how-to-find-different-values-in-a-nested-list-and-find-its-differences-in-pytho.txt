I have two nested lists, like this:I want to find the different values in between this two nested lists, and also it's differences. In the above lists, the different values are 5 and 6, so the difference is: -1(5-6). Note that no common values will be listed.I want to store it in a list and print it's output:Another example:The output should be like this:If all of them are common, it should return an empty list: []
Use a simple list-comprehension:Or use itertools.chain:

As a pure functional, but a little obscure, approach you can use itertools.starmap() and itertools.chain() plus zip and operator.sub:Another yet more understandable way is to use a flatten function for flatten your nested lists with then use a simple list comprehension and zip:
Another itertools approach using chain.from_iterable to flatten the nested lists and map to mass apply subtraction and filter to discard equal pairs.Example 1:Example 2:
