While running the above program it stops running with returning following error:Traceback (most recent call last):   File "/home/pi/v1.py", line 123,  in       x3 = struct.pack('>HH',abs(ReadValue[3]),abs(ReadValue[2])); IndexError: tuple index out of rangeI want my program to run continuously even when it returns error. I want to skip the error and to run the program continuously. How can I do that ? 
In theory you could wrap the code in an exception handler like:But this seems like a really bad idea if you're interacting with hardware, since you can't be sure what state you're leaving it in. Ideally, you'd want to make sure you're doing a proper reset of the device (or reconnect? depends what you're talking to) on every cycle.Alternatively, if you want to explicitly verify that the values you get back are available, you can do:The language reference/tutorial has more information about handling errors here: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html
In order to continue in the event of this kind of error, simply place the part you wish to ignore exceptions in within an appropriate try: ... except ... In this case, we continue only in the event of IndexError.
