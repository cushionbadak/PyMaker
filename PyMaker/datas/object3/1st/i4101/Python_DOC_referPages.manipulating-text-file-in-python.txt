This line removes the '\n' from your lines because it splits on them. Characters you split on are never part of the results.So this linecan not find anything to replace.Use line = line.rstrip("-") instead, it will remove the '-' from the right end of your string if present.You might benefit from reading/following How to debug small programs (#1) - to get some tips on how to debug your own program.Edit:You get a ' ' from your ' '-join()ing of split lines - you need to keep track on which lines ends on - and merge it with the following one. Its easier to simply do 2 replaces like this: to come to your wanted result. Uncomment the commented lines and remove the lines = """...""".
This will do (updated)?
