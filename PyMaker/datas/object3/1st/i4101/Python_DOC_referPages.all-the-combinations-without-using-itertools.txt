I want to know how to write an algorithm that gives me all the possible combinations of a list of numbers with repetition & without using itertools in Python.For example: all possible combinations of the list [1,2]:All possible combinations of the list [1,2,3]. The algorithm will then give me 27 (33) different lists in a list.This was my code:
You can write your own product method which finds out the cartesian product of multiple lists.Output
Here this actually does the combinations with replacement. You can adjust the size of the combinations. I made it return a tuple because tuples are immutable and tuple operations are faster than list operations. you can however easily make it return a list of list if you want. Cheers
