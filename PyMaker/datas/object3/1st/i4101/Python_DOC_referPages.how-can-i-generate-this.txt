Given a list, such as [3, 2, 4], how can I generate the following output?I need to generate every list possible where each element of the list is positive and is not greater than the number given at the relevant index.I know this involves for loops, but I'm looking for the most efficient way (probably using a generator) which can deal with lists of varying sizes.
itertools.product() can do the job:would print:
[[x, y, z] for x in range(3+1) for y in range(2+1) for z in range(4+1)] is what you are looking for.edit: Not your solution if you have a variable number of elements in your input.
