I have a dict of nested dicts and key-values.Is there a way I can use a for loop to get to 'c'?I tried,For the first print, I get But I get TypeError: string indices must be integers for the second print.Thanks in advance!*I edited replacing n with dicta; I copied and pasted it wrong the first time.
In general, no. Dicts can be arbitrarily recursively deep, and there's no good way to traverse them using nothing but a for loop. (You could implement your own stack using a list and simulate recursion, but that's not "good".)There's some recursive code for traversing dictionaries (counting the depth) in this question.In specific, sure. Knowing the structure in advance, you can use the right number of for loops:
for i in somedict is to loop all the keys from a dictionary.See more details from dict viewsWhen looping through dictionaries, the key and corresponding value can  be retrieved at the same time using the items() method.items() returns a new view of the dictionaryâ€™s items ((key, value) pairs).So you can just try this:isinstance(v,dict) return true if the object argument is an instance of the dict argument,so you don't need to catch exception.Have a look at looping-techniquesHope this helps.

You can use recursion to dive into given dictionary and print the key and its values.
Using nested loop you can get the required results.
