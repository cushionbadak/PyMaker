Hi there I am new with python, so recently I encountered a problem my is printing "not exist" for the amount of lines in my filehow do I get it to print only once if it is wrong?
Set a flag when item[0] == number is True. Check this flag after the loop terminates, and print "not exist" if the flag is set:An alternative is to use the else option with the for loop, however, that requires that you want to print only the first time that item[0] == number is True (because you would need to break out of the loop to prevent the else clause triggering).
You can attach an else clause to the for loop like this:Notice the break. The for loop will exit after the first match (via the break). If the for loop terminates normally (ie. no match), the else block will run
