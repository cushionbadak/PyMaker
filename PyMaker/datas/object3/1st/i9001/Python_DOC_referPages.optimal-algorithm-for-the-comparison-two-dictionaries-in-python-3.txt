I have List of dictionaries like:And other list of dictionaries like:So I need find 'cost' for each record in Stock from Prices.  But may be a situation, when I don't find 100% coincidence of dict elements, and in this case I need most similar element and get it's "cost".Please, prompt the optimal solution for this task. I think it's like Loop  from highest to lowest compliance, when we try find record with max coincidence, and if not found - try less matching condition.
how about thisto find the most similar entry I first transform the dict to a set then use max to find the largest intersection of a price with the stock that I'm checking using a lambda function for the key of max
it reminds me of fuzzy or neural network solutions, [on python2]anyway , here is a Numpy solution, :that gives me the next results (with many assumptions):Note, that this is correct comparison result based on Values and Kinds of propertiesplease up vote and check the answer if it satisfies you..
