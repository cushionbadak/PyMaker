The function take 4 input as x,y,w,z and I want to optimize the function with constraint as x + y + w + z = 1 and all 4 should be less than 1. How should I approach this task?
If I understood correctly, the following solution should fit your initial requirement:Used functions:all() - to check if each of arguments is less than 1sum() - to check the total sum of the arguments
