Say I have a dictionary like this, SCRABBLE_LETTER_VALUES = {    'a': 1, 'b': 3, 'c': 3, 'd': 2, 'e': 1, 'f': 4, 'g': 2, 'h': 4, 'i': 1, 'j': 8, 'k': 5, 'l': 1, 'm': 3, 'n': 1, 'o': 1, 'p': 3, 'q': 10, 'r': 1, 's': 1, 't': 1, 'u': 1, 'v': 4, 'w': 4, 'x': 8, 'y': 4, 'z': 10}Now, say I have a variable like this.letter = 'i'I want to add the corresponding value to the variable score. So since letter is equal to i, then score should equal 1

Dictionary values are accessed using dictionary_name[key].  So in this case:You also need to assign score to something before you do this:You might find it useful to read the documentation on dictionaries: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries
Firstly you need to know how python plays with dictionary- the question you asked in very simple thus people are downvoting!Answering you question:You have the following code in mind and struggling for the rest. I will be answering them accordingly under your statements.In python to get value for a corresponding key it work like dictionary[key], which gives the output.So for your problem if we do SCRABBLE_LETTER_VALUES[letter], its the same as doing SCRABBLE_LETTER_VALUES['i'] where 'i' is the key and we will get 1 as output.Hence for SCRABBLE_LETTER_VALUES[letter] we get 1 as output!I want to add the corresponding value to the variable score. So since letter is equal to iAssigning the corresponding value to the variable score is score = SCRABBLE_LETTER_VALUES[letter] then score should equal 1and we know now for sure that the value of score is 1. Don't we?For SCRABBLE_LETTER_VALUES[letter] value is 1 when letter= 'i' thus score is 1
