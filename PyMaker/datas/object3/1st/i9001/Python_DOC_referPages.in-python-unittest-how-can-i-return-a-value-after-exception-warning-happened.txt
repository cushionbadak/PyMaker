Here is my codes.is_this_True in self.assertTrue(is_this_True) is False, hence failed the test.What I want is for is_this_True in self.assertTrue(is_this_True) to be True. However, the return value is not "captured" since the value is returned after a warning is raised in function_that_raises_CustomWarning().How can I return the value in function_that_raises_CustomWarning() but also "captured" the warning in except?
When I run your code with 3.6 on Windows, the failure is with self.assertTrue(is_CustomWarning_raised).  By default, a warning is not an exception and cannot be caught with except:.  The solution is to use assertWarns or assertWarnsRegex.  I used the latter to show how it might be used to add an extra test.
