I have two lists as shown below:I would like to combine a list with the condition that will take the max num for each user so finally I will get this listany suggestions?TNX
You can use zip to pair the lists up, then group pairs by user and from each group pick the one with max value:In above zip returns iterable of (user, num) tuples:Then groupby is used to group the items based on the first item in each tuple:Finally max with key function is used to pick the pair with maximum value. Note that the items on num_list are strings so they need to be converted to numbers so that we pick '2000' instead of '400':
If order matters, you can use an OrderedDict, otherwise, a normal dict will do. But basically, use one pass to make a mapping from user to num, keeping the larger value each time. Then, another pass to get the data-structure you want.
The sorting that you require needs numbers not strings. A different result is returned when sorting the numbers as strings.So I would convert to numbers, sort and get the max and finally switch back to strings.if you explicitly require a list of lists as the output you can add a list comprehension on top like so:
