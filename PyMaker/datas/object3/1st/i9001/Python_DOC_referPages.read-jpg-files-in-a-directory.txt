I am trying to go through different image files in a directory. I am using Jupyter to run my python code as well. However I keep getting this error. Below is my code and the error I receive.CODE:OUTPUT:ERROR:
You have a path mismatch in your code, and your error is clearly showing it (file not found). When you do:You're listing the test_images directory in your current directory. The img will contain values in the form of file1.ext, file2.ext etc. as os.listdir() lists only the names of files and directories in it, so when you call:you'll essentially ges nothing because the img doesn't contain any path information. So, finally, when you do: You technically pass only the file name as scriptpath is empty. Since your image is in the test_images subdirectory and not in your working directory, you'll normally get file not found.There are a several ways to solve this issue, the easiest would be to just declare a lookup directory in a variable and use it when needed, e.g.:
In my opinion I prefer using the glob library to return a list of files in a directory. import globprint (glob.glob("/home/peter/pictures/*.png")returns:['/home/peter/pictures/pic1.png', '/home/peter/pictures/pic2.png', '/home/peter/pictures/pic3.png', ...ect]If you want to continue with your approach, I am sure that you are not giving a correct path to the folder directory. Think about it, how does the program know where test_images is located.
