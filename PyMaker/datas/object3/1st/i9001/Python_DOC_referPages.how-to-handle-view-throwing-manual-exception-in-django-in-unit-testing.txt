I have made a django application and am writing tests for it.In one of my views I'm manually throwing an exception:raise Http404('Not authorised')While writing test for that using django's built-in test framework(based on unittest).TL;DR: Is there way to write test such that it makes sure that the view is indeed returning Http404. ( assertEqual(response.status_code, 404 doesn't work)
This should work:Run your tests via:If it does not, recheck your code and supply an error message.
If self.assertEqual doesn't work you could try it with a with tag as shown hereassertRaises(exception, callable, *args, **kwds)For example. I have a function that will return an order or raise a HTTP 404 responseYou could also do it with get_object_or_404Example:Well i guess you get the point. Hope this helps you out!
