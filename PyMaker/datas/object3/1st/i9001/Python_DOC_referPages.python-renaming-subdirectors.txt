(using 2.7) Currently having an issue, and i've been attempting to go through the processes of os.walk / os.rename. But at the current time, only the main file is getting appended with _final, instead of all the files inside of that one as well. So for exampleMain  ---> sub1  -> sub2  -> sub3Needs to be Main_final (currently stopping here)  ----> sub1_final  -> sub2_final  -> sub3_finalHere's my code at the moment, 
Walk the tree with topdown set to False - Rename sub-directories first, and top-level directories last, renaming  top-level directories will no longer affect the sub-directories.From Documentation If optional argument topdown is True or not specified, the triple for a directory is generated before the triples for any of its subdirectories (directories are generated top-down). If topdown is False, the triple for a directory is generated after the triples for all of its subdirectories (directories are generated bottom-up). No matter the value of topdown, the list of subdirectories is retrieved before the tuples for the directory and its subdirectories are generated.When topdown is True, the caller can modify the dirnames list in-place (perhaps using del or slice assignment), and walk() will only recurse into the subdirectories whose names remain in dirnames; this can be used to prune the search, impose a specific order of visiting, or even to inform walk() about directories the caller creates or renames before it resumes walk() again. Modifying dirnames when topdown is False has no effect on the behavior of the walk, because in bottom-up mode the directories in dirnames are generated before dirpath itself is generated.
os.walk(fc) returns a generator object, so if you edit the entries during the walk or iteration, the os.walk confuses(it uses a dfs traversal algorithm, so the previous stack entries doesn't exist anymore) and so it raises StopIterationyou need to get all the entries and rename files in the order of deepest entries first.it worked on my system
