Natural Text
The html I'm trying to match is something like this...The site I'm scraping is old, so from page to page it can change from br's to paragraph tags, etc. It's a mess, the only sure thing is that all the content I need is between the start body and end body comment tags.What's the best way to do this? Should I even be using beautifulsoup or is that overkill?
I'd just grab the text directly, without BeautifulSoup:There might be an off-by one in the last line, but that should get you started. You'll also need to decide what to do if the tags appear multiple times.
You can use str.split:html.split('<!-- Start Body -->')[1] - get part after the Start Body comment.split('<!-- End Body -->')[0] - get part before the End Body commentAlternative using re.findall:
