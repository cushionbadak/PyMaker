What is the correct type annotation for a function that returns a generator expression? e.g.:I can't figure out if this is -> Iterator[int], -> Iterable[int], -> Generator[int, None, None], or something else.If there should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it, then what is the obvious way here?
All three forms mentioned by you in question are listed as valid alternatives in documentation, Generator expression simply creates a generator that only yields.Quote 1:A generator can be annotated by the generic type Generator[YieldType,  SendType, ReturnType]. Quote 2:If your generator will only yield values, set the SendType and  ReturnType to NoneQuote 3:Alternatively, annotate your generator as having a return type of  either Iterable[YieldType] or Iterator[YieldType]:
