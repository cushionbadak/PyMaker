Here is my data.csvMy target is to print below as final list. Format is unique(first_column),no.of occurences Written below python script but unable to enter second block to print 'second block' although the same logic works fine in previous loop.
You could simplify the program above a bit and only iterate through the file once:
It's because you've already read over the entire file after the first loop; there are no more rows in the reader's iterator at this point. Use csvfile.seek(0) after the first for loop to return to the beginning of the file, and it will work.
