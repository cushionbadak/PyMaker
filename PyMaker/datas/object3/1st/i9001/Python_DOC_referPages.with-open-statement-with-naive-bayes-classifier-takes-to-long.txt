Natural Text
I have a csv file with 3483 lines and 460K characters and 65K words, and I'm trying to use this corpus to train a NaiveBayes classifier in Scikit-learn. The problem is when I use this statement below, takes too long (1 hour and did not finish).Any guesses of what I doing wrong?Thanks in advance. 
There's a problem with this lib. It's documented in the following links:https://github.com/sloria/TextBlob/pull/136https://github.com/sloria/TextBlob/issues/77Small story: The library do not deals well with large datasets. 
I am not entirely sure of the text blob library but perhaps this may help-I had written the following code to train a multinomial naive bayes model with raw textual data after vectorizing and transforming the text in my dataset.
