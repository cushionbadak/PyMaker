This question already has an answer here:Return None if Dictionary key is not available                    11 answers                I am new to Python and still learning the tricks.How can i convert the following code to a single liner, is it possible in Python? There has to be a neat way of doing this.
You have a dictionary, use the dict.get() method to return a default value for missing keys:Also, do not use pokemon exception handling. You really don't need to catch them all here; if a key is missing, KeyError is raised, if you must use try..except should catch just that one exception with except KeyError:.
