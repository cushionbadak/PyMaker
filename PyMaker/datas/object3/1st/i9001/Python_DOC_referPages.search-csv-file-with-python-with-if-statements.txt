I've been trying to search my csv file in python which works so that it outputs the cost of each item etc. But if a wrong GTIN code is input i need it to say it can't find the product. Help is needed. Many Thanks in advance
You need a try and except  if the value looked for does not exist. As well as a while loop to keep on trying!
