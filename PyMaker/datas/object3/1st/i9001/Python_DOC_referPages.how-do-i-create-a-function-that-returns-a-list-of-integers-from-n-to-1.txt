How do I write a function called countdown that counts down starting from n and goes until 1 ? The function should return a list, the contents of which should be integers going from n down to 1.
Since you want to return a list, you need to create that list in the function.range creates your sequence from n to 0 (non-inclusive, which means it'll stop at 1), with a step of -1 each time.list then converts the sequence into the list that you want returned.This also means that you don't actually have to create a specific function for a countdown list. You can just directly call list(range(n, 0, -1)). 
Using recursion:This approach provides the "base case" and creation of a list of integers once the base is reached.Check out this link to visualize the execution. Do let me know if you have any questions.
