The problem is: Finish the function sum_of_over_fives that loops over number_list and adds to the total only the numbers greater than 5. Then it should return the total.I get an indent error for "number >5" line but I have this gut feeling that the line is wrong.
You can use the built-ins filter and sum:
As pointed out by @Mitch and @StephenRauch, your logic is fine, the only problem is with your indentation and the number > 5 which should be an if statement. According to the PEP 8 documentation, you must make sure that the indentation of your function body is 4 ,  at the moment, it is 8.Then the only thing left will be to put the if and the : to go with the number > 5. Here is your final code with the corrected indentations and the correct if statement:But like @a_guest said, there is a better way of doing what you are trying to do. I hope that help :).
