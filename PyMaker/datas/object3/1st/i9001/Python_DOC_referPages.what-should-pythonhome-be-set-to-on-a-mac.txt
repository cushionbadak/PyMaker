I don't have anything set in my .bash_profile for $PYTHONHOME.  What should this be set to?  Can't find anything consistent online to what it should be set to.
You do not need to set $PYHONHOME for python 2.7. Python knows where to find its standard library. If $PYHONHOME is not set, Python defaults to using the directory where python.exe was found, so that dir should be in PATH. You can read Environment variables and PYTHONHOME in Python documentation.The only reason to set $PYTHONPATH in the system is to maintain directories of custom Python libraries that you do not want to install in the global default location (i.e., the site-packages directory).
