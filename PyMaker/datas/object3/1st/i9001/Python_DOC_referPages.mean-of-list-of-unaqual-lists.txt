I try to get a list that include the mean of all of (i)th element in all lists of a list.To explain more, if i have the next list:I want to have [a,b,c] with:Any help please!
use itertools.zip_longest to zip values together. The extra difficulty is that the length of the data varies. zip_longest inserts None as a fill value. We have to create a filtered list, and count only those items:result:EDIT: one-liner (maybe a bit more complex, using lambda to compute mean):result: [1.8, 2.6, 3.0](Python 2 users have to replace zip_longest by izip_longest)
You can try with itertools.izip_longest() like so if you are on Python2:Output:
Use itertools.zip_longest to generate the sublists, and statistics.mean to calculate the average for each group, disregarding the Nones:With your example:
