This question already has an answer here:What is the meaning of a single and a double underscore before an object name?                    14 answers                Python's online documentation contains the description quoted below.Could someone please explain what it means?2.3.2. Reserved classes of identifiers__* Class-private names. Names in this category, when used within  the context of a class definition, are re-written to use a mangled  form to help avoid name clashes between “private” attributes of base  and derived classes.
Whenever code written inside a class uses a name that begins with two underscores but doesn't also end with two underscores the compiler replaces that name with a mangled form that includes the class name:What this means in practice is that when you create subclasses then (provided the subclass has a different name than the base class) you won't accidentally collide with the private names used in the base class.It isn't a security mechanism as you can still get at the 'private' values using getattr, or even just the mangled form of the name, and it isn't perfect protection as sometimes class hierarchies have both base and derived classes with the same name.
