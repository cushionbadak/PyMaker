This question already has an answer here:Short description of the scoping rules?                    7 answers                I am a history student who was challenged to make this program so please assume I have little knowledge of coding.I thought my program was approaching completion but am getting an error that the variables inside the roll function are not defined. However, when I run the roll function on its own there is no problem. I'm sure this is a simple mistake but, would like to know how to correct it, and why. (learning things is cool)
In Turn, you reference r which is not in scope; see https://docs.python.org/3/reference/executionmodel.html. What you want appears to be something like r = roll() rather than just roll().Some other things to be aware of:For the same reason as above, pScore and cScore are never actually updated in main; you will want to return those values from Turn so as to be able to use them in main. In particular, the loop appearing in main is infinite.while turn == True could be written simply as while turn. Similarly, while turn != True could be written as while not turn.Letting turn = True when turn is guaranteed to be True does nothing.The return statements in main do nothing.
