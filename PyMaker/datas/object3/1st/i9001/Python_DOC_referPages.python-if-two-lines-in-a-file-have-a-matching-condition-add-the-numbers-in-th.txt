Natural Text
Let's say I have a text file containing, for example, the following (assuming the headings are these: Name, Amount of pencils)The main thing here is that both Alexander and Rebecca have multiple entries. Currently, my code reads the lines from the file, and just outputs the lines, ignoring any multiple entries; i.e. the entries are all separate from each other (I'm not sure I need to put the code here - it's just general formatting for aesthetics). Instead, I want it to add the two quantities together for any names that have multiple occurrences, and output that to the user instead.So, for example, the output should look like this:I feel like I'm missing something obvious (apologies if I am), but how would I check if lines have a matching name, and then if they do, add the numbers together for the final output? And would it be easier to create a new file to store these new values?Currently, I'm thinking along the lines of:But I'm unsure of how exactly to go about adding numbers from different arrays that are created in a loop? Perhaps if I initialised a variable to keep track of quantities, but then is it possible to do that only for those that I know have matching conditions.Thank you!
You may want to use a Python dictionary for this instead of a list. You will want to read up on dictionaries, but this is how it could be implemented using one:
A defaultdict would be nice here:Result:
Don't use lists, use dictionary instead. Store person name as a key and  accumulated sum as a value.Then, after finishing reading the file, form an output file by processing key and value in a formed dictionary.NOTE: I've renamed variables with more pythonic names.Good luck :) !
