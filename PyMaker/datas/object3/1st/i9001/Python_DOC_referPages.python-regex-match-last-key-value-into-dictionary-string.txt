This question already has an answer here:Converting string to ordered dictionary?                    3 answers                I read this dictionary from a file as a string:I don't know which values key1 and key2 can assume, I need to access the value of the last pair written on the string (in this case 'value2'). So converting it into a python dictionary is out of the question since it would probably change the order.I've tried something like:But I don't know how to access the .group(2) of the last match.
You can do this :Output :
