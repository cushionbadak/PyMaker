I know there are several ways to convert a column to a date object, but what I am looking for is a way to do so while simultaneously formatting other columns. Say I have the following data frame:What I'm trying to achieve is the ability to print these data using some formatting, so I might do something like the following:But I also want to format the date in this step as well. I tried looking through here for what I was looking for, but the datetime options didn't seem like they would work in what I'm trying to do, and building a custom option is a bit outside scope for my target audience.Is it possible to do this in a simple manner?
Turns out this is incredibly easy once you realize how the function actually works...
