Suppose I have 5 objects: obj1 to obj5:How can I find (efficiently) the highest value of x, and identify the corresponding obj? Here the expected answer would be:By the way, in the actual case, I have 500 objects.
If you have a list and you need the index of the maximum, you can combine max and enumerate to make an equivalent to numpy.argmax in pure Python:i will be the index containing the maximum value, so you can print it asIn the example you gave, i == 2, which prints x = 3.8, belongs to obj3.
Best to put them in a collection (i.e list, tuple, ..) and use max with operator.attrgetter to grab the object with the max value of x:The value o returned now corresponds to the one with the max value for the attribute x, i.e obj3:Ideally, you shouldn't "identify" the object by means of its name, that can easily change and if you have a list that isn't ordered by the name you'd get wrong results. Instead, you should give the class it was created from another attribute, say"name", and define an __str__/__repr__ for it that prints out the name and the value.
