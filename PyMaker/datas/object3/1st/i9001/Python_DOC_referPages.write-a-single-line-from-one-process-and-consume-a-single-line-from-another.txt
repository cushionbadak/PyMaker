I have a loop from python that writes proxies to a file, one per line. That file is later used from a bash script via curl -x $PROXY, line by line using cat proxies.txt.Could this approach be improved by launching the two scripts at the same time, and using a named pipe that can be consumed by cat only when python writes a new line/new proxy?In my mind, I'd write something likeand
Lots of comments about the blocking of the FIFO; I won't repeat them, but the main issue is: when no process reads, the writing process is blocked.The code you might be looking for is something like this:There should probably be some logic to terminate the bash script when the python script dies.
