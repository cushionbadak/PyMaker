I have a dictionary of lists and the lists are quite long. How can I print it in a way that only a few elements of the list show up? Obviously, I can write a custom function for that but is there any built-in way or library that can achieve this? For example when printing large data frames, pandas prints it nicely in a short way.   This example better illustrates what I mean:Desired output: something like this:
If it weren't for the pretty printing, the reprlib module would be the way to go: Safe, elegant and customizable handling of deeply nested and recursive / self-referencing data structures is what it has been made for.However, it turns out combining the reprlib and pprint modules isn't trivial, at least I couldn't come up with a clean way without breaking (some) of the pretty printing aspects.So instead, here's a solution that just subclasses PrettyPrinter to crop / abbreviate lists as necessary:Output with maxlist=3:Output with maxlist=5 (triggers splitting the lists on separate lines):Notes:This will create copies of lists. Depending on the size of the data structures, this can be very expensive in terms of memory use. This only deals with the special case of lists. Equivalent behavior would have to be implemented for dicts, tuples, sets, frozensets, ... for this class to be of general use. 
You could use the pprint module:Would output:And,Would output:And, would output:
You could use IPython.lib.pretty.For older versions of IPython, you might exploit RepresentationPrinter:
This recursive function I wrote does something you're asking for.. You can choose the indentation you want tooThe output of your dictionary is:
Use reprlib. The formatting is not that pretty, but it actually abbreviates.
