Natural Text
I order to create a data base of Babylonian texts I need to clear some texts and tokenize them. I can do the tokanization but during the writing of the cleaning script I ran in to a problem.I want to clear all the numbers since they don't really have meaning for me (It is probably just how much sheeps they had), but It is important to keep the numbers inside the <sub>.Lets say I have the following text:hello 502world a0.0.3b .1.4 <sub>5</sub>I want to turn it to: hello NUMworld aNUMb NUM <sub>5</sub>Notice that 0.0.3 and .1.4 also turns into NUM in addition to 502 that turns into a NUM too, but inside of <sub> I want to keep the number the same.The text have non-ASCII chars in it which makes it much harder to deal with.I have tried to write some code on my own to deal with it but it is getting very annoying and I think there is more Pythonic way of doing that.This is a site with examples for texts.
