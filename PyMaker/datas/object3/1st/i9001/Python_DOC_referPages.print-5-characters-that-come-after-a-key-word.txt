Natural Text
I want to make a simple code that takes one piece of text, scans for the keyword and prints the keyword along with the next 5 characters. Note, the keyword can appear more than one time in the text. the output should be luka 90\91
Using str.find, you can get the index of the matching string:UPDATE To get all occurrences, you need to find the substring in a loop.UPDATE solution using re.findall:luka matches literally. .{5} matches any 5 characters following.If you want to match characters even though they are less than 5 character. Use .{1,5} instead.re.escape is not necessary for luka. It is required if there's special characters that has special meaning in regular expression.
Or a better solution:L = re.findall(keyword + ' .{5}', string)print(K)OUTPUT:print(L)OUTPUT:['luka 90/91', 'luka onthe']I added an additional 1 for the space, and assumed keyword after keyword is big enough. Otherwise spaces will occur. If this is unwanted it can be fixed. But such behavior is not defined by you how should be.
OUTPUT
