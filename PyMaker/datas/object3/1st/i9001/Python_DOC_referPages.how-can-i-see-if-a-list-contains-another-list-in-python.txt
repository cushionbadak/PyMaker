How would I check to see if a list contains other lists? I need it so that [['cow'], 12, 3, [[4]]]would output True, while something like['cow', 12, 3, 4]would output False.
If you also want to find subclasses of lists then you should use isinstance:any stops as soon as the condition is True so this only needs to check only as many items as necessary.The isinstance(item, list) for item in obj is a generator expression that works similar to a for-loop or a list-comprehension. It could also be written as (longer and slightly slower but maybe that's better to comprehend):
You can use this method if your list does not contain some string with '[' int it .In python 2.7 we have a module for this work:( I don't know about any such module in python 3.x )
Here's a neat solution using a list comprehension.Given obj = [['cow'], 12, 3, [[4]]], we'll first use a list comprehension to get a list of types in obj:Now, we simply check if list is in the list of types we created. Let's revisit our list comprehension and turn it into a boolean expression:There, that's nice and short. So does it work?
