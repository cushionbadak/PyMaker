I just made up a dictionary with each letter of the alphabet having a number value. I tried a few things and kept getting errors. I can add all the values of the dictionary with sum(alphaDict.values()) but cannot add separate values together with user input. Now if I use the code as I have below what is returned is type 'str' values so those cannot be added as numbers. By the way I know the dictionary came out funny looking in this post but don't worry about that. ^^
Simply do this :
You need to go through the whole input character by character and then get the sum of that. I guess the most Pythonic way would be:
This should work with both Python 2.7 and 3.*:Also, i added a try-except block to avoid invalid characters.
Try something like this utilizing the default value of dictionary.get() if the key entered by the user is invalid the value returned is -1 rather than None :Example Usage:Try it here!
your function simply print each number, and there's no return type.if you want summation, return a summation.python doesn't support implicit '+' operator with 'int' and 'str'.if you want, you need to change str to int.simply use int() built-in function.
