My problem looks quite simple but I can't figure out a clean (and efficient) solution.I have a list of tuples corresponding to common groups of words:And a sentence:I would like to merge the common groups of words in a single token like that:I am sure there is an elegant way to do so but I haven't been able to find any..If there were only 2-tuples, iterating on zip(sentence, sentence[:1] would do it, but I have up to 8-tuples in ngrams and this solution is not tractable!
You can build a list of replacement strings from your words in ngrams:And then, for each element in that list, use str.replace:There might be a more one-liner-y way to do it, but that seems relatively terse and easy to understand to me.
While Haldean Brown's answer is simpler, I think this is a more structured approach:Output:ngrams after sorting:That's needed to try to apply ("c", "+", "+") earlier than ("c", "+") (or, in general, to try to apply a sequence earlier than its prefixes). Actually it's possible that non-greedy things like [('c', '+'), ('+', 'a')] are more desirable than [('c', '+', '+'), ('a',)], but that's another story.
