I have a csv file containing 8 columns with a header row. The first 5 columns contain binary data, and the last three contain integers. How can I read this file using python?
You can use the Pandas package, specifically the read_csv method. Alternatively there is a built in module called csv that contains methods for working with csv files in python. I recommend reading both of these pages as they will provide you with a great launching pad for working with csv files in Python. 
Just import the csv module:
as Grr suggested, the pandas library is your best bet
I usually use the csv.DictReader from the csv module. This is a pattern I commonly use myself. The col1 through col7 or whatever can be names anything you want as long as you get the column names correct from the file, where it says ['col name']. After doing this you can call each column of data by name.
