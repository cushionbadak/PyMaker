I have this date format:I want to use datetime to store this data.  datetime.datetime.strptime(dateString, '%a %b %d %H:%M:%S %Z %Y').timetuple()What is the date/time format for GMT?  The document doesn't have GMT.
Handling timezones is always a bit confusing.  In your example, you were not specific in your needs as it relates to the timezone.Fixed timezone offset:One way to read what you wrote is that the timezone information in your string is always GMT-00:00. If the timezone is always the same, then it is a simple matter to build a strptime string as:This makes no effort to interpret the timezone, since it is fixed. This will give you timezone naive datetime.  And since your example immediately converted the datetime to a timetuple, I assume this is the result you wanted.To test:Interpreting the timezone offset:If you have non-GMT timezones in your timestamps, and want to preserve the information you can do:This function will take your time string and make use of the UTC offset. (eg. -00:00).  It will parse the timezone information out of the string and then add the resulting minutes and seconds back into the datetime to make it UTC relative.To test:Timezone aware:The above codes return a UTC relative timezone naive datetime.  It if you need a timezone aware datetime, then you can do that with:To test:
