I want to insert a key-value pair into dict if key not in dict.keys().Basically I could do it with:But is there a better way? Or what's the pythonic solution to this problem?
You do not need to call d.keys(), sois enough. There is no clearer, more readable method.You could update again with dict.get(), which would return an existing value if the key is already present:but I strongly recommend against this; this is code golfing, hindering maintenance and readability.
Use dict.setdefault():
