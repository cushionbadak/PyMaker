I went through couple answers on forum already but without any success.I am using Linux mint, Python 3.6.0 and i am trying to open CSV in Python but then error occurs:My code:I also tried to move the file to desktop as in some answers i found, instead of path i used "city.csv". Still doesn't work.Completely new to Linux and just can't find why this isn't working.Each reply appreciated!
You should'nt use '~' to specify the path of your directory but the full path instead. E.g. :If you need to use the tilde, you should then use os.path.expanduser('~/Desktop/xyz/city.csv'). E. g. :The reason for that is that the "tilde expansion" is a user interface feature that is not recognized by the file system: http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bashref.html#Tilde-Expansion
Try using the full file path, something like this:
Usually ~ does not expand properly. I have found that when it is needed, put $HOME environment variable value into a python variable and then use join to attach it as a prefix to the file name relative position. This also allows you to move the file to a different location and create a function that will allow you to redefine the prefix.
