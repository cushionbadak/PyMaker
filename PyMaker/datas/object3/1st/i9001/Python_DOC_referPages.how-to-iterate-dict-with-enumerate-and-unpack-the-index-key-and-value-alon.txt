How to iterate dict with enumerate such that I could unpack the index, key and value at the time of iteration?Something like:I want to iterate through the keys and values in a dictionary called mydict and count them, so I know when I'm on the last one.
Instead of using mydict, you should be using mydict.items() with enumerate as:Sample example:Explanations:enumerate returns an iterator object which contains tuples in the format: [(index, list_element), ...]dict.items() returns an iterator object (in Python 3.x. It returns list in Python 2.7) in the format: [(key, value), ...]On combining together, enumerate(dict.items()) will return an iterator object containing tuples in the format: [(index, (key, value)), ...]
