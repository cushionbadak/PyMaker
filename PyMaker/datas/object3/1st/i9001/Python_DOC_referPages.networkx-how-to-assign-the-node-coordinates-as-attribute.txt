In a simple graph like this:if I try to assign each node a list of attributes containing the node ID and its (x,y) coordinates like this:I get the following error:What is wrong here?
After a bit of research I've figured out that the answer is in nx.set_node_attributes().It is of course possible to assign the node positions as attributes:which results inand it is also possible to attach multiple attributes using dedicated dictionaries (in this case test) that don't have to have the same number of elements as the nodes in G (e.g., there can be nodes without attributes):which results inI am speculating that the same is possible with the graph edges, using nx.set_edge_attributes().
