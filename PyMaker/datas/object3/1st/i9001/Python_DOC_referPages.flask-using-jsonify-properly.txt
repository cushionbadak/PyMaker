I'm having some trouble in understanding how jsonify works even though I went through the documentation. As you can see below, I'm calling the lookup() function which returns a dictionary, then I'm trying to jsonify it.my helpers.py:The error that I'm getting is of invalid syntax. Any idea into what I'm doing wrong? Thanks
I think your dict syntax is wrong. You can read about more in official documentation.The code that I think you are trying for is as follows:Specifically you should use curly braces instead of brackets ({}) and colon (:) instead of equals sign.Another option is to let jsonify() to do the conversion (as pointed out in the other answer):Nevertheless, I think you would be well advised to use create a dict. It becomes more flexible when you need to create larger JSON objects.Hope this helps.
You dont need the square brackets, get rid of them.Read about keyword arguments in python.
