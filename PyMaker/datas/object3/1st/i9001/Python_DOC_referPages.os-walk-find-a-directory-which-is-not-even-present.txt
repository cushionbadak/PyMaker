What makes you think that /.git doesn't exist?Try this:
You should use os.path to make the file paths.  os.walk will visit all the directories in the tree under the top directory - you are only interested in directories that end with 'inventory/group_vars', so check for that and take action.  If you want to write the values as a group, you need to collect them in something.I used a defaultdict to store multiple items of interest from a single file.  If there is only one 'isv_alias', 'LMID', 'products' group in each file then you could just as easily store the information in a list or namedtuple.You didn't provide an example of the file(s) so it's not clear what the line structure is.  If it looks like this:It can be simplified to As long as you are accumulating the information in data, you can just open the output file onceIf using Python 3.6 or an ordered defaultdict then the solution above assumes the order of appearance of each key in the file is the order you want them written out.If the file structure isn't ordered or the dictionary used isn't ordered, write to the file like this:
