This question already has an answer here:Trying to import module with the same name as a built-in module causes an import error                    1 answer                The following simple script raises an ImportError in python3:The key to reproduce this error is to name this file queue.py, and then the following messages appear:If the file is named as queueue.py, then everything is fine.I think this is because multiprocessing module is trying to import Queue from my queue.py since its name coincides with some file in multiprocessing module. However, If it is how python works, then I should avoid filenames of any possible internal libraries, which is not practical.Is this error attributed to the same filename of my file and some file in multiprocessing module? And if it is, how can I ensure my filenames are distinct from files of any possible library in general programming?
You can't have the same file name as the module you are importing.Read modules for more clarification Using that, any unadorned package name will always refer to the top level package. You will then need to use relative imports to access your own package.You will want to read about Absolute and Relative Imports which addresses this very problem.
