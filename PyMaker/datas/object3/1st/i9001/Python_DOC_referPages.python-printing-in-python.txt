I want to print out the contents of a list in a specific format: Here's what I want it to look like: I'm confused how to achieve this output.  Right now, I have the individual elements in the list as strings that are of the format ("\"" + name + ""\" + ",\n" + grade).  However, I don't know how to achieve the proper indentation and bracketing for printing out the list.  Should I just manually print a [ and ], every time or is there a way to compile all the elements into one list, where a call to print list would result in the output above?  I could manually format the brackets, but that would leave the last bracket with a comma after it, which I do not want.  Any help would be greatly appreciated!
You could use json.dumps(). Assuming that you have a list of lists like this:This is pretty close to what you are after, with no coding effort, and no escaped quotes in the strings themselves. If you don't like the outer brackets, then you can print each list individually:
Just to clarify, you have a list with list elements? And the interior elements are always a string you want printed in quotes followed by a number?You could just define a sub function (Note that I'm using single quotes to effectively "escape" the double quote character)You can then print the list like this:You could probably clean that up with printf as well. 
The json.dumps() method has parameters to make it easier to read the result:the indent parameter to define the numbers of indents.
