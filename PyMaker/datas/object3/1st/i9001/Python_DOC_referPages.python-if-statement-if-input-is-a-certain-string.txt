So I am trying to create a sort of calculator that handles all types of equations. All you have to do is input what you need help on and it will ask you a series of questions based on what equation you need help one, and it will return a value. I am trying to make it so that when a certain string is inputted, it will ask a certain series of questions. However, it asks all the questions regardless of what I input. I'm using Python 3.6.So how would I only show either the 'slope' equation or the 'interest' equation if whichEquation is slope or interest.
Your indentation is incorrect, it should beThis is because anything that comes indented underneath an if statement is the action the if statement does.This goes for both IF statements, not just the slope one.And lastly, an IF statement checks if an item matches something specific using the "==" operator, which is basically "is equal to", so if whichEquation == "slope" is the same as if (what ever is stored in) whichEquation is equal to "slope"
the shortest way to solve this is to bring all related code under if block hope this help 
You can format your code like so:This way, your whitespace is correct and will properly read each condition
I believe from what you are saying, you want the program to ask questions depending on the selected input.To accomplish this, you must add == to check if the two variables are equal.This is because python was multiple ways of testing variables with the if statment. Some common ones that are more math related are:*Less than  <   **Greater than   >   *Less than or equal     <=Greater than or equal  >=Equals  ==Not equal    !=I suggest going to This python 3 doc, which demonstrates different IF statement conditions.
