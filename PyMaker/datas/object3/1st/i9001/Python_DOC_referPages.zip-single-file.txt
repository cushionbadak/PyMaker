I am trying to zip a single file in python. For whatever reason, I'm having a hard time getting down the syntax. What I am trying to do is keep the original file and create a new zipped file of the original (like what a Mac or Windows would do if you archive a file).Here is what I have so far:
The correct way to zip file is:The python official doc says:ZipFile.write(filename, arcname=None, compress_type=None)Write the file named filename to the archive, giving it the archive name arcnameYou pass open(filename).read() into write(). open(filename).read() is a single string that contains the whole content of file filename, it would throw FileNotFoundError because it is trying to find a file named with the string content.
Since you also want to specify the directory try using os.chdir:Python zipfile : Work with Zip archivesPython Miscellaneous operating system interfaces
If the file to be zipped (filename) is in a different directory called pathname, you should use the arcname parameter. Otherwise, it will recreate the full folder hierarchy to the file folder. 
Try calling zipfile.close() afterwards?
