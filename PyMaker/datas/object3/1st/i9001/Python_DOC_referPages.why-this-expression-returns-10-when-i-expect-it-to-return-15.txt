This question already has an answer here:How does the Python's range function work?                    6 answers                In the Python console, this code should return 15, but it returns 10.What is wrong?
Because ranges are exclusive, they don't include the last (stop) element you've specified, from the documentation on range objects:For a positive step, the contents of a range r are determined by the formula r[i] = start + step*i where i >= 0 and r[i] < stopomitting the step defaults to a value of 1.You're essentially summing this:which, obviously, sums to 10.
In python,range(5) is equivalent to [0,5)
