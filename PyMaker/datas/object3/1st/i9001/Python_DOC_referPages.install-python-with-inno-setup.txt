I am creating a setup from C# program successfully with Inno Setup. To run this program I need Python. Until today I asked my customers to install Python manually, since some customers are not always following my installation guide, I am getting often questions from them. Now I want to simplify the installation, so that everything is done automatically. I need to set:Install path of Python: C:\Python\Python3.5.2Installation for all usersSet the global environment variable for Python C:\Python\Python3.5.2If all this already exist no installation needed I tried to do this with this code, but I didn't had any success. Normal Python installation is starting unfortunately.  What do I do wrong?BRStefan
