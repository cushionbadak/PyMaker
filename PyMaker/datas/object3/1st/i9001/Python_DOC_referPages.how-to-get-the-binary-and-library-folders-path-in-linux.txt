Let's say that I am writing a Python program on Linux. And I want to run a binary manually-installed command called "foo" using its path. Usually this is in /usr/bin/foo. But on some distributions it's /usr/local/bin/foo. Some other distributions may change it too.So my question is how to get something like $BINARY_FOLDER_PATH or $LIBRARY_FOLDER_PATH which would instantly give me whether it is "/usr/bin" or "/usr/local/bin/" or something else (PATH gives a lot of paths, I am looking for a single output option if it's there)? Also for libraries folder. How to know if it was /usr/lib or something else? In Python for sure.
In general, you cannot. If you want to find a particular binary, your best bet is going to be searching the PATH variable. There is some code on activestate that does what you want.
