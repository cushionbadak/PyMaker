I have this script that I import into the route:That works fine when I print it.Here is the route:And here is the template:The table shows ok but no data is filled in. I been trying all day to do this simple thing and having no luck. According to all the tutorials and stackoverflow answers I checked, this should be correct. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
I think you should write your table like this (not tested yet):
Look more closely at datarows. It'll be a list of tuples, not a dictionary. That is, there no names to associate with each 'column', so attempts to reference in the template, say, row.code are going to fail, because row is a tuple.You could, with a bit of work, turn the rows into dictionaries, by matching up the slots in each tuple with names found in cursor.description. There's an example of how to do that using row_factory in the sqlite3 docs.
Always debug the variable that you are passing to the rendered page this will let you know that whether the data are inside the index or notUsing this you will be confirmed that what data you have to parse to the template page
