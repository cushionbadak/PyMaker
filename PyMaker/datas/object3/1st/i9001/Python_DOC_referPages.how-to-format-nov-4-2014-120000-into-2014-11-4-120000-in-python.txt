First of all you are using strptime wrong https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime.strptimeAfter you converted datetext to datetime with strptime you need to convert it back to string using strftime https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime.strftimeUsing @FeebleOldMan partial answer
Put the correct formatting into strptime to mirror your input:See here for the formatting directives. (Here for Python 3.)If you print the subsequent datev datetime object you created, the default str formatting of the datetime object will be as you requested (2014-11-4 12:00:00). If you want to modify how the printed output looks, use strftime as shown in Sardorbek's answer and again, use the formatting directives you desire.
