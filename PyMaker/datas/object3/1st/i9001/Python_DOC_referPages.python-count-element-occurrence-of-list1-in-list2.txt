In the following code, I want to count the occurrence of every word in word_list in test, the code below can do this job but it may not be efficient, is there any better way to do it?
Use collections.Counter to count all the words in test in one go, then just get that count from the Counter for each word in word_list.Or using a dictionary comprehention:Creating the counter should be O(n), and each lookup O(1), giving you O(n+m) for n words in test and m words in word_list.
You can do it in linear time using a dictionary.
You can combine collections.Counter and  operator.itemgetter:Which gives:or if you rather want it as a list:
You could try to use dictionnaries :But you would end with a different structure.If you do not want that, you could try this instead
