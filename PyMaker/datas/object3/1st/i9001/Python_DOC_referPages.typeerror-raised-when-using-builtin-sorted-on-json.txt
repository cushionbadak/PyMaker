Using Python 3.5, I'm running into a TypeError when I'm sorting JSON. The function can be found here on StackOverflow, and recursively sorts the dictionaries and lists found in valid JSON. I'm not using the json-module to sort my keys because it doesn't sort "deep" enough into the dictionary.The TypeError arises from a comparison between two dictionaries: when similar dict's are evaluated by the builtin sorted, a comparison of their keys and values is made. If the keys are the same, their values are compared. If the values are of different types, a TypeError is raised.Here's the JSON:and here's the function:My thoughts as to getting around this involve either a) casting None-type objects to a float or string (since the TypeError would also happen if None is compared to Str) or b) creating a custom class and overriding the __lt__, __gt__ special methods to return True or False based on a type comparison. (e.g. if a=None and b=0.0, aIs there a better way to avoid this issue and allow the sorted function to do my sorting for me without raising a TypeError?
sorted() allows you to specify the key function, and for Python3 there is a functools.cmp_to_key() which lets you supply a comparison function (like you could in Python 2)Write a comparison function that will sort it however you want it sorted.
