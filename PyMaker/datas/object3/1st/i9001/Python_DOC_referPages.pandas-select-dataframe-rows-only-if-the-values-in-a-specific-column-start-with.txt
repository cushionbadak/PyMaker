I have the following dataframe df1:I know how to select the row for which column B is yes or any other specific value:But how can I select all the rows that do not start with 336?PS: in my case, 3360 and 3365 are strings.
I would use something like df[~df.B.str.startswith('336')], using the str accessor. For instance, And if you have multiple strings to check, startswith accepts a tuple of prefixes.
