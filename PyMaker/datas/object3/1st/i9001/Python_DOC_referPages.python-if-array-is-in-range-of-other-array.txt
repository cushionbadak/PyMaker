Meaning "if each item is within range of other item with the same index".This works:I figure there's some way to just reference the whole array though. Like so: if price in budget:
You could use:This will create tuples of price[i],budget[i] and then for each of these tuples we check that price[i] is in range(budget[i]). Nevertheless, you can optimize this further to:Note that this makes the assumption that prices are all integers. If you however use x in range(y) it will fail if x is not an integer. So 0.7 in range(10) would fail whereas our second approach will succeed (but it depends of course on what you want).
Assuming that both prices and budgets must be non-negative, using in range seems to be over-complicating things. Instead, you could just use the < operator.Regardless of whether you use < or in range, it seems like the easiest approach would be to zip both lists and apply the condition on the pairs:
