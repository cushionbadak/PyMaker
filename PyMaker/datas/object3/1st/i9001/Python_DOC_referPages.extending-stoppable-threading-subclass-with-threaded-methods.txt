I'm trying to create a subclass of threading.Thread whose methods are threaded. I'm using it for video, but I suspect that a working example will be generally useful for folks.I realized here that I never instantiated a thread and never called the start() method, but I don't know where to call it from or how. I also want to save the thread handle so I can stop it if I receive a stop() signal.The class works as far as it goes, but of course, none of the methods are actually threaded.start_sequence() is public so I can start a threaded sequence of videos like this:Or when I instantiate the class like this:Later, if I need to stop it, I can:What am I missing?
You should rename the start_sequence method to run and delete the playlist parameter (use self.playlist instead). Also, delete those two last lines in __init__ method. I mean:Then, to use your class just do:And you can stop it using:Note that when you call .start, it invokes the run method in a separate thread of control, check the official documentation for more information.
