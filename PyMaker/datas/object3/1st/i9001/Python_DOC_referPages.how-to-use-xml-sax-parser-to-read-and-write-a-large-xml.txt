I'm trying to remove all the project1 nodes (along with their child elements) from the below sample xml document (original document is about 30 GB) using SAX parser.It would be fine to have a separate modified file or ok with the in-line edit.sample.xmlHere is my attempt..parser.pyI can't make it to work.
You could use a xml.sax.saxutils.XMLFilterBase implementation to filter out your project1 nodes.Instead of assembling the xml strings yourself you could use xml.sax.saxutils.XMLGenerator.The following is Python3 code, adjust super if you require Python2.
