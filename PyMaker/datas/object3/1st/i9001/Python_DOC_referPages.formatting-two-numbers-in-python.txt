I am coping with the formatting of numbers. I assumed that the .format allows to use multiple arguments:Returns:Instead of:On the other hand, this works fine:Returns:Any idea where is the problem?
You used for both of the the parameters the value a (0), you should call in the second param to value b (1).the value before the : is for giving placeholders an explicit positional index.This allows for re-arranging the order of display without changing the arguments.ChangeTo:
Values before the : character specify either a field name or a conversion; by using 0 in both cases you're essentially telling .format, via the element index, to use a in both cases.In your second case, '({}, {})'.format(a, b), by not specifying a position, .format replaces each empty pair of {} with the elements supplied in increasing order of position.A simple replacement, as suggested, is to use 1 to indicate that you want to use b instead of a. Alternatively, simply omit them:to get a similar effect.You should skim through the Syntax for the format strings to get an idea of the rules used when formatting.
