Natural Text
I was checking a similar problem about importing python files and it seems like something to do with my _init_.py file in the main parent folder a level up from my tests folder (which contains all my test files) for importing classes, but not sure. Maybe it is nothing to do with this.I am using pytest for testing and want to group multiple tests into a class that helps me test the parsing of multiple sentences: http://doc.pytest.org/en/latest/getting-started.html#grouping-multiple-tests-in-a-class.Now, when from another file which is in the same folder (test_pipelines.py), I try and run import test_text I am unable to do this. Why is this so?The main issue here is this statement from test_text import UNEMPLOYMENT_SENTENCES within test_pipelines.py is not even picking up the file test_text, let aloneUNEMPLOYMENT_SENTENCES within it.Contents of test_text.py
The file __init__.py is used to structure your modules and group them.If you place your test_text.py in the same folder where you have the script that imports it, there should not be any problems. In case your test_text.py is in a subfolder I would recommend to add the __init__.py file.This is how a package structure would look like:Inside the __init__.py you can declare vars like __all__ = ["echo", "surround", "reverse"] which will import all submodules that you specify wen from sound.effects import *PS: I have copied your code and did not have any problem to import it from the same folder.PS2: source: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#packagesPiece of code that works for me when i place prueba.py (your code snippet) in the same folder as the scripts that imports it.
