I usually use very simply subprocess.check_output:If I fear there is something in stderr, I use it like that:But I have a problem with nginx -V:Why is the command nginx -V behaving differently (all printing in stderr)? How can I design esealy a workaround with ``subprocess.check_output`?
The way to redirect standard error to standard output in the shell is 2>&1 but you would do well to avoid using the shell at all here.If you have a more recent Python, also consider switching to subprocess.run()
