I get the following errorWhen I run the following python:Any ideas?  I need to run init since I want to ONLY do my setup work once.  Not once for each test.  That would be a big optimization for overall test run time.Here is the rest of the stack crawl:
Read the docs for the class you're extending; unittest.TestCase's initializer takes an optional argument, and if you don't accept it, and it gets passed, you'll get this error.There's rarely a good reason to override __init__ for a TestCase anyway; test setup is done in setUp (run once per test so changed state from one test doesn't influence the behavior of another test), not __init__ (run once total). You'll inherit __init__, and since your __init__ isn't doing anything extra, it's silly to have it at all.If you do have a legitimate use for it, make sure you delegate initialization up the chain:Of course, as noted in the comments, you can have separate class setup (as of Python 2.7/3.2) using setupClass so you don't have to deal with __init__'s finickiness at all.
