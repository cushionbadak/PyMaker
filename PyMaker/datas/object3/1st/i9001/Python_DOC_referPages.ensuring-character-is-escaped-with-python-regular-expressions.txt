I have some code in Python 3 that looks like this:So the idea is to find the indices of all occurrences of a character in a string.The problem is that string1 could be anything, so if it's something normal like string1 = 'cat' or string1 = 'dog', then everything is fine.But if it starts with a regular expression control character then you have a problem.  For example, if you have string1 = *hello, then searchChar is '*', and findIter will return an error since '*' is an invalid regex.In my scenario I'm always searching for a character literal.  So is there a way to ensure that searchChar is escaped (i.e. '\*') if and only if it needs to be?
Do a plain string search. If you want to count occurrences of a substring, str instances provide the count  method for that.
Niemmi's comment was the answer I needed.  Looks like re.escape is the answer.
