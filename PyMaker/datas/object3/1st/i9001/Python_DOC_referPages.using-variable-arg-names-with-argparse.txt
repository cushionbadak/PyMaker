I have an upstream system that invokes my program with varying arg names. Example:I would like the result of argparsing to be a xyz = [10, 25, 31].The names of my args have a common prefix, but unfortunately have to differ at least with a different numeric suffix, which also indicates order. I also don't have a fixed number of args.Is there a way to model this with argparse? Either with what is available through some combination of built-in capabilities, or by overriding/pluging in some custom parser handling.
I would suggest a bit of pre-processing to achieve this:Code:To Test:Output:To use:Nominally instead of a fixed cmd_line as in the above example this would be called with something like:UPDATE: If you need --xyz=31 (ie = separator):Then you will need to change:To:
Here's what I did for reference (quick and dirty version), though I also like Stephen Rauch's answer (so I'll mark that as an answer -- esp. since I used internal implementation detail for my solution):Usage:Note -- This supports args of the form --xyz:1, --xyz:2, ... which is slightly different than the original question.
