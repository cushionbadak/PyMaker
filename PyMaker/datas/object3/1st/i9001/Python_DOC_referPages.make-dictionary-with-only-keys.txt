I need to make a dictionnary containing only keys.I cannot use d.append() as it is not a list, neither setdefault as it needs 2 arguments: a key and a value.It should work as the following:add "a":add "b": add "c" ...What is the code I need to get this result?Or is it another solution? Such as making a list. 
A dict with only keys is called a set.Start with an empty set instead of a dictionary.You can also create a set via a {} expression:Or using a list:
You need a set not a dictionary,
That should do it:As @Rahul says in the comments, d = {"a", "b", "c"} is not a valid dictionary definition since it is lacking the values. You need to have values assigned to keys for a dictionary to exist and if you are lacking the values you can just assign None and update it later.
