Natural Text
The documentation for __init__.py is quite hard to find. I can't find a place that explains all the things you can do in this file. The Python module documentation barely even mentions __init__.py nor that you can use __all__ for from module import *What I want is for my module to be callable like:main.pymodule/__ init __.py
Maybe silly answer but you can add method into __init__.py file like__init__.pyand then main.pyalso, you just can write some operations into init and then it will be calling after import example:__init__.pymain.pyafter run main.pythe output will be but actually, it's not good practice. Try to write code without "calling" modules because a module is a file containing Python definitions and statements, not the function that needs to call.
