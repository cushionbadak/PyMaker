I saw some variations of the following simple piece of code: Variation 1:Variation 2:Can someone please explain how this print (x,y)[x>y] code works? 
Booleans are actually a subclass of integers in Python:are both true statements. So you can index a two-element sequence with a boolean. If the boolean is False, you will get the first element. If the boolean is True, you will get the second element.The expression (enemy_1, enemy_2) creates a two-element tuple. [dist_1 > dist_2] provides the boolean index. The print is incidental; it is just used to output the result.
If you put some element(s) in parens with at least one comma it becomes a tuple. Similar to a list, you can index a tuple. You index using integers, usually. However, if you index using a boolean then False will be interpreted as 0 and True will be interpreted as 1.So the code:Is interpreted in English as "if dist_1 > than dist_2 give me item 1 from the tuple, else give me item 0."If you want, you can do a tuple tutorial.
