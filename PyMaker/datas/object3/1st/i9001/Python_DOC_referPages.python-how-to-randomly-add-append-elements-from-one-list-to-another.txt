Hey, so the above program is supposed to randomly add 4 of the elements from the list called colours into the other list named current. I have looked through the forums, but I cannot find help specific to this case.In short, Is there a quick and efficient way to add 4 random elements from one list straight into another?Thanks
To fix your original code, doinstead ofYou should also make current a local variable and return it rather than a global variable. In the same light, you should pass the array of choices as a parameter rather than working on a global variable directory. Both of these changes will give your function greater flexibility.
You're describing the basic usage of random.sample.If you want to allow duplicates, use random.choices instead (new in Python 3.6).
