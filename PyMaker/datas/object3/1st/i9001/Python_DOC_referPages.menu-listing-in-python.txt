I am very very new to Python so I apologize in advance! I am trying to create a list where the user has the option to add a number, display the mean, display the median, print the list in order, print the list in reverse order, or quit. I thought I was on the right track but I cant get it to run. Can anyone help me?When I try to choose option 2 it gives me:When I try to run the third option it gives me:
Problem with meanYou got a really good hint from the traceback message: ZeroDivisionError: division by zero. What was the denominator of your division? listLength. Where was listLength calculated from? The length of an empty list (myList) that you created with local scope to the function. You needed the length of the list passed as an argument to the function instead.There's another problem with your mean calculation also: your numerator isn't correct for the division either. Fixing it is left as an exercise to you.Problem with medianAgain, the traceback message gave you a really good hint: AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'median'. Neither the common sequence operations nor the List-type operations provide a median method. You either need to define it as a function or build a class that defines it as a class method and has a List as internal storage.Or, you could avoid re-inventing the wheel -- probably the most Pythonic answer of all -- and use the statistics module from the standard library.
