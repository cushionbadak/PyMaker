when I try to run this module I get invalid syntax highlighting the import. what is the issue?I have already tried import random but it doesn't seem to want to work
Your code is full of errors. I have fixed indentation and other syntax issues.You don't need to use from, just use import random.Here is the code
Fixed your indentation, spelling, capitalization, insertion of unnecessary spaces and comparing between a string and int which would always be false.Also added str.title to allow for all types of capitalization for restart
