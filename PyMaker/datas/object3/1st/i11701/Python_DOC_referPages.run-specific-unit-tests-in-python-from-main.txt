I am trying to run only a single test from the unit tests provided in a class. So assumingI would like to run only test_false. Based on the Q&A provided on this site and online I used the following lines of code in my main classI keep getting errors while trying to add the test. Mainly:Do I need a specific runTest method in my class? Is there a way to run particular tests that may belong to different suites. Eg: method A belonging to suite class 1 and method B belonging to suite class 2. Surprisingly this has proven to be a difficult thing to find online. There are multiple examples of doing it through command-line but not from the program itself. As always, any help is appreciated.
You're just passing the wrong thing to addTest. Rather than passing in a bound method, you need to pass a new instance of TestCase (in your case, an instance of MyTestSuite), constructed with the name of the single test you want it to run.The Docs have a great deal of additional info and examples on this.
