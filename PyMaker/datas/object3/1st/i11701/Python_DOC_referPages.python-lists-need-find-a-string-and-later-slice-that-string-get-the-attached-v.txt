Natural Text
so this is my code: I want "AM ID:" value , I have used description.splitlines() function and stored it in list . Now in that list I need to search for " AM ID:" if it is present I need get value connected to that colon . else print no am id .
You could use a for/else loop:Here, the else part is executed only if the loop terminated normally, i.e. without hitting the break.
