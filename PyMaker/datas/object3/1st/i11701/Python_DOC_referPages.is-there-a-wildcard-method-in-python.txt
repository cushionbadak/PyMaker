Natural Text
I am looking for a way to use a method of a class which is not defined in that class, but handled dynamically. What I would like to achieve, to take an example, is to move fromto the possibility of using aaa and bbb (and others) within the class without the need to define them explicitly. For the example above that would be a construction which receives the name of the method used (aaa for instance) and format a message accordingly. In other other words, a "wildcard method" which would itself handle its name and perform conditional actions depending on the name. In pseudocode (to replicate the example above)Is such a construction possible?
You could overload the class' __getattr__ method:Result:
If you know the names of the methods in advance, you could do this with a decorator that adds all the methods for you. Use it like this: If you are unfamiliar with decorators, the@ syntax above is equivalent to doing this after the class definition:
I found above answers a bit hard to comprehend so I do this.Inspired by Django's code.
