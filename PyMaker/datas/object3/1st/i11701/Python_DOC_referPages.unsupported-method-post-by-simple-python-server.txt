I'm learning about full stacks development of Udacity and we have to create a simple python server using http.server.I wrote a small program in python that does a GET request very well. I'm having issues with the post. The server is running on port 8080, local host. Any POST request i give is returning a 501 unsupported method error.I'm mostly into kernel device drivers etc and I'm not used to debugging errors like this.The program is creating a simple server that prints a greet message on GET request as such. http:localhost:8080/helloIt also gives the user a form to enter a new greeting message, but when entered, give the 501 error. The POST method is supposed to display the same page with the user inputted greeting. I' using CGI to get this done.I'm stuck!Also, if anyone can provide links/tips to how to go about debugging such things, i'd be grateful! Is there like a log file i can read or something?The program:
Your do_POST function is not indented properly, it's outside the class right now, have it aligned with the do_GET function and it should be fine.
