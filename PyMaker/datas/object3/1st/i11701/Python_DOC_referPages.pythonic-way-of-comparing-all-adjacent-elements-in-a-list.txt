I want to know if there's a more Pythonic way of doing the following:I feel like this should/could be done differently. Ideas?EDIT:Since some are asking for requirements. I wanted a general-purpose answer. Maybe to check if A[i], A[j] are between a certain range, or if they're equal. Or maybe I wanted to do a "trickle-up" of elements. The more general, the better. 
zip lets you combine multiple iterators:you can also use enumerate on a range object:Note that unlike the other answers this gives you access to the indices of A not just the items, this is necessary if you want to use any assignment to A[i] or A[j], for example here is a very basic bubble sort:this is only possible when you iterate over the indices of A.
There's a nice little recipe in itertools for doing this. As a bonus it works with any iterable, not just sequences.If you need the index as well then just enumerate the pairwise iterator.
For operation '+':General:
You could do :
You can use normal slice A[1:], but that makes another list wasting memory. Now zip() emits values till the shortest iterator(A2) is exhausted. So no worries about the possible IndexError.
