I have a game that when I land on a place, which is a coordinate,it checks it and replaces that coordinate with an object sort out thing. I'm struggling to do it please can any of you help me.Please can any of you help me.THANKS :) t
you can use tuple as key to store x and y axis and put counter on valuesWhenever player landed on some coordinate update in dict if its 1st time, else check the value is greater than 3 or not. if not increment the value and update the dict.
So you want to note down how many times each coordinate was visited. You can use a dictionary. A dictionary is a container which holds a particular item for every particular key. Its denoted by curly braces.Let the dictionary be d.d = {}To set an item,d[(x, y)] = 1Here (x,y) is a tuple. You are confused between what tuples and dictionaries are.You'll do this for the first time. For the next time you'll have to increase it by one which you can do by:d[(x, y)] += 1
