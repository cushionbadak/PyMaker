I've got this simple code here running for project Euler question 31.The Euler Q is not required; I just want to know, why my list values are getting mutated, i.e. this is printing a list of many lists of [2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0].This doesn't work for some reason and the output isHowever, this one works, and the output isWhat is the difference between the two?And also, how can I shorten my code, maybe a recursive function?So that instead of doing c1 in coins, c2 in coins and so on, I just have one or two loops to do the same job.
The problem is that c still gets modified after it has been added to perms. You can instead pass a copy to check, then it seems to work.BTW, I didn't even know for c[1] in coins is valid Python syntax...Also, you might want to have a look at itertools, particularly product, permutations, combinations and combinations_with_replacement.A recursive function could look roughly like this:However, this, too, seems to be too slow for getting all the combinations of coins.
@tobias_k indicates, you can use in this case combinations_with_replacement with permutations from itertools: NOTE: If you use a list in this case should be eliminated repeated or check in another way.
