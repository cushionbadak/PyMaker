Today I have come across wired error running the Django application with virtual environments. The application runs without errors both locally and Heroku under python-3.5.1 with Procfile web: gunicorn --pythonpath='src/' proj.wsgi:application --log-file -And my project structure is:``````But when I run it with python 2.7.11 I get the following errorImportError: No module named proj.settings.developmentI could easily guess the error is related pythonpath config. However I am curious why in first place I am getting an error?
Fixed now! The reason is that as the default django structure is rewritten every nested folder contains module need an __init__.py.src/proj missing the __init__.py. Adding it fixed the error for python2. From python3.3 this is not an requirement Reference PEP420 https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0420/
