I am look like to be able to iterate over two arrays in parallel (or with only one for loop).Here is my script I tried ...But is obviously incorrect as I get a syntax error:I am trying to get output that would look like this:
To iterate over multiple list you can use the built in function zip. According to the Documentation, this function returns a list of tuples, where the i-th tuple contains the i-th element from each of the argument sequences or iterables. So, applied to your particular exampleThe only drawback of zip is that when your lists, as in this example, have not equal length, zip will return a list of tuples, each with dimension equal to the smaller one. To favour the longest one, and fill with None when necessary, just replace zip with itertools.izip_longest:
You can use zip to iterate over 2 list.Note:  zip will provide till the list which is small. So in your case, list1 has 3 element and list2 has 5 elements, so zip will give data till 3 elements only. you can use izip_longest to reach all element in list2
I have similar requirements, implemented byneeds more detection if lists do not have the same length, or to use some try/except statement to avoid invalid index
If you want it to not just blend the two list but truly run in parallell use two threads:
