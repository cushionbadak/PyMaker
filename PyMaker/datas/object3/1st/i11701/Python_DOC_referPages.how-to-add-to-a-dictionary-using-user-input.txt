I'm doing a project but there's one problem I've run into while using the dictionary, more specifically how to add an entryThe problem I get when I try to add to this is:ValueError: dictionary update sequence element #0 has length 1; 2 is required. So what way do I have to put the information in so that the dictionary gets updated? So far I tried "d [4]", "d 4" and "d:4".
You must convert your input to be a dictionary by using the curly braces ({ }). You can split the input so that you have a string that contains your key and a string that contains your value.For example if you wanted to add the string input which was assigned the value d:4 you would use: This is because the dict.update function requires a dictionary as a parameter.
You haven't described what is acceptable for the user to enter, however, you can do it with ast.literal_eval(). This requires the user to enter a valid Python dictionary. The input is not very user friendly though.You could just have the user enter space separated keys and values, e.g. a 1 e 5 z 26. Then convert that to a dict and perform the update:Or you could use : to separate keys and values, with space between each item:
If your goal is to add a single element, you can do something like this:Substitute the input in the suitable place.
