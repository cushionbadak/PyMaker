Natural Text
I have two text files1) foo.txt2) write.txtfoo.txt contains and write.txt is blank text file.The above lines are the python code.When I run it there are no errors.The output isText files after running the program:1) foo.txt 2) write.txt is completely blankso the test "hoola" is not written on the file write.txtWith the output, i made sure that str[0] is 'welcome' but the text is not written to the 2nd text fileHow can i correct this code to compare the first element of str[] with the string 'welcome'
The problem is that open('foo.txt').readlines() will give you the list ['welcome\n'], you are missing the newline character in your check. So either check your string against 'welcome\n' or strip the line you have read in of any newline characters (and whitespace) with the str.strip method.In addition, don't use the variable name str, you will mask the builtin str type.  
Here are a few things you can do:-If there is any trailing whitespace it can mess up the string match and can be removed with:-Also you could use regular expressions to pattern match if you only care about the first characters matching. My personal experience is that this is a more reliable way to do text parsing:
