Natural Text
I need to define a variable that contains all possible natural numbers, or at least all numbers from 1 to a million.I don't want to use the range function because it is not applicable for my particular purpose. Is there any other way to define the variable so it can represent, or contain any number after 0?EDIT:If I use the range while defining the variable it will contain a list of numbers, but I am trying to avoid creating a list. The program is giving me a number X and I don't know which number it is, but I need to have that number X represented with the variable var 
In Python 3.2 and higher, representing a container with all integers from 1 to a million is correctly done with range:It's extremely efficient; the numbers in the range aren't actually generated, instead the membership (or lack thereof) is computed mathematically.If you need some equivalent object that supports any positive integer, or need it in Python 2.x, you'll have to write your own class, but it's not hard:That does something similar to range, but without supporting a start or step, and not requiring a stop, so you can do constant time membership tests:
