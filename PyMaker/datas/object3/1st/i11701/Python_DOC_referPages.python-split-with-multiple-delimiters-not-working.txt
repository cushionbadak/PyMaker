Natural Text
I have a string:feature.append(freq_and_feature(text, freq))I want a list containing each word of the string, like [feature, append, freq, and, feature, text, freq], where each word is a string, of course.These string are contained in a file called helper.txt, so I'm doing the following, as suggested by multiple SO posts, like the accepted answer for this one(Python: Split string with multiple delimiters):However, I get the following, which is not what I want.
This looks for the string ' .,()_ to split on. You probably meantre.split takes a regular expression as the first argument. To say "this OR that" in regular expressions, you can write a|b and it will match either a or b. If you wrote ab, it would only match a followed by b. Luckily, so we don't have to write '| |.|,|(|..., there's a nice form where you can use []s to state that everything inside should be treated as "match one of these".
It seems you want to split a string with non-word or underscore characters. UseSee the IDEONE demoThe [\W_]+ regex matches 1+ characters that are not word (\W = [^a-zA-Z0-9_]) or underscores.You can get rid of the if x if you remove initial and trailing non-word characters from the input string, e.g. re.sub(r'^[\W_]+|[\W_]+$', '', s).
You can try thisThis will result:
I think you are trying to split on the basis of non-word characters. It should be[^A-Za-z0-9] can be translated to --> [\W_]Python CodeThis will also work, indeedIdeone Demo
