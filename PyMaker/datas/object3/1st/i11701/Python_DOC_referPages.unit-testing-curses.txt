well I'm studying about unit test, and I faced a question about it using python, but I don't know the language very well. How could I do a unit test of this function? :
You should/or it's best to cover all possible scenarios your function handles by sending appropriate input in each test case. Here is a stub for a test class to understand what i mean:Note: The last 3 test cases require patching curses.tigetnum. The reason is so that you can control what it returns easily. You can even make it raise an error. Here are some examples in the docs:https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html#patch
Imagine each line of code doesn't exist, or has been changed to be wrong. Write a test which needs that line of code to exist.etc.You probably need to pass in a fake curses instead of importing the real thing.
