Say I have a list of n elements, and each element consists of list of 0 or more integers, I want to get all possible combinations. This is my list:This is expected output:List order should be kept. That is any combination should be started with 0.
You are looking for the product of the lists; use itertools.product(), but do filter out empty lists first:filter(None, ...) removes any empty elements.Demo:
Throw out any empty list and then apply itertools.product.itertools.product will compute the cartesian product for the given iterables. If the iterables you provide are ordered (which is the case for your lists), the tuples which product creates will reflect that order, too.
