I am using the below method to replace all the spaces and new line characters in the pandas dataframe column headers.My question is:Is a more efficient way to loop using the list comprehensions in the below code ?
Using str.translate:Using regular expression substitution:
You can use the string methods available for index objects,  in this case columns.str.replace() which allows you to do this without looping over the values yourself:And by using a regular expression, you can replace spaces and newlines at the same time. See the docs: http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.Series.str.replace.html (for Series, but the method is the same for Index)
You could split() and '_'.join():It'll lose trailing whitespace and newlines though (if that matters) and compress multiple spaces etc. to a single "_":
