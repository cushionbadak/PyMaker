I'd like to create a variable whose name includes the name kaiylarScore for example, but the below code doesn't work.I want to make it so that if print(kaiylarScore) is entered, for example, then if the score variable was equal to 7, 7 would be outputted. How can I do this?
You cannot have kaiylar - 30/04/1984 variable in Python. The Python variable naming rules are described in PEP 8 (also see this related thread: What is the naming convention in Python for variable and function names?). Instead, look into using a dictionary:Or, depending on the end goal, you can have first name, DOB and score under separate keys:Or, to take it further, you may define a, say, Person class with first_name, date_of_birth and score properties. 
As discussed in other answers and comments, you should use a dictionary. But in the case of you think you should create a dynamic variable with respect to Python naming rules, you can use exec built-in function like this:Actually exec function runs Python statements dynamically. Ä°f firstName variable is "Kaiylar" and score variable is "1.2" of int, then we pass "KaiylarScore = 1.2" statement to this function.Regards.
