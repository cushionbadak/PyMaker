I'm a bit new to Python and I am trying to simplify my existing code. Right now, I have the code repeated 5 times with different strings. I'd like to have the code one time and have it run through a list of strings.Currently what I have:What I'd like to have:and run that through:I've tried running exactly what I put up, but it does not seem to format it the way I need to. The output from above looks like:But it is supposed to look like this (And it does when I run that same block over the strings separately):How should I go about looping this block of code through my list of strings?There two strings that I would need for the find and replace, old and new, so they would have to work together. These lists will be the same size, obviously, and I need them to be in the correct order. Address with address, ESSID with ESSID, etc.Thanks in advance!

If I am reading your question right, you are opening the same file, making a small alteration, saving it, and then closing it again, five times. You could just open it once, make all the alterations, and then save it. For instance, like this:If you want to use lists (ORG and NEW) for your replacements, you could do this:
Given your ORG and NEW, the simplest way to do this would be something like:
You could just do this:
