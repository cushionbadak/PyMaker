It is unlikely that programs will port painlessly from Python 2 to Python 3. Changing the "shebang" at the beginning of the script is completely unrelated to the porting process: all that does is to allow the shell (bash) to run the script through one version of Python versus another.You should read more about the differences between Python 2 and Python 3 in the documentation.
Migrate your project gradually over to Python 3. Look into how you are using each of your packages and see how to transition each of them to v3, one at a time.
