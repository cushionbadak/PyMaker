I have a dictionary that contains the starting and ending coordinates of line segment. I want to compare all the possible combination of any two keys in the dictionary to check if the line segments have an intersection. How can I do that ?The function for determining whether there is a collision is like this
You can just make nested loops for each of the pair elements. The following example does just this and tests the results with a plot., result is:, and:
You can use the standard itertools.combinations function to generate combinations. Eg,Using itertools.combinations is more efficient and more readable than using nested for loops, especially if you want combinations of length > 2.
You may writeThe if x < y part makes sure you only get (1,2) but not (2,1) which would be the same and not (1,1) which would not make sense.You get an iterator with combinations and you can write:Note you should use a list rather than a dict if the keys are 1, 2, 3,...
