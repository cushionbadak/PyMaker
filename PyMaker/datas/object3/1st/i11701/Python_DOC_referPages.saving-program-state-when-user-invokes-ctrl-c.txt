In python, when the user invokes Ctrl-C, what happens? Do I have the possibility to save the program state?What about context-managers? Does the __exit__() section get executed?
Basically, a KeyboardInterrupt exception is raised inside the main thread. So yes, you can handle it by catching it in try/except block and __exit__() sections are executedhttps://docs.python.org/2/library/exceptions.html#exceptions.KeyboardInterrupt
This is what the atexit module is for. You can register multiple exit handlers. You can see it at work by running this program and observing that a message is displayed:
I'll just mention signal which is also a built in that can handle Ctrl+C and many more signals such as SIGHUP etc.This is just a example of a broad framework that can handle numerous signals.Here's a list of some of the signals you could catch.
