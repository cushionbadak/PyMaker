I have a given weather data from MetOffice. The sample is shown below:SAMPLEThe data updates hourly and is from 2016-01-01 to 2016-03-31 . i have tried to count Unique SRC_ID values per **Hour of OB_END_TIME ** The relevant code for the same is given below:I want to do three things here:for the hour variable i want to use DateTime module of python so that i can read the hour value in OB_END_TIME column. Here i have used string indexing to get the hour value but now i want it using the function.for the src_id variable in the code i want to read the column by Name as an identifier not the as the position. That is, I want src_id variable to read the SRC_ID column without mentioning the [6] index.for dd = collections.defaultdict((lambda: collections.defaultdict(int))) is there any efficient method to do the same. can we initialize a normal variable and do the same.i hope i am clear with my doubts. In case of concerns please let me know by the comments. I perfectly understand that some requirements of mine may be tricky but just wanted with an efficient code.PS: I think csv.DictReader may solve my second query but i don't know how to implement it in this section.NOTE : I cannot use external modules such as Pandas, Numpy, SQLite, etc. i can just only use the modules that comes with Python Installer. My editor is Python IDLE.
You could actually use csv.DictReader as follows:I hope this what you were looking for.
You need to count the unique elements from a CSV. Ok, use a set:And Bob's your uncle!
You don't need csv reader for that. Just open the using context manager and read each line.Operate on the date_object as much as u like
