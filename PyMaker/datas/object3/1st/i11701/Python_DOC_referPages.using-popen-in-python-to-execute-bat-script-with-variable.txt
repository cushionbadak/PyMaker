I have a python script that is calling a bat script called testrunner.bat which in turns executes a TestSuite in SOAPUI.  I actually have gotten the external call to work just fine with the following command:However, I need to be able to have the software "level" to be dynamic and need to pass the variable level into the command in place of "NIGHTLY" so I can specify if it's nightly software, or stable, etc.  I have seen that I should break all the arguments up separately, but I am having a hard time.
subprocess.Popen() can take a list of arguments as well as a string. So, this should work for you:As mentioned in the docs, shlex.split can be very useful for splitting your original command string into pieces. However, at least in my case, I had to re-add the double quotes.Also, recall that single-quoted strings can contain double quotes, and vice versa, so you don't need to escape the quotes here.
