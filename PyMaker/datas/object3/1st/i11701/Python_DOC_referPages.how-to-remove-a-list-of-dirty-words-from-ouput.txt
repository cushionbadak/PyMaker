Natural Text
I have three text files that I have opened and read into my program. Each contain speeches that I am going to extract the n most words from. I have converted the words to lowercase and I am trying to get rid of dirty words that I have created a list for prior to exporting the words to excel spreadsheets for further analysis.I have tried multiple options from several sites and I am stuck.Here is what I have:All other variables, etc for the text file and other things are called, I just posted the issue areas here. I am still marking it up, so I haven't error-trapped everything, etc. The main issue I am having is here:I am trying to remove the dirty words before creating the output list, but the dirty words keep showing up.Any help is greatly appreciatedBrandon
In your if-else statement in the lower code snipped you provided, you're testing to see if the word in question is in the hitList in the if but not in the else. Therefore, each word you don't want to get added is getting added at least once.Providing the same sort of protection in the else as you do in the if should help. Or, better yet, just wrap the whole if-else in the if x not in hitList:.Also, as Andrea Corbellini pointed out, using a Counter would tremendously  simplify your code.
