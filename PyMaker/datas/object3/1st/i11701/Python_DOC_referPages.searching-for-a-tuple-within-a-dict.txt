I have a tuple struct in my Python code that declares the following:When I print match_entry, I see the following:I am searching for this particular tuple a dict of tuples, let's call it dict_of_tuples; the corresponding output for the dict is below.However, when I check if the match entry is in the tuple:I do not see any results, even though the match_entry is clearly in dict_of_tuple. Any reason why this would be the case?

Dictionary is not hashable, so I think your structure may not be possible:Dictionary doesn't allow a dict exists in its keys. So make sure it's really a dict not something like string.Edit:As mentioned in comment, a frozen dict (immutable dict) will be hashable therefore solves this problem. But you have to modify default dict type. Normally, you can modify a dict at runtime:It's enabled with __setattr__ in Object. When we need immutable classes? Basically, immutable objects are more efficient on memory. Here is a topic about this.
