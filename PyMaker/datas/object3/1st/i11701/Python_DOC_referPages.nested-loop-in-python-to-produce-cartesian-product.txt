I am trying to loop through two list in python to get a output like this.So it should loop for each value of list1 over list 2. list1[a] will loop 3 times over list2 and so on till it reaches c. However, I am not getting the desired output.Output:Desired out put should be like below: Please guide me what I am missing here, am new with this.
You need to interpolate the list2 value inside the loop. You could the itertools.product() function instead of nesting your loops; do swap the order of the lists if you want the values of list1 to alterate:The str.format() method fills the {} in the list1 strings with your l2 values, letting you avoid having to rebuild list2 from scratch each time:Another alternative is for list1 to contain tuples of values to be used, and only when printing you convert everything to one string by using print() as a function (Python 3, or a from __future__ import in Python 2):It depends on what else you want to do with the values produced.Note that if the 1 and 5 numbers are otherwise unchanged between the values of list1, there is no need at all to do a complicated dance with string templates or tuples. You'd just reference those inside the loop:I still used string formatting just to show another form of combining several values into one string.
You need to move the construction of list1 into your for loop. Reorganize your lines as follows:this will printThat being said, this can be improved using string formatting:
