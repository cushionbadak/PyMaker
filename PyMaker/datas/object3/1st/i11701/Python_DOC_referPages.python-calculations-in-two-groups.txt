I have the following two lists: And i am just wondering if I could use Python calculate the sum Number for each element in list level. So the output would be two new lists x and y:
You could use a defaultdict if you don't care about the order in x, although I'm sure there's a more practical way to do this Output:
One way would be using defaultdict:Another way would be using a Counter:In both ways you can unpack it into 2 lists like so:
You have to create key mapping for them.Below code, I create dictionary with mapping. And check, if your level is not exist in dict then sum your frequency with 0 else sum with last calculated frequency.
