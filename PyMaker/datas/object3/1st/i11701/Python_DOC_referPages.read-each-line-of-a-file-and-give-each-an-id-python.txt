This question is an exact duplicate of:How to assign IDs to dictionaries while iterating through document input - PythonI need to read each line of an input file and assign each one it's own ID so that it can be identified later on. This would be simple if I knew the amount of lines that the file would have or if it were short but I need to make it able to take a file with any number of linesFor example the trial file I am using contains this:and I need to read each line individually and assign it an ID so that somewhere over rainbow bluebirds fly birds fly over rainbow why why is assigned ID 1 and so forth.I can't seem to be able to find a way to dynamically create variables/variable names and I don't know of any other way of automatically assigning IDs.Any help would be greatly appreciated. 
You can store the lines in a dictionary, with the keys as the ids:This will produce a dictionary with numbers from 1 as keys:The second argument to the enumerate function sets the starting number for the enumeration, so in this case we start indexing from one; the default is zero if no starting number is provided.
line_no would be your id ... I guess
You can use a dict to store the lines with the idHere an example
I'd probably just use a list, with position as ID:
A dictionary seems like a good solution for this problem. I would also use enumerate to get the line number automatically.
