Natural Text
I have a .txt file with N lines. I want to read the line number 8, and the line number 16, which look like these:How can I recover the values  04:59:20.3635 and 04:27:30.6216 and substract them? I tried with opening and reading the file usingBut I don't know how to store each line in a variable, and then access the specific part of the line that I want to reach. I've tried some stuff, but I want to know which would be the most efficient way to handle this. Many thanks!!
The following is my approach. Hope it helps:Output:
You could make an array of strings then have the file print each line into the array in a while loop. The while loop checks how much you read into the array or when to stop reading file. After, just simply use other methods to search through a specific line or array index to find what you need. There are plenty of other ways too depending on the task at hand.
python is good at manipulate string, so at your situationjust you could even extract/ calculated the time delta by using the datetime or timedelta related build in libraries, but first, as other commented, you should go through the tutorial, believe me, it's short and worth reading if you think you would occasionally grasp some line the other day -- you need to know what python could do generally
