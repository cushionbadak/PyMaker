I have a problem, where I'm assigning function to an "entry" in dictionary.This is from the code:And this is the traceback. From what I understand, it thinks I'm trying to call a string.And this is the dictionary being listed out:What am I doing wrong?
Your iteration here: Is giving you the keys  of your dictionary. Not the values. To get the values when iterating the way you are, you want: orEven more simple just use values instead:Take a look at the dictionary documentation to get more acquainted with it: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries
for loops over dictionaries iterate over the keys.  your request variable will have "nick1" in it.  You need assignment[request]("Ping").
