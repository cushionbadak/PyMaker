So I make couple of experience:This one works perfectly.However, this one seems not work:I deem that it should work,because I use one set contain two element, {2,3} and {4,3} to minus one element {4,3}.Nonetheless, it just can't work. Why?
sets are not hashable; cannot be member of set. Use frozenset instead:According to set / frozenset documentation:The elements of a set must be hashable. To represent sets of sets, the  inner sets must be frozenset objects. If iterable is not specified, a  new empty set is returned.hashableAn object is hashable if it has a hash value which never changes  during its lifetime (it needs a __hash__() method), and can be  compared to other objects (it needs an __eq__() method). Hashable  objects which compare equal must have the same hash value.Hashability makes an object usable as a dictionary key and a set  member, because these data structures use the hash value internally.All of Pythonâ€™s immutable built-in objects are hashable, while no  mutable containers (such as lists or dictionaries) are. Objects which  are instances of user-defined classes are hashable by default; they  all compare unequal (except with themselves), and their hash value is  derived from their id().
