I have a dictionary named dico containing these information:When I call comparePackages(dico) I keep getting different results for the same input such as :ororHere is my comparePackages functionExpected output :I would like to know why and how to correct it. At the end all I need is a dictionary that for each package present in the tuple has the latest version. Loosing 1 of 2 values for a same package isn't a problem. Thank you.
This is not a direct answer to your problem BUT you need to fix that problem in order to get a working and reproductible behavior. (and i will not be shocked if your bug goes away after this fix)In your code:And:This assume that keys and values are sorted in the same order. That's not necessarily true, and that's lead to differences of execution based on the returned order.You should use items instead:And:So:Become:Or, more pythonic:Another solution could be to use an OrderedDict.
I got the answer"""    Function that compares package versions and keeps the most recent one.    @param : dictionary        package_dictionary :            keys : tuple            values : string"""
