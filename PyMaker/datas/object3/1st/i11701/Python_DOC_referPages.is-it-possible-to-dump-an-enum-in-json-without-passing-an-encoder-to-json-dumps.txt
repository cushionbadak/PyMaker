My problem could be summarised by the following example:I get a type error, because enums are not JSON serializable.I primarily though of implementing a JsonEncoder and adding it to the json.dumps() call but I cannot change the line where json.dumps() call is made.So, my question is : Is it possible to dump an enum in json without passing an encoder to json.dumps(), but instead, by adding class method(s) in FooBarType enum ?I expect to extract the following json:or
I don't think there is a great way for this and you will loose features of the Enum.Simplest option: Don't subclass Enum:What you could also do:This will actually give you And therefore not really be valid json, but you can play around with it to fit your needs!
Try:Result:
Sadly, there is no direct support for Enum in JSON.The closest automatic support is to use IntEnum (which enum34 also supports), and then json will treat your enums as ints; of course, decoding them will give you an int back, but that is as good it gets without specifying your encoder/decoder.
Just adding method(s) to the FooBarType enum won't do what you want.As I mentioned in my comment, you can however use part of my answer to the question Making object JSON serializable with regular encoder to monkey-patch the json module so it will return the name (or value) of Enum members. I'm assuming you're using the enums34 module by Ethan Furman et al, which was backported to Python 2.7 since that version doesn't come with it built-in — it became part of the standard library in Python 3.4.Note this will work even though you can't change the line where the json.dumps() call occurs as long as that happens after the patch is applied. This is because Python normally caches imported modules in sys.modules, i.e. they aren't reloaded everytime they are used in separate scripts — so any changes made this to them are "sticky" and remain in effect.So for what you want to do, first create your own module to make the patch. For example: make_enum_json_serializable.py.Then, in your own script, all you need to do is essentially add one line:Output:
