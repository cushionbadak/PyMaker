What the equivalent way to str.format function for converting booleans into strings?Please note the space in ' True'. This  always makes the length the same for 'True' and 'False'.I've check the methods in this post:How are booleans formatted in Strings in Python?None of them can do the same thing.
You can use type conversion flags to do what you wanted:Note the !s. I used an underscore to show the padding more clearly.Relevant documentation:6.1.3. Format String Syntax[...]The conversion field causes a type coercion before formatting. Normally, the job of formatting a value is done by the __format__() method of the value itself. However, in some cases it is desirable to force a type to be formatted as a string, overriding its own definition of formatting. By converting the value to a string before calling __format__(), the normal formatting logic is bypassed.Three conversion flags are currently supported: '!s' which calls str() on the value, '!r' which calls repr() and '!a' which calls ascii().Some examples:
You can use the str() function. More about it here.Here are some examples:
I found that "{:>5}".format(str(True)) works fine. The output is exactly the same as "%5s" % True, ie ' True'.So the length of "{:>5}".format(str(bool_value)) is alway 5, no matter bool_value is True or False.Of course you may change the length or the alignment direction as you want. eg. "{:6}".format(str(True)) outputs 'True  '.
Not sure if I got idea correctly but if some variable x results in True or False, You can write str(x); if not a case, sorry just try explaining Q in more detailed way
