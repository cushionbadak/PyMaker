Natural Text
I have implemented the mergesort algorithm using a post on codereview. It's working nicely on a list of integers but I thought a more practical application is need. So I downloaded a text file with random english words and attempted to sort them.However it does absolutely nothing.I think the problem is that it's handling a list of lists instead of a single list. Also the function has no way of knowing what's the basis of sorting. Is that correct?Here is how I want to call it
As you identified the problem is that merge_sort has no way of knowing the basis of sorting. You could change merge_sort to take in an additional parameter that returns the key for each element in the sequence just like sorted does:Then change the comparison to call passed function instead of comparing elements directly:And finally pass key to recursive calls:With these changes it will work as you expect:One thing to note though is that results are not identical with sorted since merge_sort is not stable:
