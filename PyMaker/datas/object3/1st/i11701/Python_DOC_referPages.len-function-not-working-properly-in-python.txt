I have the following code:All of the methods work properly but len(). No matter the length of the Stat object, the returned length is always 0; I don't understand why.
it will return 0 always when you are using it like this:if you want to override len function use this code:
I have run your code, the result is correct in my environment.
Override the magic method __len__(self) to control the output of a call to len(my_stat_object):
If what you're trying to run is len(stat) and not stat.len(), your function len should be named __len__ instead. Here's the docs: object.lenAs a side note, you might want to replace lst=[] in your init definition, as it can cause some weird looking behaviours. Read about it here: mutable default argument
