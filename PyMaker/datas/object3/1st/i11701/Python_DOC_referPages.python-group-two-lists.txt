I have two lists:Is there anyway i could group items in A for the same sessionid, so that i could print out the following:
The itertools groupby function is designed to do this sort of thing. Some of the other answers here create a dictionary, which is very sensible, but if you don't actually want a dict then you can do this:outputoperator.itemgetter(0) returns a callable that fetches the item at index 0 of whatever object you pass it; groupby uses this as the key function to determine what items can be grouped together.Note that this and similar solutions assume that the sessionid indices are sorted. If they aren't then you need to sort the list of tuples returned by zip(sessionid, A) with the same key function before passing them to groupby.edited to work correctly on Python 2 and Python 3
Not using itertools, you can use a dictionary:And based on the remarks below:
You could use a dictionary and zip:Or you can use defaultdict:Output:
One linerWithout nested loop
You can do:
You could also convert them into numpy arrays, and use the indices of the session ids you need with np.whereshould return  ['T' 'D' 'Q']you could of course turn this into a function which takes N, the desired session and returns your A values.Hope this helps!
