Natural Text
I have a little server running on my Raspberry Pi which listens at a specific port. However, whenever an exception occurs during a connection and the connection is terminated, it seems that the assignment to the port is not "unbound".This is an example code:When I run it for the first time and do a telnet localhost 5005 on another terminal, the connection is made and the server raises the Exception as expected.However, when I try to run it for a second time, I get this error:How can I make sure that the socket is unbound even if an exception is raised on the server?(By the way, this doesn't seem to happen in Windows.)
Set SO_REUSEADDR socket option before binding the socket.the SO_REUSEADDR flag tells the kernel to reuse a local socket in  TIME_WAIT state, without waiting for its natural timeout to expire.from socket documentationNOTE: You will get an error even if you apply this, if there's TIME_WAIT socket is remained from the previous run (without the SO_REUSEADDR option).
