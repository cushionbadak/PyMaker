I'm performing a regex search in python like the one below:How can I determine the number of groups that get returned from the regex search?
regexSearch.groups() is all of the groups. len(regexSearch.groups()) gets the count.In your case there will always be 0 groups as your regex does not contain groups (group(0) is the whole match and not really a group)
