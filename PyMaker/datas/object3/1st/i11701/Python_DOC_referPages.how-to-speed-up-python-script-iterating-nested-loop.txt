I'm running a Python script which iterates two huge lists and finds the matching pairs.However, it seems to take forever. How to speed up this script?
Use setsUsing a set for the first list, means that checking if the item is in that list is now reduced to an O(1)As I am writing this, I realise you can even do better. The range function in python 3 returns a sequence, so you need python 3 for this next partEven better, using range and do the checking within the first loop?
If using Python 2, use xrange(), which returns a generator-like object.
