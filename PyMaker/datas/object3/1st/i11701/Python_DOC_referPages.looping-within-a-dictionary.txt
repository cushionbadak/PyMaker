I'm stuck on the last part of this coding and need help.Here is my taskThe part I need help with is the for/if statements on comparing just the age and returning the lowest value. I know that I want to loop through all the ages and only return the lowest using if > than or < than signs but don't know how to word it in coding. 
Something like this seems to do the trick.You could do it by stepping through the dictionary and saving the key value if it is the minimum seen so far as well which may be more explicit if you intend for others to read your code later. This method is more of a test of Pythonic ways to do complex tasks in minimal space.
Use the key argument of the min() function to tell it what it should use when comparing elements.
To loop through the keys  and values of a dictionary, you use .items()You can even automatically expand the value tuple like this:You only need to store two values, the minimum age, and a list of all presidents with the same minimum age.  You can do this with a single iteration through p_db
