Natural Text
I'm creating a program in Python 3.x where a quiz containing randomly generated simple arithmetic questions (e.g. 3 x 8). The quiz will be played by 3 different classes of school students (not real ones!), and the latest 3 scores of each student should be stored. The scores for each class should be kept separately (in 3 text files).After the quiz is played by a student, the student's score for that try should be added to their scores. I created the following code, where filename is the name of the text file which stores the student's class' scores, score is the student's score that they just acheived, fullName is the student's full name (which they inputted at the start), and scores is a dictionary which stores the user's class' scores:But when I run it, I receive an error:I thought that this was because the text files were empty, so when the program tried to read from them, it produced an error. So, I changed it to this:But when I run the program multiple times, either with different names or with the same name, only the score from the newest try appears. I tried having data already in a text file and then running the program without the try...except statement, but the same SyntaxError still occurred. Why is this happening? Please note that I am a beginner, though, so I may not understand a lot of things.
You could use a deque and pickle but to keep it simple we will use json to dump a dict using lists to hold the values:
