I have a list of items which I would like to periodically "cycle" through, accessing the first (0th) item and subsequently moving it to the back of the list. What is the best way to accomplish this? My desired syntax is shown below.
You can use itertools.cycle():Get 10 items:Output:Get the next item with next(cycled_list).Note itertools.cycle() makes a copy of your list. You can avoid this by writing your own cycle iterator function that works only with sequences but not with iterators:Output:The second method should be the most performant because it does not copyany part the list at all.
You can use .pop() with .append():
