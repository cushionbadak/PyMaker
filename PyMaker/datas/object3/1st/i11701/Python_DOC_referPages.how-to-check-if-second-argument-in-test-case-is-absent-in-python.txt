I have the following Python code:The code is supposed to return string chunks of certain size n, and is also supposed to check if n is empty or not passed as a parameter. It is giving an error string_chunk() takes exactly 2 arguments (1 given). How do I provide a default argument so that I can call this with one or two arguments?
This has nothing to do with test cases, testing or the assertion you are trying.Your code simply fails because your function string_chunk expects exactly two arguments, but you are giving it exactly one.If you want n to be an optional parameter, use a default value:not n will account for all cases of falsy values for n, among them None, 0 or the empty list [].edit:From your comment I'm assuming you actually want instead ofI can only guess, though, your specifications are unclear.
