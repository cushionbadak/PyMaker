Natural Text
The code below looks at a list of tuples (each with two elements) called pairs, and creates a bank of all the element names in the list. It then counts how many times any element appears in a tuple and divides that by a number of elements. I want the average number of interactions (times it appears in a tuple with another element) per element for the entire list. The code works well but is an eyesore. I'm trying to learn how to write more pythonic code, but every time I try to condense my code into fewer lines it becomes erroneous. An example of my abysmal attempt:
You can use a set.
Try these two linesSee if it works for you.
