I am working on a small application that I know will have 3 threads independent from the main thread, at some point, and I will need to identify a thread from another. Suppose threads are A, B, C. A will need to join with C if something happens. I am trying to add the threads to a dictionary before starting them, so I can identify thread C later:The behavior is weird: sometimes both currentThreads[key].start() yield AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'start', sometimes only currentThreads['B'].start() does.Any clue why this might happen?
I suggest to you, for keeping reference name to your threads, to actually give them names, like so:Then when you need to check for the name of the thread, just get it's name with getName():
This is because start returns None so in:currentThreads['B'] is None thus calling  currentThreads['B'].start() will raise AttributeError
