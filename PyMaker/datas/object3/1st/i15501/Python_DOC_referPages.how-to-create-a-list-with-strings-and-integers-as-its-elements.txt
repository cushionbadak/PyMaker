This sounds so simple, but I cannot find anything on how to do this on the internet. I've gone through documentation but that didn't help me.I have to get inputs from the user to create a list. This is what I am using right now.But this is converting every element into  a string. If I use int in map function, then every element would be converted to int. What should I do? Is there any other function that I am missing?
You can use a list comprehension to only call int on the strings which contain nothing but numerical characters (this is determined by str.isdigit):Demo:
use try/except.  Try to make it an int.  If that fails, leave it as a string.You can use a list comprehension rather than map for more "pythonic" code:Edit:  I like iCodez's better... the isDigit test is nicer than try except.
