I'm trying to make a request to the box api using python and django. I'm getting a 400  Entity body should be a correctly nested resource attribute name\\/value pair error. My requests looks like: When I inspect the 400 request.body it contains 'parent=id&name=name.pdf' which leads me to believe I'm not setting the body properlyA curl works with the body -d '{"name": "name.pdf", "parent": {"id": "xxxxx"}}'
Explicitly encode the dictionary to prevent form-encoding. Otherwise, it will be form-encoded as the way similar to urllib.urlencode (or urllib.parse.urlencode in Python 3.x).In other word, instead of passing a dictionary, pass a string.According to More complicated POST requests - Request documentation:...  There are many times that you want to send data that is not  form-encoded. If you pass in a string instead of a dict, that data  will be posted directly.
