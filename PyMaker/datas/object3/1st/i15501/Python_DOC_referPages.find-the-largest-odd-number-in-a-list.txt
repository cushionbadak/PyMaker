After identifying the integers used if they are odd(which is this case) or even, I ran the program and it did showed that 5 is the largest odd in the list. I was curious as to how did this happen, so I tried printing the variable 'n' which then results in the following numbers: 1, 3, 5. If l = n which means l is equal to 1, 3 and 5, how come this else statementidentifies and prints the largest number in the list? I do hope someone could shed some light for me and help me understand this dilemma of mine.
l is not "equal to 1, 3, and 5". It is equal to 1 the first time through, then it is subsequently set to 3, then to 5, and then the loop ends. So it retains the value it had when the loop ends, which is 5.
This should make things more obvious:which results in
