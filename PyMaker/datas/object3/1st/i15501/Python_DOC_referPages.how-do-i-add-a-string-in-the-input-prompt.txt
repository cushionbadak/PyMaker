I want to make the input prompt say people's name while asking income, for example:If I type hui when "Could you tell me what is your name:  ", I want the next question to ask "May I ask hui's monthly income:  ".How do I do that?

Edit:Actually, it would probably be better to do this instead:By using a conditional expression and str.endswith, we ensure that we do not accidentally add a 's on the end of a name that already ends in s.You can just insert the name into the prompt string with str.format:Also, there is no reason to do str(input(...)) since input always returns a string object.Finally, you should use a , with print instead of +:Otherwise, the output will be Hello!hui, which isn't very readable.
