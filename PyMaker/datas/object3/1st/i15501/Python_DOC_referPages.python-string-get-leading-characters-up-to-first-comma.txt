I have the following string:I would like to retrieve from this a variable type = "Head" and an array vals = [0.000235532,0.43656735]How can I do this using Python? I've considered using strIn[0],...,strIn[5] to get the type, but then I realized I'll get types of various lengths. Thanks.
If you're using Python 3, you can doThis uses str.split to split the string into a list based on the provided character, and then uses Python 3's extended tuple unpacking to put the first value into type_ and the remaining values into vals. See this answer for more discussion on how to use tuple unpacking.If you're on Python 2 you can't use the extended unpacking syntax, so you have to add an additional step:
As you are in python2 first split with , then use slicing and float function :As type is a built-in name recommended that dont use it !
