I am usually an R user for all my statistical analysis work, but I wanted to learn Python. At the time I did not know that Python comes native to the Mac OS, so I went to python.org and installed Python 3.4.2 on my Mac. This created a Python folder in my Applications from where I can access IDLE. For my purposes specifically, I also needed a few libraries, namely Pandas and Numpy. After some research I learnt that the best way to do this was to get Anaconda. Hence, I went ahead and installed Anaconda for Python 3.4 from their website. Now, the issue is, the Anaconda launcher came with its own IDE called Spyder and I found that this was much easier to use than IDLE, since it contained all the libraries I needed already. So this raised a couple of questions for me:Do I still need the Python 3.4 I installed from python.org? If not, how can I remove this? I should mention that I'm not very familiar with how the Mac command line works, so if I could get instructions that have more detail, it would be easier for meDo I have 2 installs of Python 3.4 on my Mac now or did the Anacondas one replace the one from python.org? If this is the case, can I just go ahead and delete the Python 3.4 folder in my Applications folder (which contains IDLE, etc.)?
You now have three versions of Python on your Mac -- Anaconda will have installed itself into the directory anaconda in your home directory. You can remove the python.org install by following the instructions at: https://docs.python.org/3/using/mac.html?highlight=uninstall -- you may need to use the command line and rm command to remove files (for example, the symlink in /usr/local/bin/). Don't do this unless you're sure of what you're doing because they don't go to the Trash.Important note: do not delete or modify the system-provided Python in /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework and /usr/bin/python or you will hose your operating system and need to reinstall Yosemite.If this all seems too scary, I would live with the bloat as long as anaconda is your default Python and you're happy with it.
