Can you please explain if I need to pass the variable multiple times for the string concatenation.For eg.My question is, how do I pass String1 just once?Is there a better way to do it?
If you use the newer str.format method, you can do:In fact, you should always prefer str.format over % formatting in modern Python.  The latter approach is pseudo-deprecated and will most likely be removed from a future version of the language.
