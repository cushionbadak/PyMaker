Natural Text
What I want to achieve is trying to open a text file with text. The format of the text is something like this:Etc. Now the code that I have now:Only prints out the last line in a list. What I want to do is print out ALL the words in the list.So for the example above when I print(line) it prints ['Plant'] but I want ['Bear','Car','Plant'].Can anyone steer me in the right direction please? 
You don't need to split, you need to strip (to remove the newline) using str.strip(), then add the result to a list:Note that the file.readlines() call is not needed at all; just iterating over the file is enough.You can do this in one go by reading the whole file and using str.splitlines():or you can use iteration still, in a list comprehension:
readlines reads file as listyou can also use list:
