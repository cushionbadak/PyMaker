Natural Text
In my code, I want to insert words into a text file from a user. So I have these words in the text file that must be replaced by the user input, here are the strings must be replaced in the file ,  adjective,plural_noun,noun.
A little something to get you started...If Sample.txt contains This is some text to *replace* and the user input is xyz, this code prints:This is some text to xyzLet's step through it bit by bit:file1 = open('Sample.txt', 'r') opens the file for reading ('r' means "for reading").text = file1.read() reads the content of the file and puts it in the variable text.while (text.find('*replace*') != -1): looks for occurrences of the string *replace* and continues with the indented commands as long as it finds one.inp = raw_input("enter some text to replace: "), which only runs if there is a remaining occurrence of *replace*, gets user input and puts it in the variable inp.text = text.replace('*replace*', inp, 1), which also only runs if there is a remaining occurrence of *replace*, replaces the next occurrence of *replace* with the user input, overwriting the old text.print(text), which runs once all occurrences of *replace* have been replaced with user input, prints out the new text.This is not how you would write an efficient programme with lots of different *string* strings, but hopefully it will lead you in the right direction and walking before running is often a good idea.There is excellent online Python documentation and you can also use the pydoc tool -- e.g. pydoc str.replace from the command line.
