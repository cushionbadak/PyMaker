The above is essentially:But I am not able to figure out how to set the seed? 
I'm not sure why you want to set the seedâ€”especially to a random number, even more especially to a random float (note that random.seed wants a large integer).But if you do, it's simple: call the numpy.random.seed function.Note that NumPy's seeds are arrays of 32-bit integers, while Python's seeds are single arbitrary-sized integers (although see the docs for what happens when you pass other types).So, for example:Same seed used twice (I took the shortcut of passing a single int, which NumPy will internally convert into an array of 1 int32), same random numbers generated.
