Thank you and sorry it is a bit basic. Also I am using 3.3.2 I think.
You can use str.isalpha to test if a string is all alphabetic characters (letters):If you have a specific character set to test for, you can use all and a generator expression:Also, I used a set instead of a regular string of characters to improve efficiency.  Sets have O(1) (constant) complexity with in where as strings have O(n) (linear) complexity.  In other words, it is faster to find things in a set than in a string.Lastly, you can use string.ascii_letters instead of typing out the whole alphabet:This becomes especially useful if you want to test for all the letters of the alphabet plus another character or so (such as a hyphen):
There are a couple of ways to address this. One would be to do something likeBut this will reject some names that you might like, such as "John Smith" or "Kate O'Conner". A more careful approach would be something likeYou can also build a whitelist:
