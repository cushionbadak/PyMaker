For classes defined in python code, inspect.getmodule works for both objects and typesBut in case of datetime, it doesn't work for objects:Why this discrepancy?
The calendar module is pure python, whereas the datetime module is an extension.According to the docs, inspect.getmodule() is intended for retrieving information about source code, so it's obviously limited in what it can do with objects created by extension modules.
