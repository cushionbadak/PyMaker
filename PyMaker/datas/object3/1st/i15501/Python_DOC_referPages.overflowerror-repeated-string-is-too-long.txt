I'm writing a python script for when I'm using my radio. When trying to calculate wavelength, I get an OverflowError. Is it possible to overcome this problem?Here is my code:Here is the output:
Your codehas not just one problem, it has two problemsThe input function returns a string of characters, that you concatenate to itself a million times, say "107.6107.6107.6 ... 107.6", just one million times.You want to convert your response to a floating point nuber, using float, before multiplying it by 10**6The wavelength calculation is wrongExample dimensional analysis: [L] != (1/[T]) * [L]/[T] = [L]/[T]^2
If you're using Python 3.x, input returns a string object.If you want to number multiplication, convert the return value of the string to numerical value.or
You're multiplying a string:You probably meant:
