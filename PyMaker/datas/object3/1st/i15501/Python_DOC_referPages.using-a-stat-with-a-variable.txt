I am writing a script that checks the octal permissions of files and folders in Linux. I am struggling with this line of code:Check is raw input from the user, for example /home. When I run the script in terminal I get the following error message when the line above is executed:I also tried putting check in brackets and I then got:
That line should be executed in the terminal, not in a Python script.  It contains invalid Python syntax.If you want to issue a system command from Python, you can use os.system:If you need to add values into the command string, use str.format:
Python has its own calls to check stats
Rather than using os.system, I would propose that OP use subprocess.Where your_string is the variable holding the name of file you are interested in.
