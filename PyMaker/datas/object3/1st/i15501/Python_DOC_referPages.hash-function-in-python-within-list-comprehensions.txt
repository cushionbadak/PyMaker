I am trying to understand why the code behaves the way it doesThis outputsI'm wondering why in the second case I get all same hashcodes
If you don't define a __hash__ method in your class Python will use the memory address for the hashing.In the second case Bash(i) isn't needed after the hash. Python throws it away and reuses the memory for the next Bash instance, so all subsequent calls get the same hash value.
k carry list of instances pass to class Baz with value 0, 1, 2, 3see here, instance pass to class Baz is same. because hash uses same memory references and throws the previous memory reference for the instances.
