It is strange that why can't import test module which is in the sys.path "/root/Python-3.4.0/Lib/site-packages/"?
You imported your module test with the extension .py. So the import will try to find module named py in package test. Would be the correct syntax for importing a module.For example :Here string is module. But if you try to import string.py it treats string as package and trys to import py module.And you should also fix your site-packages path in sys.path which has '}' symbol at the end which is invalid path.
For two reasons:Your sys.path is messed up (there's a trailing }).You're supposed to import test, not import test.py.Please read the Python tutorial's section on modules: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html
