This is the code I've used to import the Random module. When I run the code, it instead imports a file of mine for testing code called random.py.This was leading to all sorts of errors, so I 'permanently' deleted it in the Recycle Bin and all it's shortcuts I could find.Yet it still is there somewhere and it causes errors.My entire program depends onThe game I'm making depends in randint to randomly create ships and submarines.I am running Windows 7.Thanks
Python creates a bytecode cache for each python module you import; for Python 2 the same name as the original file with the extension .pyc is used. It is that file that is imported when you import random, even if the source .py file was deleted.Use:to  locate the stale random.pyc bytecode file and delete it.In Python 3 these files are normally stored in a subdirectory called __pycache__ but these are ignored if there is no corresponding .py source file. People that want to distribute just the bytecode files (to obfuscate their code in commercial software distributions, for eample) they'll have to use the compilall script with the -b switch, something you almost certainly did not do.
There will also be a random.pyc file, either in the same folder (for Python 2.x) or a subdirectory called __pycache__ (for 3.x).
