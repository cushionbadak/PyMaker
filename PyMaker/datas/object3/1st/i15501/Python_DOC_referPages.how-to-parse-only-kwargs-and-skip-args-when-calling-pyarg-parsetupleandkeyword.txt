I am calling a function which takes a list of positional arguments followed by keyword arguments. I want to process args and kwargs both separately. Unfortunately, unlike PyArg_ParseTuple for positional arguments, there is no equivalent PyArg_ParseKeywords for keyword arguments. I tried to prevent parsing of positional arguments by passing Py_None (also NULL) in place of args:Having Py_None (or NULL) there leads to :If I replace Py_None by args, I get following error:Above TypeError occurs as it unpacks 2 positional args and 2 keyword args I passed to test_func while there are only two variables, kw1_val and kw2_val to receive those 4 values in parsing method.Is there a way to handle above scenario ? Note that positional argument can have any number of values.
Try passing an empty tuple instead of Py_None:
