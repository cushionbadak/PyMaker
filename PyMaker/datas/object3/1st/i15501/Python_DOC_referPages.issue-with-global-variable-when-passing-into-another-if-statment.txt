I am trying to get Ardinput to pass into the if "(Ardinput == stagecode):" but it seems like Ardinput loses it's contents here is my output for the codeCode:
You removed just the \n newline but left the \r carriage return in place.Use str.strip() instead to remove all whitespace from start and end:and remove the space from stagecode:For future reference, it is far easier to spot these differences if you use the repr() or even ascii() functions to produce a string literal version of the value:Note how the latter shows that there is still a \r carriage return character in the value.\r and \n are considered whitespace, as are spaces and tabs and the non-break space:Note that the space in the middle was not removed; str.strip() works on the lead and trail ends of a string only.
\r\n represents a carriage return with a new line (hence:and not STAGE Befor CR). You will have to strip it for instance with  Ardinput.decode('utf-8').strip() to remove the newline, or remove the last 2 characters with Ardinput.decode('utf-8')[:-2]).
