The typical structure for exception handling is below:May I know what does except Exception, e:orexcept Exception as e: mean?Typically I will use print (e) to print the error message but I am wondering what the programme has done to generate the e.If I were to construct it in another way (below), how would it be like?What should the method be to replace the something?When the body of code under try gives no exception, the progeamme will execute the code under else. But, what does finally do here?Thanks! :)
except Exception as e, or except Exception, e (Python 2.x only) means that it catches exceptions of type Exception, and in the except: block, the exception that was raised (the actual object, not the exception class) is bound to the variable e.As for finally, it's a block that always gets executed, regardless of what happens, after the except block (if an exception is raised) but always before anything else that would jump out of the scope is triggered (e.g. return, continue or raise).
