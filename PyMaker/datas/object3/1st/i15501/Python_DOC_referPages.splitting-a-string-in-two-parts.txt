I want to split a string in two parts like this:Is there any method to do this in python?I tried:As you can see the comma is not printed.
You can simply use list:list will iterate over the string and collect its characters into a new list.Also, you cannot use str.split here because the method was designed to split on characters/substrings and remove them from the resulting list.  For example, 'a b c'.split() would split on whitespace and remove those characters from the returned list, which is ['a', 'b', 'c'].  You however want to break the string up into individual characters while still keeping all of them.
