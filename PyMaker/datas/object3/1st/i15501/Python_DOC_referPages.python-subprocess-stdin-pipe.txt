Hello i have such problem. I need to login via subprocess. So i want to create a input pipe and write login and password to them.So i try to do something like this: After first string i have such error tcgetattr: Inappropriate ioctl for device. And i have None value of o. How can i write smth to pipe in this case. Thank you for your help.
From subprocess.communicate(input) docs:The optional input argument should be data to be sent to the child  process  ...  Note that if you want to send data to the processâ€™s stdin, you need to  create the Popen object with stdin=PIPE. Similarly, to get anything  other than None in the result tuple, you need to give stdout=PIPE  and/or stderr=PIPE too.i.e., to pass input to the subprocess, specify input parameter; to get a non-None o value, you must specify stderr=PIPE.In many case password prompt and password itself are not written to/read from a pipe but directly to/from terminal i.e., you might need a pseudo-tty to pass the password unless the command allows to set an option to accept password via stdin. You could use pexpect to interact with a child process using pty. See the first reason in  Why not just use a pipe (popen())?
