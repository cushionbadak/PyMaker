Well, I placed a breakpoint at a = 0.When I stop at the breakpoint, I want to evaluate __whiteList.The error is:Well, this is a mystery to me. Because I have the getter method and outside the class it works perfectly.Well, you may tell me that I could easily take no notice of it as it works outside the class. But I need it during the debugging. Could you comment on why I can't catch the value at the breakpoint?
When you prefix an attribute name with a double underscore, Python "mangles" the name by placing _<classname> before it.  This means that you would need to do:in order to access the __whiteList attribute.But it doesn't look like you should be using the __ in the first place.  You may just want to remove it and access whiteList directly:Or, you could use a single underscore:This sends a clear message that the _whiteList attribute is internal and should not be accessed directly from outside the class under normal circumstances.Also, if you decide to use either of these approaches, then there is really no purpose to your getWhiteList method since you can access the whiteList attribute directly.  I would remove it.  You generally want to avoid getters and setters in Python since 99% of the time they do nothing but clutter the class definition.
You can use print self.getWhiteList() or print self._Controller__whiteList.
