Natural Text
I'm working with an api which returns some data in the form of 01234⇒56789. Sometimes this data has only numbers which is not a problem but sometimes it returns ⇒ character. As I have to automate the filtering process of selecting the number after the arrow (non-ascii character) I have to know when the characters contains a non-ascii character. I used decode(utf-8) and it returns u'01234\u21d256789' . I tried split('\u21d2') but the string is not splitting. Any help is appreciated.
python3:python2:the key point in Python2 is to specify that you deal with an unicode string. In Python3 strings are unicode by default and there's bytes type
