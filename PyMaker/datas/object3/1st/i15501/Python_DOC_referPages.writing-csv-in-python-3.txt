Natural Text
I'm a extremely beginner in Python and all I want to do is to delete space in some sells in the table.But because of the error, I cannot write csv.I've already checked several related posts in stackoverflow, but still couldn't correct my cord.Errorline 27, in  csvWriter.writerow(corrected) TypeError: 'str' does not support the buffer interfaceCode
Apparently, csv.writer in Python 3 doesn't support binary output streams. This isn't mentioned in the documentation, and worse, it's backwards from the Python 2 recommendation of always opening the underlying files with b. Luckily for you, the fix is easy: just open the file in text mode instead of binary. The docs also recommend that you specify newline='' when opening the file, so you might as well do that too.
