I want to print a float value I got after doing some math as a string in the hh:mm format. Currently I have:(The time in this case is equal to a float like 9.888888888888886,or 09:50 (how I want it))and when I print I useAny way to achieve this effect consistently? With more advanced inputs my above code does not work properly, and outputs the wrong time.
Alternatively to using datetime, you can just use simple formatting with a bit of maths, eg:
Using datetime.timedelta:
Using divmod you get the remainder and the quotient of a division.Output:If you want the seconds too:
Assuming you want to turn 9.888888888888886 into 09:53, based on the former being floating point hours, and you don't want to worry about days, without a library you could simply do:With only the math module, tryYou might think that using the datetime module would help, but it's actually a bit fiddly. You can get a timedelta object out by passing in your fractional hours:But getting that into a time object or a datetime object to format is the tricky bit, you end up having to do something like(That uses a randomly picked date to get the time delta into a datetime to use)
