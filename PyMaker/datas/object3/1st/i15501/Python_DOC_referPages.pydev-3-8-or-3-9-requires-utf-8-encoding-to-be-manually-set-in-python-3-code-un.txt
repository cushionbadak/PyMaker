Running this code in Python 3.4 from Python shell works just fine:However, running it in Eclipse with Pydev 3.8 or 3.9 fails:In order for the code to run, replace:with:Note 1: The file valid.csv contains any character with accent, for example:Note 2: In Eclipse preferences > workspace, text file encoding is set to utf-8ReferenceThis StackOverflow question may be related
From the open() function documentation:encoding is the name of the encoding used to decode or encode the file. This should only be used in text mode. The default encoding is platform dependent (whatever locale.getpreferredencoding() returns), but any encoding supported by Python can be used.Emphasis mine. You should not rely on the default encoding; evidently the PyDev environment has been set to a locale where ASCII is the default codec.If you know up front that your CSV is encoded to UTF-8, explicitly set the codec when opening the file, and do not assume that the system on which you are running this has been configured with UTF-8 as the preferred text data codec.
