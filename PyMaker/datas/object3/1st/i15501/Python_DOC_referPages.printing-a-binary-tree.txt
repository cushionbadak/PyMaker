I just started working with classes in Python and I am at a roadblock trying to print a binary tree that I created. Here is the code I have:The first part represents the root of the tree and the add_node function adds a node in the tree. I created a new instance for the root of the tree:Tree = Node(6)The problem that I am facing is printing the tree. If I just say print Tree, I get this:Somebody told me that I have to create a function to actually print the tree and this function looks like the function that's creating a new node but so far I wasn't able to do that. Any help please?!
You can add the __str__ method to determine how your node object reacts when used as a string, i.e. str(Node(6)) . This is useful if you want to give out a string representations in print statements etc. without calling methods directly.Edit:While __str__() returns bytes, __unicode__() returns characters. __unicode__() is actually supposed to replace __str__() , so it's actually recommended to use __unicode__() instead (in Python 2.x there's both for compatibility reasons).A 3rd way to represent your object is __repr__() which is used for less formal string representations but rather for debugging etc. The returned string should look like a valid Python expression that could be used to recreate an object with the same value. For more information have a look at the language reference.
Yes you need to add a function to create a function to print the value at the node. The function can be as simple asAnd you can now print using
