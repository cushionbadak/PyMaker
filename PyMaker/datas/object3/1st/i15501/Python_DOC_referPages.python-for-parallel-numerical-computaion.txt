i am working on a python application which involves large set of numerical data. the data is segregated into groups in first step and then the group can be independently computed.i tried using threading.Thread() but soon realised its of no use due to gil.i also tried multiprocessing.Process() but all it does is creates new instances of my parent process and not subprocess (implemantation similar to threads just replace Thread by Process)is there any other way i can implement parallel processing in my situation?number of independent computations are in thousands.
On Python3 you can use the concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor to run several independent tasks in parallel.On Python2 you can use the multiprocessing.Pool class to achieve same result.
