Natural Text
I'm trying to add together strings where each letter has been converted to ASCII and then added together accordingly. So for example, adding together the strings "goodbye" "hello" I'd like to convert each letter to ascii then add them together like so:In this instance, "goodbye" must be interchangeable, i.e. user inputted. This is the code I've generated so far:This code doesn't work. It just seems to add the first character of input1 to every character in input2, an innumerate amount of times.The count is in there as I'd like the loop to stop after each character in input1 has been added to the loop of input2. 
You are looping over all of input2 for each character in input1, because you nested the loops.Use the zip() function instead to pair up letters:where zip() will stop iterating once the shortest of the two strings is done. Since input1 has been extended to repeat until it is at least as long as input2, that means you end up processing all characters of input2, and no more, unless input1 was longer to start with.Instead of manually repeating input2, you can also use itertools.cycle() to cycle through all characters in input1 indefinitely:Demo of the latter approach, with some extra formatting to illustrate what is going on:
