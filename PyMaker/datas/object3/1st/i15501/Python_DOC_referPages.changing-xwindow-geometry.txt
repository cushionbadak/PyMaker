I have two programs, first's got a XWindow and I get its xid, then in the second one I want to do some operations (eg changing size, position, etc..) on that window (xid as a XWindow). I use ctypes for Python3. The funfact is that XResizeWindow(display, xid, 320, 240) returns..yes..1, but of course the window geometry is the same as before.
As @Andrey Sidorov said I have to call XFlush() before display closing. Now works.
