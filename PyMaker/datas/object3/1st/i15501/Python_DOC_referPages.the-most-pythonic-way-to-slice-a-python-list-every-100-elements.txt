This question already has an answer here:Slice a binary number into groups of five digits                    7 answers                I have a list contains many elements. I want to slice it every 100 elements to a list of several lists.For example:b should then be [[0,1,2,...99],[100,101,102,...199],[200,201,...,255]].What's the most pythonic and elegent way to do that?
This should do the trick:range takes an optional third step argument, so range(0, n, 100) will be 0, 100, 200, ....
