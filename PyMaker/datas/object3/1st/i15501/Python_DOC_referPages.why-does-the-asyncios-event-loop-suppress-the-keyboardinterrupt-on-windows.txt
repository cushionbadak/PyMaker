I have this really small test program which does nothing apart from a executing an asyncio event loop:When I run this program on Linux and press Ctrl+C, the program will terminate correctly with a KeyboardInterrupt exception. On Windows pressing Ctrl+C does nothing (tested with Python 3.4.2). A simple inifinite loop with time.sleep() raises the KeyboardInterrupt correctly even on Windows:Why does the asyncio's event loop suppress the KeyboardInterrupt on Windows?
This is a bug, sure.See issue on python bug-tracker for the problem solving progress.
There is workaround for Windows. Run another corouting which wake up loop every second and allow loop to react on keyboard interruptExample with Echo server from asyncio doc
If you just want to exit the program and don't need to catch the KeyboardInterrupt, the signal module provides a simpler (and more efficient) workaround:
