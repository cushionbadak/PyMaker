This question already has an answer here:Python3 - reload() can not be called on __import__ object?                    1 answer                I know this might sound like a really stupid question but whatever. I've made a small script in Python and I've made some changes while in a shell. Normally, on an OS X computer (It's running Python 2.7), I would simply type in reload(the_module) and it would reload my module that includes the changes that I have made. However, when I am reloading the module here (on windows python v. 3.4), it simply gives me this:And then when I type in imp.reload(my_module), it simply says that the function is deprecated. I can't seem to find what the new function (or it's equivalent) would be anywhere so if someone can help me that would be great! :)
The imp module was deprecated in Python 3.4 in favor of the importlib module.  From the documentaion for the imp module:Deprecated since version 3.4: The imp package is pending deprecation  in favor of importlib.So, you should be using the reload function from there:
