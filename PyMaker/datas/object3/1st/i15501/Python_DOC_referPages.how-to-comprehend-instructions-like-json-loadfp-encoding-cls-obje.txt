I recently came across this when reading the Python official documentation for json.load:May I know how should I comprehend this?For example, if I want to set the parameter parse_float to be 3, how should I construct the argument?Also, what does [, ....] mean? Why is there a comma preceding the formal parameters?
The square brackets […] is a common metalanguage notation used to denote an optional component of a syntax in documentation and manuals.  "Optional" here means you can either omit or keep everything inside the brackets (but not a subset of it).  It is in some sense analogous to (…)? in regular expressions.The usage predates Python: you can find it in various Unix manpages.  It is not part of Python's syntax, though you will find it in many docs.When the documentation says:Formally, it means that both of the following are acceptable:For your example:Formally, it means any of the following are acceptable:However, the documentation is not very precise with the notation: it's fine to use keyword arguments to skip any of the parameters that you don't care because of the way arguments in Python work, e.g.:In fact, if you look at the same documentation for Python 3 you see that they chose to use a much clearer notation:json.loads(s, encoding=None, cls=None, object_hook=None, parse_float=None, parse_int=None, parse_constant=None, object_pairs_hook=None, **kw)
The parameters are keyword arguments. You can use them like this:Output:For parse_float, the value of 3 makes no sense. Read the documentation:parse_float, if specified, will be called with the string of every JSON float to be decoded. By default, this is equivalent to float(num_str).
