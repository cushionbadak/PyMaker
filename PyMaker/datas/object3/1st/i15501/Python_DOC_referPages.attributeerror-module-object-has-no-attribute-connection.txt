The beginning of my code is:But my error is:I tried changing my .py name and my my database name but nothing is working. Please help if you can. 
sqlite3.connection does not exist.  The function you are looking for is called sqlite3.connect:Also, you should never use str.format or similar tools to insert values into a query.  From the docs:Usually your SQL operations will need to use values from Python  variables. You shouldn’t assemble your query using Python’s string  operations because doing so is insecure; it makes your program  vulnerable to an SQL injection attack (see http://xkcd.com/327/ for  humorous example of what can go wrong).Instead, use the DB-API's parameter substitution. Put ? as a  placeholder wherever you want to use a value, and then provide a tuple  of values as the second argument to the cursor's execute() method.  (Other database modules may use a different placeholder, such as %s or  :1.)
sqlite3 module does not have attribute named "connection" it does however have an attribute named connect. You should try 'connection = sqlite3.connect('practice1.db')'
I see a couple of possible mistakes:From the file path, I guess that you are on window. Well, you need to change the file path: C:\\Users\\Mrs Rose\\Desktop\\ to avoid to be confused as an escaped character.On my IDE, the sqlite3 module does not have the method connection.. maybe connect?
