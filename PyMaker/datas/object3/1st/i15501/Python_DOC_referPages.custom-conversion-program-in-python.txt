I would like to do something like as follows:So, in the above example, when you type hello, it gives back @(&&!, and vise versa.(I would perfer it in Python, but it doesn't have to be.)I would like to make a small utility of this sort. Can anyone help? Thanks!EDIT: "Basically I would like to be able to assign some letters a unique character. Then, when you run the utility, it asks for your input. Then you type what you want in any order. Using the example above: "hello"="@(&&!" , "elloh"="(&&!@" , "looleh"="&!!&(@" and so forth."
In Python2, you could use str.translate:Or, you could use unicode.translate:Lutz Horn's answer shows how you could build a single table which can perform both the forward and backward translation.In Python3, string.maketrans has been replaced by bytes.maketrans:
Use the existing small utility tr.In the following example, every uneaven line (1, 3, 5, 7) is input, every even line (2, 4, 6, 8) is output.
