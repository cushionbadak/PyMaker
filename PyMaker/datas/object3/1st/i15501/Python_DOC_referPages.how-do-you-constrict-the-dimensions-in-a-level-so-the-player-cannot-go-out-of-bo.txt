I've posted a few times and I'm stuck once more, I tried using an if statement to calculate where the boundaries of the map are but its not working. Here are the two files I'm working in:gui.pyplayer.pyThank you for your time and help.
You've written some boundary-checking code in your __init__ method:But this only gets run once, at initialization time. It doesn't get run every time you change the x or y values in the future.You could solve this by moving it into a method:… and then, every time someone adjusts the value, they have to call that method:But that can be tedious—and error-prone, because it's pretty easy to forget to call fit_in_bounds. This kind of thing is exactly what @property is for: you can make it so that every time x or y gets set, fit_in_bounds gets called automatically.Now your SimpleGUI can just use self.player.x the same as before—but every time you do self.player.x -= self.player.speed, it will automatically make sure the player is still in bounds.
Something like this:Where the edges represent the edges of the maps.
This is not complete but will give you a start.  You should place everything to do with a player in the class.  So movement, bounds checking, etc. should all be in the Player class.  There are some hard-wired numbers for bounds checking that will have to be passed to the Player class and some problems with hitting the actual edge, but this is all I have time for.  Also note that a loop replaces all of the create_rectangle statements in your code and only one function is used for a keypress, with the letter passed to the function.  And the "movement_dict" may be overkill as simple if statements would work as well.  HTH
