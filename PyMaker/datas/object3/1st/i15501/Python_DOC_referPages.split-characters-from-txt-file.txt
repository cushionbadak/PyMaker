Natural Text
I am facing a problem with split characters from text file and find their frequencies. I have write this code but it founds only the words.I want the letters in a A-Z dictionary.
You can use collections.Counter and string.ascii_letters to get your letter count. The use of string.ascii_letters will allow you to only count letters, and not punctuation, etc.
If you want to iterate through letters individually, no need for split. Strings are directly iterable....Although, this will also count whitespace such as " ". If you want only letters, you might iterate through the words, and then iterate through each character in the word.Incidentally, Python already has a Counter class, so you don't necessarily need to construct a frequency dict manually.
