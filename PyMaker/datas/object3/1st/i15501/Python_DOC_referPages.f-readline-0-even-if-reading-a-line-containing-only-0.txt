Natural Text
I do not have trouble setting variables in the program with the var = f.readline() function, but I am having trouble with the if statement when it comes to reading out of a text file. I am trying to see if a 0 is in a text file and every time I use the if f.readline() == '0': it acts as if it does not equal 0.Example of my script below:My code would come out as The variable is not 0Why is this? And how can I use an if statement with the readline function?
The readline method does not remove trailing newlines from lines.  You need to do this manually:Otherwise, myvar will be equal to "0\n", which is not equal to "0".Also, you forgot to close the file by calling the close method:Of course, using a with-statement would be better:with will automatically close the file when control leaves its code block.
