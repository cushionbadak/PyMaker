Natural Text
I use regex to detect numbers from "0" to "999 999 999" inside a string in Python.The results are :print(wk_ptrn) displays : ['114 893']print(non_wk_ptrn) displays : [' 893'] (with a space before the first digit)The non_working_pattern is "\d{1,3}(\s\d{3}){0,2}" detects 1 to 3 digits [0 to 999]detects any white space followed by 3 digits [" 000" to " 999"]is a quantifier so I can detect "0" (quantifier = 0) to "999[ 999][ 999]" (quantifier = 2).I don't understand why "\d{1,3}(\s\d{3}){0,2}" doesn't work .Can you please help me figure out the mistake ?Thank you. Regards.
You are almost there, but you should change it as follows:The ?: makes the group non-capturing so that findall will return the entire matches, and not just the groups. As stated by the linked docs:If one or more groups are present in the pattern, return a list of groups
