Natural Text
Is there an easy way to format a dictionary in python for nice output?I am learning how to interact with an API/XMLRPC in python at the moment. After making a request, I get a dictionary back formatted like the following:This is a wall of text, easily a few pages. Is there an easy way to display this data nicely, or perhaps just to output the name of each category on one line?edit:Here is an attempt to print it via pprint, which ended up omitting a lot of the data:
You can use pprint.pprint:To display just the category names you can do:Alternatively you can use json.dump(s) + the JSON viewer of your choice (plenty of online choices available, or just your local browser).EditProcessing in a recursive manner:
This will give you a list of category names:OUTPUT:['Headboard', 'Mattress']
If the data is actually a dictionary of dictionaries, such that it is in the form: { "key_1": {}, "key_2": {} ... "key_n": {} }then the following code will create a list of the names of categories:OUTPUT:['Headboard', 'Mattress']
