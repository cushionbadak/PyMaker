I have a cdef function that has amongst its parameters a function. I am trying to generate a python 'wrapper' function that will call it. I know that defining a function as cpdef() I would be able to get access to a python version of the function. However, if I do this, I will get an error (as expected) that says that python cannot recognize the function definition I provided.  Any suggestions?My original function is domain specific and quite long but I think that the following example captures what I am after. I would have the following cdef() function defined,and I would like to define something like the following so that I can call it in python:
If you actually need to this (might think about refactoring so you don't) - you need some kind of PyObject to store the c function pointer.The PyCapsule api provides a way of passing opaque pointers around in python space.  Could do something like this, I'm probably missing some safety checksUsage
