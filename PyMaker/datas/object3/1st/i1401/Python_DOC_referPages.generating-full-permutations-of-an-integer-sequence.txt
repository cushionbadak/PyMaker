I need to find a way (in python) to produce all permutations of integers of (+1)s and (-1)s according to given x legnth. For example if x=1, it should be [(+1),(-1)]; x = 2 -->[[(+1)(+1)],[(+1)(-1)],[(-1)(+1)],[(-1)(-1)]] and so on. Actually, itertools.product() function does this work for string permutations. This is what I can do:However, I found no way to assign integers to strings afterwards. Is that possible to do this for integers using itertools or something else?
If I understood correctly you could do:OutputThe product function receives an iterable, from the documentation:Cartesian product of input iterables.
You can really do string permutions :
