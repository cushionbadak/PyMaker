I have a list of lists and I want to calculate first the size of each sub-list and then to see whether all those sub-lists have size 2. Therefore,The list lengths contains the size of each sub-list. How can I check whether all my sub-lists have size two or not? In my example it should fail.
Use all with a generator expression.Or if the length does not have to be two specificly:
You can identify the number of unique elements in a list by converting it to a set.  If the length of the set is 1, and the only element of the set is 2, then you know that every list had length 2.
Using all() and map(). Mapping len with my_list to find length of the sub-list.Output:If you want to check all the length is identical.Output:
You could do it in one line:First I map an on-fly function that check if the length is two. Then I apply all that returns True if all values are True, else False.In production code, you could use assertResults:
You can just run through your list of lengths and check what their lengths are. If all the items in lengths are 2, then true otherwise false:Alternatively, you could just use the any function.
