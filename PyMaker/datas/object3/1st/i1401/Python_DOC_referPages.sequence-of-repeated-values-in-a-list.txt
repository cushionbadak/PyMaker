I have problems with a program, I hope someone can help me to fix this. Basically I have a random generated list with 20 values, and I want to place between brackets the values that are repeated (for example if the list is [1,2,2,4,5] it should display 1 ( 2 2 ) 4 5 )Now here's my code that works only if there is no repeated value in the end, because the list index goes out of range. How can I fix this?

Not the pretiest but will do it:
Just check for "last element" before your inner while loop.
convert the list of number to a string then you can use this function.split it if you need the list back again.
This is another option using just basic list:
