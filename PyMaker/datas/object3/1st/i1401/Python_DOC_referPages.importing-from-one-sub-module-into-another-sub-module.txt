I'm struggling with python's imports.I have my repository for my python projects in which I have a collection of more or less independent programmes and tools. There are a few sub-folders which contain the single scripts and programmes; some can be used as helper routines for others scripts as well. Assume that my folder structure looks like:Now assume that I want to use prog3.py directly but need call filter1.py. How can I import it into prog3.py?The only way I managed to import it was giving adding to the path which needs modification of sys.path.As I know the relative way the modules are located, is there another way similar to what is described in python's module import guide (here and here) without changing sys.path?
Assuming you need to call filter1.py for importing shared functions or classes, I would use relative imports as described in the python tutorial.filter1.pyprog3.pyI would then run prog3.py with -m argument to resolve relative imports but without extension:Current directory must be the one containing root (or be defined into PYTHONPATH variable).I don't modify sys.path. Is that what you are looking for?
