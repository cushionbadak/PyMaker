Natural Text
I'm doing a project and got stuck in this part. The project consists in a program that matches individuals retrived from two diferent files (two .txts). They match if some atributes are the same between them (for instance, region, hours available, etc).The thing is, the given files have the individuals ordered by lines and in phrases, splited by commas (name, region, ...). I must convert the informations individually in lists so i can acess their elements. However i cant. To explain myself easily, the given part of the txt with individuals information is organized like this:function:So far, i could only extract the first individual. I cant do a "loop" for the rest of them to be analyzed. Any ideas?Thanks in advance. Hope i could give an idea of what im trying to solve.
Firstly, could you please include some sample data. Secondly, why not use for loops?Thirdly, readline() usually stops at \n, so we can assume, that \n is at the end of your line where strip() will remove it, hence no need for replacing it.The general strategy I apply in the following two functions is:Read the Textfile into an array of linesExtract the Atrributes by splitting at predefined characters and put them into a list of dicts.Assuming you are running Python 3 (sorry for my bad exception handling):You can replace the "=" by any char that is in between your attribute's name and  its valuePS: I had these functions already lying around, regular expressions might make them much more elegant.
