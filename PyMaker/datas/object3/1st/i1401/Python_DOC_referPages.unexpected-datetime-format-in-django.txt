I have a django project in which one of my models has a dateField named start_time. In my views.py I created a DetailView, and try to retrieve the timestamp like:On my Raspberry Pi, it gives the expected result.However on my Ubuntu 18 computer it gives:How can I get my Ubuntu machine to give the same (expected) result as the Raspberry Pi?They both run Django 2.1.3.
The value %b is locale-dependent (see the relevant strftime doc).Check the locale on both machines; it's likely they're at least subtly different. Ensuring both are using the same locale would be ideal in any case, but particularly for dates, you might consider sticking to locale-independent numerical values instead.
What finally fixed my problem was to, on the computer giving unexpected results, add to ~/.bashrc. Then open a new terminal or call source ~/.bashrc.An alternative is to include in views.py of the app.You can check your current locale settings by calling locale from the terminal. In my case LC_ALL was blank.
