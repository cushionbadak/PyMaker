Natural Text
I'm working on a text pattern problem. I've the following input - I need to remove all the possible punctuation (delimiters) from the input term. Basically I need the following output from the input term - I also need to store (in any format (object, dict, tuple etc.)) the delimiter and the position of the delimiter before removing the delimiters. Example of the output (If returned as tuple) - I'm able to get the output using the following python code - But how do I store the delimiter and delimiter position (in the most efficient way) before removing the delimiters?
You can simply walk once through term and collect all nessessary infos on the way:Output:See: string.ascii_lettersstring.digitsYou can useand inside the iteration:to get a list of tuples instead of the dictionary:
You could do something like this, adding whatever other delimiters you need to the list delimsAnd then do you re.sub command to replace them.
