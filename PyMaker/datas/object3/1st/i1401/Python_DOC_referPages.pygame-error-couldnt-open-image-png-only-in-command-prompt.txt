I've got a very simple python program I wrote to learn pygame, and among other things I use an image.When I run the program with PyCharm, or when I run it by double-clicking on the file, it works fine. However, if I try to run it through the command prompt, I get the following error:This is the line in my code it refers to:The image "racecar.png" is located in exactly the same directory as the program.The confusing part is that my code seems to be fine since there are no errors when I run it by double-clicking.Can post full code if necessary. Thanks in advance
The fact, that the file is in the same directory as the program doesn't matter. If you don't provide a path the program will look for the file in the working directory which might be a total different one.If you want to use a specific directory add your path to the filename. A flexible approach would be to determine the path of the current file and use that. Python has a way to do that with os.path.dirname.In this case it would lead to the following code:
