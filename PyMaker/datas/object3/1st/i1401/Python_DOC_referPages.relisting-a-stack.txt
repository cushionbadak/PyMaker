Here are my codes for generating 3 random drinks from a stack of 7 drinks. After popping the 3 randomized drinks, I will like to know how I can relist my stack.For example, my output for the 3 random drinks are:How do I print out the 4 remaining drinks in the stack like so:
Add a __str__ method to the class that will construct the list then just print the instance... In your example code, you pop an item off the stack even if it does not meet your criteria - just comment out the else clause
