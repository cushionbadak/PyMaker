I'd like to create groups by a custom ID, and then eliminate groups that are duplicates in some columns.For example toHere I grouped by id and then i removed 3 because, if we only consider columns A and B, they are identical, while group 2 has some duplicated rows but its not an exact copy.I've tried looping over groups but its very slow even tho there is only around 12.000 groups. One possible complication is that groups have variable sizes.Here is the solution ive been working on but its taking way to long with no aparent duplicated hits (which i know exists in this db)
Using agg tuple and duplicatedMore info : Right now , everything within the group is in one tuple Update 
You can use the unique_everseen recipe from the itertools docs (also found in the more_itertools library), together with pd.concat and groupby:
