So I think you are trying to ask for the first three elements in the list, indexes 0, 1, 2. So while what you are doing is valid, this way is better.Slice - common function each python programmer should know: Python Docs for "Slice: https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#sliceDjango Docs for "Limiting Querysets": https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/topics/db/queries/#limiting-querysetsWill grab first three elements starting on the not entered 0th index. The brackets could have also been [0:3].
