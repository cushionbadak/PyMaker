Natural Text
I am totally new to subprocess and need to be able to send a variable from one python file to another using this library.I have a little idea of how to send the data from the master file (something like this?):But how do I call that variable in the other file?Unfortunately, I cannot use any other module because of the nature of my project.
Your description is a little vague, but to answer your question as I understand it:if your slave.py is executed every time you need to pass it a variable, you can pass it as an argument on the cli.In slave.py you can then get this variable from sys.argv:If your slave.py is running continuously there are several ways to communicate between processes on a same computer system:Remote Procedure Calls - RPCShared Memory - See this SO threadUsing stdin as suggested in the comments (only for simple data structures like strings, int etc)
