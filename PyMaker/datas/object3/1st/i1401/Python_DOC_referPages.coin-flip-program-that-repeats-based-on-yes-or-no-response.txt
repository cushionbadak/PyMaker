I'm very new to python and want to create a basic coin flip program that will repeat based on user input.I was able to create the randomized response for the coin flip but when it asks if I want to repeat it it dosn't generate a new randomized response and instead repeats the same response. how do i get it to restart the program if i input "y".
Your program keep giving you the same result because you are randomizing the value coin variable outside the coin_flip() function. Therefore, it is only being randomized once, at the start of the program.To fix that, simply randomize the coin variable value at the start of coin_flip() function
You should be generating the random value within the coin_flip function. You only create it at the start of your script, so it is only ever created once.Move the line coin = random.randint(0,1) to the start of the coin_flip function.
If you dig around a bit in the random module you will find some interesting utilities that will make things like this very short and pretty. For examplewill give you a random heads or tails without all the extra if/elif logic. These kind of things will make your code easier to read, understand and maintain. For example you could do something like:
