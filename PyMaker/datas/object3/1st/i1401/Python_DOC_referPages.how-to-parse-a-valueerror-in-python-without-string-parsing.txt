I am running a programming and getting an expected ValueError output of:ValueError: {'code': -123, 'message': 'This is the error'}I cannot figure out how to parse this data and just take the code (or message) value. How can I just get the code value of the ValueError?I have tried the following:e.codeAttributeError: 'ValueError' object has no attribute 'code'e['code']TypeError: 'ValueError' object is not subscriptablejson.loads(e)TypeError: the JSON object must be str, bytes or bytearray, not 'ValueError'What is the pythonic way of doing this?EditThe one thing that does work is taking the string index, but I do not want to do this, as I feel it is not very pythonic.

ValueError is a dict type. So you can use    e.get("key")to reach any field inside dict.
You should get your values() directly from your dictionary not e. Try this one:
