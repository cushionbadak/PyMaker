To expand. I am interested in what's happening in the last 4 lines of the code below. I've looked at it for hours now and I can't figure out what's going on. Would appreciate some help.Code goes something like this:
dict[key] = value is syntactic sugar for dict.__setitem__(key, value). This is explained in the docs.Keys must be hashable, e.g. tuple. Values need not be, e.g. list. In your case, the key is a tuple and the value is a list. Parentheses are not required to define a tuple. So the following are all equivalent:Your example count_response[a, c, b] = [1, d] is equivalent to the following:
I sometimes use a complex number as a simple 2d vector as it supports addition.You could simplify this code by using a default dictionary, with a complex. Instead of:use defaultdict, which will create a default entry if the key doesn't already have a value. Then you want to add your new vector:
Thankyou everyone I think I understand now.So the dict key for Count_response will be unique combination of the a,c,b variables (in the actual code they are unique for each iteration of the loop), the value assigned to that will be the following list value (count of d value, d value)
