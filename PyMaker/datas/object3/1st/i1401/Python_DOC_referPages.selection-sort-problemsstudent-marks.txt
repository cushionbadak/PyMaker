Currently I have a list, which represent the student with their test scoresa = [['May', 81], ['Jack', 91], ['Mike', 52], ['Jeremy', 58], ['Mark', 71],['Sam',81],['Brian',61],['Yan',71]]I wish to use selection sort to sort the scores first then the student name in alphabetic order.I am a beginner and only know how to sort a normal list like will give: a = [1,13,23,64]My selection sort code is here:How can i sort the scores first then the name?  
The function min can be use in conjunction with a custom key:OutputThe key transforms each element of lst in a tuple where the first element is the score, and the second element is the name. Note that the above solution assumes you want the lowest scores first.FurtherHow does tuple comparison work in Python?As a side note, the complexity of selection sort is O(n^2), it will be best if you use the built in .sort method, complexity O(nlogn). Example of usage:Output
You can use numpy:
If you want to sort by scores first, names second, you can using itemgetter - this will be faster than using lambda and avoids using python function callwhich will result in:
