What is an elegant, Pythonic way to write lines of data that contain an embedded (quoted) list of comma separated values to a CSV file?I need to put quotes around a comma separated list so that Excel doesn't break the list into separate columns when looking at it with Excel.My function looks like this:Output looks like this:How do I get rid of the trailing ',' in the ip list?
Instead ofdoThis will give you a comma separated list that does not have a comma at the end. See the documentation of the join function for more info.You may also want to take a look at the CSV module. When using this module you only need to provide your list of data, and it will take care of formatting everything for you.
