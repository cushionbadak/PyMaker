Natural Text
I have a text file with a high-level structure as follows:I wish to open this text file, and parse for every instance of CATEG:, separating the content in between. However, I am having a lot of annoyance with the open method and how it deals with new lines in each line while reading.i.e. using f = open('mydata.txt', 'r') and then f.readlines() results in a lot of unnecessary new line operators and makes it annoying to split by the data structure above. Does anybody have any tips? Unfortunately, it is the data set that is annoying.
Try read().splitlines().For example:
Try following code:
Try This:
Write a little wrapper around your sequence that strips all the newlines:Then wrap your file object with it when you go to iterate:This will preserve your line-at-a-time reading of the file, instead of reading it all in at once, which read().splitlines() will do.
You can use itertools.groupby:
