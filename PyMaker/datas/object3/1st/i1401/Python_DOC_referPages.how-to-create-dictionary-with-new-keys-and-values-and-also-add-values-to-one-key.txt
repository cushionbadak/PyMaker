This question already has an answer here:How to convert list of key-value tuples into dictionary?                    4 answers                I want put a list of tuples into a dictionary like this:what i want to do is to add keys with multiple values dynamically.The list of tuples:The output should be like this:the labels should be the keys and  the tuples of data_points should be the valuesi want to create the dict so that the keys won't be repeated
Use setdefault:Or as an alternative, you could check if the key do not exists in the dictionary and set the corresponding value to the empty list:Output
.append is fine for this.If you don't want to define keys ahead of time:
Simply putting each tuple into the right list within the dict.   
As a more general purpose solution I'd recommend using a defaultdict:When a key is given to a defaultdict that does not exist, it will call the factory function you provide (in this case just list).
use defaultdict
