I'm converting a project (not originally mine) from python2 to python3.In one of the scripts I've:  This works on py2, but not on py3, which throws an error:Apart from the error, I'm also confused about the original syntax obj/list.Can you guys throw a light here?
This is due to the different behavior of the division operator between Python 2 and 3.You'll need to define the __truediv__ special method, rather than __div__, for Python 3. See the data models for Python 2 and Python 3 for more info.
It is likely that Primitive implements __div__ allowing it to be “divided” by another object (a list in this case). In Python 2 the operation x / y will use x.__div__(y) if it exists (and if it does not, then y.__rdiv__(x).In Python 3 this behaviour has changed.  To implement the / division operator you need to implement __truediv__.  This explains the difference you are observing.Presumably you have access to the source for Primitive. Simply patch its __div__ method to be __truediv__
