How can I acess the negative numbers in strings like this ('((-1,-5,-1),(3,1,-3),(4,-1))') I already tried  slicing and got  '-' and '5' instead of -5
If the string is a valid Python tuple, you could use ast.literal_eval:OutputOr, you could use regular expressions through the built-in re module:OutputThe pattern -?\d+ means match a group of digits (\d+) that can possibly be preceded by a minus sign (-?).
