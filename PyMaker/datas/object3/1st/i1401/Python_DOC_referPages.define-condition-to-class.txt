I am trying to define condition to class, if my object Does not meet the conditions:The conditions: all the organs is vectors, the shape of the vectors is the same.When I try to casting the object the function will return None.Thats what I tried so far:But I get this error:i wish the function will return None.
instead of
The CPython docs state for the __repr__ method state that The return value must be a string object.So returning None isn't going to work.If you're going to share your code with others, it might be better to code __repr__ to produce its coventional output:...this should look like a valid Python expression that could be used to recreate an object with the same value (given an appropriate environment)...And override __str__ to produce a representation that indicates the validity of the object instance (though note __str__ must also return a string).
