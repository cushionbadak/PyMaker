Natural Text
I am to write a regex which captures a string: "N letters followed by 2 or 3 digits", where N is passed as an argument of a function.What I did is this: "[a-zA-Z]{" + "{number}".format(number=N) + "}[0,9]{2,3}" but it's not right. Where's the mistake?For N=3, it should match: "abc12", "abc123" but not "a1", "abc1", "abc1234".
Your second block is only capturing the numbers 0 and 9, change it to a range:EDIT:To not capture something that doesn't match, you will want to add start and end conditions to your regex. This can be done in a few ways:Text AnchorsStart and end line designations if your pattern is to be by itself on a line:Where ^ represents a start of line and $ represents end of lineDesignating Not matchesYou can say to not match specific characters after the pattern:The ^ inside the brackets will say "Do not match these chars." I'm not familiar enough with lookaheads/lookbacks to give you a good answer using those, but the docs can be found here
You need to add anchors to your expression:See a demo on regex101.com.In general:
