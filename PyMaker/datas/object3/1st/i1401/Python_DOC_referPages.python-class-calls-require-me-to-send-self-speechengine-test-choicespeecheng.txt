I'm having some issues where whenever I make a call to one of my classes methods it's requiring me to specifically send the containing class with the call, where I would expect it to already know about it self. I'm sure this is user error but can not track it down.I've referenced python - self - required positional argument but i think i've got that covered.And then I would expect to callBut that returns the followingWhere as if i do it implicitly It returns the expected results no questions asked.I should also point out the same happens when i would assign it as follows.
Since initial_contact_msg is a method, you need to call it from an instance, not the Type. Your last attempt is almost right. To instantiate it, you need to do the following:"SpeechEngine" is the type class. When you create a new instance you need to call it like a function. This is similar to using the "new" keyword in other languages.When you have a static method, this can be called directly from the Type object:You can read more in the Python Documentation.
