Natural Text
I have a data file (.txt) containing some lines, each line as following:0  45  1  31  2  54  3  54  4  64With a white space before zero, two spaces between each two integers and a white space at the end. What I want is to have it like following:0 45 1 31 2 54 3 54 4 64I am trying everything (using Python) but I am not successful!Of course at the end I want to reform it to:45 31 54 54 64That is eliminating the numbers 0 to 4 as well. But this last step is maybe easier to do if I reach the first one.For example I have tried this:But yet in the `myfile_2' the string is not corrected.

You could use a regular expression  to match one or more spaces (' +', where + implies "one or more") and substitute them with a single space:
