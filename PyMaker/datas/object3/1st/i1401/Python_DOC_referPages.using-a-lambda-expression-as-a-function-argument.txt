I am having trouble understanding how lambda expressions work when they are used as function arguments. For example:replaces 'hi' and 'ya' with 'hello' and 'you', returningI am confused as to why this works because we never specified what values m takes and how the re.sub() function interprets this when the first argument is supposed to be a string.
From Python documentation:If repl is a function, it is called for every non-overlapping occurrence of pattern. The function takes a single match object argument, and returns the replacement string.You can think of lambdas as single-line functions as they're functionally equivalent, sobecomesand m is assigned as a function argument.
In addition to iBug's nice answer, you say why the first argument can work with a non-string object, this is also the case with timeit, and other stuff.Also, lambdas are equivalent to functions, so basically you're putting a function, even if you manually did a function and put the function name in it, it will work.Note: there's a non-regex no-module way of doing this thing:Demo:
