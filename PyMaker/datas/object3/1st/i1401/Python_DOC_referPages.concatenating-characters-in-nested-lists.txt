This question already has an answer here:How to join nested list of strings and get the result as new list of string?                    3 answers                I'm currently working with a datastructure that presents itself like this:I got this dataset from parsing a query string using this answer from SO: https://stackoverflow.com/a/17141441The query I parsed was:The problem is that it deals with individual characters which are appended to the list one by one. I need to get back to a structure like:I'm trying to wrap my head around the parser function to do this or do a post-process step to push the characters back together. Anyone know of a solution for this?
As a post-process step you could use itertools.groupby in a recursive function:OutputThis will create groups for lists and characters, if the group is one of characters use the built-in join function, else call the join function recursively.
