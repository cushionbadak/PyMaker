I want to extract certain variables from a dict and save them in a csv (sometimes, the variable key I am looking for might not exist. I am new to working with dicts, so I am not sure how to handle this).I am using the code below, which works, but somehow prints each character of the extracted variable to a new column (instead of all characters of the value in 1 cell).Also, I am not sure how it behaves when it does not find the key. Any suggesstions would be greatly appreciated: 
writerow method expects iterable and because string is iterable of single letters, it writes your word split by each characterYou probably want to use csv.DictWriter instead of csv.writer - at https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.DictWriter you can see documentation along with simple example(main difference: to writerow you'll pass whole dict instead of single value from it, also you'll need to provide fieldnames parameter - to determine order of columns)
