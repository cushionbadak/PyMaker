So I was trying to use OrderedDict inside json.dumps() and it started off working well. However, when trying to use the output directly inside a payload of an HTTP PUT request, it has these single quotes around it that I believe is screwing with the way the json is being interpreted at the receiving end.So how do I get around this and have it give me the output without the single quotes?Example:... gives an output such as:... when I want it to give me the meat, the json, like:... so that I can put that straight into myr = requests.post(url, data = out)... and be on my merry way.As an aside: is there something VERY basic about strings and string literals (whatever those are) that I am completely missing? My Python knowledge being self taught I am sure there are some gaps.EDIT:print(out)... gives{"name": 1, "value": 2}which is what I believe I want.EDIT2: json = out as mentioned in the selected answer did the trick thank you! However, since I am just starting out with coding in Python, I would love to know whether you have come across any articles/ documentation that might be handy for me to know so as to avoid similar issues in the future. Thanks once again everyone!
requests will encode the data for you. You should be able to pass the OrderedDict directly to post:I hope this helps.EDIT: I realized there's another answer that may help you and it suggests using json instead of data when making the post call.Documentation:http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/quickstart/#more-complicated-post-requests
