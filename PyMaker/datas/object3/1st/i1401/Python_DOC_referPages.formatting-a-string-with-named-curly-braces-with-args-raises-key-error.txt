Natural Text
I have this string: my_str='a pi{ece} of t{ext}'and these args: args=['ece', 'ext']When calling: >>> my_str.format(*args)It gives me: KeyError 'ece'Any help?
I think what you're looking for is fstring. Fstring was added to python 3.6. If you really want to use .format()or Please google fstring and .format()Fstring is generally faster
