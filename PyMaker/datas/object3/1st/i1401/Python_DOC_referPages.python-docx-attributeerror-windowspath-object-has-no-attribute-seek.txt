I want to insert about 250 images with their filename into a docx-file.My test.py file:After Debugging I got this Error:How can i avoid this Error?
Have you tried using io.FileIO?I encountered the same error using PyPDF2 when passing a file path to PdfFileReader. When I wrapped the PDF file in FileIO like so FileIO(pdf_path, "rb") the error went away and I was able to process the file successfully.
In my case, changing the '/' for '\' in the path did the trick. Ex: "C:/Users/Admin/Desktop/img" (which I believe is probably what wrapping it in FileIO does, but in my case doing this didn't work)You can also achieve that using as explained here https://stackoverflow.com/a/2953843/11126742
