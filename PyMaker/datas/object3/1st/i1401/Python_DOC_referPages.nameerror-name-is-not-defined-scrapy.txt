I am working on a web crawler using scrapy 1.5 and am getting an error that row_list is not defined when it is. I believe this is a global issue but am not sure what would be the proper way to correct this. The reason I am keeping the code like this is because I need sublists with all the details in a row. So I can use the first element in the list as a key and join everything else after the first element into 1 element stored in the second position. I have to yield a dictionary and need it in this format. any help would be great.
It seems that the issue is that you're calling del row_list and, after that, you try to update final_dict with that name.Check out this example:When you call del row_list, the row_list name is gonna be removed from the namespace, thus you can't access it.More about the del statement: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#del
