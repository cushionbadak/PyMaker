Does anyone know how to get the discord username (and discriminator) of someone given its ID?This code does not return a username:Thank you ! :)
What is bot? I guess it's your discord.Client object? Then, your call to get_user_info returns an object of class discord.User. Furthermore, get_user_info is a coroutine.You will have to write something like this:As @squaswin pointed out in the comments: Keep in mind that await statements have to be inside async functions. Otherwise a SyntaxError will be raised.
