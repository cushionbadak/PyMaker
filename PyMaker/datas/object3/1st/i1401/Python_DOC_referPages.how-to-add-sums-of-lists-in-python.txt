sum of num_list_1 = 10sum of num_list_2 = 26how would I be able to sum together num_list_1 and num_list_2.I've tried doing it myself however as it is a list it wont let me concatenate them. 
Get the sum of each list individually, and then sum the both scalar values to get the total_sum:
You could sum the concatenation of the two lists:This is what I get using the python console:Or you could just sum the sums:which leads to the same output but in a probably faster way:
if you have several lists (more than 2) you could sum the sums by applying map to the results:
+ acts as concatenating in case of lists, so sum(num_list_1 + num_list_2) will help
First Define both liststhen use Sum() For Both listAlso You Can Do This :
You can use:
sum takes an iterable, so you can use itertools.chain to chain your lists and feed the resulting iterable to sum:
