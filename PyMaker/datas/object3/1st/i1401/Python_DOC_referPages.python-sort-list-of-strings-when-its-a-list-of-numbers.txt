This question already has an answer here:Why does “return list.sort()” return None, not the list?                    6 answers                Newbie here with the python interpreter.Why am I not able to sort this list of strings?Why isn't python able to sort this list of string for me?
list.sort() mutates the list in place, instead of returning a new list.
Firstly, list.sort() manipulate the list in place, which means when you call it, the list is already sorted, and the default return value is NoneSecondly, above is sort by string value, you want to sort by the numerical value, you can use key=int. Remember you can replace int with any custom methods:Last but not least, you should not use list as a variable name, as it's builtin function name already.
list.sort sorts the list in place. Some Python programmers would prefer sorted which will return a sorted list and leave the initial list untouched
