The loop goes through list of numbers. I need to use map to accumulate the sum of all element[0] in another list's element[0] , sum of all element[1] in element[1].Input:result_list must aggregate the sum of all element[0] in each list to result_list[0].Outputr is this, I omit names and calculate average of each 'column'.
This is one approach.Ex:Output:
You could do something like this, assuming each element of l is a list of one string:Output
A oneliner can do the job:If you need first to parse the strings with the numbers:And after that, just:
csv.reader + zip + statistics.meanI omit names and calculate average of each 'column'You don't need to construct a large list of lists from your data. You can use an iterator and use sequence unpacking with zip. To calculate the mean, you can use statistics.mean:
Use list comprehension :[sum(sub_list) for sub_list in l]
