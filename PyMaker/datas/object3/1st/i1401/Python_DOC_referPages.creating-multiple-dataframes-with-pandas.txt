Is there a way to use a 'for loop' or something similar to run through the code to create multiple DataFrames with Pandas that I can assign to separate variables, instead of hardcoding both DataFrames? If I add new tickers it wouldn't be efficient to keep hardcoding them.
You could certainly use a variable instead of hard-coding the ticker:To create a loop, you could do something like:The tricky thing is storing the df variable in each iteration of the loop instead of overwriting it. One solution is to store each DataFrame in a list or dictionary.ORIf you're feeling really fancy you could also use a list comprehension / dictionary comprehension to accomplish this in one line:Additional note: You might also consider combining the frames into one large DataFrame, perhaps a tidy-style DataFrame where "ticker" is a field for each row.
