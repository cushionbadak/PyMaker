In python2, it's possible to use print 123 and print(123), and both assert True and assert(True).In python3, why can't I use print 123 while being able to use assert True?
Short answer: assert is not a function.Long answer:When python3 came out, it changed(or, removed) print sth syntax, because print became a builtin function so it should be called.Although assert can be used like a function(assert(True)), it isn't a function - it actually is a syntax in python3 grammar, like print in python2 was.Unlike print, of which the type is class 'builtin_function_or_method' when you execute type(print), when you try to type(assert) or type(if) you'll get this:So you can't use print 123 while using assert True because these two are different.
In Python 2, both print and assert are statements (like if, while, def, etc). In this case, the parens are not interpreted as the function call operator but just as plain parens, forcing the evaluation of their content, which in this case is a no-op and is actually considered unpythonic.In Python 3, print() became a function so you must call it. assert is still a statement so it works just like in Python 2.
