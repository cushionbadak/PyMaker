Natural Text
I have the following structure:I want to get an output that adds the probabilities of each of the id there and return the one that has the highest score.For instance for 3 and 10:The return should be: (3, 1.2)This though overrides the keys so only the last seen key and its value gets stored. When inserted a new key I don't want it to be overwritten, I want the value to be added to the existing key. 
You can collect the values in a collections.Counter and then get the most_common(1):About your existing code: You are not actually summing, but just overwriting the previous value, if any, with =. Intead, you should use += and initialize the value with 0 if it does not exist yet. (collections.Counter will do this automatically) Then use max to get the max element.
