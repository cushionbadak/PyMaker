I tried using the random.gauss function in Python to get a random value between a range. The gauss function takes mean, standard deviation as parameters. Shouldn't the return value be between [mean +- standard deviation]?Below is the code snippet:Output of the code:
"Shouldn't the return value be between [mean +- standard deviation]?"No. For the Gaussian distribution slightly less than 32% of the outcomes will be more than one standard deviation away from the mean in either direction.  There is no fixed range that contains 100% of the outcomes.
Gaussian distribution only concern about the probability of a value to deviate from the mean by a certain amount. So, any value is possible, it just that the probability is very low for some range of values
A sample size of 50 is not enough for the sample mean and sample SD to be good estimators of the population mean/SD. Law of large numbers to the rescue:(https://repl.it/@millimoose/SiennaFlatBackground)To get random numbers between 3 and 5, use random.uniform(3,  5) instead.
