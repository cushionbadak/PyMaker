What's the best optimal way to approach ?SOLUTION:now, header1 and header2 can be accessed as list.
Assuming you read the JSON into a variable d (maybe using json.loads), you could iterate over the keys (sorted?) and build the lists with the keys of current value:
Fixing your json structure:And then loading and creating lists:Gives:
Once you load your json, you can get the list you want for any key by doing something like the following (headers variable below is a placeholder for your loaded json).

For example:
You can use recursion:Output:
