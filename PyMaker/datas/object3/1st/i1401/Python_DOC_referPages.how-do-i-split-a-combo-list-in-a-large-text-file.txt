Natural Text
my problem is that I have a very large database of emails and passwords and I need to send it to a mysql database.The .txt file format is something like this:My idea is to make a loop that takes the line and make it a variable, search the ":" and pick the text before, send it to the db and then the same with the after part of the line. How do I do this?
Short program with some error handling:Create demo data file:Parse data / store:        Output:Edit: According to What characters are allowed in an email address? - a ':' may be part of the first part of an email if quoted. This would theoretically allow inputs as which will get errors with this code. See Talip Tolga Sans answer for how to break down the splitting differently to avoid this problem. 
This can be done through simple split() method of the strings in python.To accomodate  @PatrickArtner's complex password fail this can be done:str.find() returns the first occurrence location of the given character in the given string. Emails can have : in their name field but they can not have @. So first locating the @ then locating the : would give you the correct separation locations. After that splitting the string will be piece of cake.
Open file as context manager (with open(...)), You can iterate over the lines with a for loop, then regex match(re Module)(or just split on ":") and use sqlite3 to insert your values to DB.So the file:Sqlite3 Docs: https://docs.python.org/2/library/sqlite3.html
