I am developing a program that does a polling and I need the polling to be done in a separate process for performance reasons.The program is pretty long, but I managed to reduce it to a minimum so it easier to understand. It is a two states machine, one idle and the other prints values that the separate process has put in a queue.So the problem is that when order the multiprocessing process to Start, everything freezes. Only the process is running like crazy and the program does not react.Please look at the code commentaries for further explanation.Would you help me out with this?I edited the code, changed the process.run() to process.start() and now it tells me this error as well as opening a new tkinter instance:
A process is started by calling start() on it, which will setup the process run method to run in a separate process.So try replacing: self.slave_process.run() with self.slave_process.start()It's explained here :https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html?highlight=process#multiprocessing.Process
