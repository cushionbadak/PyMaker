I'm trying to convert this string data that looks a lot like a list containing dictionaries, into an actual data of said data type or any other form that I can retrieve information. To put it into multiple lines for better view, the string looks like this.I've tried the common json.loads(a, strict=False) and json.loads(a) but it had errors as below. I hoped the "{\bid\:8,\acc_num\:135}" part to be lumped into a string (as a value to the key data) but maybe it didn't happen... Thought it might be the \ in the string causing this problem but a=a.replace('\','')is not valid as well (SyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal error). 
As others have mentioned, you could use ast.literal_eval() to do this—but you'll need to use it twice, something like what's shown below which uses a dictionary to "unescape" any standard string backslash escaped characters encountered (while leaving others alone).The central idea is a two-step process:First to turn characters that must have been escaped back into their original unescaped format (which contains the \ character). Then replace the \ character in that with a quote character. For example the character 'x\08'—a backspace—is first changed into '\b', then into '"b'.Output:
You can use ast.literal_eval():
