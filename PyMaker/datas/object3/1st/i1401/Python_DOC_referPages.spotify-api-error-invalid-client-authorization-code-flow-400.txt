This is one of my many attempts at making a POST request to https://accounts.spotify.com/api/token. Scope was set to 'playlist-modify-public, playlist-modify-private'.I'm using Python 3.7, Django 2.1.3.No matter what I do, response_data returns {'error': 'invalid_client'}I've tried many things, including passing the client_id/client_secret inside the body of the request as per the official Spotify documentation for this particular request... to no avail. Please help!
I suspect the issue is with invalid characters in your Authorization header. Try using urlsafe_b64encode instead of b64encode to prepare that header value:
Thanks for your response @solarissmoke! I found out what was wrong... I had reset my Spotify client_secret on the Spotify Dashboard and completely forgot to modify my code accordingly... I feel real smart :|
