I have three lists:I want to "slice and paste" elements by "b"The result is supposed to look like this:But I don't know how to approach this... please help me!
Use itertools.groupby.If you want to join groups not belonging to a certain keyDemo:If you want to join groups belonging to a certain keyDemo:Details on what groupby produces (non generator approach for join_except_key)The list comprehension groups = [... in the second line was only needed for inspecting the elements of the grouping operation, it works fine with just groups = groupby(li1).
You can use itertools.groupby, dividing logic into 3 parts:Group by equality to your separator string.Construct an iterable of lists depending on the condition defined in groupby key.Use itertools.chain.from_iterable to flatten your iterable of lists.Here's a demonstration.
Itertools and Yield from are great python constructs but challenging to master. Something simpler would go like so involving string shifting and splitting.
Here is a function I wrote to perform this:Here is the result:There are a lot of answers here already, but I hope this helped.
I don't get why all the answers look complicated for this. Did I miss something ?PrintsKeep it simple and stupid. Readability matters.
I'm late, but this is another option:Calling on the OP lists:It is possible to call it on 'b':
