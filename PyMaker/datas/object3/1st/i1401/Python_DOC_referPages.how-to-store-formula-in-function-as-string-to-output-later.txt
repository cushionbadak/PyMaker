I am trying to create a function in which I will store formulas for my converter. When X formula will be needed, it will be called from it. When trying it with simple 0:a+b  it works when returning, but when trying to store it as string meters_to_foots, it doesn't work. I need to have that formula stored as something since I need to output it later.Here is a part of the code which I have problems with. NameError: name 'meters_input' is not defined
To create a function in Python use either lambda functions or the regular function definition. Examples are respectively:orGenerally the regular function definition is preferred since it improves readability. You can define your function mapping as follows:
If these will always be simple functions you can use a lambda expression for this:If your function lookup will always be a number starting with zero you might be better off storing the functions as an array. You could do something like this as well:It's a little more complicated, but probably easier to read and understand.
Try changing your function to this:The "i" in the function is a local variable for the function. In your code you are passing 0 into the my_formulas() function. i then becomes 0, but meters_input is out of scope for the function.
