Natural Text
I've encountered problems with trying to calculate the average salaries and total salary from the following txt file.I don't even know where to begin with this
Let's suppose the file you showed there is named myfile.txt (just make sure to uncomment the first line). Then, the following code should solve your problem:And just like that the magic is done. If you don't have pandas installed, run pip install pandas in your terminal.Pandas is a python library created specifically for data analysis. Considering your file is basically a csv, it is probably the best approach to properly interact with it. In the case I showed you, I converted your file into a dataframe named df, so pandas can deal with it.In this specific case, we are using the function .mean to calculate the average of the column SALARY, by calling it as a list. (there are a bunch of other functions, of course).
