I'm not sure what your needs are. If you want to save the current amounts to amounts.json file and overwrite it every time, your code in the question would suffice.If you want to save the amounts to a different file so that you can say look back and see the contents of amounts at a some previous time, you can add timestamp to your file by (assuming you had imported datetime by from datetime import datetimeSay, at 2018-11-29-19:00:01 you pressed save and then the contents of amounts might be saved to a json file named amounts-2018-11-29-19:00:02.json.
