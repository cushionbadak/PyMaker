I am currently new to python and the programming world, so this question may sound very newish for you. I am trying to create a rock, paper, scissors, lizard and Spock game. I wanted to use a modulo to save a lot of if statements. My problem is that I cannot get the modulo to determine the correct winner. Can anyone see what I am doing wrong?For example when I enter 2 computer chooses 3 and wins the game. 
I would suggest putting the "get a number from user" into a function and add some exception handling for dumb players:You can learn more about this in the answers to Asking the user for input until they give a valid response.You should only ask the user once for his name, put the rest of your games logic into a while with a suitable codition to leave it - I choose 5 times lost is enough.Collect wins/draws/looses into variables. I added a dictionary for numer to choice mapping and some string.format() for nicer output - see:string.format()dictionaryFor the actual game logic - your mapping seems to be incorrect. The rules of the game say: So if you change your main program to: it works as expected:Your current logic gives you:Program:
