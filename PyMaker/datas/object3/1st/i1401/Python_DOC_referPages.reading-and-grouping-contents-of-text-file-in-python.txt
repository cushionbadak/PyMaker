Natural Text
I have a text file to read in PythonContentsReading:OP:But I want to read the contents based on white space separating the lines.Expected OP:Is there a shorter approach than reading the entire contents of the file iterating through the list and then grouping based on the whitespaces. Any suggestion on the approach?
Something like this should do what you need:Or another (not as readable) oneliner version using itertools groupby
