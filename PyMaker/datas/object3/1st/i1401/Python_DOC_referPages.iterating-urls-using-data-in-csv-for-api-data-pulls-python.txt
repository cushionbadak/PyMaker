I have about 20,000 postal codes in a CSV file in one column. I'm trying to extract some geographic electoral data based on these postal codes through an API. The url for this API iterates towards the end (where postal codes change for each iteration). I tried a number of different code samples, but none of them work. EDIT: Pasting a sample below that I now know doesn't work - primarily because I don't need a strip function. However, how do I get the loop to pull in postal codes from CSV file directly? Also pasting error messages I get. 
Python provides a CSV module, with which you can do the following:This will let skip the annoyance of dealing with parsing the CSV file. The above code works for me if I use Canadian zip codes with no spaces. 
Include the errors you get which will point you in the right direction. For starters though, probably doesn't mean anything. When using the strip function, you should include what you are wanting to 'strip', and the string that you are stripping from. For example, from this tutorial:returns: 
Okay, so I figured out what I was doing wrong. I just got python to read my csv column as a list, and then used a for loop to get my results in json format. Pasting the code below, in case it's helpful to anyone:
