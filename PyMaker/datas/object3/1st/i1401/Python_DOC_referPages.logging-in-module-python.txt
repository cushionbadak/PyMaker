In MAIN_SETUP.py program I am importing otherMod2MAIN_SETUP.py otherMod2.pyIf I run the program (MAIN_SETUP.py), new_snake.log file is created, following data is written in the fileQuestion 1 :In otherMod2.py , we do have below logger, it's just defined and not used . Can we delete it? Will it have any impact if we delete it.Question 2:There is no handler defined for below logger in otherMod2.py but still its writing in new_snake.log file, how this is possible
To answer both questions:Question 1You can delete the module-level logger exampleApp.otherMod2, however, you might want to keep it so that other code within the module can use it. Creating a module-level logger is the recommended approach - typically by calling logger.getLogger(__name__). That sets up a logger using the same hierarchy as the module's package structure.Question 2Python loggers are constructed within a hierarchy which is determined by the dots in the logger's name. By default, events logged lower down the hierarchy are also passed to loggers higher up the heirarchy. So although your exampleApp.otherMod2.add logger has no handler, the event is passed up to the top level exampleApp logger which outputs it to the log file.This behavior is controlled by the propagate attribute. You can set this to False so that higher level loggers won't receive the events.In that case you would need to attach a handler to exampleApp.otherMod2.add if you wanted it to output anything.
