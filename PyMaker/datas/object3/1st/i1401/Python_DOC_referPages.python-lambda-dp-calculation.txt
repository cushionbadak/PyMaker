I am trying to understand below code snippet, for each value of i, what are all the two arguments passed to min()? appreciate if you could explain how the dp[i] computation could be expanded? 
A lot of things are happening here. The min() method is receiving a python list as an argument. This python list is created through list comprehension. It helps to start from the back. The list comprehension is saying "For every value c in the iterable coins, append the value dp[i - c] to my list if the boolean i - c >=0 is True. Otherwise, append the value MAX. In other words, the line [dp[i - c] if i - c >= 0 else MAX for c in coins] is equivalent toThe min() method will be performed on this list once it is complete, which simply find the smallest value in the list
