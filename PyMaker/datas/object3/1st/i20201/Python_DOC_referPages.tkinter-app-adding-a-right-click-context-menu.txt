I have a python-tkinter gui app that I've been trying to find some way to add in some functionality. I was hoping there would be a way to right-click on an item in the app's listbox area and bring up a context menu.  Is tkinter able to accomplish this? Would I be better off looking into gtk or some other gui-toolkit?
You would create a Menu instance and write a function that callsits post() or tk_popup() method.  The tkinter documentation doesn't currently have any information about tk_popup().Read the Tk documentation for a description, or the source:library/menu.tcl in the Tcl/Tk source:tkinter/__init__.py in the Python source:You associate your function with right-click via:the_widget_clicked_on.bind("<Button-3>", your_function).However, the number associated with right-click is not the same on every platform.library/tk.tcl in the Tcl/Tk source:Here is an example I wrote that adds a context menu to a Listbox:The use of grab_release() was observed in an example on effbot.Its effect might not be the same on all systems.
I made some changes to the conext menu code above in order to adjust my demand and I think it would be useful to share:Version 1:Version 2:
