sum(iterable) is effectively:Does Python have a built-in function that accomplishes this without setting the initial value?The problem I have with sum is that it does not work for other types that support the + operator, e.g. Counter.
Try looking into the python reduce() function: You pass in a function, an iterable, and an optional initializer and it would apply the function cumulatively to all the values.For example:You can change the function based on your iterable, so it's very customizable.
In the case of addition:This will work on iterables that can't be added together using sum. Similarly, you could perform multiplication using
This is a pretty good use for reduce(), which was moved to functools.reduce() in Python 3.Here is an example for chaining multiplication:You can replace operator.mul there with one of the other functions from the operator module, or just define your own two-argument function that operates on its arguments.
