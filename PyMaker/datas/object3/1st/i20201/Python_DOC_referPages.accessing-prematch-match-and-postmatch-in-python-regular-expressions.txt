When matching a regular expression in Perl, three variables named $PREMATCH, $MATCH and $POSTMATCH are set, containing the parts of the input string before the match, the match itself, and the part after.How can I access the same values using Python regular expressions?
No, Python has no explicit support for prematch and postmatch values, but you can use the attributes of a match object to slice the input string; given a matchobject match, the equivalents are:$PREMATCH: match.string[:match.start()]$MATCH: match.group()$POSTMATCH: match.string[match.end():]Demo:You could also use re.split() to divvie up a string around a regular expression with a group around the whole expression:You can use tuple-unpacking to put that into variables if you like:Do be aware that .split() will keep on splitting unless you limit it to 1 match with the maxsplit parameter:
No, you use the re module in python. The syntax is however a bit different than in Perl, there are no shortcuts as in Perl.Depending on what you are trying to achieve, you can for example use groups.
