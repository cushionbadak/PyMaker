When I import R in python, using rpy2, how do I suppress warnings?It appears that in R you have to do just the following...but I'm not familiar with R. How do I do this in python?
You pretty much gave the answer yourself. You can call the options(warn=-1) function from Python by using RPy:For RPy2 it should be something like this (haven't tried this):Just put it at the beginning of your Python script (after the module imports) and all warnings should be suppressed.
The warning system in rpy2 uses Python's warnings module. As a consequence, you can switch off warnings using that package's filterwarnings() function. As already pointed out in a comment to another answer here this could be dangerous as not only R-related warnings are affected.However, rpy2 comes with its own warning class, RRuntimeWarning. Therefore, you can switch off only this type of warning by
Beginning with 3.0 version, rpy2 does not use Python's warnings module anymore. It now relies on logging instead. The new solution would be:If you want to filter specific warnings only, use:See LogRecord class specification for available fields for advanced filtering.
