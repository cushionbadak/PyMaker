I want to create a zip archive of the pip package , code as following but when I got a list of files and folders in current directory, which originally resides in the pip package  , i.e.While  I hope there is a directory named pip to contain the list of files and folders when shutil.unpack_archive, so what adjustment to shutil.make_archive should I do ?BTW, I cannot grasp the use of shutil.make_archive even consulting the doc, I think the doc should update so that give a clear description .
You were half way there. Basically you were specifying the root_dir and not the base_dir. You can do it by using the following snippet.
