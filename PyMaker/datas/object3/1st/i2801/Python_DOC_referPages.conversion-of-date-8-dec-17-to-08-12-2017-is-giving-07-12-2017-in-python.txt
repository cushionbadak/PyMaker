I'm trying to format the datetime in python, and this is what I was trying: The output of this code is :07/12/17 which is not the one I wantI am expecting : 08/12/17
You can use datetime which is a bit shorter and gives the result you want:
According to https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.mktime, mktime() is the inverse function of localtime(). So, you need to use localtime() instead of gmtime() to print the result:outputs 08/12/17
