I have the following class which I made:I don't exactly know how to explain it but I basically want to be able to maintain a points id despite mathematical operations. For example:Is there a reason this doesn't happen in my code. It says False during the id part in mine. 
The id is basically the memory address. If you make a new object, it will probably have a different id. If you want a mutable Point object for some reason consider the __iadd__ (and friends) methods instead, which can do the update in-place.
