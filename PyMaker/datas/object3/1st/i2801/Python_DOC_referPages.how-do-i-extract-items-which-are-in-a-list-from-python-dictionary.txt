I am quite new to python and I am struggling with this particular question.I have the follow script:So this script is a dictionary which is divided into continents, and for each continents it includes maps of certain regions.Now I want to be able to read these maps for these occassions;Read all the maps of the whole world all togetherRead all the maps of one region, for example just 'Africa' or 'Asia' etc.Read one specific region within a continent, say only mask_M08.mapHow am I supposed to arrange a script which is able to do all of that?I'm a bit stuck on this.
Just get an input from the user, and then decide what to do.For instance, you could accept:the special string whole_world which would select all the maps from all continents,any content, e.g. Africa, Asia, Europe,any individual map, ending in .map.So, in Python, this would look like:So when whole_world is entered, the maps list contains the names of all maps:and when a continent like Africa is entered, the maps list contains just the maps from that continent:and when a specific map is entered, the maps list contains just that map:
It seems like you will want methods that call one another to complete each task you outlined. THat is, taking your list:Read all the maps together Read all the maps of one region. Read one specific region within a continentLet's do it from the bottom up, because it will be easier to work that way:This way, you have a function to read an individual map, a function to read a group of them (e.g. a continent's maps list) and then a function for the whole thing! You could also put these into one big function, but this is probably more readable.
