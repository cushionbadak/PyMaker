Is there any tool/library through which the list of methods/functions called within another methods/functions can be listed?For example:If that tool or library runs for below methodthen it should returnThis question is almost same as this one but it's for Java. This is basically same as what PyCharm does for Find Usage.Thanks!
This seems to do the work:Example:What's happening here is:we make a Bytecode object of the function we reverse the list of instructions, since the function name willfollow the function callwe step through the list, and for each CALL_FUNCTION instruction, we use the instructions arg parameter to tell us how manyarguments    we're getting we look one past that to find the instruction that loads the functionwe're calling we add that function's name (instr.argval) to a list which we thenreverse, enumerate, and return in the requested formatNote that since Python 3.6, there are three CALL_FUNCTION instructions, so you'll have to check the documentation to extend this example to be fully functional with current python
Update: added compatibility for Python2.7Tested and confirmed working with Python2.7, Python3.5 and Python3.6Credit for pointing out dis goes to Patrick Haugh¹ Implementation (parsing of the dis output) is my own:Setup:Python 2/3 compatibility:Code: Output:¹As Patrick Haugh's comment about dis is over 2h old I consider this one free for taking...
