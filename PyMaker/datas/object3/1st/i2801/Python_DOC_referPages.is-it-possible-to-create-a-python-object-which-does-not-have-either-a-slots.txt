Is it possible to create a python object which does not have either a __slots__ a __dict__?
As pointed out in this SO python classes defined in C have no __dict__ attribute. So yeah, it is possible and this is how you get built-in classes that don't have it, such as str. Other than that... if you look at the data model the __dict__ is used to hold the namespace for user defined modules, classes and functions. So you'll get that attribute even when you define a new class that inherits from a built in class which doesn't have it. (such as str)
