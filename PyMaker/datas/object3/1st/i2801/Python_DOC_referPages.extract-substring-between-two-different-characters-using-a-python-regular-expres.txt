This question already has an answer here:My regex is matching too much. How do I make it stop?                    5 answers                I'd like to use a python regular expression to extract the substring between two different characters, > and <.Here are my example strings:<h4 id="Foobar:">Foobar:</h4><h1 id="Monty">Python<a href="https://..."></a></h1>My current regular expression is \>(.*)\< and matches:FoobarPython<a href="https://..."></a>My re matches the first example correctly but not the second one. I want it to return "Python". What am I missing?
Use expression:(?<=>) Positive lookbehind for >.[^<:]+ Match anything other than < or :.(?=:?<) Positive lookahead for optional colon :, and <.You can try the expression live here.In Python:Prints:Alternatively you could use expression:(?<=>) Positive lookbehind for >.[a-zA-Z]+ Lower and upper case letters.(?=\W*<) Positive lookahead for any non word characters followed by <.You can test this expression here.Prints:
You are missing the greediness of * quantifier - with . it matches as many characters as it can. To switch this quantifier to non-greedy mode add ?:  You can read more in the documentation in the section *?, +?, ??.
