Here is a catch:I need to collect all the logs only from the specific time which is parsed as a string argument to the python file as 'python main.py -t "Aug 6 12:30:45.123" The logs actually have the timestamps and the corresponding logs. For example:and so onIt is becoming very difficult to capture logs from this time onwards till the script executes.Please note: only standard Python libraries can be used.This is what I have tried so far:Extracting the date and time.
Looks like you're not having trouble separating the time stamp string, but you'll need to convert it to a time object or similar so you can compare times.Here's a simple example that parses the string to create a time object and then compares that with the start log time:This produces:See time.strptime() for more information. I've lazily sliced the string, assuming that the time stamp is in the first fifteen characters, you may need to use some of the other work you've done in isolating the time string.
Try list comprehension to filter the list:Output:
