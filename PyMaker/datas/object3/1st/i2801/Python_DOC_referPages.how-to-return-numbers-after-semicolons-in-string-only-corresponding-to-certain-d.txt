I want to extract all the numbers to the right of the semicolon corresponding to a date. For example, with date '2017-07-17', I want to return the list [14,5]. And for date 2017-07-23 I just want to return [4].How can I do this? I only know of iterating through the indices to extract numbers but that's not going to get me lists of numbers corresponding to certain dates.for eventIndex in range(2,len(path)):   curr_date = path[eventIndex].split(';')[0]Will only get me the corresponding numbers traversed, but I just have no idea how to get lists corresponding to each date.
Choose a proper data structure e.g. a collections.defaultdict with list as the factory:Here, we're iterating over the list, partitioning strings on ;, and using the date portion as the key to the out dictionary with values being the right sided substrings appended.
Join your list with a character that is not present in your list (e.g. |), then use a regex to find the numbers that are after a semicolon after the date in question:If you need them as numeric dtypes and not strings, use map(int,...):
