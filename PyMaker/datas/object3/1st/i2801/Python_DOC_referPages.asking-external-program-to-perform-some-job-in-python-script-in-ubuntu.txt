I would like to write a script in python in ubuntu for performing some series of a task by an external program(installed in Ubuntu) multiple times. I can run the program for one file from the terminal but I would like to automate it by writing the python script so that it can read the files and perform the job. How should I proceed?Thank you in advance

Use subprocess.run():You could also run the program on a set of files, e.g. those that have a specific file ending, like .txt:
