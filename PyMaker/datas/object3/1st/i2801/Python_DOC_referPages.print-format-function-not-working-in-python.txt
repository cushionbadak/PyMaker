I am getting used with datasets from the scikit-learn and I am currently using the iris dataset (dataset for classification of different species of iris).When I try to visualize the values describing the flowers features using print adding with this code:from sklearn.datasets import load_irisiris_dataset=load_iris()print("Keys of the iris dataset:\n".format(iris_dataset['feature_names']))I just obtain this output from the console:Keys of the iris dataset: On the other hand, if I use the print function without "format" with this line:print("Keys of the iris dataset:\n",(iris_dataset['feature_names']))I obtain at least an output:('Keys of the iris dataset:\n', ['sepal length (cm)', 'sepal width (cm)', 'petal length (cm)', 'petal width (cm)'])This happens with every section of the dataset I try to display, it seems a problem with the function format(), does anyone have any suggestion for solving it and correctly visualize the formatted output?
Your format string doesn't have anything to interpolate.You need to use a {} somewhere for each parameters you want put into the string, like this:
You are missing the curly braces {} which are essentially placeholders. They will be replaced with the variable(s) specified in the  str.format function. Please try this:This will give you:Please check out the documentation or one of the many tutorials on Python string format() on the web.
