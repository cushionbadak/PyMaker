Suppose I have this program:How can I call a class from a class with a button? Note: This is just an example.Thanks.
I used Qt for this example : However this is not a good practice ,You better create a function inside the MainWidget class that print "Something" whenever you push the button.Example : def button_pushed(self):    print ("Something")That you will call using : self.button.released.connect(self.button_pushed)This is more simple , so better :) Hope it was helpful.
