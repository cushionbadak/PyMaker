This question already has an answer here:What's the correct way to convert bytes to a hex string in Python 3?                    8 answers                I have a variable b whose value is b'\xac\xed\x05sr\x00'. How can I convert it to 'aced05737200'?s, and r are converted to 73 and 72 respectively because their ascii code are 73 and 72.b.decode('utf-8') gives me this errorUnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0xac in position  0: invalid start byte
Simply use .hex()-methodto get the wanted result, because it's not a problem with decoding or encoding. Your bytestring looks ok to produce a proper string object with hexadecimal numbers.
