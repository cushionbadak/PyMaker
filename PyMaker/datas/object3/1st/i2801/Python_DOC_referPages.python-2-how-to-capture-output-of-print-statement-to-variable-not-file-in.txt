This question already has an answer here:Understanding repr( ) function in Python                    5 answers                In Python interpreter, return without “ ' ”                    2 answers                EDIT: SOLUTION!!!As it turns out, all I needed to do for this to work was df.query('{}'.format(eval(queryStr))) and Python treated queryStr as if it were the same as print(queryStr). I don't recommend using eval all of the time, but in this case it was the best solution for me that I could figure out so far.ORIGINAL PROBLEM:I have a string (queryStr):(Note the backslashes--there are 2)When I print it queryStr, I get:Which 1 backslash-- EXACTLY what I want to pass to df.query(). Because when I run df.query(queryStr) (running df.query() with two backslashes), I get an error. But when I run:df.query('(1522000002801<=TIMESTAMP<=1522000034174 or 1522000048441<=TIMESTAMP<=1522000074589) and (RESOURCE==\'GTEX\' or RESOURCE==\'MOD_FLYBASE\') and (ACTIVITY==\'REQ_RESOURCE\')') (df.query() with 1 backslash)I get exactly what I want:So, my question is:How can I capture the 'output' of print(queryStr) and pass it to df.query(), exactly as it is printed? I know that I can pass the output of print to a file, and then bring in those lines, but I feel like that's extremely inefficient. Thank you!!EDIT:Please note that queryStr is NOT the .__repr__() of the string--because then there would be backslashes in front of the first and last quotes. Hence, using solutions involving .__repr__() or .__str__() have not worked. I quite literally need to somehow 'grab' the output of print. Thank you again!
If you prefix the string with 'r', it will indicate to Python that it's a "raw string" and will pass the string exactly as you specify it:This will pass the string 'y', 'o', 'u', 'r', ' ', '\', 'q', 'u', 'e', 'r', 'y' -- with the one backslash exactly as you specfiy it.From the Python docs:  https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.htmlBoth string and bytes literals may optionally be prefixed with a  letter 'r' or 'R'; such strings are called raw strings and treat  backslashes as literal characters.
