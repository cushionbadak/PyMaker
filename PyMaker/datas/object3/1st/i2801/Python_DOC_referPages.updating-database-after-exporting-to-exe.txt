I am exporting a script I have made in Python that sends commands to IP Addresses of projectors to shut them down. The functionality of the code works, and the projectors will shut down. The list of projectors is stored in a dictionary in a different file to the script to allow it to be edited and accessed by other scripts.Once I export my script to an exe using Pyinstaller v3.3.1 for Python 3.5.1, the .exe file no longer updates from the .py file that contains the dictionary, and instead has a version already stored in memory that I cannot update.How can I make the executable file still read from the dictionary and update every time it is run?Thanks,JoshCode:dictonaryfile.py (reduced for security, but format shown). Script that performs shutdown
As you noticed, once an exe is made, you can't update it. A workaround for a problem like this is ask for the location of dictonaryfile.py in your code-For applications like these, it's a good idea to take a configuration file(.ini) and python has Configparser to read from config files. You could create your config file as -And read projectors from this file with Configparser -
