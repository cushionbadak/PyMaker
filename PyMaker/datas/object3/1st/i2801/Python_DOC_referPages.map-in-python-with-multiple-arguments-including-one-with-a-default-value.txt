I am using Python3.6 and am trying to figure out ways in which we can use map with multiple arguments.When I run, list(products) returns [9, 240] as expectedHowever, when I specify a default value for z,list(product) returnsWhy does Python differ in the way it runs map in the two scenarios?
When you set the default value of z during execution with map this happens:Therefore your output, for map to work as you intend you should explicitly give the list as one of it arguments and in your case the default value of z is not a direct argument of map. Hope this makes sense. 
Try:Then list(products) would be: [9, 240]Explanation:Your code doesn't work because you're multiplying a number with a list (so basically it will be a list repeated n times), you need to get always the next value, so do next to the iter of the listSee: Python: next() function
I think it should use reduce rather than map.This link explain difference between reduce and map.Using reduce it should beAccording to this doc.reduce is roughly equivalent to:
