I have an django app route that will run a pytest.main() command if some conditions are met: I would like to include a unit test that validates run_test has been executed. What is the best approach to doing this? Mock and unittest are new to me.I tried messing around with stdout:but this returns: 
Here are two example tests that verify that pytest.main is invoked when a valid test name is passed and not invoked otherwise. I also added some different invocations of mock_pytest_main.assert_called as an example; they all do pretty much the same, with extra check for args that were passed on function call. Hope this helps you to write more complex tests!
