Here is the letters: I made a list of it with this:So I have a chars list.I need to all variables=0 each one to declare.And I wrote that:But there is an error message, like this:The question: how to declare these multiple variables?
You can use either a list of tuples or a dict. A simple solution to do it:To use list of tuples:
The SolutionSo, in short, what you want is a dictionary (mapping) of character -> 0 for each character in the input.This is the way to do it:The ProblemThe problem with the original code was that there, chars was a list (because it was created as a list here: chars=[]), and characters were used as its indices.So, the first time chars[i]=0; was executed (BTW, ; is not needed here), i was 'A' and chars['A']=0 produces the error.
An alternative to list comprehensions is to use mapOr if you want a dict like the other answers are suggestingI generally find list/dict comprehensions to both be faster and more readable (to me at least). This is just a different approach
If you want to create 0-list with the length of string letters.
I think you mean this: update: Or,
