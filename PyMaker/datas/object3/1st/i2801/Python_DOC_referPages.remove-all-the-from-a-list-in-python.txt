I have tried all kinds of different things when it comes to this. How do I just remove all the # from this list that I created?
.remove(value) only removes the first occurrence.  You can use a loop to keep removing duplicate values until there are none left:Perhaps a better solution is to not add unwanted values in the first place:
Or a list comprehension:Or filter:Also as John Gordon says, even easier:Or a list comprehension again:See List comprehnsionsSee Map, Filter, and Reduce
One quick method for removing all instances of a character is the string method replace:Assuming a list like this, updated based on your feedback. Let's say remove all # and * in strings, you just need to use replace twice:This will loop through each element of your list using a list comprehension and remove all instances of # in each string. You can send the optional count if you want to limit the number of hashtags replaced (change to e.replace("#", "", 1) if you only wanted to remove the first instance for example).
