Hi, may I know what does recursive=True parameter means?
https://docs.python.org/3/library/glob.htmlIf recursive is true, the pattern “**” will match any files and zero or more directories and subdirectories. If the pattern is followed by an os.sep, only directories and subdirectories match.So, the following files will match your pattern when recursive is true:27-Jul/a/foo.csv27-Jul/c/d/baz.csv27-Jul/boo.csvIf you use a single * instead of **, only 27-Jul/a/foo.csv will match. * means “exactly one file or subdirectory,” and ** means “zero or more directories or subdirectories.”
