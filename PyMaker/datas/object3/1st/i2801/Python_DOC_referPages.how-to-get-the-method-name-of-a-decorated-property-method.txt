Lets say I have a method which I decorate with @property.Is there a way to get the underlying name of the decorated method?How could I for instance print the name of the property when it does not have a __name__ attribute?I'm trying to do a RPC call and everything works for methods and static functions but not this.
A property has the following attributes: fget, fset and fdel, which are references to the getter/setter/deleter functions.So, you can get the __name__ of each of this functions (if not None)Demo:
i think if use decorator @property you can access your function with name of function and you can give return value.
If you use functools.wraps() in your decorator, the decorated function will have the __name__ of the wrapped function.IF you had some sample code for the decorator in your question, I could show more precisely how to do this...
