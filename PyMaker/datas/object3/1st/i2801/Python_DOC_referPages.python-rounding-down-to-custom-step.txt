We have a partially working code and 2 examples with different types of custom steps. The example 2 (Int) is working, while the example 1 is not, as it is rounding up instead of down.How do we fix it?
Another approach is outlined in this SO answer:If you want to round down always (instead of rounding to the nearest  precision), then do so, explicitly, with the math.floor()  function:For your example:
You'll want to use Decimal objects to for precise decimal numbers to begin with.Then, use Decimal.quantize() in the ROUND_DOWN mode.prints out
