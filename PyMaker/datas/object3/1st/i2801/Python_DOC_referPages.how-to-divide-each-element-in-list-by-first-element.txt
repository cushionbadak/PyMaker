Lets consider some list:I need to divide each element of list by its first element.It can be done with list compehension:but I have to use some functional programming for this
map:Or as a function:Or use numpy:and if you want list:
You can use the built-in function map in combination with the class list:map() returns an iterator that applies a function to every item of iterable, yielding the results.list() takes an iterable in order to produce a list.
Use map:And if you don't like the lambda expression, you can use the truediv (or floordiv) method in operator, but two parameters are required so here I used a little trick.I first build a new iterable according to the question, and then use starmap which can map multiple parameters to a function. truediv in operator has exactly the same functionality as operator / but just make it run in a function way and accept two parameters and return the div result between them.
