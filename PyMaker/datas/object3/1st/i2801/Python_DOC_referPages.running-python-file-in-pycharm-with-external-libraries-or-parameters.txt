I have a script connecting to Oracle DB while doing the job. This connection required external libraries from third party like Oracle common driver.I found the way to add system viariables to the console in PyCharm so I can run my program properly in PyCharm python console. However when I try regular run (or debug) button it does not run complaining for lack of these libraries.How can I define such variables/libraries to enable running my program directly?
Try to create a virtual environment specifically for this project (https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html). After creating select this virtual environment and try to install the necessary libraries in File-> Settings-> Project Interpreter.
On MacOS, I am running cx_Oracle 5.3 with Django 1.11 and Oracle 11g. I defined the following environment variables in the run/debug configuration of pyCharm:If you are running Windows then you will need to amend the paths accordingly...
