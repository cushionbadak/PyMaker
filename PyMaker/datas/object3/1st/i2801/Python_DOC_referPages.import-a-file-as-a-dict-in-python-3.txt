I'm not familiar with opening a file and creating one.I'm looking for a very simply way to do this. I did some research with re and it isn't turning out. Withing the with block, I ran a = f.read().replace(' = ', '\',\'') which returns:Now I need to add a ' at the beginning and end of each line. Then I think I can use f.readlines() to create a list I can slice into keys and values. I know how to do this with vim or sed in Linux, but I'm trying to stay within Python. Please help. Thank you!
I can suggest you an alternative one-line style solution using dict comprehension:  
I would suggest taking a look at the builtin configparser library which will return a dictionary like object.Alternatively you can simply split the lines on =
Just treat it as normal data, don't try to convert it to python or you will end-up going down the horrible eval road.  Gives:
