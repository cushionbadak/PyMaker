I have a chat bot that displays information from a call to an API. I would like to display the following information more clearly:Having it break and skip to the next lineHave (btcChange), (btcVol), (btcPrice) proper commas like 100,000.
If you're trying to get commas in the JSONâ€¦ well, you can't; that would make it invalid JSON, which no program can read, so Python's json library won't let you do that.If the whole JSON thing is irrelevant, and you just want to know how to get commas when formatting a number using str.format, then you just need to look at the Format Specification Mini-Language or maybe a third-party tutorial or cheatsheet that's not quite as dense).If you have a modern version of Python, there are two choices.1A , for the grouping_option can be used together with any of the normal number presentation types, including the default d type for integers, and it will add commas every 3 digits:Alternatively, you might want to use the special presentation type n, which sues the appropriate separates for your current locale. That might be commas every 3 digits, dots every 3 digits, the ...-2-2-3 thing that's used in India, etc., depending on your locale. Although the default "C" locale actually has no separators at all, so it may not be very useful if that's your setting:1. Basically that means 2.7 or 3.1+, which covers most people nowadays. Grouping options were added in 3.6, but , as a special case with only slightly different details goes back to 2.7/3.1. n goes back to the initial version of str.format, but didn't do the right thing until 2.7/3.1.
