I haven't been coding for awhile and trying to get back into Python. I'm trying to write a simple program that sums an array by adding each array element value to a sum. This is what I have:I get the following error:I found that what I'm trying to do is apparently as simple as this:But clearly I'm not iterating through the array properly anyway, and I figure it's something I will need to learn properly for other purposes. Thanks!
When you loop in an array like you did, your for variable(in this example i) is current element of your array.For example if your ar is [1,5,10], the i value in each iteration is 1, 5, and 10.And because your array length is 3, the maximum index you can use is 2. so when i = 5 you get IndexError.You should change your code into something like this:Or if you want to use indexes, you should create a range from 0 ro array length - 1.
The for loop iterates over the elements of the array, not its indexes.Suppose you have a list ar = [2, 4, 6]:When you iterate over it with for i in ar: the values of i will be 2, 4 and 6. So, when you try to access ar[i] for the first value, it might work (as the last position of the list is 2, a[2] equals 6), but not for the latter values, as a[4] does not exist.If you intend to use indexes anyhow, try using for index, value in enumerate(ar):, then theSum = theSum + ar[index] should work just fine.
