I want to check when the worker object comes closely to any of the fence objects in order to print a notification message. By "closely" I mean the distance of 20 pixels between the worker and the border of fence. For example, something like "distances_list = worker.get_dist(fences)", where "distances_list" would contain the current distances to all fences.I could adopt the approach proposed here, but maybe there is some built-in function for my task?In pygame we can use different collision detection functions, but in the case described above there is no collision. Is there any built-in function to find the distance between the sprites?
Here's this solution ported to pygame. The y-axis in pygame is flipped, so I had to swap the top and bottom variables and the distance can be calculated with math.hypot. You need to pass the rects of the two sprites to rect_distance where they will be unpacked into the x1, y1 (top left) and x1b, y1b (bottom right) variables. (You can see the distance in the window title.)
