Natural Text
Im trying to access a dict ive created called Brands.I am then trying to replace information from a user input with information from the dict. I am struggiling to print out and replace text of the user input. Currently the only thing I can get it to do is print out all of the table content, with words inserted which unfortunately doesnt help very much.This is an example that my code must do.
You can define a function to cycle through your dictionary and perform str.replace repeatedly:Example:
Try this:
OR:Example Output:
Here is an example that does not require looping over all elements in your dict.By using a regex, you can do the replacement in a single traversal instead of using str.replace for each element in BRANDS.CodeExample
You can use dict.get() with a list comprehension to iterate over the values of your user input (separated by space) and replace them with the values from your BRANDS dictionary. The dict.get() method will first check if a key of that particular value of i exists. If it does it will return the corresponding value from the BRANDS dict or else just keep the original value of i. You can then pass this list to str.join() to form the final stringHope this helps!
