Natural Text
can anyone help me with an bfs code in python? It's printing just self value, not the entire tree. The answer to me is just "10", not the entire tree. I can't find the error. 
Along with the return statement, there are some wrong indentations too.Input Graph:Output:Reference:https://docs.python.org/3/library/queue.html#queue.Queue.get
