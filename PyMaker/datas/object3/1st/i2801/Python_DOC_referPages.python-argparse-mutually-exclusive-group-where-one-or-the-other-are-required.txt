I'm trying to build an input list where I have two options -domain - which would take input of a domain. And the same again, but -dL (or domainlist). If a domain is parsed then domainslist isn't required, but one of them must be provided.I've tried to do this by adding both of these as required in a mutually exclusive group, however the error I'm presented with states that no objects in a mutually exclusive group can be required.I could hardcode this check on startup (make neither required and handle myself) but I'm sure argparse can do it, can somebody gfive me a nudge as I haven't found this in the documentation thus far.
