Natural Text
I faced with this problem in my work code, so I can't show it. But I wrote some short example, which exactly reproduce error and cuts off redundant logic. Example have two files: Example.py & ImportedExample.py.Example.pyImportedExample.pyAnd Traceback looks like this:The main detail is that when I make __private_method() non-private (renaming to private_method()), all works fine.I don't understand why this happens. Any suggestions?
multiprocessing module uses pickle for transferring object between processes.For an object to be pickable, it has to be accessible by name. Thanks to private name mangling, referenced private methods don’t fall in that category.I suggest making the method protected – that is naming the method with only one leading underscore. From a global point of view, protected methods shoud be treated just as private methods, but they are not subject of name mangling.
