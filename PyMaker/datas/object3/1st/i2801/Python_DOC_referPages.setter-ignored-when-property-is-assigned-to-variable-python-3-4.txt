I'm creating a Verdict class which will evaluate to true until it is set false after which it always evaluates false even if you set it to true. The only way I could think of to do that would be to have a property and a setter.It works, but for simplicity rather than having:I thought I could do:But it seems that v in the second case is the attribute directly, and is ignoring the setter.Is there a way to fix this, or a better method to achieve the Verdict?
You can't avoid using the v.verdict = ... syntax.This is because properties require attribute access in order to work. Properties are descriptors, and the descriptor protocol only takes effect on attribute access.If you store a property (or, more generally, a descriptor) in a variable, you've effectively robbed it of its functionality. Accessing a variable is just a name lookup, and assigning to a variable is just binding a value to a name. It's not possible to make an assignment like v = ... trigger your setter.
