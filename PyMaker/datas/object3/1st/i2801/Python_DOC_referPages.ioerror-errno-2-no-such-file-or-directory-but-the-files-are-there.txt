If you do print filename in the for loop #commented below, it gives you all the file names in the directory. yet when I call pd.ExcelFile(filename) it returns that there is no file with the name of : [the first file that ends with '.xlsx' What am I missing? p.s: the indentation below is right, the if is under the for in my code, but it doesn't show this way here.. 
The problem is that your work directory is not the same as the directory you are listing. Since you know the absolute path of the directory, the easiest solution is to add os.chdir('/Users/ramikhoury/PycharmProjects/R/excel_files') to the top of your file. 
Your "if" statement must be inside the for loop
The issue is that you are trying to open a relative file-path from a different directory than the one you are listing. Rather than using os it is probably better to use a higher level interface like pathlib:pathlib was added in Python 3.4 so if you are using an older version of python, your best bet would be to use the much older glob module, which functions similarly:If for some reason you really need to use the low-level os interface, the best way to solve this is by making use of the dir_fd optional argument to open:While you could accomplish this fix by changing directories at the top of your script (as suggested by another answer), this has the side-effect of changing the current working directory of your process which is often undesirable and may have negative consequences. To make this work without side-effects requires you to chdir back to the original directory:Note that this introduces a race condition into your code, as original_cwd may be removed or the access controls for that directory might be changed such that you cannot chdir back to it, which is precisely why dir_fd exists.dir_fd was added in Python 3.3, so if you are using an older version of Python I would recommend just using glob rather than the chdir solution.For more on dir_fd see this very helpful answer.
