Natural Text
I am working on a command line text editor(similar to nano) in python and i have run into an issue regarding file editing. I can read the file, i can print it, but the user has no way of editing the file once the print instructions have been executed. I need a way of reading the text into a buffer so it stays editable to the user so it can be navigated through the arrow keys and so on. I think i need a buffer, but it doesn't seem to help? How should i proceed?
You might find the curses module useful.
