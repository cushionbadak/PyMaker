I'm importing data from API using multithreathing as:When I set:pages = [i for i in range(0, 3)] it works with no problems.But when I tryIt generate this error:I'm not sure why this happens and why it gives me connection broken?Any idea why it doesn't work?Is there a way to actually get detail of what is broken? for example which specific url caused the problem etc?
requests.exceptions.ChunkedEncodingError: ("Connection broken: error(104, 'Connection reset by peer')", error(104, 'Connection reset by peer'))The log is clear that the connection between the script and the server got broken. And the reason is Connection reset by peer. If you dont understand what that means there are answers in this questionI suggest you wrap your code into try...catch blocks and retry, log, or end up script gracefully.
