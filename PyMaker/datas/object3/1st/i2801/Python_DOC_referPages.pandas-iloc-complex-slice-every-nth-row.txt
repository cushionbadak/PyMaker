I have a dataframe with a periodicity in the rows of 14 i.e. there are 14 lines of data per record (means, sdev etc.) and I want to extract the 2nd, 4th, 7th and 9th line, repeatedly for every record (14 lines). My code is:Mean_df = df.iloc[[1,3,6,8]::14,:].copy()which does not work TypeError: cannot do slice indexing on <class 'pandas.core.indexes.range.RangeIndex'> with these indexers [[1, 3, 6, 8]] of <class 'list'>I got help with the code from here, which has been useful, but not on the multi-row selections -- Pandas every nth rowI can extract as several different slices and combine, but it feels like there may be a more elegant solution.Any ideas?
Using:
You can use a tuple comprehension with slice and np.r_:In this example, indexing dataframe rows with 1::14 is equivalent to indexing with slice(1, df.shape[0], 14).This is fairly generic, you can define any tuple of slice objects and pass to np.r_.
