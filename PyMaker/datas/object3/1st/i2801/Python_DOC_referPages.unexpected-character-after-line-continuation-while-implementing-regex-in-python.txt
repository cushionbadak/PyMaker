re.search needs a pattern and a text. You left one of them out.Python does not have a literal syntax for regular expressions, which means all regular expressions in Python need to be strings.You probably didn't mean .xlsx.You need to escape the extension dot. (You do not need to escape the dot in the date, since it is inside square brackets, a character class.)You need to account for space. A literal space works okay here; if it's possible it might be a tab or something \s would be preferable.I use raw string literal r'...' so I can write \d instead of \\d etc.All together now:
