I want to execute a Python file from another Python file and show all print() outputs and error outputs without waiting (realtime).The simplified version of my code is as follows and I would like to show "start" and an error message without waiting for "end" (the end of the script).I also have run.py:I tried this blog post and several other similar answers on stackoverflow, but none of them worked, so I decided to put my original code here, which is above.
The following seems to work for me (on Windows). It uses subprocess.Popen() to execute the other script because this gives more control over what goes on. It turns buffering off to eliminate any delays that might cause, plus it redirects stderr to stdout to so all output can be retrieved from a single source.. Also note it also includes the correction @Ketan Mukadam mentions is his answer tregarding the value of __name__ in your first script.main_script.py:run.py:Output from executing run.py:
Is this line a mistake?The symbol is __main__ set by interpreter and not main. It is possible that because of this typo error no code is running from main script. Try first executing the main script directly on command shell.
