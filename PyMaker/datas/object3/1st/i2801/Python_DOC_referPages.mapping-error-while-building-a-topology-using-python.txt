I'm trying to build a topology in mininet using python. my topology is like this:So as you see I have 2 level of switches, switch_L1 is connected to controller, and switch_L2 is connected to the switch_L1. Here is my code:but when I run my topology, I face an error:It seems that the mapping is not taking place correctly. What can I do as a solution?
Your problem is the scope of the variable cmap.This declaration inside the build method has only local scope.If you want to use a global inside a function you need to use the keyword global.
