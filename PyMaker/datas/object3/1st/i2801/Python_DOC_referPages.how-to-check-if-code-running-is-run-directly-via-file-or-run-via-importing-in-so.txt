This question already has an answer here:What does if __name__ == “__main__”: do?                    27 answers                I am trying to make a CLI and GUI for a appliaction in which I am using my CLI to perform task and return string for my GUI and give output.But problem is when I import my CLI it first takes input as it should when it is run from direct CLI, but I do not want it to take input from CLI when running from GUI.So, for this is there any way from which I can check if the CLI script is run directly or from CLI or is imported in some file and then being run.this is an example what I did:cli.pygui.pyWhen I run this this asks me to input in CLI first and then give CLI output and then run the GUI
You should add your logic in to main function and then at the bottom of the file add'main' is the name of the scope in which top-level code executes. A module’s __name__ is set equal to '__main__' when read from standard input, a script, or from an interactive prompt.https://docs.python.org/3/library/main.html
OR to create a class:gui.py:cli.py:
