This question already has an answer here:Accessing values in nested dictionary                    4 answers                I have a huge dictionary called Menu. Here's a snippet of it:I am trying to get the value of the key by looking for PLUFor example:If I want 'PLU:59'. I want 'breadsticks' and 'Appetizer' to show up.So far I can only try fetching the data by manually searching for it.that is byAny suggestions will help!Please feel free to ask me to clarify anything.
You can use recursion with a generator to find the path of keys leading to the desired 'PLU' value:Output:
If you want a strictly python solution with your dictionary, you can iterate over all the courses and search for a specific valueNote that this solution uses python's type hints. You can remove them if you are not using them. 
Data structures are everything.  You want to eventually have this:Give you this:So you should make a single pass through your original data structure to create a new one like so:Then you will have efficient lookup by PLU.
Solution from pandas 

Loop through the keys down recursively until you find the right PLU value.Generally, if you are searching for data in a data structure, you want to loop through it. Access the key directly when you know the path to the key.
This may be overkill for this problem, but you could define a recursive function for filtering a nested dictionary for certain key/value pairs and return the segment of the dict that contains them.This works with arbitrarily nested dicts and with arbitrary keys, and will also handle multiple matches, e.g., if you changed another of the PLU values to 59, the result will be
I'll add another general recursive solution to this problem which will work for arbitrary key-value pairs in the data structure you presented.By calling:You'll get the following result:The variable result contains the "breadcrumb" for the answer (the ancestors and the key that contains the value 59). To only get the "ancestors" of "PLU" and display them in the order you asked for, you can do the following:Which will give you:
