I am finding it difficult to understand how the following code works:the code above gives a correct result of 15, but shouldn't "i" be used after it is declared and not before?
Read the documentation on generator expressions.You will see that you are (effectively) creating a mini generator equivalent to:
Python is an untyped language.That means you do not need to declare the variables such as i.You can give a bit more clarity to compiler , and your understanding by doing the edit:So, Python is just very smart in giving type to variables, and flexible too as compared to static C code.
In this particular case (list-compherensions) the syntax allows to do so
Because of the Syntax of sum() ... iterable and a start positionsum(i, start)You can take an look with examples there --> https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/methods/built-in/sum
