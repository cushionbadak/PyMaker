I have an XML file in the following format:I am able to parse tags in the item element usingBut I cannot retrieve the tags under WorkerInfo using for item in root.findall('WorkerInfo').  What would be best way to get to this element?  
Just add another loop like below. Also my indenting might be off.
It look like WorkerInfo contains nested elements, and your first line for item in foot.findall('item'): will only loop over top level elements. So, at some point item will be set to WorkerInfo, but that is not the same as being set to its sub-elements. You will need a nested loop to loop over those. Try this:
To get to WorkerInfo and retrieve its tags, you can use a similar structure. Just call findall() passing in 'WorkerInfo' and loop through its children.With your example, row becomes ['Country', 'JobTitle', 'Region']
