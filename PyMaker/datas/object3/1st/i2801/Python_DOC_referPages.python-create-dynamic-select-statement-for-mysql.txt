In my MySQL database I have 10 tables.  Based on the user input, I want to select the rows from one of the table.  The user input is an image.  I am getting the number of columns and rows of pixels the image has and storing it in a variable.  the mysql tables are created basis the area of the image, and hence, depending on the area, I want to select the values from a specific table.I am getting the following error:However, when I pass on a single query within cur.execute I am able to retrieve the results.
current your variable sql is tuple, so if you want to pass it as parameters to the execute you should use *you can read more in the doc unpacking-argument-lists
this should fix your problem. You need to use % not comma in the queries inside if else.
