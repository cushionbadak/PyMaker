I am trying to make a discord bot that will log the edited or deleted messages.At some point the program is considring the author id as string for some reason.the code of on_message_editdoesn't work like the on_message codewhen I am on the on_message I mention the author like this at it worksbut when I tried to do the same mentioning method on the on_message_edit it didn't work. I did and I get this error 
You need to move the %sIn your case you wantIf you're on Python3.6+, f-strings are even cleaner
Operator % has higher precedence than +. See the docs on operator precedence.So a code which does a + b % c evaluates b % c first.In your code, that would mean, the first thing evaluated is ' `` ' % (MemberId) and that fails because there is no %s in ' `` ':This could be fixed by adding parenthesis around everything before %, e.g.:But that is still a rather poor way to do it.For example, it fails if there is a % in before.content or in after.content. It also fails if MemberId is a tuple.This would be correct:This would be even better:
