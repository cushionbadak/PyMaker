You can try using strftime and then to split on '-' as given inside strftime('%Y-%m-%d-%H') function. The code: If you want all the columns in a single dataframe use pd.concat() along axis=1.
Maybe:
One flexible approach is to use operator.attrgetter with pd.concat. Such an approach enables you to specify an arbitrary list of properties, which are then extracted via the pd.Series.dt accessor.Setup
