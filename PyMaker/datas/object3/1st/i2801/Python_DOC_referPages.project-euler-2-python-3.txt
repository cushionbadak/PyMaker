Why won't this work for me? I'm sure my code is correct:I have checked over the code many times yet it still tells me there is a syntax error.Problem reference: https://projecteuler.net/problem=2
The problem lies in the line:You seem to need to add 1 to iter instead of 0. Hope this helps!
So I run your code and got this:Accordingly to this link, How to read a traceback,The last line will show the actual problem that caused the crash:(IndentationError should be self explanatory).Keep reading up the traceback you should have good hints where the error could be.Then read this piece of PEP about indentation rules. Basically use 4 spaces per indentation level and prefer spaces over tabs (and don't mix them).
