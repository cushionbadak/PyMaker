Natural Text
I have a multi-line document, from which I have to extract a specific part. ID: 58101 \n LOCATIONS: Yerevan, Armenia \n  _info:  Aregak was established in 1997 by United Methodist Committee on Relief, an international NGO is headquartered in New-York, NY, USA.  In 2006 Aregak UCO CJSC obtained license to carry out full range  credit services in Armenia. The organization operates in ten marzes of  Armenia and throughout Nagorno Karabakh. Aregak Head Office is located  in Yerevan. \n START_DA: 28 November 2013Now this is what I ame up with "^_info:(\n|.)*START_DA:" Problem is it highlights start_da as well. I want to make it like whatever the word there is if it detects a ":" at the end of the word, (START_DA:) stop and not include that word. So my target is in layman terms from _info: to ..headoffice is located in Yerevan. Please advice. 
You can make START_DA: part of a positive lookahead expression instead:
