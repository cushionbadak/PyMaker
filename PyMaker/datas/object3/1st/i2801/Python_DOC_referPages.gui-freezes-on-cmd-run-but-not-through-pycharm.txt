So I've been looking at this for quite some time and can't figure this problem out.The goal here is to have it display realtime results line by line from the cmd/ terminal into the tkinter ScrolledText/Text widget, which it does except when ran through the cmd on Windows.I am running the code on both Linux (Kali) and Windows 10. If I run it using Pycharm on Windows 10 then it will run smoothly and the GUI won't freeze waiting for the code run using Pexpect.If I run the code through the cmd (python tmp_stack.py) then it will freeze the GUI until Pexpect finishes running the file I asked it to.On Linux terminal the code runs fine and doesn't freeze (after adjusting it for Linux).I combined multiple files into tmp_stack.py to prevent the need to create more files for no real reason.I have tested that the configuration runs the same on both Windows and Linux.Side note: I don't mind changing to subprocess.Popen and I don't mind using threading if it won't complain about main loop and will work.requirements.txt - pexpect==4.6.0op.py:oscheck.py:tmp_stack.py:
Try running the child Python process with output buffering disabled.In other words, try replacing the linewithSee also the Python documentation for the -u option.
