Natural Text
Have tried many ways, such as printing line by line:print (" ------- ")print ("|       |")print ("|       |")print (" ------- ")Also with * ,print ("********")print ("*      ")print ("      *")print ("********")Personally, I think the dashes (-) look more smooth than the stars(*). Any other ways to do this?
Which of these would you rather have:Unless you need to output pure ASCII for some reason—or you're going for that retro APPLE ][ look—you should draw boxes with box-drawing characters. And it's really not much harder than drawing them with hyphens and pipes and other things not meant to be used for line drawing:It's sometimes even easier to grab a library off PyPI that does what you want, like terminaltables for drawing tables with borders, or asciitree for drawing trees like the DOS and Unix tree commands, etc.Or, depending on what you're trying to do, maybe you actually wanted to write a curses or urwid or similar full-screen console app, and let it draw boxes around your windows.
Guff way:
