I'm having a hell of a hard time trying to figure out why my print(Node(3).value) is printing 0. Any ideas?When I run this code, I getAny ideas? I know I'm not saving the Nodes anywhere but my mind can't wrap around it.Any help would be appreciated, thanks!
Statementcreates Node object with data set to 3 & value set to 0 (default argument), so when you're getting its value it returns 0.If you want to create Node objects and then re-use them -- you should store them in some sort of container.Assuming thatdata field is a hashable unique identifier of Node,if Node has been created and we're passing different value -- old value persistsI see at least 2 approaches here:Create container on the top level, explicitly add Nodes to it upon creation and access them using it afterwards likegives usExtension of previous approach: restrict Nodes creation using global function which caches already created ones:(note: here we're using "hack" with mutable default argument, more info may be found in this thread)Then everywhere when we need to create/access Node object -- we should use this function only likethis will give us the same output as before.Further improvementschanging valueIf our assumption about value being persistent turns out to be wrong -- we can simply add changing of value if it was passed like:in first approach:in second approach: set value parameter's default value to None and check if it was specified likeinheriting from objectIf we're working in Python 3 -- there is no need to specify object as base class, it will be set by default (see this thread), so instead ofwe can simply writeuse for-loop instead of whileWe don't need to use while-loop & increment i by hand when we have for-loop and range objects, so instead ofwe can writealso I think here is a typo, because we're skipping case with i equal to n - 1, so we can fix it:finally we can see that there is no need in i index when we can use zip built-in & iterate over pairs of first & second lists elements like
