Inputting 'w(here)' into the IPDB or RDB will print out a stack trace.  Is there a way to do this without entering set_trace()?  I guess what I'm imagining would be something like print(w), or otherwise simply printing the stacktrace at the point where I set_trace(). 
traceback.print_stack() is what you want, it will print current call stack start from sys._getframe(), see more on its doc.
