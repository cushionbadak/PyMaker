There are two columns in a CSV file:Now I update the csv and add a new rowI want to get only the newly added element. So, I am trying this:Now, my question is how to get the newly added element from column two? Thanks for your help!Update:The newly added elements can be anywhere in the list (not just the end) -- sorry for the confusion! 

If you know that the "newly added elements" are always appended to the end of the list, then just slice from the length of the old list onward. i.e.
You will need to get indexes that are not present in first one, so use just sets without symmetric_difference. Use enumerate() to get indexes easier.
