How do I create a special method __repr__ where I can print, for example, '6 of spades' or 'Q of diamonds'?How do I access the data from the namedtuple, keeping in mind that I have a list of namedtuples in self._cards?
It seems like your issue right now is that you are trying to make the __repr__ method inside of your Deck class. That method will only get called when you are trying to print Deck objects, however it seems like you are trying to print a message for a single Card instead. You could solve this by making a simple Card class with suit and rank as class variables, and storing a list of Card objects in your deck. This way you could write a __repr__ method for the card class itself, and reference the card's suit and rank directly. 
You could use typing.NamedTuple instead, which allows you to define methods normally:
It would be clearer if you renamed cards to Card, since that's the name you assigned to that class:You can extend a namedtuple just like any other class, including to give it __repr__ method. You can even reuse the class name, since a class statement is a type of assignment:A more compact version would be
