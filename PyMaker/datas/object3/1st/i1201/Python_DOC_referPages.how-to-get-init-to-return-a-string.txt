Here I am trying to return a string but constructor can only return a None value. Is there any way around it?In this code I have to use multiple inheritance to access the values of the two super classes, into a single derived class but the constructor of the first super class can't return a string. Is there any way around it.
You can't. You are breaking python rules by trying to: See documentation of object.__init__():Because __new__() and __init__() work together in constructing objects (__new__() to create it, and __init__() to customize it), no non-None value may be returned by __init__(); doing so will cause a TypeError to be raised at runtime.(emphasis mine)
I think this is what you are expecting  I am using special method of __str()__
