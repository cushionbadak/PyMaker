I want to calculate a value in the class that stays the same for all instances of that class and is calculated only oncefirst, What should I set as reference for calculate_a() in a = calculate_a() ?self.calculate_a() and A.calculate_a() both are not correct (unresolved reference)what I need is, when the second instance is created, the calculate_a() is not called again.
Class members are only initialized once - they are initialized before (and without) instances being created.You can test this yourself:Executing this prints 'Calculated' once, even without any creation of instances. Executing this print's 'Calculated' only once - and it does so right before asking for 'Order?' - after inputting the program ends wihtout any more outputs.
