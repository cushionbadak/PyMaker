Explanation: The BOM is the byte order mark (q.v.). If Excel finds it at the beginning of the CSV file, it uses it to determine the encoding, which in your case is UTF-8 (the default encoding – correctly – for Python 3).EDITAs Mark Tolonen pointed out, the compact version of the above is the following code:The -sig in the name of the encoding stands for “signature”, i.e., the BOM at the beginning which is used by Microsoft software to detect the encoding. See also the Encodings and Unicode section of the codecs manual.
You system seems to be writing the file encoded as UTF-8.  Excel expects UTF-8 files to have a BOM signature, else it assumes a text file is encoded in a locale-specific ANSI encoding.  This is for backward compatibility due to Windows existing before UTF-8 did.Python has an encoding that writes the UTF-8 BOM signature, utf-8-sig, so simply use:
UPDATE:I've fixed this situation from the following answer in the link below..https://stackoverflow.com/a/6488070/10675615Save the exported file as a csv in the cmd promptOpen ExcelImport the data using Data-->Import External Data/ Get Text/CSV --> Import DataSelect the file type of "csv" and browse to your fileIn the import wizard change the File_Origin to "65001 UTF" (or choose the correct language character identifier)Change the Delimiter to commaSelect where to import to and Finish This way the special characters should show correctly.**
