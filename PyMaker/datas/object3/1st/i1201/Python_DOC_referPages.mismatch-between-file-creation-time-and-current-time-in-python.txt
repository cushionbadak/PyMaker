Why is the file creation time less than the time measured before it is created?Edit OS is Linux
Since OS module is from CPython and designed initally for the python2.x versions. If you run your code in 2.7 version it returns the same value for before_creation and creation_time. Since, the result islimited to 2 decimal places only in 2.x version.  eg., 1545073155.03Also, you have to note that when you do print(os.stat('my_file'))  we get posix.stat_result(st_mode=33204, st_ino=12, st_dev=1792, st_nlink=1,st_uid=488, st_gid=487, st_size=0, st_atime=1545073155,st_mtime=1545073155, st_ctime=1545073155)And if you doprint(os.stat('my_file')[9]) we get 1545073155 As far assolution, you might have to use the time.time() to get the time aftercreation.  Considering this there might be a bug during theconversion from int to float of the st_ctime.
