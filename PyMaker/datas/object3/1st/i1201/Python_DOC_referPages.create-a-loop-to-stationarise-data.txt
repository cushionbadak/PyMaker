My problem is: Currently my code runs the dickey fuller test and differences the data if the p-value is greater than 0.05, but I need it to re-run the dickey-fuller test again and difference the data again if the p-value is still greater than 0.05, and continue doing so until the condition that the p-value is less than 0.05 is satisfiedI have a dataframe of time series data.  In order to determine whether it is stationary, I have performed the dickey fuller test using the following code:In the Dickey Fuller test, if the p-value is greater than 0.05 this means the data is not stationary and the data can be differenced to make it stationary. I want to create a loop such that the dickey-fuller test is run and if the p-value is greater than 0.05, then the data is differenced and this continues until the p-value is less than 0.05.This is what I have written so far:
You might want to check up on while loops and do-while loops in general, not just python. You want the loop to continue forever until the diff results in a test < 0.05. What if it's exactly 0.05?Further reading on break statement.
