I don't understand how I would print the data that I have queried from a database.For example:So I created this function to select all products in a database that are still in stock. But how do I display these products in the database to the user?
Once you've executed a query, you need to fetch the result. Either with fetchone (fetches one result row), fetchmany (fetches multiple rows) or fetchall fetches all of them. E.g.:
You can treat the cursor as an iterator, or get results from the cursor using fetchone() or fetchall() ie: print(cursor.fetchone())If you are only executing a SELECT statement, you don't need to commit.
