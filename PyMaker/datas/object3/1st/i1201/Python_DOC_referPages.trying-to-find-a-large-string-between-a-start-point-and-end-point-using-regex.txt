Natural Text
I have a big chunk of text that I'm checking for a specific pattern, which looks essentially like this:My text variable is named 'html_page' and my start and end points look like this:I thought I could find what I want with this one-liner:However, it's not returning anything at all.  What is wrong here?  I saw other examples online that worked fine.
There are multiple problems here.As mentioned by @EthanK in comments, "start(.+?)end" in Python is a string which describes regex which literally matches start, then something, and then literally matches end. Variables start and end do not matter here at all.You've probably meant to write start + "(.+?)" + end here instead.. in Python does not match newlines. re.MULTILINE does not matter here, it only changes behavior of ^ and $ (see docs). You should use re.DOTALL instead (see docs).Values of start and end include characters with special meaning in regex (e.g. ( and [). You have to make sure they're not treated specially. You can either escape them manually with the right number of \ or simply delegate that work to re.escape to get regular expression which literally matches what you need.Combining all that together:
