I'm looking to rename my files from time to time in numerical order, so for example, 1.png, 2.png., 3.png, etcI wrote this code in an attempt to do so, I simply ended it with by printing what the files would be named to make sure it was right:How would I go by solving this? 
You keep on getting 1.png suggested as the new name because you always set f_name = 1 inside the loop. Initialize it with 1 before the loop, and then increment it as you are renaming each file instead.A few additional points:You don't need os.chdir because even if the default is . – the current dir –, you can also supply the target path to os.filelist.When dealing with user home directories, it's nice if you don't have to hardcode it. os.path.expanduser retrieves this value for you.When iterating over lists that you possibly want to change, it's best to make a separate list of only the items that you want to change. So, rather than looping over all files and changing some of them, make it easier by first gathering all items that you want to change. In your case, make a list of only .png files and then loop over this list.(Rather advanced) os.rename will throw an error if you try to rename to an already existing name. What I do below is check if the next name to be used is already in the list, and if it is, increase the f_name number.
I'm not sure why you need to use os.chdir() to change directories, when you can just pass the path straight to os.listdir(). To rename files, you can use os.rename(). You also need to increment the counter for the file names, since your current code you keep fname equal to 1 on each iteration. You need to keep the counter outside the loop and increment it within the loop. This is where you can useenumerate(), since you can use indexing instead. Basic version:You can get the full paths using os.path.join(), since os.listdir() doesn't include the full path of the file. The above code is also not very robust as it renames all files, and doesn't handle renaming already existent .png files.Advanced version:Which uses os.path.exists() to check if the file already exists.
use os.rename
