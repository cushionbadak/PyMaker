You can specify a sorting key and use the sorting for tuples: [(1,1),(1,2)]: Tuples are sorted by 1st element, on equality by 2nd to nth:This ensures it is first sorted by the 'lower' character - grouping a and A  together and then by the actual character afterwards so they occure sorted as well: ABaaAAaAaAAAB =>  AAAAAAAaaaaBBReadups:Overviewby key (part of the first link)A simple key = str.lower as suggested in the allegated dupe does not group A to A and a to a which would be nice to have for Prunnet squaresIf you had them rather stay in order of occurence then grouping lower- and uppercase together, you can use:results in keeping the elements "in order":and is described in case-insensitive list sorting, without lowercasing the result?
You can pass in a key to the sorting function:
