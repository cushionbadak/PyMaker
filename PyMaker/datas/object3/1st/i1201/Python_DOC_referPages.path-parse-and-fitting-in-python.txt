I need your help to solve this problem using python. I have a .txt file called good_files.txt within which each line is a path that leads to a new file (good_files.txt and the directory which contain the files are in the same directory) . In each of these files, there are three columns of data that I will have to unite all together to make the curve fittinge.g the sctructure of the file is like this.So I have to eliminate the first 2 lines keeping the 3 columns and then eliminate the third colums, keeping only the first two.The first colums is my x coordinates and the second column is contain my y coordinates.With my x and y and the error function erf I have to do the curve fitting.For now the only code that I have written is for reading the good_files.txtSorry but I am a noob in coding, for now. Thaks for your help, guys <3
You could use Pandas to help reading and combining the csv-files. Assuming that your ReadFromFile function gives you a good list of filenames, you could do something like this:This should give you a dataframe with the x and y column.
