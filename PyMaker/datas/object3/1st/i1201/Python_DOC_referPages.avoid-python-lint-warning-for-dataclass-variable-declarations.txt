I am having a try of the dataclasses feature in Python 3.7, but get this warning below word 'hue':I suppose it is a linter warrning. I tried several linters that python extension provided, but none of them work.Is there a way to have syntax checking etc enabled but avoid receiving this warning?warning using pep8warning using pylint or mypy
You can set "python.analysis.disabled": ["use-before-def"] to disable the check (docs). The mis-classification of this as an issue has been reported.
