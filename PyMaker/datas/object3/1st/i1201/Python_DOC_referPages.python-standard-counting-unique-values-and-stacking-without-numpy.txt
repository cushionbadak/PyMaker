I have a my_list which looks like this: Now, I want to count the number of unique IP Adresses and stack them together with their counts. The result should be a list and look like this: I have code that does this with numpy arrays:I cannot use numpy as it is not installed on the server I am running it on. How would I do this using Python standard libraries and only lists? 
This should do the job:
You can use collections.Counter:Output
Counter is good but if you are interested in a more in depth implementation you can use a dictionary and keep track of the counts as you traverse the IPs.This is a good exercise but a cleaner approach definitely uses a counter.
