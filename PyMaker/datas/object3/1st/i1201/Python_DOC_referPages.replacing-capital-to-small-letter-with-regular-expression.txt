Natural Text
I want to replace I and A with lower case, using regex. (I already coded this using sent.lower(), which works fine. I want to know how to do the same by using regex) 
You should pass in a function as the replacement. The function will return the corresponding replacement for a given match object.I think \b (word boundary) here is more suitable than matching a space before the capital letter.
