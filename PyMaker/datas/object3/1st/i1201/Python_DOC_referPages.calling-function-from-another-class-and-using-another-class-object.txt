I have two classes. One class creates model(Say class A) (This is time taking function, so to remove this time delay I need to use GraphPipe client server library).Another class(Say Class B) is from Graphpipe, this class receive request from client, use model generated to class 1 and give response back to client. I am calling Class A in main function and get model trained. obj is it's object.Currently problem is, classify_demo is in MyDict so I am not able to call it from GPHandler class. Can anyone help me to manage this situation in standard programming way?Let me know if any thing is unclear or question for me.Here is the code - 
You can define classify_demo as a static method, using the @staticmethod decorator.Therefore, in GPGHandler class, you can call directly MyDict.classify_demo(json.dumps(query)).Unfortunately I do not find your question very clear. Perhaps you should clarify a little bit.
