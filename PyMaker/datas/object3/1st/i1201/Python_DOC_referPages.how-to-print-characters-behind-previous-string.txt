You can change cursor position using:You can find its description here:Python 3 libraryHowever using write methods overwrite stdout, therefore you need to remember output somehow.Solution example:But when you aren't redirecting output to file stdout is not seekable. You can find reasonthere.
Try this:or this:both give the same result and the code is here:https://onlinegdb.com/BJGCJQml4
Is this supposed to be in an interactive environment? If yes, you'd have to deal with whatever the library you uses provides to control output. For the regular standard library, you can use the carriage return character \r to overwrite. Play around with:The line sys.stdout.write(msg1) produces the output Hello World while the line sys.stdout.write("\r{}{}".format(msg2, msg1)) moves the cursor back to the beginning of the line, prints Im Back Here! followed by Im Back Here!. I added a newline just to avoid messing up the shell window.If you want the exact same output that you specified, with Hello World appearing twice (the first time followed by a newline), you can start with sys.stdout.write("{}\n".format(msg1)), which would produce the output):
