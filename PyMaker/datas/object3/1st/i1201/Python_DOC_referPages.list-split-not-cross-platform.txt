Is the list.split() not cross platform?
Use os.sepEx:
A more "universal" way to do it is by using os.path.split(). This splits the path at the last separator. The first part must be treated iteratively or recursively.Under Windows, think of splitting the drive letter as well.Something likeshould do it, but I don't have Windows at hand and cannot test it.
If you want to be super safe, you should use repeatedly os.path.split, or test for both os.sep and os.altsep as separator.__file__ will always use os.sep, but when you get a path from other code or by direct input from a user, chances are that os.altsep ('/' on Windows) is used.Example on Windows:Alternatively:and
