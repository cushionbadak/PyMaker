I'm suppose to write a code using arrays and inputs then split the list from people above 16 and people below 16. but can't seem to get the code to print every input. it only wants to print the last input I did. Here is what I have so far:
That is because, you are overwriting B2 in the line B2 = int(B[i]) at every single iteration of i inside the for loop ( for i in range (10): ) The following code should work:In the above code A is a list which stores all the names as strings. B is another list which stores all ages as int data types.
Your code does ignore 16y olds and has some other problems. You can either filter the input directly after input into two seperate lists (under_16,over_15) or simply throw all into one list (all_studs) and filter them later using list comprehensions or filter-function :Output (for input Phil,2,A,19,B,18,C,17,D,16,E,15,F,14,G,13,H,12,I,11,J,10):
It is because you are overwriting B2 since the if condition is outside the for loop. Every time B2 will get overwritten by what input user provides. I don't know what you are trying to do with the printing part . but putting it in loop should fix the problem.
