Django newbie here. I'm on Django 2.1 and was taking tutorials when I saw this line in the settings.py file. What exactly does this line mean? What does os.path.join do?
os.path.join() joins parts of path to a complete, system independant, path.On different operating systems you have different conventions of paths, for example Windows vs Linux.os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static') just joins BASE_DIR which is path to your base Django directory and static, resulting in something like path/to/django/static.
