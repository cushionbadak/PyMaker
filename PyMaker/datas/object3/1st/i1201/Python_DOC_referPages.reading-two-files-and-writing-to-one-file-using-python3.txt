Natural Text
I'm currently using Python 3 on Ubuntu 18.04.  I'm not a programmer by any means and I'm not asking for a code review, however, I'm having an issue that I can't seem to resolve.  I have 1 text file named content.txt that I'm reading lines from.I have 1 text file named standard.txt that I'm reading lines from.I have 1text file named outfile.txt that I'm writing to. I'm not sure where to put the following line though.  My for loop nesting may all be off:  Any code examples to make this work would be most appreciated.  Thank you.  
if i understand good you whant to add outfile_set if this is not empty to the outfile or add the string "\nNo New Content" Replace the lineto
I'm assuming that you want to write "No new content" to the file if every line in content is in standard. So you might do something like:Your original code was almost there!
You can reduce your runtime a lot by using set/frozenset:You can read more about it here:set operator list (python 2 - but valid for 3 - can't find this overview in py3 doku set differenceDemo:Output:or
