I am trying to understand quick search algorithm in pyhton. Here is the code I am working on:Then I am calling this function defining a variable. For example:MY question is that when I try to print b after the function call, it prints as [1,4,5]. So, how come the value of this array is changing within the function??? It is not a global variable. Whey the local variables inside the function overrides it?? Please help
When you provide a list as a function argument you are passing a pointer to that list, meaning the parameter a isn't its own array, but a pointer to b.  What you are looking to do is provide only the items of the array b to randomized_quick_sort()This can be done by making the following adjustment:randomized_quick_sort (b[:], 0, 2);Notice b[:] instead of b. Now, when you print b after calling the function you will have the same values as you did before.You can find more information about this here
