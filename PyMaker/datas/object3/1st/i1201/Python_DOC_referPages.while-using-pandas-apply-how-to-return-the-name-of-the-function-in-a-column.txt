Assume the following pandas dataframe:And the following function:I am applying sum function to the pandas dataframe as follows:How can return the name of the function in another column? For instance the expected output would look like this:The reason is that I would like to keep track on what applied on each value.
If you want to get the function name, another option is using f.__name__. Example:I assume you are already familiar with the pitfalls of using apply this way. I've written this under the assumption that your function is a stand-in for something a lot more complex. But in general, you should try to vectorize where possible.If you want more flexibility naming the output column, you can add a keyword argument name:
You may check inspect
If you need to use the name of your function, use a dictionary as a dispatcher. This is clean and reliable. It avoids having to shadow the built-in sum function, which is not recommended.With Pandas, you should avoid pd.Series.apply, as this represents an inefficient Python-level loop. In this case, your function can be trivially vectorised by redefining apply_func:
