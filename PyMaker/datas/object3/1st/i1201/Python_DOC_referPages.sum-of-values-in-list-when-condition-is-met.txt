I have a python list l containing instances of the class Element:Now I want to sum all value members of the classes Elements if their id is equal to obtain this list:What is the most pythonic way to do this?
There is (almost?) nothing that itertools cannot do. Take a look at groupby:which results in:
One way would be to create a defaultdict that maps ids to sums of values.  Then we can take those results and use them to build a new list of Elements.  One way to do that is to use starmap to map the items of that dictionary to the arguments to Element
You could also get the desired result using set to get just the unique ids and sum to total the values. For example:
