Would it be possible to use argparse without any flags?For example, whenever no flags (-u or -i in this case) are provided, I would like the script to process the first argument sys.argv[1] as IP Address.The codeNormal outputMy desired output even if no flags (-u or -i) provided.If there is better alternative, please let me know.
You may use ArgumentParser.parse_known_args()The disadvantage of this is that it wont show up on the help (unless you include it somewhere or modify the HelpFormatter).An other solution is to use a mutually exclusive group with a positional arguments that uses nargs='?':So that when trying to specifying both a positional argument and -i you get the error:This will show that you can either use -i IP or the positional argument, although the syntax might be slightly difficult to read to people not used to the commandline:
You could do something like this:Here we use the options as a way to specify the type and make location a required argument.  The type will default to ip, so it gives the default behavior you require, but you can use both -i and -u to be more explicit.
