I am writing test files for a Python module and I need block B's side effect while testing A.my question is that how to replace class B in test file.following the instruction of accepted answer. I finish my tests tws/main.pytest/test_mock.pyit will print mock,hope it will help other people with same problems.
As suggested in the comments, you can mock out class B by using unittest.mock - in particular patch(). You can use patch() as a decorator on your test method, making sure you add an extra argument to receive the mocked class B:Note that the path you pass to the decorator must be the path to where B is used (the same module containing class A) not the path to where class B is defined. See Where to patch for more info on that.
