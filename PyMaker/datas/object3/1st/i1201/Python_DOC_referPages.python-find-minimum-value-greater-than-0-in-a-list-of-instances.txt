I have a list of instances (of Process class) named process_list. I'm strugling to find min value of attribute l_time greater than 0.This is how my class looks: I tried something like:it gives an error : TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'Process' and 'Process'Do I have to write a __gt__function somehow or is there a way to do it using lambda?
Use the key parameter of min:Output
