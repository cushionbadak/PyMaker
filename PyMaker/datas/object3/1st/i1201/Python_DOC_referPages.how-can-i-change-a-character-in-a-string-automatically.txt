Natural Text
I am trying to make an encrypting program. So far, I have only been able to change the order. How can I make it change a character to another character ?Ex;   'n' => '&', 'a' => '*', etcI have tried to make a variable array to change the character.
Can't you just try replace method on stringsomething likeFor multiple replacing use
If you're just making a simple cipher program (not anything for actual production,) I would suggest converting each letter to to ascii code as seen here http://www.asciitable.com/ by using ord(), shifting by adding a number, and converting back to text with chr().
