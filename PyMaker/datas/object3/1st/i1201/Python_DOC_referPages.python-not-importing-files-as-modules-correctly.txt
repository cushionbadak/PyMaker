I am trying to get Python code to work on a web browser using the CGI module, as well as some other file modules that I am trying to import into the main program.My initial program, which works as required, is the following:In the same folder as this program, I have a Python file called "_serverTestModules" containing:If I then add:to the original file, both of which are in the same directory, and attempt to access the function from the original code, I get this error:So basically my test program works, but as soon as I try to import functions from other files which are in the same directory (something which I need for my main project), the code fails. Is this a problem with the computer system or the network? Every other answer I have seen on Stack Overflow has either had no answer or an incorrect answer, so any help is much appreciated.
