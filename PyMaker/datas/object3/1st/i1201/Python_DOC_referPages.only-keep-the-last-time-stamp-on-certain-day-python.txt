Hey sorry for being a rookie with python, just need a point in the right direction.Here is the data i am working with:What i need to do is only keep the last entry for each day. Is it wise take the values which are stored in a numpy array and append them to a list. Will this be my best option? I ask because I know I cannot delete values from a numpy array. Just curious if this will be easier to do this from a list or numpy array?
I noticed that your times are ordered.  If that is the case, you may simply convert to dict to keep the last entry:If the ordering is not reliable, do not sort - this will degrade time complexity down to O(n log n) for what is an O(n) task. Instead, you should build a dict (keys are dates, and values are lists of times) and take maxima for the dict values.
If that is an option, you can use some of the facilities in pandas dataframes.The following makes two assumptions:Your data have been sorted by time stamps;You have added an extra column on which to group, which will discard the time from the time stamp so that you can group by day.
If your data is not sorted, you could also store your dates in collections.defaultdict(), then take the maximum datetime:The above uses datetime.datetime.strptime() to get the maximum datetime, as specified in the key parameter. If your data is already sorted, you can take advantage of itertools.groupby():
