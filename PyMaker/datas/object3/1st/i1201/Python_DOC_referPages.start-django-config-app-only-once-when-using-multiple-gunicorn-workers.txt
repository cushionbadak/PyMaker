I'm using :python 3.6 django==2.1.1gunicorn==19.9.0i have done the following:created a django project called api created an apiapp (an app in my project) and i have this code in api_app's apps.py :and the following in api_app's __init__.py:i'm creating an API so i am required to use multiple workers when deploying:now, my issue is that the function job which is called when the server is started, is getting called 10 times because i'm using 10 gunicorn workers, i would like to call it only onceanother thing that i would like to do is to have the settings.SHARED_VARIABLE variable, shared between the different workers. this variable will be updated only by the worker that will launch the app.py on server start.Thank you ! 
gunicorn has a setting to do this: --preloadSo, after I add this in settings.py: SHARED_VARIABLE = 'content of SHARED_VARIABLE' (and fixed apiapp/__init__.py to use the real app name), I can run gunicorn with the application loaded only once:
