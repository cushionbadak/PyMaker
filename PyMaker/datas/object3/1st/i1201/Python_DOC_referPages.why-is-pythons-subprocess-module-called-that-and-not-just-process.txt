I am new to threading and processes. I have been trying to understand asyncio.  Researching asyncio on Doug Hellinger's Python Module of the Week section of Concurrency, I ran into the multiprocessing, threading, signal and subprocess modules.I have been wondering why the name subprocess module was named thus. Why is the module not called process. And what is 'sub' [meaning below] about it?  Edit: Forgotten additionThere's a Popen class and I assume the 'P' stands for process. The Github code comment says:Popen(...): A class for flexibly executing a command in a new processDoesn't the existence of the Popen class, give more reason to call the module process instead of subprocess? 
Processes in most operating systems form a parent-child relationship. Processes created by another process are called child processes or subprocesses of that process:A child process in computing is a process created by another  process (the parent process). This technique pertains to multitasking  operating systems, and is sometimes called a subprocess or  traditionally a subtask.Python subprocess module provides facilities to create new child processes (i.e. every process created with this module will be subprocess of your Python program):The subprocess module allows you to spawn new processes, connect to  their input/output/error pipes, and obtain their return codes.It does not deal with arbitrary processes, so it makes sense to name it subprocess instead of just process.
subprocess provides an API for creating and communicating with secondary processes. The "sub" in the module name refers to the fact that all processes you are going to start here will be child processes of your running Python process. They exist to support your Python code.
