What is the purpose of using [0] in random.choices()? Does [0] refer to index of Lists or of its sub-lists in the example code below? If I use [0], I get the single random word from the lists, which is the desired result, but if I omit [0], it gives the random sub-list with all of its elements.Why it is giving the different result for the two cases?If I try [1] instead of [0], The code gives index error: index out of rangeBut if I use [0] or [-1], code gives the desired result.
You're using random.choices instead of random.choice, which returns a list with a single element instead of the element itself. See here:Calling [0] on it returns the element, while [1] is out of range because there's only one element. You probably wanted to use random.choice (without the s), right?BTW, random.choices is Python 3.6+.
