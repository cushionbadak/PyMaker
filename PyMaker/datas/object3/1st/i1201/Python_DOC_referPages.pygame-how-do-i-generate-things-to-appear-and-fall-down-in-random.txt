I'm trying to build a game something like, balls are coming down randomly and the boy in the bottom catch the ball. I made a row of balls on top in a random manner, but I'm not sure how to make them appear randomly and fall down individually. baseball_game.pyball.pygame_functions.pySo the first row of balls are randomly placed on top, but how do I make it to appear not all at once, and falling down separately? 
Since you mention that you want the balls to fall down individually, we can think of each ball having two states: "falling" and "not falling". We can adjust the update and __init__ functions for ball.py accordingly:Now we just need some way of triggering the falling property in each ball randomly. In game_functions.py, you have a method that updates the balls. We could add some function there to randomly decide whether we want a ball to drop, and which ball we want to drop:
Make a variable called RNG and set it to generate random numbers between any range let's say between -50 and 50. Then you can make an array called RNG_CASES[] and give them any random constant value in the range that you set for the RNG. Finally, make a conditional structure: 
You could just add new Ball instances to the group if some condition is True (if random.randrange(100) < 2: in the example below). If there should be a maximum number of balls, add and len(balls) < max_balls:. Also, don't forget to kill the sprites when they leave the screen.
