I have excel Data (float) in one column where 20 changes of sings occur in every couple of hundred lines. The list is a couple of thousand lines long but simplyfied it looks like this [5, 4, 3, 2, 1, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, -5, ...].I need lists containing all numbers to the point where a sign change occurs and then start a new list until the next sign change. So in total I want as many  lists returned as there a sign changes. I need those to do numerical integration. I can do that though... Can you give me an example with a short array like the one above? I don't really care if it gives the resluts as the return in a function or defines new variables. Whatever is easier or more elegant. Thanks for the help guys. 
Assuming you want to group by sign, you can use itertools.groupby:Output
