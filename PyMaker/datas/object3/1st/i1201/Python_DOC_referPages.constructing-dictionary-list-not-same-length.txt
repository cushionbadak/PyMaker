I was wondering if it possible to create a dictionary and convert it into a Pandas dataframe where each dictionary key has an array of values, but the array will vary in length.e.g. col3 only has 2 values and all other lists have 3 values. Can I somehow put NaN to "fill" in the missing values and not get an error?

A dictionary isn't strictly required. Using itertools.zip_longest:Notice the pd.DataFrame constructor is smart enough to convert numeric series to numeric, even though each tuple in the input list of tuples contains mixed types.
Sure - you can fill the missing values with numpy.nan:Output
