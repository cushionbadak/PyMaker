I have the following code:This however puts string inside source_objects. I want it to reference the variables (whatever is saved in the variables)meaning what I actually want is equivalent of this:When table = BQ_TABLE_NAME_CATEGORIES When table = BQ_TABLE_NAME_MANUFACTURERS 
you can use the eval() function to turn strings into variable:read on evaloutput:also as noted in comments, you really shouldn't override list, and use mylist or whatever instead
If I understand your question correctly, what you are trying to do is store the values of table_categories and table_manufacturers inside a list called source_objects.Assuming the table_... variables are global,This would get you:And if the table_... variables are not global, use locals().
