I am trying to install python module turtle to my Ren'Py game. However, it will not install even if I clean the cache and download a fresh version of turtle:
The syntax except ValueError, ve: is Python2-syntax and you're installing the module with Python3. The module was not updated since 2009, it's certainly Python2-only.The actual module turtle is a part of the standard library, you don't need to install it, it must always be available.
