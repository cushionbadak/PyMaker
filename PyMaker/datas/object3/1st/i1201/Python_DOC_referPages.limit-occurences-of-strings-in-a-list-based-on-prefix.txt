So the code that I am working on is for an IRC bot, and I want to implement a way to limit channels based on the CHANLIMIT server option. The CHANLIMIT option is a list of limits with the prefix and limit seperated by :, but if there is nothing after the : then there is no limit.The solution below works, but I am looking for any improvements on it.
We can go further :Solution 2But here I have to make an assumption: I supposed that a channel can match at most one element of results. In other words, no two elements of results will match the same channel. Tell me if this is not true for your situation.Here are the changes that I have made: I have created channel_groups using a dictionnary comprehension where every element's value is a list comprehensionI have created modified_channel_groups which contains the elements of channel_groups that have been shortenedI updated the elements of channel_groups with those of modified_channel_groupsI created a lambda expression so that I could include it in modified_channel_groups's definition.I have extracted result_channels using itertools.chain.from_iterable()
There are many ways to approach this problem. Doing some minimal simplifications you could have something like that:Solution 1Here are the changes that I have made: I created channel_groups directly instead of creating a list of tuples (prefix_groups) and then using that to create channel_groupsI iterated group over results instead of iterating over prefix_groupsI didn't checked to see if len(channels) > int(limit) because even if the length of channels is lower than or equal to limit, channels[:limit] will return all of channels
You can even further so that you create your answer channel_groups directly but it becomes more difficult to read. So I don't recommend it:Solution 2aJust a few things to note:channel_groups is created like in Solution 2 but each value of the dictionnary is a list (obtained from a comprehension) that is sliced with the integer value of the current group or None which will mean to take all the values.
When I have to extract some information from strings, I tend to use regular expressions. So extending Solution 2 we can get:Solution 3
But let's backup a little. If I understand correctly, in the end you want a list of the elements of channels_to_test that matches the prefixes and doesn't exceed the limit of a prefix if there's one. You could implement this filtering behaviour in a generator:Solution 4Here are some comments:In this solution, I have put back the requirement that an element of channels_to_test will match only one element of results. It's because of the break statements placed in the generator.What we do is having a dictionnary with the initial limits for each results and decrement each time we encounter a match with an element of channels_to_test. If that value become 0, the generator will skip to the next value. This is what the (optional in this case) continue statement does.
