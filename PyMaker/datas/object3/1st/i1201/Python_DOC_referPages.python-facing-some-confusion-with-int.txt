I was trying out python for the first time, and ended up with a little confusing code. The statement int("9", 16) returned 9 , but int("10", 16) returned 16. Is it supposed to work so, or did I miss something???
second argument of int function is base for conversion "10" in base 16 is 1*16 + 0*1 = 16. for more details see docs
Yes, it is supposed to work like that. int(number, base) returns the integer string number expressed in the base base:You can read the docs here.
between int('9',16) and int('10',16) have int('a',16) - int('f',16).this statement is converts a hexadecimal string to an integer.
