I have list of lists: dep = [['ArithmeticError'], ['ZeroDivisionError', 'ArithmeticError'], ['OSError'], ['FileNotFoundError', 'OSError']] and I need to convert it to dict like: dep = {'ArithmeticError': None, 'ZeroDivisionError': 'ArithmeticError', 'OSError': None, 'FileNotFoundError': 'OSError'}. Also it possible to have list of strings as value with  some names of errors.I saw variants with dict(), but it doesn't work for me because empty values is possible.I tried to use dep = dict(dep), but I have error: "dictionary update sequence element #0 has length 1; 2 is required".
You could add None to the end of each sublist, then take the first two items.e.g. using pprint to print nicelyedit: To perhaps be clearer we could also use itemgetter to give a name to what we're returning:Then the above solution becomes:
You can do this:This works by making the dictionary dep_dict and assigning it's keys to be the values of dep and their values to either None or the second item in the corresponding list.
Just a small check and a generator
You can use a generator with basic conditional. 
There are probably easier ways, but you can use:Output:
