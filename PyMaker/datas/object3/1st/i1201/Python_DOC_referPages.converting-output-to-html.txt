Natural Text
I am making this program:This outputsHow can I enter this output into html, guys?
If you were to put...Into a .html file then load it, it'd work fine. If you want to format it properly with tags directly from the python file, you could change your print() line to, for example...
There is several ways, and depends on what you really want to achieve, so I'll explain couple of options you have:you can add any HTML tags you want in the string "as it's alreadyHTML that doesn't have any tags to format it" but you will have toescape special characters that may break your HTML using built-inModule " html" you can also use third-party modules such as this which can generate HTML for you, and it's usage described briefly in the link.The choice is simple if you have HTML knowledge and want to customize your HTML go for the first option, if not or you want easy solution go for the module.
I'm going to cut you some slack here. The text you have is already perfectly valid HTML. I think you actually want to display the text in a browser (jumping a few steps ahead). You will need a web framework for that; I'm using Flask here, but there are many, with Django being the other major framework (that takes a little more effort to set up).Run this and then type 127.0.0.1:5000 in the browser. There's a lot going on here, but hopefully enough to inspire you and keep you interested. You'll need to Google a lot. You can find more in the quickstart guide for Flask.
