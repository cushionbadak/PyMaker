i have two functions in pythoni have a parameter params defined in my function get_jobs_stateand i want to pass this param to my other function get_jenkins_json_data so that the complete url inside function get_jenkins_json_data joins to https:<jenkins>/api/json?pretty=true&tree=jobs[name,color]But when i run my code the url is not correct and the value of params inside the function is <__main__.CLASS_NAME instance at 0x7f9adf4c0ab8>here base_url is a parameter that i am passing to my script.How can i  get rid of this error?
In your function get_jobs_state you are passing in self as the argument for the params argument to the get_jenkins_json_data, and self in this case is an instance of a class.Try something like this:
Just write params.params instead of params. The way you do it is extremely confusing because in get_jenkins_josn_data, self will be the params and params will be the base_url. I would advise you no to do that in the future. If you want to send some parameters to the function, send the minimal amount of information that the function needs. Here, for example, you could have sent self.params instead of the whole self. This way you wouldn't encounter this error and the code would be much more readable.I suggest you to rewrite this function this way.
So your solution is a bit confusing. You shouldn't pass the self to the get_jenkins_json_data method. The python will do that for you automatically. You should check out the data model for how instance methods work. I would refactor your code like this:
