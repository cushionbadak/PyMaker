OUTPUTI'm assuming the empty list items ('') are the hyphens. My question is, why between a and b are there only two '' and not three like in the input? 
let's replace the empty fields by some string:now you see clearly where the fields are located.You can see that there are only 2 fields between a and b. Special case is at the start of the string, where the empty string at the start is also seen as a field.
str.split uses its argument as a delimiter, and so won't include it in the list it returns.The same goes when using re.split(r'-', test_string), unless you put the pattern in parentheses.  So if you really want to keep the - when splitting a string, I suggest you do something like this:This will print out:If you're wondering why there are a lot of empty strings in this output, it's because re.split will keep whatever is between the - characters, even if they are strings of zero length.A shorter example might help to understand what's going on:This will print out:If you don't want the - characters, then remove the parentheses from r'(-)'.  That is, change r'(-)' to r'-', or just use:
This is default split() function operation.So basically if you separate between to other characters, you always get x-Splitting an empty string with a specified separator returns [''].https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html
