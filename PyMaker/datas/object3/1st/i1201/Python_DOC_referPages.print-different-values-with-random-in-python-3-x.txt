This code gives me 4 values which is ok, but I'd like to have no repetitions. So if program took e.g "White", it won't include it to iteration. Any ideas?
If you have 4 values and you just want a random permutation of them, just use random.shuffle:Another option (especially good with larger lists, because shuffling a list is "slow") is the use of random.sample:
You can check whether that particular value has been taken or not.So what above 4 lines of code do is, maintain a list of already taken values and repeat finding new values until it gets a new one. Hope this helps!
