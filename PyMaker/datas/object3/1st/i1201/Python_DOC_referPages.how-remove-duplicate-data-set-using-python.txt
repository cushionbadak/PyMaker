I have a dataset in this format with each set of data consisting of a unique id (left) and a supplier (right)I want to remove the duplicate set and get a count for each supplier. So the output after the duplicates have been removed would look like this:how could I loop through each data set and remove duplicates and get a count for each supplier id?
You can try using collections.Counter() after converting your list of tuples to a dictionary, which will get rid of the duplicate ids for you. This is because dictionaries can't have duplicate keys. Then you can just count the dictionaries values(). Implementation using dictionary:You could also remove duplicates by using set or frozenset, since tuples are hashable and smaller than dictionaries.Implementation using sets:Which can also be written nicely with operator.itemgetter() and map():Note: The key difference between is that frozenset is immutable, and set is mutable. This means that the contents of frozensets cannot be altered after creation, whereas you can alter sets after creation. 
You can just do thisBy doing this you will get one dict with all your values mapped. For finding count you just need this
For Counting Dulpicates:You can do that using count:For Removing Duplicates:You can first count duplicates and then remove duplicates using these methods :)
