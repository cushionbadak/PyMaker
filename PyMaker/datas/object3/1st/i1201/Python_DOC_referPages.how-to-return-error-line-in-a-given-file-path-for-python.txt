I want File1.py to return the error line in File2.pyFile1.py:the error is on line 2File2.py:ZeroDivisionError: integer division or modulo by zeroIs this possible?
You can do it a little bit ugly with the traceback module.File1.pyFile2.pyoutputIn this case, you will catch all exceptions raised during importing your file, then you will take the last one from the trace_back.
