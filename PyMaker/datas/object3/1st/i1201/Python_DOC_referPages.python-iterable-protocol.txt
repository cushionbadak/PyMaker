I've made an iterable Squares object in 4 way. The classical class, generator style and just for fun a closure style and an improved(?) closure style. classIt works as expectedgeneratorclosureimproved(?) closureWhat I wanted to try is attach the __iter__ function to the inner function object and return a generator and I can leave the ()-s and I can use the returned inner as an iterable object. What is the exact definition of the iterable protocol? It seems, only the presence of the __iter__ function is not enough. 
The "exact definition of the iterable protocol" is in the documentation: iterable:  An object capable of returning its members one at a time. Examples of iterables include (...) objects of any classes you define with an __iter__() method or with a __getitem__() method that implements Sequence semantics.BUT: __magicmethods__ are only invoked when defined on the class - you cannot override them on a per-instance basis (well you can but they won't be invoked).
