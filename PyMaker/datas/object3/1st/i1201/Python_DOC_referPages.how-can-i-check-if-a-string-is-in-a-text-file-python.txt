This is usually advantageous to using python's open() method, which requires you close() the file when you are finished reading it.Side note: notice you have returned False under both conditions of your function.
One issue with this function is that usernames is not defined, and the other is that both ends of the if block will return False.One way you could solve these would be That snippet above is different in a few ways, but it also ignores two likely errors you might also be facing: case sensitivity in inputs (the input(...) line could be whatever the user wants), and line separation in usernames_file. Hopefully this pushes you in the right direction though.
You need to open() the file before calling the read() method. Check if username isn't empty after using strip()You can use the ternary conditional operator (a if condition else b)i.e.:
