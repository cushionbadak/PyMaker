I'm currently building a Discord bot that uploads a file to Google Drive when a command is used. However, the command methods are Asynchronous and the files().create() method is Synchronous, and calling it simply causes the bot to get stuck.The line causing the problem is:The bot just gets stuck after saying "Uploading...." and doesn't upload anything.Does anyone know how I can fix this?Edit: Using a ThreadPoolExecutor, nor a DefaultExecutor has worked, nor has setting up a synchronous function that runs the create and execute methods, taking in the metadata and media parametersEdit 2: After doing some more screwing around, it turns out the problem is now in the following line:However from my testing, for the question I asked, Patrick is correct and I have marked the question as answered.
You can run your blocking operation in another thread, while your asynchronous code waits for it to complete without blocking the event loop.We'll create a new ThreadPoolExecutor, then use run_in_executor to use it to run the task.You may also be able to use the default executor by removing the context manager and passing None instead of pool.  I'm having trouble finding information about the default executor though, so you may want to experiment.
