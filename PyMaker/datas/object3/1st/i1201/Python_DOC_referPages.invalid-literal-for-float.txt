I'm new with python. So maybe there is something really basic here I'm missing, but I can't figure it out...For my work I'm trying to read a txt file and apply KNN on it.The File content is as follow and it has three columns with the third one as the class, the separator is a space. My Code:
Here:You have to tell csv.reader what separator to use - else it will use the default excel ',' separator. Note that in the example you posted, the separator might actually NOT be "a space", but either a tab ("\t" in python) or just a random number of spaces - in which case it's not a csv-like format and you'll have to parse lines by yourself.Also your code is far from pythonic. First thing first: python's 'for' loop are really "for each" kind of loops, ie they directly yields values from the object you iterate on. The proper way to iterate on a list is:so no need for range() and indexed access here. Note that if you want to have the index too, you can use enumerate(sequence), which will yield (index, item) pairs, ie:So your loadDataset() function could be rewritten as:Note that if any value in your file is not a proper representation of a float, you'll still get a ValueError in row = tuple(float(x) for x in row). The solution here is to catch the error and handle it one way or another - either by reraising it with additionnal debugging info (which value is wrong and which line of the file it belongs to) or by logging the error and ignoring this row or however it makes sense in the context of your app / lib:Also, if you want to iterate over two lists in parallel (get 'list1[x], list2[x]' pairs), you can use zip():and there are functions to sum() values from an iterable, ie:lst = [1, 2, 3]  print(sum(lst))so your euclideanDistance function can be rewritten as:etc etc...
