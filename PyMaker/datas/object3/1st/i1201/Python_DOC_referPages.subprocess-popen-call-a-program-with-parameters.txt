I have a EXE file, which could be called like this:When trying to call this from subprocess.Popen, I got an could not find file error:What is the right structure to call this?  
start is a shell built-in. It's not really an executable. So you cannot call it without shell=True. That's your primary error: there is no start.exe in the system. But there's more...no need to start a process in background since you seem to wait for it. Either start it without start and don't wait, or just wait: don't use start, so now you can use check_call instead.use lists not strings for your arguments.using backslashes within a string needs escaping/raw string prefix, in your case \t becomes "TAB char"my proposal:
Have you tried run instead of Popen?You can read all about here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.runIt allows shell=True, etc.
