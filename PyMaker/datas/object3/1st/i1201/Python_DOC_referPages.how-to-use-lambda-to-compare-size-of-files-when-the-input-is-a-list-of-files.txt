I have a function that gest 2 file paths: remote path can be a simple a/b/c or a bit more complex - a*/b/c*. If I want for example to check if remote files exist I can do that using lambda:However, if I want to check file's size, I'm using os.stat(path).st_size and that's I'm not sure how to insert into a lambda.What I want in the end is something like this: lambda compare_sizes file_A, file_B_may_contain_star : os.stat(file_A ).st_size == apply_on_star(os.stat.st_size, file_B_may_contain_star)where the inner apply_on_star would get the sizes of the each file in file_B_may_contain_star but that wouldn't work. Can reduce or lambda or something else be useful here or must I write it in a function?Just to clarify - I want to take 2 paths, A,B where B may contain '*' and check if size(A) == size(B) if B does not contain '*', else compare size(A) with each and one of size(glob.glob(B)). One option I think of, is compare all files in B using reduce, and then, if same, compare to A, but I don't know how to
One way you might be able to get away with this is the pathlib2 library (the backport of pathlib in Python3's standard library). To get a file's size, you can do Path('file').stat().st_size, and it also supports Glob in the form of Path('parent').glob('star_pattern').So maybe something likeThough I'm not sure how to test it against your example.
