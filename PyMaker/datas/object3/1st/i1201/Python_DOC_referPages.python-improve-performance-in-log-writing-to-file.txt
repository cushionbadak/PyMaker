Natural Text
I am writing a piece of code that involves generation of new parameter values over a double FOR loop and store these values to a file. The loop iteration count can go as high as 10,000 * 100,000. I have stored the variable values in a string, which gets appended on every iteration with newer values. Finally, at the end of loop I write the complete string in a txt file.My question here is, is there a better pythonic way to perform this kind of logging. As I am guessing the string gets very bulky in the later iterations and may be causing delay in execution. Is the use of string the best possible option to store the values. Or should I consider other python data structures like list, array. I came across Logging python module but would like to get an opinion before switching to it.I tried looking up for similar issues but found nothing similar to my current doubt.Open to any suggestionsThank youEdit: code added
You can write to the file as you go e.g.Update: whether or not directly streaming the records is faster than concatenating them in a memory buffer depends crucially on how big the buffer becomes, which in turn depends on the number of records and the size of each record. On my machine this seems to kick in around 350MB.
