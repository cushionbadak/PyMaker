New to python and threading, so i'm not sure if threading is happening as mentioned below -- Here, I'm trying to deploy an individual thread for each event. A new thread should be created when user presses "submit button" every time, then execute it.a.py file :ins.tpl :result.tpl:Both ins.tpl and result.tpl are stored in views folder('cause i'm using bottle). I'm not sure if a new thread is generated every time. Or is there a better way to do it? 
The code looks like it does indeed kick-off a new thread with every submit.  This is easy to verify using threading.enumerate().It looks like there is a race condition in calc() with multiple threads competing for access to stdout via the print() function.  You can fix that by combining all output lines into a single string and printing all at once (or better, create a print queue and do the printing in a separate thread).
