Natural Text
I have a big text file like this small example:small example:this file is divided into different groups and every group has 2 parts (2 lines). the 1st line which starts with > is ID and the 2nd line is a sequence of characters. length of every sequence of characters is 61.I have a short sequence (which is CCGA) I would like to scan every 2nd part for this short sequence. and output would be a text file with 2 columns.1st column: is the position where the beginning of short sequence is located (every 2nd part has 61 characters so in the output I will report the position of characters which is a number). 2nd column: is the count of number of times that the beginning of short sequence is located at that specific position.for instance for the following sequence of characters the beginning of short sequence is at position 49.for the small example, the expected output would look like this:expected output:I am trying to do that in python using the following code. but the output is not like what I want.do you know how to fix it?
The below uses finditer to find all non-overlapping occurences of the CCGA pattern, and creates a mapping from the index of the beginning of the sequence to the number of times a sequence has begun at that index.  printsOne way to export it to a file would be to use the print function
