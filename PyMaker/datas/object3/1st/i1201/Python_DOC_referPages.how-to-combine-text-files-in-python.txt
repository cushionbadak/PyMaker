i have 2 text files.file1:and file2:How can we make one text file like below:Any help?
You can split a line into a list of words based upon spaces as a breaking character:You can zip lists together to get pairings of first, second, third elements of each list:We can then format each pair into a new string:We use str.join for each pair in the sequence.Putting it all together:edit: also we could join each pair into a new string, which is terser:So, you would instead get:Note, I also added a missing \n character when writing to the output file.
You could just read both files, format the content and then write out your content on a new fileThis will generate your merged file into output.txt by default. This also assumes that your data is correct where the file rows match the expected count.
You can read the file and store the values into list. Then you can do whatever you want by accesing the list element via index. You can check this Concatenate text files and for reading the file read a file line-by-line into a list
