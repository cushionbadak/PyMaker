start is the hour in which a worker starts doing his job. duration is the amount of time the job will take. A worker can only work between 08:00 and 20h00.If a worker starts a job at 19:00 and the job takes 01:30 to finish, the output next_day_finish_time will be, as desired, 08:30. However, if the job takes 01:20 to be done, python won't be able to give me an output because of the minutes. In the way I did, I transform those 20 minutes into hours. But 20/60 will give me 0,(333)..... and so on. I've tried to round the value before the If: condititon. But when I do that, inside the If:, at time_left_over = final_hour - 20,I checked that Python keeps getting a huge value in debugging.
