Python seems to be automatically converting strings (not just input) into raw strings. Can somebody explain what is happening here?The question marked as a duplicate for this one seems to be useful, but then I do not understand whydoes not get two backslashes when called, and does when repr() is called on it.
\n is a valid escape sequence and '\n' is a length 1 string (new line character).  In contrast, \s is an invalid escape sequence, so Python is assuming that what you wanted there was a two character string: a backlash character plus an s character.What you saw on terminal output was just the usual representation for such a length 2 string.  Note that the correct way to create the string which Python gave you back here would have been with r'\s' or with '\\s'.This is a deprecated behavior.  In a future version of Python, likely the next point release, your code will be a syntax error.Since you're using v3.7.1, you could enable warnings if you want to be informed about such uses of deprecated features:As for your subsequent question after the edit:
