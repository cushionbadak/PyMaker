I have begun creating an inventory system in Python for my employer. I have the frontend GUI mostly complete and have questions about the backend.How should I store the information?The program will be located in a dropbox folder that can be accessed by multiple people at once. Should I use an SQLite database, and upon executing functions such as "add stock", open a connection, execute the change, and close the connection? Will this allow multiple users to have the inventory open at once? Are there better ways to handle this?There won't be a lot of inventory items. Would it be better to use python objects and object methods to store and manipulate the information?
You can manipulate an sqlite database pretty easily with Python.https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.htmlYou can built a pretty CRUD api with this pattern and map the operations to your GUI. From a design standpoint, it then falls to you to decide what operations you are willing to expose to your users. For example I don't suppose you will want to make CREATE TABLE available to users so I didn't include that. (But this means you would have to manually create tables and define what columns exist in them.)You already said that this would be a pretty lightweight inventory system, but it should go without saying that at enterprise scale this solution is a loser.
