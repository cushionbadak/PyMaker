Natural Text
I have a Python function that takes inputs from user and executes a SQL statement:When I try the above code, it runs when all inputs are provided by the user. If any of the fields are not provided, it returns an empty output.Edit : Output returned when I share the below input:However when I enter the below it returns an empty output (it should execute the elif (dept is None): portion of the script)
It would be helpful if you include your input lines for team and dept.You're missing a comma after dept, should fix the user-defined function.Furthermore, function_name input should be as followed:function_name(team='team1', dept='dept1', start_date='2018-01-01', end_date='2018-01-01') prints elseprints dept is nonefunction_name(team=None, dept='dept1', start_date='2018-01-01', end_date='2018-01-01')  prints team is none
