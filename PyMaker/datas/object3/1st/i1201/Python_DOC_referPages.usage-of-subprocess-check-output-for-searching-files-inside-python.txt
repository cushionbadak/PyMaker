I am using subprocess.check_output() to run the basic "ls" command. From what I understand after reading documentation is that this process can help run a shell command from within the domain of python. Let us say my example folder is home/ where I have the following files If I do an ls search from shell for the keyword "acis", naturally all files are returned. Now I want to do the same thing from within python.The following is my attemptThe two " ", " " should run sequentially and I should get back all the files as a result would have been my guess. However the output I get is a file not found error. Disclaimer : I have looked at multiple Stack Overflow questions on subprocess.check_output() and tried to see if my question is a duplicate. If I have missed something please let me know.   
As @Ry-â™¦ said, glob is the module you're looking for. Running glob.glob("home/*acis*") will give you a list of files and directories that match the pattern. To match recursively, like if you wanted to find a file such as home/flux_acis_folder/something_else.dat, you could use glob.glob("home/*acis**", recursive=True).
