I'm probably missing something obvious here, what I'm trying to do is extract part of this Django view into a function since I'm using same code multiple times:I would like to pass model_name as a method name (in bold). What is the correct way to do this?My solution would be calling instance.__getattribute__ ("model_name").save(...)
You can use getattr to access attributes by name:getattr(obj, name) implicitly goes through the various attribute lookup options:obj.__getattribute__(name), obj.__dict__['name'], obj.__getattr__(name)Usually, you do not call magic methods directly. They often are hooks for built-in methods or operators, e.g. iter(obj) calls obj.__iter__(), len(obj) calls obj.__len__().
