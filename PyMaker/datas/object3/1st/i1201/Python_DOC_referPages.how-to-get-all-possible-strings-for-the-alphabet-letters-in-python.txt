For example, given the alphabet = 'abcd', how I can get this output in Python:iteration by iteration.I already tried the powerset() function that is found here on stackoverflow,but that doesn't repeat letters in the same string.Also, if I want to set a minimum and maximum limit that the string can have, how can I?For example min=3 and max=4,  abc, aaa, aba, ..., aaaa, abca, abcb, ...
You can use the product function of itertools with varying lengths. The result differs in order from the example you give, but this may be what you want. This results in a generator that you can use to get all your desired strings. This code lets you set a minimum and a maximum length of the returned strings. If you do not specify a value for parameter maxlen then the generator is infinite. Be sure you have a way to stop it or you will get an infinite loop.This example gives the printout which is similar to your first example, though in a different order.If you really want a full list, just use
You can use combinations_with_replacement from itertools (docs). The function combinations_with_replacement takes an iterable object as its first argument (e.g. your alphabet) and the desired length of the combinations to generate. Since you want strings of different lengths, you can loop over each desired length.For example:Sample:Output:Edit:If order also matters for your strings (as indicated by having "ab" and "ba"), you can use the following function to get all permutations of all lengths in a given range:Sample:Output:
