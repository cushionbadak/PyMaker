Natural Text
I am new to programming and have already checked other people's questions to make sure that I am using a good method to replace tabs with spaces, know my regex is correct, and also understand what exactly my error is ("Unhashable type 'list'). But even still, I'm at a loss of what to do. Any help would be great! I have a large file that I have broken up into lines. Ultimately I will need to access the first 3 elements of each line. Currently when I print a line, without the additional re.sub line of code, I get something like this: ['blah\tblah\tblah'], when I want ['blah blah blah'].My code to do this isWhen I print the first few lines without the regex sub bit, it works fine. And then when I add that line in attempt to change the lines, I get the error. I understand that lists are changeable and thus can't be a hashed... but I'm not trying to work with a hash. I'm just trying to replace \t with \s in a large text file to make the program easier to work with. I don't think there is a problem with how I am changing \t's to \s's, because according to this error, any way I change it will break my code. What do I do?! Any help is super appreciated. :') 
You need to change the order of params present inside the re.sub function. And also note that you can't use regex \s as a second param in re.sub function. Syntax of re.sub must be re.sub(regex,replacement,string) .raw.splitlines() returns a list which was then assigned to a variable called lines. So you need to apply the re.sub function to each item present in the list, since re.sub won't directly be applied on a list.
