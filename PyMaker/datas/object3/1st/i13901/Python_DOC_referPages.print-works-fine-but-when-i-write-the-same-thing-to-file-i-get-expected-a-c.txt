I'm working with Splunk, but this seems to be a python-related problem I'm having.By an API call, I'm receiving a list of dictionaries, and I'm iterating through the individual dictionaries to print out a specific field. It looks like this:reader is the list, item is the individual dictionary.The print call works perfectly. It prints out the lines of businesses as I want it to, as it should. So I don't give out personal information (the real words are English, similar in length, if that matters... one word no spaces), the output looks like:AlphaBravoCharlieHowever, when I write() the same thing (item[key]), I get an: "expected a character buffer object" error.So, I change it to LOBs.write(str(item[key]). But when I write the file, instead of getting the above output, I get (A,B,C bolded for ease of sight):Alpha~1116~7F4F9983-72F8-48C8-BFAD-82C0F713CA34 1116:18886924 1437770160 1 07-24-2015 16:35:59.888 -0400 INFO  Metrics -  group=per_index_thruput, series="clo", kbps=3.596555, eps=13.129038,  kb=111.493164, ev=407, avg_age=2.422604, max_age=27 199 ['ksplidx4c',  '_internal'] splunkd .888 2015-07-24T16:35:59.888-04:00Bravopsplfwd1a  _internal 1 clo /opt/splunk/var/log/splunk/metrics.log splunkd ksplidx4c  _internal~1116~7F4F9983-72F8-48C8-BFAD-82C0F713CA34 1116:18886931 1437770160 1 07-24-2015 16:35:59.888 -0400 INFO  Metrics -  group=per_index_thruput, series="cos", kbps=564.982992,  eps=1387.129659, kb=17514.464844, ev=43001, avg_age=2.232622,  max_age=11 198 ['ksplidx4c', '_internal'] splunkd .888  2015-07-24T16:35:59.888-04:00Charliepsplfwd1a  _internal 1 cos /opt/splunk/var/log/splunk/metrics.log splunkd ksplidx4c  _internal~1116~7F4F9983-72F8-48C8-BFAD-82C0F713CA34 1116:18886952 1437770160 1 07-24-2015 16:35:59.888 -0400 INFO  Metrics -  group=per_index_thruput, series="issofim", kbps=1.250410,  eps=12.193554, kb=38.762695, ev=378, avg_age=1.738095, max_age=8 195  ['ksplidx4c', '_internal'] splunkd .888 2015-07-24T16:35:59.888-04:00Now, I know that looks huge and you have no idea what that means Just hear me out :). Obviously there's a difference in how write() works vs. how print() works. Now that this is explained, my question:Does anybody know how I can mimic the way print() works into howwrite() works, so that I get the clean A, B, C output on each line?Thank you so much. I think this^ is the best way to approach the problem, if possible.
Can you try again with this code instead and provide us the output?Now you should see the same in the print as in the file
https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#printAll non-keyword arguments are converted to strings like str() does and written to the stream,As the error message indicates, you need to convert your objects to strings (however that is appropriate for your purpose) before you can write it to a stream.Link to Python 2.7 docs: https://docs.python.org/release/2.7/library/functions.html#print
