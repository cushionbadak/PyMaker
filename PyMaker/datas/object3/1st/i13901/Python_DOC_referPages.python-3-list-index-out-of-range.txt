Every time I run this command, I can't get through all of the cards without having this error; IndexError: list index out of range.
Print cards[cardIndex] before deleting by that index:And you don't need randomness at all:You'd do that using either random.sample:or random.shuffle (which will modify the cards list):
Your problem is that you first delete the card and then print it, so the problem is when you pick the last card:what you want is to change printing and deleting:len() tell you how many things are in listIt should work now :)
