I am trying to have 2 separate lists that turn into one tile map.is for placement of the color block or textures is to hold the placement of walls** and a exit point.I am using two different method of creating a tile using characters to represent the tiles. I can get both methods to work separately but would like to combine or use them both?I would ideally like to know how to combine the two the results from the 2 lists, is for placement of the color block or textures is to hold the placement of walls** and a exit point.I will be adding invisible items down the line so I want keep two separate maps so some titles can have the same texture as a wall or not.some examples of possible uses: 1. you can walk trough some water tiles but not others2. quicksand, invisible item or trap So in the 1st map represent the water tile with X blue color In the 2nd I represent the the water with W for the wall collision detection.I am blocking off area by using a W for a wall for collision detection in this example the blue color or water and the grey color or rock tiles are areas the player can not walk.I am blocking off area by using a W for a wall for collision detection in this example the blue color or water and the grey color or rock tiles are areas the player can not walk. But I want retain two maps in case I want to add invisible areas or maybe some water you can walk on, etc.I am creating the color or texture tile map using a technique I learn off reading a member Sloth posts here. I will be swapping out the colors with a texture map#######################################below is my attempt following the answer provided still I have only got it to preform half the check.Full Source
Without ItertoolsI might recommend using the zip() function in Python. Basically it takes two (or more) lists as arguments and returns a single list where each element is a tuple of the values of your original two lists at that location. For example, you could create a new list where at each location in your map you have a tuple (tile, wall):which, using your first example in your question, returns:You can then get the tile and wall status of any given location in the map, (x, y), with something like:Then you can access tile and wall each individually:Is that along the lines of what you were looking for?There is probably a really clever way to combine these two lists of strings with list comprehensions, but I could not quite get it to work for me.Edit: With ItertoolsThere is a clever way to do this with itertools! Well, sort of. I could not quite retain your 2D layout, but instead managed to get all of the (tile, wall) tuples put into a single 1 x n*m-length list (as opposed to an n x m 2D list) with this:Now you can access the (tile, wall) values at position (x, y) with:There is probably still a more elegant way to do this with itertools (or without), but hopefully this helps.
Since you're using characters to represent the tiles and the walls, you can concatenate them into a single string to combine the two list. The combined list will require less memory a provide faster access this way than would be required if they were put into lists or tuples of characters.Afterwards, you can access the tile and wall character for a specific position directly with combined[row][col][0] and combined[row][col][1] respectively.Using itertools.izip() instead of zip() reduces memory consumption because it eliminates the need to create temporary intermediate lists. Same goes for using xrange() instead of range().Output:
