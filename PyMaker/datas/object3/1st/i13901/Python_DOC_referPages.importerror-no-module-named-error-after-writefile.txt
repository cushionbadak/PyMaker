I want to collect some of the cells in my iPython Notebook into a python script. However, I cannot import a function that's been added to a script with "writefile -a" magic. Here's a 4 cell notebook to replicate the problem:cell 1: save a function into foo.pycell 2: use the function from foo.pyThis prints 42 succesfully.cell 3: append another function to foo.pycell 4: try to import other_funcImportError: cannot import name other_func
You need to reload the module after modifying it:In general, this works better with the import foo form of the import statement, rather than from foo import some_func.  If you have a long module name, you can rename it with import some_long_module as slm
IPython has a specific extension "autoreload" that reloads modules automatically before entering the execution of code typed at the IPython prompt.It is already included in the standard IPython installation, so in your example, you only need to write:And then each time you call a specific function of foo, it will be dynamically reloaded before actually executing the cell code, which solves your problem.
