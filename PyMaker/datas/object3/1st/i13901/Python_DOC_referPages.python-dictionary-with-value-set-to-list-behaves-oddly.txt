I know list object can be changed in place, but list() should returns me an independent list object each time when it is called. Now I'm confused about the output:the required output should be:
The problem with your code is that the fromkeys constructor reuses the same value for each key. Thus list() is evaluated only once.You can use either a dict-comprehension:or, if you know that you will always be using lists in your dictionary, use the defaultdict factory:
list() is called once, and that same list is used as the value for all keys.Console transcript (you can see the same id for all values):
You could consider using a defaultdict from collections, it might be more suitable, and at the least it is worth learning about.This would print the following:
list() is only called once. For older version of Python you can use the fact that you can initialise a dict from a list of key/value pairs:Starting with Python 2.5 you can use generators and leave out the list construction from the previous example:Starting with python 2.7 and 3.0 you can use the, initially rejected for python 2.3, dict comprehension from PEP 274:
