This question already has an answer here:How do I pass a variable by reference?                    24 answers                Until recently, I thought Python passed parameters by value. For example, But if I pass in a list to a method, likeit mutates the list. I did another test:Here the list did not change. My question isWhy do these different cases happen?
Python always passes by assignment , even in the first case, actually the object reference is passed. But when you do an assignment inside the function, you are causing the name to refer a new object. That would not mutate the name/variable that was used to pass the value to the function (Better explained in the below example).Example -In your case, when you do del list[0] you are actually mutating the list in place (deleting the first element from it) , and hence it reflects in the place where the function was called from as well.
