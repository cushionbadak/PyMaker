Unlike list.extend(L), there is no extend function in set. How can I extend a tuple to a set in pythonic way?My expected result is:My solutions is something like:
Try the union method -Or as indicated in the comments , cleaner method -
Either:Or the following, which actually updates without any assignation needed
You are using the wrong method. add adds a single item, update unions the set with the argument.
