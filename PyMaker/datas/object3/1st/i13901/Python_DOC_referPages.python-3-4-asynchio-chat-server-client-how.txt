I am working on a Python 3.4 chat asynchio server and client but I have having a little trouble porting the client to asynchio.Here's the link for your reference.18.5.4.3.1. TCP echo client protocolMy working asynchio working chat server code below:My Old working Threaded chat client code below:Using the link below as reference, can anyone help me modify it so that it sends messages via shell input like my old client code?Thank you so much for any help.18.5.4.3.1. TCP echo client protocol
If I'm understanding your question correctly, you want to broadcast messages from STDIN to every connected client, is that right?Here try this:The trick is to async-ize the input function by running it in a thread (this is what run_in_executor does). This way when you are waiting for data from STDIN you don't block the entire loop.
