I recommend a dictionary. If you want, you can turn this into a list: 
Try itertools.groupbyAnd then you can form the results as you wish    UpdateIt appears the result should only contain lists that were combined from 2 or more lists. This can be fixed by checking the length before appending
If you want one list of distinct items, you should consider set.
