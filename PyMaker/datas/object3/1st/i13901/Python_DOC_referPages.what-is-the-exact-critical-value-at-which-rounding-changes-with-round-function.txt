In py2, criticality is found to round .50 where it is round .51 in py3In python2,  In python 3,  
The change from round(0.5)==1 to round(0.5)==0 was intended.Compare the documentation between round in Python 2 and Python 3.. It was changed to round always round toward the EVEN value, instead of rounding away from zero (if both values are equally close).If you always wish to round up, instead use:This will give 1.0 no matter version of python.Here is an article explaining the strangeness of floats and why the rounding error occurs. The difference in the rounding errors between 2.x and 3.x are because of the change in how rounding works in the two versions.Due to how floating point values work, it is impossible to accurately represent many decimal numbers. If you need an exact number you'll need to use a decimal datatype instead. Edit: This change was to conform to the IEEE 754 standard, aka the IEEE Floating Point standard. This is so that the rounded values will not be biased towards high values, and instead bias towards even numbers.
