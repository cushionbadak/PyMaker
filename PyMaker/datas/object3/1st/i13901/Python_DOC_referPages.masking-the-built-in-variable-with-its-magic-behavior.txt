I am not able to follow this statement in python tutorials:This variable should be treated as read-only by the user. Don’t explicitly assign a value to it — you would create an independent local variable with the same name masking the built-in variable with its magic behavior.
In the interactive prompt, _ has "magic" behavior -- it gets set to the value of whatever expression was evaluated last:If, however, you assign something to a variable named _ yourself, then you only "see" that variable, and the magic variable is hidden ("masked"):This happens because your local variable _ is unrelated to the variable that has the magic behavior, it just happens to have the same name.So don't do that, not in the interactive prompt anyway.
It means exactly what it says it means; you should not assign anything to the _ variable as that would hide the real magic variable:The magic _ variable stores the result of the last expression that was echoed, but by assigning to _ you no longer can 'see' this magic variable. Looking up _ shows whatever value I assigned to it now.Luckily, you can also delete the shadowing _ name again:
