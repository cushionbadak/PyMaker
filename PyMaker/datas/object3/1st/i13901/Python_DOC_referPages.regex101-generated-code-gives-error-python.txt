Natural Text
I used regex101 to test a simple regex (\D+\n*), but the code generated gives a syntax error. What's wrong? Using python 3.4.3.
The ur prefix is not supported in Python 3. Use r instead. Python 2.7:Python 3:This is one of the least helpful Python errors I've seen, to be honest.
Use only r string prefix instead of ur.
If you import re, and use re.compile(r'\D+\n*'), it seems to work.What exactly was wrong though I do not know.
