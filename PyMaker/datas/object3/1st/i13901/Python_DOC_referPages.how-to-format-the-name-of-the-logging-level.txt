I find this cool and would like to write my logs that way too. However, IPython uses tornado logging system.I use the colorlog module to color the messages. In order to do the formatting, I subclassed the StreamHandler class, as described here: How to get the level of the logging record in a custom logging.Handler in Python? But when I do this, coloring does not work anymore.Is there a way to have both logging level name formatting and coloring?Here is my full code:
Do not change the level in handler.emit(). Instead, truncate the level in the format string itself using %(levelname)1.1s (not %(levelname)1s as in your example). Or you can use the Tornado logging system whether you use the rest of Tornado or not: just call tornado.log.enable_pretty_logging() at the start of your program.
Yes. While the problem seems quite complex at first, the cause simple: colorlog uses the dictionary you provide to match the levelname after Handler.emit.Thus, you need to change your dictionary to
