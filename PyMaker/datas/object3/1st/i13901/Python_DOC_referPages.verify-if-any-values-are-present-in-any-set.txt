I'm looking for something like:This would return true if any of the four values were found in any of the test1, test2 variables. What type should test1,test2 be ?Later edit:What if I have a list so it would be something like: 
You want to use set intersections:So if one of test1 and test2 is set to one of the four values in the other set, the test will be true.If you need both test1 and test2 to be using values from the other set, you'd test for a subset:
You can use a generator expression within any() built-in function:DEMO:
