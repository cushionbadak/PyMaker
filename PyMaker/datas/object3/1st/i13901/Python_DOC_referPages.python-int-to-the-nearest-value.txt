The way the python int()function works rounds a number to the smallest value.Such that 4.99 = 4 What can I do if I want 4.99 be equal to 5?
int() truncates float values, removing the non-integral portion of the number. You are looking for rounding instead.You can use the round() function for that:

math.ceil and math.floor return floats which are the nearest whole numbers above or below the parameter.
