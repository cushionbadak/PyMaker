This question already has an answer here:Script using multiprocessing module does not terminate                    1 answer                I don't understand this part of the multiprocessing doc (python.org) and I quote:"An example which will deadlock is the following:"First, why does it block ?And more surprising, it works perfectly when I try with some smaller values than 1000000 in the definition of f (it works with 10,100,1000,10000, but not with 100000).Thanks a lot for your help !
This example illustrates the behaviour described in 17.2.2.2.if a child process has put items on a queue (and it has not used JoinableQueue.cancel_join_thread), then that process will not terminate until all buffered items have been flushed to the pipe.  This means that if you try joining that process you may get a deadlock unless you are sure that all items which have been put on the queue have been consumed.
