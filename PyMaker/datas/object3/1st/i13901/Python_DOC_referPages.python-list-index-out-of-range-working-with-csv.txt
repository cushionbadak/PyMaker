I have a CSV that looks something like this: I want to delete all the lines where the 2nd column equal the 4th column (ex. when Smith,Andy = Smith,Andy). I tried to do this in python by using " as the delimiter and splitting the columns into: F02303521, Smith,Andy ,GHI, Smith,Andy ,GHI,,, I tried this python code: but for this line: I get: Traceback (most recent call last):    File "C:/Users/sskadamb/PycharmProjects/vastDeleteLine/manipulation.py", line 11, in       PI = line.split('"')[1]  IndexError: list index out of rangeand I thought it would do PI = Smith,Andy investigator = Smith,Andy... why does that not happen? Any help would be greatly appreciated, thanks!

Try splitting on comma, not qoute.x.split(",")
