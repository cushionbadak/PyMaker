I'm a beginner in Python and PySide. Can someone explain me how to recognize what is an object constructor and what is a method in this class (e.g. QLCDNumber(self) vs addWidget(argv)) and therefore why not calling self.vbox instead of vbox? 
The difference between "methods" and "object constructors" in Python is very thin. You must be getting thoroughly confused with Java here.Consider this:What happens is baz is a mere variable and only egg hangs around after A.__init__() ends.Also, the return values of A() and B() are indistinguishable.In Python, way moreso than Java, everything is an object and with a few corner cases there is no distinction between functions and methods. If you really really really did need to check, this is the way to go:...but the need to do such introspection is quite rare.
Class constructors are defined by the method __init__. All non-static class methods (including the constructor) take a reference to the object itself in the form the self parameter, which is the first parameter passed. You'd create a new instance of the App class by doing the following:Then to call the method init_ui you'd do the following:If lcd, sld and vbox are all member variables of the App class then you'll need to access them as self.vbox within the methods.
Constructor __init__() is called when you initialise the classSo:The  self is something that class have stored inside itself, not globaly but it will not 'disaper'
