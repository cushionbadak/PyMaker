Which adds an extra blank space between each line:My desired output is:How can I alter the second code shown above so that I can print my output without those extra blank spaces?I know this may seem like a duplicate question but the fact is that I have searched online and I can not seem to find a solution to this problem. I am happy to clarify anything. Thank You.
