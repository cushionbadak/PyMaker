I'm writing a simple Python library in which I have several "private" functions starting with underscore:This way my library users can simply do from MyLib.Module import * and their namespace won't be cluttered with implementation detail.However I'm also writing unit tests in which I'd love to test these functions separately and simple importing truly all symbols from my module would be very handy. Currently I'm doing from Mylib.Module import _a _b public_interface_call but I wonder if there's any better/quicker/cleaner way to achieve what I want?
I'm not sure if it was a blackout or something when I wrote that question but today I realized (inspired by Underyx's comment) that I can simply do this:Or even to shorten things a little (because I'm a lazy bastard):
According to docs,There is even a variant to import all names that a module defines:from fibo import *  ...  This imports all names except those beginning with an underscore (_).Not sure why this is the case however.
If you are not making some serious program, you can try this
