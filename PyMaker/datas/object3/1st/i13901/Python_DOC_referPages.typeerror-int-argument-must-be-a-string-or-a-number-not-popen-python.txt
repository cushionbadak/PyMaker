I have these lines using Popen    but run into this traceback errorOn this lineI'm new to scripting is there anyway to assign these Popen values to a string or int so this works? I don't think doing a simple numcpu== 'anything' works but I could be wrong? Any help for a beginner? Nothing I can find on here (SO) for similar cases, work for my case unfortunately. Thanks!
You can read the stdout with proc_name.stdout.readline() and then convert it to int.
