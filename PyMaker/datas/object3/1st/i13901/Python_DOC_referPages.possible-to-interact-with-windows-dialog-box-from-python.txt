So I've had a good look around, and this is the closest I could find to what I need to do:http://bytes.com/topic/python/answers/23100-windows-dialog-box-removalBut it's only part of it.So I have a script that needs to run fully automated. Currently it's being stopped by a Windows dialog box prompting the user to click 'OK'.Is it possible to register some sort of handler that when a dialog box opens is fired and selects the 'OK' option for it? Any ideas how to do this/where I can get futher info on it?NOTE: My goal isn't just to keep the code going, a requirement is to select 'OK' on the dialog box before continuing.
You have to create a thread in the background. Different threads may run at one time. Dialog box stops current thread and waits while user make a choice. This is normal behavior.Python has very easy threading API. Thread is function that is passed as an argument to a thread class constructor. Thread executes this function then, and you may start several threads, they will not lock the current thread. Move your dialog or background code to a separate thread.Samples: Simple threading event exampleMore info: https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.htmlMaking program automatically select OK in that dialog box is not possible for a Python program. Well, there are several techniques, but they require C++ and other extended skills.
There is a package called Lackey which can scan the screen for a predefined pattern (the image of the Dialog in this case) then type the keyboard ('Enter' in this case).It is a python implementation of Sikuli. So all supporting docs can be found here.
