Natural Text
I am learnig python for the beginning, I am doing some tutorials and video-tutorials. I am using sublime text 3 for wrinting code and the console of sublimeREPL to run the files and the code. a few days ago I had to search on the web how to make sublimeREPL to run as IDLE 3 runs, and i made it. The problem right now is that in the lesson i am doing right now they are teaching me how to use tkinter but in the videos the guy codes:and it works, but when i code that , it doesn't work. the error says:Traceback (most recent call last): File "", line 1, in   NameError: name 'colorchooser' is not definedI need to code :and it works.I just need to know why do I have to do it like this?, and why doesn't it work for me in the first way?I not a English Speaker I tried my best.
Withyou are importing the (sub-)module colorchooser (plus its variables and functions) from the package (which is a structured module) tkinter.Packages are a way of structuring Python’s module namespace by using “dotted module names”.So the module tkinter is structured as follows:With from tkinter import * you are importing all methods and variables from tkinter (in fact all public objects not starting with _), but not its submodules, this is why the two methods are not the same:... the statement from sound.effects import * does not import all submodules from the package sound.effects into the current namespace(source)You can, however (even though many would say from ... import * is bad practice)
from tkinter import * doesn't work because you need the entire tkinter directory. This is why you must specificy colorchooser module for your program to work.
I am not sure where you saw that , but colorchooser has always been a module inside tkinter and it does not get imported when you do -You have to specifically import it using -As you already observed.
