I am having trouble finding a way to do this in a Pythonic way. I assume I can use itertools somehow because I've done something similar before but can't remember what I did.I am trying to generate all non-decreasing lists of length L where each element can take on a value between 1 and N. For example if L=3 and N=3 then [1,1,1],[1,1,2],[1,1,3],[1,2,2],[1,2,3], etc.
You can do this using itertools.combinations_with_replacement:This works because c_w_r preserves the order of the input, and since we're passing a nondecreasing sequence in, we only get nondecreasing tuples out.(It's easy to convert to lists if you really need those as opposed to tuples.)
