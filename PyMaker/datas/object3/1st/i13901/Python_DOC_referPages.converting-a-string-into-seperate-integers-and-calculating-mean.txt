Natural Text
I have this Python tool written by someone else to flash a certain microcontroller, but he has written this tool for Python 2.6 and I am using Python 3.3.So, most of it I got ported, but this line is making problems:The file function does not exist in Python 3 and has to be replaced with open. But then, a function which gets data as an argument causes an exception: “TypeError: object of type 'map' has no len()”.But what I see so far in the documentation is, that map has to join iterable types to one big iterable, am I missing something?What do I have to do to port this to Python 3?
In Python 3, map returns an iterator. If your function expects a list, the iterator has to be explicitly converted, like this:And we can do it simply, like thisrb refers to read in binary mode. So, it actually returns the bytes. So, we just have to convert them to a list.Quoting from the open's docs,Python distinguishes between binary and text I/O. Files opened in  binary mode (including 'b' in the mode argument) return contents as  bytes objects without any decoding.
