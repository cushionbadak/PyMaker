What I want to do, is transform my variable:Into a kind of scheme like this: Row: 0 Col: 0 Cell value: femaleRow: 0 Col: 1 Cell value: IngelinRow: 0 Col: 2 Cell value: AleksandersenRow: 1 Col: 0 Cell value: maleRow: 1 Col: 1 Cell value: JohnnyThe list is long, so ill stop at 5, but you get the point.My code so far:My output is this:As you see, it misses quite a lot....
Expanding my comment:You never reset col before you print a new row. But this is a prime example for don't repeat yourself - instead of writing nearly identical code 4 times, why not use loops?To reproduce your output, you could use this as a starting point:These are two nested loops, which iterate over the input while using enumerate to automatically count the respective position.Notice that the split function is used twice: once to split on newlines (\n) to get each row, then to split on tabs (\t) for each cell.Since this very much looks like a csv-file, also have a look at the csv-module.
You should try a nested for loop....
