I'm just learning about python & web scraping, I'm trying to scrape sectional times from attheraces & I can get the data into a spreadsheet but it is all vertical & I want to get it as a horizontal table (like dispalyed on the website), so far I have this...
If you go directly to the cells, you'll have to make assumptions about the rows. Start with the rows:Look into using Python's csv module to avoid common issues. Also, the with syntax is a great way to make sure your resource management is correct; csv supports this, as do files (with open('...', 'r') as:), and these can be used together.
