This question already has an answer here:Is there a difference between “==” and “is”?                    20 answers                In the following code :The loop breaks at 256, but if you set magicnumber to 257, it doesn't. Why ?
Because you are checking for identity with is (instead of checking for equality with ==).As an implementation detail, Python keeps an array of integer objects for all integersbetween -5 and 256, when you create an int in that range you actually just getback a reference to the existing object.So integers above 256 will still be equal, but not identical (unless they refer to the same object, you can compare that with id()).Source: https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/long.html#c.PyLong_FromLong
