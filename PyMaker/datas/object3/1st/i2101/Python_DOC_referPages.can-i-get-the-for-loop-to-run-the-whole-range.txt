This is my code. I am trying to find the prime numbers before or equal to the integer inputted. However, it seems that the loop stops when it sees an integer in the range that fits the requirements. Unfortunately, this is not I wanted it to do. I would like to make it run through all the tests in the range before making the judgement. Is this possible? If so, how do I do this? Thank you.
You've got your logic a bit wrong. Here's what your code is doing:Examine numbers in increasing order from 2 to the inputted n.For each number i, check if any number a between 2 and n divides iIf a divides i, add i to the list, and then move to the next iThis isn't going to get you a prime number. In fact, I'm having trouble figuring out what it will give you, but a prime number probably isn't it. Look at this function instead, which will return all the prime numbers less than or equal to the given number - you can compare it to your code to figure out where you went wrong:If you wanted to be more efficient, you could even use range(3, n+1, 2) to count by twos - thus avoiding looking at even numbers at all.
You can use a if/else block if your break is never executed by any item in the iterable the else statement will triggered. https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html 4.4 demonstrates this accomplishing this almost exact task.
