I have a python code that takes 2 input files from the Input folder, they are shapefiles but the format is irrelevant to the questions. I process the files and then eventually output a csv file to the Output folder.To help visualize this maybe the flow line can explain what I do.I would like to be able to iterate the python code over all the input files in the input folders and store all the output files. So line1.shp+point1.shp = data1.csv and line2.shp+point2.shp = data2.csv and so on..Any guidance or help on how to do this would be great, the code runs well for any input but would like to be able to do it on a lot of data. I am fairly new to python and don't really know what to look for.Thank you!
I guess a for loop will be helpful as follow:And those two websites will be helpful for shapfile and csv reader/writer in pythonhttps://pypi.org/project/pyshp/https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html
To start off Im not sure what you need to do with the files, but it seems like you have that covered. There are some parts of the os module that you might find useful. I have include the functions that seem most useful in your case.
