I want my code to do this, but with music playing in the background:I tried this:but, it repeats the sound then repeats the word. I am expecting it to repeat the word and play the sound at the same time.
You need to play the sound on another thread, so your other code can be executing at the same time.EDIT:I have moved the thread declaration into the loop. My initial answer had it created outside of the loop, which caused a RuntimeError. Learn more here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html#threading.Thread.start
It's called asynchronous sound, and the winsound.SND_ASYNC flag on PlaySound will let you play a sound while your code continues to execute:From memory, this will give you a single sound channel i.e. playing other sounds will cut off any currently playing sounds. If more concurrent playback is required, something like PyGame is required.
