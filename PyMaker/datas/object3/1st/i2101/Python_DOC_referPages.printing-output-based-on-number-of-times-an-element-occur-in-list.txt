a simple variant using itertools.Counterthis lets the Counter do the work of counting and just displays the items in your desired format.the Counter objects work like dictionaries an look like this (last item in your list):as with a dict you can iterate over the key, value pairs using c.items(). the format string f'{number}^{mult}' then produces strings like 5^2 which then are joined using the separator ' | '.
You could use itertools.groupby only thing issue is the trailing | on the print
