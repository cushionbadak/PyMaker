I'm trying to do something like this, but I can't figure out how to call the function bar.Notice, that this is somewhat unusual. Normally you'd have an object and get an attribute on that, which could be a function. then it's easy to run. but what if you just have a function within the current scope - how to do getattr on the current scope to run the function?
You are close. To use getattr, pass the string value of the name of the attribute:i.eOutput:
alternatively, you can also use the locals() function which returns a dict of local symbols:It also allows you to get the function by its name instead of its reference without need for a custom mapping.
