I am trying to transform the column, 'issue_d' by year.below is the code I have used but it gives me errorthis is the error message
Looking at the error, I am pretty sure that df['issue_d] = 'Sep-14'. That means that you are using the wrong format string. The format string you have specified expects the months as digits and the full year (4 digits), i.e., '09-2014'What you want as a format string is '%b-%y' which takes the abbriviated month name in your locale and the year as two digits (starting at 2000). Thus, your line should look likeThe different formats can be found in the Python datetime documentation, found here.
