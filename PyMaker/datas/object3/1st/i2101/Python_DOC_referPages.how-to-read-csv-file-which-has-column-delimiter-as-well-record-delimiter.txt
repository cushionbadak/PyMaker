My CSV file has 3 columns: Name,Age and Sex and sample data is:The column delimiter is 'Ç' and record delimiter is '#Ç#'. Note the first record don't  have the record delimiter(#Ç#), but all other records have record delimiter(#Ç#). Could you please tell me how to read this file and store it in a dataframe?
Both csv and pandas module support reading csv-files directly. However, since you need to modify the file contents line by line before further processing, I suggest reading the file line by line, modify each line as desired and store the processed data in a list for further handling.The necessary steps include:open fileread file line by lineremove newline char (which is part of the line when using readlines()replace record delimiter (since a record is equivalent to a line)split lines at column delimiterSince .split() returns a list of string elements we get an overall list of lists, where each 'sub-list' contains/represents the data of a line/record. Data formatted like this can be read by pandas.DataFrame.from_records() which comes in quite handy at this point:Remarks:I changed Ç to ; which worked better for me due to encoding issues. However, the basic idea of the algorithm is still the same.Reading data manually like this can become quite resource-intensive which might be a problem when handling larger files. There might be more elegant ways, which I am not aware of. When getting problems with performance, try to read the file in chunks or have a look for more effective implementations.
