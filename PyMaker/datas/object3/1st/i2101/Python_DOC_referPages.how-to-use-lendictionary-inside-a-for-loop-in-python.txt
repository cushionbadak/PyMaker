I have a code snippet in python, I tried running it but I am not able to understand the ouput that is being produced. Here is my code:First For loop and it's output:Second For loop and it's output:It would be a big help if someone could help me understand both the for loop codes and also help me underdstand the outputs produced. Thanks.
When you use for i in range(some integer) the loop will iterate i from 0 to that some integer - 1for example following code will give 0 1 2 3 4 as outputin your first for loop you iterate i until 4 which is the length of list "chris" and you are printing the i th element in the "chris" list.So you get the first outputin the second loop, loop condition is same but there you printing the length of the i th element of "chris" list, which is  1 2 3 4 and that is your output in the second loop.Hope you could understand
You have a dictionary s and "chris" is the key pointing to the list ["1", "22", "333", "4444"]. So calling s["chris"] gives you the list ["1", "22", "333", "4444"], while s["chris"][i], for i =0, ... 3, gives you the elements of this list, i.e. s["chris"][0] = "1", s["chris"][1] = "22", etc. The rest you should figure out yourself.Just let me add that the first loop is equivalent to and the second loop to
Explaination:First example:iterate trough the range of the dictionary's chris key ( range an iterator from 0 to parameter - 1)then get the value in the dictionary's chris key with that indexSecond example:same as first example, but just getting length, so length of '1' is 1, and length of '22' is 2 and so on
