I am currently trying to implement a Python module using C++. Official Python 3 docs provide an example here, but to my surprise the code provided there throws errors in my Visual Studio 2017!If you take a look at Custom_init function implementation, you will see a function call PyArg_ParseTupleAndKeywords that takes several arguments, including a keyword array kwlist declared 3 lines above (Example copy-pasted below):However upon trying to declare a kwlist of my own like in example above, VS2017 throws the following error:a value of type "const char *" cannot be used to initialize an entity of type "char *"The simple thing would be to declare my own kwlist as const, but PyArg_ParseTupleAndKeywords expects kwlist as char *. (Documentation here)Is there a way to deal with this without resorting to extremes like const_cast?Thank you.EDIT:One of the comments below suggested to simply copy from const char* to char* and I believe that will be the simplest approach to resolve this.
I cannot think of anything less horrible than 
You can store the strings as std::strings, and then use std::string::data to get your char *sAlternatively, you can use offsets into a single string literal
