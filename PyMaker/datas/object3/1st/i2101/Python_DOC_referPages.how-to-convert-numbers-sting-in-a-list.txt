What is the quickest and cleanest way to convert an integer into a list? For example, change 132 into [1,3,2] and 23 into [2,3]. I have a variable which is an int, and I want to be able to compare the individual digits so I thought making it into a list would be best, since I can just do int(number[0]), int(number[1]) to easily convert the list element back into int for digit operations.
Convert the integer to string first, and then use map to apply int on it:or using a list comprehension:
The shortest and best way is already answered, but the first thing I thought of was the mathematical way, so here it is:It's just another interesting approach, you definitely don't have to use such a thing in practical use cases.
There are already great methods already mentioned on this page, however it does seem a little obscure as to which to use. So I have added some mesurements so you can more easily decide for yourself:A large number has been used (for overhead) 1111111111111122222222222222222333333333333333333333Using map(int, str(num)):Output: 0.018631496999999997Using list comprehension:import timeitOutput: 0.28403817900000006Code taken from this answerThe results show that the first method involving inbuilt methods is much faster than list comprehension.The "mathematical way":Output: 0.38133582499999996Code taken from this answerThe list(str(123)) method (does not provide the right output):Output: 0.028560138000000013Code taken from this answerThe answer by Duberly Gonz√°lez Molinari:Output: 0.37039988200000007Code taken from this answerRemarks:In all cases the map(int, str(num)) is the fastest method (and is therefore probably the best method to use).  List comprehension is the second fastest (but the method using map(int, str(num)) is probably the most desirable of the two.Those that reinvent the wheel are interesting but are probably not so desirable in real use.
Use list on a number converted to string:

you can use:First convert the value in a string to iterate it, Them each value can be convert to a Integer value = 12345l = [ int(item) for item in str(value) ]
If you have a string like this: '123456'and you want a list of integers like this: [1,2,3,4,5,6], use this:or if you want a list of strings like this: ['1','2','3','4','5','6'], use this:
It prints [1, 0, 0] object.
