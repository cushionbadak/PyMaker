Column 2 within my csv file looks like the following:and so on. I have a definition created that will change the listed date into a julian date, but was wondering how I can go about altering this specific column of data? Is there a way I can make python change the dates within the csv to a their julian date equivalent? Can I split the column into two csv's and translate the julian date from there?
You might be overthinking it.  Try this.
I observed that there are many interpretations to Julian Day, One is Oridinal date(day of the year) and another one day from Monday, January 1, 4713 BC.Method "toJulianDate" can be used to get the day of the year or Oridinal Date.for second format, there is a library called jdcal to convert gregorian date to julian day or vice versa which is done in toJulianDate2 . This can also be done directly by opening csv and without loading into a dataframe.Similar question was answered here Extract day of year and Julian day from a string date in python
