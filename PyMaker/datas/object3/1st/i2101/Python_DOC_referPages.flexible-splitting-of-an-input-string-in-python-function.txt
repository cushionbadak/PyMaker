In Python, what would be the most elegant way of converting this structure:into this structure: and potentially back.What is needed is a function that can take either a list of a string of comma separated values (first case) or a list of strings of the same values (second case) and handle them as one and the same: a list of strings.In pseudocode:Also, if using split() as per suggestions:Is there a way to make the delimiter space insensitive or conditional or a regex: I'd like to get to the ['group1', 'group2', 'group3'] result in either ['group1, group2, group3'] or ['group1,group2,group3'] or even this ['group1, group2,group3'] (or a combination thereof) as an input?A bit more clarification:Basically, I'm looking for the most elegant Python conditional expression that would result in the same output both in case of a and b above:['group1', 'group2', 'group3', 'group4'].
You were almost there in your edit:
you could use split and join to get from one representation to the other:in a function you could do this:
How about using split():Code:Test Code:Results:To return:To return use str.join()Results:
You can define a function using str.split on , followed by flattening of result using itertools.chainIn case of variable separator and optional space, regex would be a better choice
split() and join() can try .Output for case-1Case-2Output for case-2
By using str.replace() to eliminate all white spaces you can use a formula that will work on all cases presented.    
I think it's most clear simply using split and strip.
