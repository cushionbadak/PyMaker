I'm pretty new to coding and I'm stuck on this problem. Written in python.This code does create a CSV file, but it's not exactly exporting what I want it to export. It only creates a csv file listing only the "Y" and I understand that because i'm calling "new_domains" in writer.writerow. I'm trying to figure out how to also export the print function that matches with the if else statement into the csv, if that makes sense. Sorry if this may sounds gibberish, like I said, I'm super new to coding. Was hoping to post a picture of what I get in the csv file vs what I wanted but I'm new to stackoverflow also so it doesn't allow me to post pictures haha.Thank you!!!
print() only displays the strings on the screen.You need to remember them somewhere, like in a new list:and save both in the CSV file with something like:It's easier to save the domains again, as the for / in may not keep their order.By the way, with "for line in new_domains:" I guess you should have written "line" in the CSV insead of "new_domains"...
Question: m trying to figure out how to also export the print function that matches with the if else statement into the csvIf you want to print into a file, you have to give the file object to print(..., file=<my file object>. In your example, move the for ... inside of with ....Note: It's no good Idea to use csv.writer(... for non csv data"From Python Documentation - Built-in Functionsprint(*objects, sep=' ', end='\n', file=sys.stdout, flush=False)Print objects to the text stream file, separated by sep and followed by end.sep, end, file and flush, if present, must be given as keyword arguments.The file argument must be an object with a write(string) method; if it is not present or None, sys.stdout will be used.
