I try to Implement an logger in Django. I had it allready working in Django Version 1.5 and Python 2.7.But when I try to implement it on my actual Version(Django 2.0.8 and Python 3.6.5) I get the Error on the following Code in the manage.py:The Exception i get:My logging.ini:I don´t really get how it would come to the Error. When I checked the Pythonversion I didn´t notice any changes regarding the Logging.Afterwards i´m importing the Logging and use it like this in my Models and Views
Operator > in python 2.7 can be used with two different types like string and integer. Example:In python3 this operation is not allowed.Comparison operator > is described in a detailed way in python docsIt seems that somewhere in your code you are trying to compare string vs integer.EDIT (after OP posted the code)The problem with operator > unsupported arguments occurs, because your RotatingFileHandler setting maxBytes is interpreted as a string instead of integer. You can fix this problem by providing the list of RotatingFileHandler constructor arguments without using keyword notation. Like this:Second argument is mode and by default is equal to 'a'. reference
