How can I extract the index of a substring in a python list of strings (preferentially in a rapid way to handle long lists)?For example, with mylist = ['abc', 'day', 'ghi'] and character 'a', I would like to return [0, 1, -1].
You can use str.find with a list comprehension:As described in the docs:Return the lowest index in the string where substring sub is found  within the slice s[start:end]. Optional arguments start and end are  interpreted as in slice notation. Return -1 if sub is not found.
Or with index
