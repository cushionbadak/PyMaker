I am kind of new to python. I am trying to print only the integers in a list divisible by 5. Which I have done. But I want the output to be a list, not only the integers.My Code:I want the output to look like:[2,4,12]But intsead it looks like: 2,4,12Is there any commands to print the "x" items into a list? Like print(list[x])?
You need to collect your answers in a new list and then print that list. You can do this by creating an empty list and using the .append() method to add items to that list.A list comprehension is another option. A list comprehension is a powerful shortcut that creates the second list for you automatically.For this problem, you could use:which accomplishes the same thing as the for loop in fewer lines. In this case, you may have to use the for version, but you may want to use a comprehension in the future.
This is how I achieved that. I hope it helps:
The OP, using the following numbers [2,4,5,10,12] is "trying to print only the integers in a list divisible by 5.  I want the output to look like: [2,4,12]"Generally, "numbers divisible by 5" are capable of being divided by 5 without a remainder.  From the given list the output would be [5,10]From the output provided by the OP, he's looking for numbers where there is a remainder after dividing by 5.
