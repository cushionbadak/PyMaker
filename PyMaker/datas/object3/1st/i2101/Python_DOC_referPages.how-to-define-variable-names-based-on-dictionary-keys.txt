This question already has an answer here:How do I create a variable number of variables?                    16 answers                I am running a loop to slice table based on value of a given dictionary. But I would like to create one table for each loop and save table using the key of the dictionary. In the following example, I would like put the 'key' in table name df_slice, such as df_slice_loc1, df_slice_loc2
Use a dictionary for a variable number of variablesFor example, using a dictionary comprehension:Then access a slice via, for example, df_slice['loc2'].
