Natural Text
Hello I'm trying to write a script to open all files without an extension in a folder organised in subfolders etc.I've failed at finding a way to declare all files without a certain known type (there are some PNGs and txt but I'd like to understand how to generalise this approach)Folder hierarchy:Etc (obviously the files aren't the same in the different folders)Example of a said file:1.2.840.113619.2.227.20792477682.2116111104093220.75
This will be rather general approach for the folder structure you provided:
os.path.splitext(path)Split the pathname path into a pair (root, ext) such that root + ext == path, and ext is empty or begins with a period and contains at most one period. Leading periods on the basename are ignored; splitext('.cshrc') returns ('.cshrc', '').With that you can get the extension and than you can do if ext == "" to get the files without extension.
Try this code inside your script. You can add other known file extensions to the list. Can find all known extensions list online if you need it.
