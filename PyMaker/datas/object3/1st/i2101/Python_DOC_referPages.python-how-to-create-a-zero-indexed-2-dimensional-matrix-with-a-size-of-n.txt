Given a value n, what is the most efficient way to create a zero-indexed matrix with the column and row size equal to the value n?I know the following command will create a 2d matrix with 0 as all of the cell values:So when the n = 4, the matrix would look as follows:But is there any way to create the matrix as follows?
Since you are talking about 2-d matrices, and you're specifically asking about efficiency, it might be best to turn to numpy:Or you could use a list comprehension such as the following (or one of the ones suggested by @hiroprotagonist):
you could simply use the current coordinates x and y to calculate the value x + y*n:our you could use itertools.count: 
Something like this would work.
