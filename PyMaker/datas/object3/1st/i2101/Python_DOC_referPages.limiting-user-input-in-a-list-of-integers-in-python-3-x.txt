I am new to Python and in one of my exercises I need to write a program that will store 5 integers entered to the console in a list, then print its length, type of the list, and print the sorted list.So far, the most elegant way I could do it without limiting the input to 5 integers was:However, I can't get my head around how to add the command to store only 5 numbers entered by the user in the list and ignore the rest.I thought of using int(input()) for x in range(5), but it didn't work, and I also don't know how to add the split then.I know there is a way to store items in the list using map(), but I haven't come across that in my course yet, so if there is a simpler and more efficient way to do it with list(map()), I would highly appreciate if someone could guide me.I only started learning, so any advice would be appreciated. Thanks!
You have two options:Take the first five values from a line, ignore the restCheck the length and tell the user to not enter so many valuesThe latter would give the user better feedback, where the first could lead to surprises (What happened to the numbers at the end of my line?)Ignoring the rest is easy; slice the list you create; the [:5] creates a new list with just (up to) 5 values:The above also tells str.split() to only split up to 5 times, to avoid further work.An error message should, by command-line tool convention, be written to sys.stderr and you would exit with a non-zero exit code:When you use a library to handle command-line parsing, then the library usually includes a function to handle error communication and exit (such as argparse, where you'd use parser.error(message) to signal an issue and exit in one step).
Limit your split to the first 5 numbers via the maxsplit argument of str.split.Then slice up to but not including the final element of the resultant list.Note you can also rewrite this with list + map:
This will just keep the first 5 items in the list:Using this gives all the items in the list that have index less than 5.
