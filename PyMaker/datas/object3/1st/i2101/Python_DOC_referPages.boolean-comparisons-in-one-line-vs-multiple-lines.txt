I wasn't sure what to name the title. But I'm new to programming in general and I'm using python. My question is, how come just writing return instead of a bunch if and else statements work exactly the same.Both these codes yield the exact same results.. but why? sorry I'm super new
Both these codes yield the exact same resultsThat's incorrect. It is only true where the inputs are of specific types. Consider this trivial counter-example:But note and / or are designed this way:Note that neither and nor or restrict the value and type they return  to False and True, but rather return the last evaluated argument.parrot_trouble2 exhibits short-circuiting. Let's assume that talking is a Boolean input.  If talking is False, the expression short-circuits and returns False. If talking is True, parrot_trouble2 will return True or False depending on the value of hour.parrot_trouble1 doesn't short-circuit, but the result is the same. If talking is Boolean and False, the function returns False. If talking is True, then the second criterion hour < 7 or hour > 20 is tested. If the condition is not specified then, since nothing is returned, Python move's outside and after the if statement to return False.
Instead of havingin a function, you could just have it return the condition since you're checking for the same value you would return
