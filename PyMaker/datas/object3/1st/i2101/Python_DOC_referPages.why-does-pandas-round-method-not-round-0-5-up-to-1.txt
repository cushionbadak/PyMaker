This question already has an answer here:Python 3.x rounding behavior                    9 answers                I'm posting this with what I think is the answer because I couldn't find a similar question-answer here.I expected pandas round method to round 0.5 up to 1.Even more strange: Python's round method has different behaviour in Python 2.7 and 3.6:Python 2.7:Python 3.6:Is this something to do with floating-point representation or my platform (Mac OS X)?
I believe in thisc ase it is actually intended behaviour in python, and not a floating point problem. Looking at the documentation:if two multiples are equally close, rounding is done toward the even choice (so, for example, both round(0.5) and round(-0.5) are 0, and round(1.5) is 2)
This is indeed due to floating point arithmetic as described in the Python 3 documentation for round() in where it states:The behavior of round() for floats can be surprising: for example, round(2.675, 2) gives 2.67 instead of the expected 2.68. This is not a bug: it’s a result of the fact that most decimal fractions can’t be represented exactly as a float.
