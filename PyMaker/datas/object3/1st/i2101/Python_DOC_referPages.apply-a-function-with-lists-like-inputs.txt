I want to create a new list (V) from other lists (a, b, c) and using a function, but I would like to take advantage of python and apply the function to the three lists and not element by element. For example, I have the lists a, b and c; and the result after apply the function should be V. Thanks.

You want to first zip the arguments, then map the function on the unpacked tuples:See here for an example.
An alternate solution is to use map and lambda
What about using only built-in functions? Like zipPlus another python buit-in function, map which returns aniterator and thus makes things go faster and ends up saving memory:
