so I recently learned about data visualization after watching a cool Numberphile video, I wanted to make my own little data visualization with random numbers. The idea is that I have a list of random integers, and based on the number, I draw a different colored circle. The color key is explained in the code below.However, I seem to be having a logic problem with my code. The code runs without bugs, but based on what I described previously, my program is not working properly. First off, my list has 10 integers in it, but only 6 are drawn on the program. Also, the coloring is a bit off. Any help is appreciated, thanks.
The first step to debug the program would be to print n, color, n*50 + startN. You'll see that you're iterating over the indices in the random_list not over a range like you expect. So the first number is 9, you check if random_list[9] == 0, that's True and it sets color = black and displays it at 550.You can iterate over the range for n in range(len(random_list)): to fix this problem.I suggest putting the colors into a list or dictionary and just iterate over the enumerated random_list. Then you get the number n and the color index at the same time and can just access the color in this way: color = colors[color_index].The updated code:
