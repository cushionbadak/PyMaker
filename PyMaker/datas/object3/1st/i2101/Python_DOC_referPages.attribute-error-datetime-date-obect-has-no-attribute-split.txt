So don't try and "split" them via str.split.str.split returns a list. This is anti-Pandas, since it means you are storing two layers of pointers, a series of lists which themselves hold pointers. Instead, construct int columns to represent components of your dates.This is one approach:To make your code work with datetime.date objects is possible, but requires string conversion first and leaves you with a series of lists. Neither method or result are recommended:
