Natural Text
I have a keyword "grand master" and I am searching for the keyword in the huge text. I need to extract 5 before words and 5 after words of the keyword (based on the position it might go to the next/before sentence also), and this keyword appears multiple times in huge text. As a trail , first i tried to find the position of the keyword in the text, usingtext.find(), and found the keywords at 4 different positionsSo tried to split the text based on spaces and taking first 5 words, But how to extract the 5 words before that keyword?
you can simply use
Use re module for this. For the first keyword match:Parentheses in the pattern indicates the group number. First pair of parentheses corresponds to match.group(1), second pair of parentheses corresponds to match.group(2) and so on. If you want all the groups you can use:orFor all the keyword match in the text, use re.findall. Read re for details.P.S: There are better ways to write patterns. Thats just me being lazy.
