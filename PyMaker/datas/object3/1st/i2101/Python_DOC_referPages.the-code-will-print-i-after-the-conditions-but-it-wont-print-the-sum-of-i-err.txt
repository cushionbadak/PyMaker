You probably want to sum i one at a time like this:If you want to use sum instead you have to apply it to a list:or using a generator expression:There is also a shortcut to get all the multiples of 7 within range(x, y) :Then you only have to check the second condition (not divisible by 5)You could also create 2 sets and calculate the difference:Finally a more maths approach. Your if condition is selecting the multiples of 7 and filtering out the numbers that are multiples of both 5 and 7. This is equivalent to subtracting the sum of the multiples of the least common multiple of 5 and 7 (which is 35) from the sum of the multiples of 7 within the range...(Of course in the above you could just write 35 instead of lcm. I show the calculation in case you want to apply this using other numbers.)
You are getting that exception because sum expects an object that can be iterated through or in other words can return an iterator, such as a list, or tuple.A proper way would have been to utilize the iterator object returned by the range function to get the cumulative value of all the numbers between x and y which are factors for  7 but not factors of 5.
