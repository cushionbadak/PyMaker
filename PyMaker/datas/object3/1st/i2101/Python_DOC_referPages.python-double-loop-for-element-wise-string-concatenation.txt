My question is very simple:I have A = ['AA','BB'], B = ['CC','DD']How do I get AB = ['AACC','AADD','BBCC',BBDD']?Thank you!
with list comprehension:we thus iterate over the elements in A and for each element x in A, we iterate over B, and then add x + y to the list.Or for a variadic number of lists, and with a generator:This can be easily extended to a variable number of elements, like:
You can use itertools.product:This has the benefit of working with any number of iterables.
Its easier to see whats happening in a complete loop, here we are going to take i in a which will be AA and BB and j in b which will be CC and DD. On our first iteration we combine the first two AA + CC then append them to our new list , next comes  AA + DD then onto BB and the process repeats.After you understand this you can skip that process and do it with list comprehension, this is identical.
