I'm scraping this website: http://housing.ucdavis.edu/dining/menus/dining-commons/tercero/. The following is my code: Basically, I want to reproduce all the dish names, where they are and which meal they belong to. However, my code only works for Breakfast and other meals will have the exact same dishes as the Breakfast, unless a location didn't show up in the Breakfast. I think somehow I cannot overwrite the old dishes by the new ones. Could someone have a review and help me out on this issue? Thanks~
You have a logic error, and it's difficult to debug because you're attempting to print unformatted HTML straight to the console.To make it easier on yourself, you should populate a dict with your structured data as early as possible, using either dict.update() or dict.setdefault().In either an interactive Python console, or in a running program, you can also access the most recent item from a loop outside of its scope, i.e.I encourage you to experiment in the interpreter as much as you can.Back on topic--your logic error probably has something to do with the fact that print(real_item_list) is on a different scope than I would expect you to put it, but I found debugging your code annoying enough to not look too deeply into it.Again, emphasizing the importance of making debugging as easy as possible.In fact, it was easier to just rewrite it. You should be able to do the meat of your looping in about 7 lines and 3 loops.
