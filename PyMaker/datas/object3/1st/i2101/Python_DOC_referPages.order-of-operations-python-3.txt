Can someone explain why c is equal to 25 and not 30? I keep getting 30 by multiplying a*(b//a) and then adding b to it after.
Just do it step by step and you'll see that you're doing Hence c is 25. b//a is floor division, meaning 15/10 becomes 1
An easy way to understand whats going on is to print each steps:output
(15//10) is equal to 1 so the formula for c is equivalent to 15+1*10 The // operator is floor division which round down to the nearest integer. In additon all the values you are using are integers. To get 30 you need to use the normal divsion operator / and case one of the operands in the division to a floating point number, like this: c = b+(float(b)/a)*a That code sets c to 30.0.
Does this clear it up?The crucial part is 15//10, because // performs integer division which rounds down to the next integer. Note the difference between / and // in Python 3.
