I am given an array X and I am asked to return another array Y where y[t] = x[t] + x[t-1] and y[0] = 0 without using a for loop in Python.What I can think of is using rolling sum but I am not sure if this is the fastest way since I need to convert x into a dataframe/ a series for rolling to work. Is there a faster way to do that? Thanks!
You could use a list comprehension and zip:OutputThis approach relies on built-in functions, so no need to import an external module such as pandas.
In case you are looking for one-liners might not give best performace
Well, you could use numpy, though that still turns the list into an array.This is fast, short, fairly transparent and doesn't (explicitly) use a for loop.You could also use map, which is pretty much the same as the list comprehension and doesn't require any external libraries.In Python3 this doesn't work, and instead you would need to write:or
