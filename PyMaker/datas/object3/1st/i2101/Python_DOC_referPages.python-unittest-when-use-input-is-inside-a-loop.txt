I have the following:You will see that there is a single call to the function, but the function contains a loop that iterates until the use enters a value of 0.How do I test this function with unittest library?  
I am assuming your code is inside a module called mymodule.py. Therefore, you could create a test file name test_mymodule.py to implement your tests. What you want to do is to use the unittest.mock module to have access to the patch() function in order to decorate the builtin input. What does that mean is that instead of calling the input function to ask for the user input, you are patching it to return the values defined in side_effect. Each call of input will therefore return a value of the list. Notice that you should include 0 as well, otherwise the test will not work.For each sequence of inputs, you will have to compute manually (or even using your program) to provide the final result for the method assertEqual.Each test method should be prefixed with a test_ in its name. The default pattern when using python -m unittest from the CLI looks for test*.py in the current directory (it is the same as running TestLoader.discover(). You can probably change this if you want, but you will have to take a look at the unittest documentation for more details.
