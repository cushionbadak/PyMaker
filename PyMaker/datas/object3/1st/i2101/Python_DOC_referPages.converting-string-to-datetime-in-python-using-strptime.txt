I'm trying to convert the following String to datetime object in Python.I get the following error,What am I doing wrong here?
You're almost there, but there were a few errors in the directives you were using. Try:
%c is defined as Localeâ€™s appropriate date and time representation.This means that %c is in fact a macro for the current locale's format string and thus is meant to be used by itself.In the case of en_US, your format string expands to'%a, %b %d %Y %H:%a %b %d %H:%M:%S %Y %z'As you can see, %a is in position 1 as well as position 6.Writing correct format strings requires quite a bit of careful book-keeping.
