Natural Text
I am a newbie to Python 3 and python in general. I have been set a task to write a function that reads a data set (plenty.data) and then convert this data to float.I have managed to write code to read the data set, but I am really struggling with the converting it to float.This is currently what I have for converting to float but when I run it I get an error message saying I have been told to use loops but I am still struggling with how to do this.any help would be greatly appreciated!
You can't just convert a long string of numbers to floats. Your exception shows that the line consists of more than one number:Next, even if that would have worked, the expression data(float(line)) asks Python to treat data as a function or class (a callable). List objects are not callable however.You need to split the line into separate numbers and convert those separate parts to floating point numbers. If you want to append each line of text as a separate list, you can use:However, it'd be more efficient to have the csv module do this for you, it can convert data to floats as it reads the data and splits the lines:The quoting=csv.QUOTE_NONNUMERIC configuration for the CSV reader is what makes the reader output floating point numbers.If you don't need random access to the data (if you can process the numbers row by row and don't need to refer to individual rows by index), then you don't have to read the whole file into memory. Just loop over the reader and process each row as needed:
