I need run 3 or 5 threads approx, this threads monitoring some activities in the OS. Because of this, the main program must be running in background. I've read many examples and explanations, but I'm not clear yet how to launch threads and main program in the background and after that, how to control them.I start threads in daemon mode from main program:and after that I run the main program in background with (I'm not sure that this is the best way to do it for what I want to achieve):How control the threads after main program initialization if I need stop a specific thread, change its state, or whatever? How to access a specific thread or the main program?
I understand now how to do, to resume the problem: I have a main program running in background and this main program have some threads. But I want with another script or program stop the main program with the threads safetly and in some cases pause and resume threads. I didn't have a correctly concept about how to use the Threads. I can stop or send signal to this threads from main program How?,with a database or config file.I updated my project with this changes: If I want change with another class or script the state of my threads, I just change config table in my database y this take effect in the Threads, from main function. In this example if I stop correctly my threads and program just I update table, that's it.I need read about Signals and Condition Objects to complement correctly Threads uses. Thanks everyone!
