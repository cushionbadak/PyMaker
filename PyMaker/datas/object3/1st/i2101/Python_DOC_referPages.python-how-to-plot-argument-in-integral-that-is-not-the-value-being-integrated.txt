I want to integrate a function that has no closed form solution with an unknown variable and then plot vs the unknown variable. To try a simpler test, I tried to use the integral of f(x,c) = (x^2+c), integrated with respect to x and plot with different values of c.  However, the code below gets the erroronly size-1 arrays can be converted to Python scalarseven though the integral of a number, e.g. integral(5), seems to return the correct scalar value.  
You pass a numpy array as the argument c while you wanted to integrate over x for all the items of c. Therefore you can use this:
onno was a bit faster. But here is my similar solution. You need to loop over all the different c:
