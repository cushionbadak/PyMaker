Is there any more elegant way to reduce the code below, which should reverse a direction from left to right and vice versa, based on the size of a line?
Maybe something like:
You can reduce 3 branching statements to 2 if you use the math.copysign function:copysign will copy the sign of left - right and apply it to the left operand (in this case, 1).If left and right are floats, use math.isclose to check for closeness accounting for floating inaccuracies.If you have numpy, you can handle the special case of left == right with the function itself using np.sign:
A compact and elegant function definition, if you need to reuse the code, could be this: 
You can use print with two conditional expressions   
You need the cmp (compare) function from the math package.  In other languages, a similar function is called sign.  The Python community didn't have a clear consensus on edge cases, and has so far left sign out of the language.I think this got deprecated in Python 3.  In that case, use numpy.signFor Python 3 without numpy, you could do
