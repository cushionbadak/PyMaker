Write a function named "indexed_kvs" that doesn't take any parameters and returns a new key-value store containing the integers from 0 to 36 as values each stored at a key which is a string containing the digits of the integer. For example the key-value "0":0 will be in your returned key-value store (include both 0 and 36 in your list). (My code below)I keep on getting the first key and value; how do I get all the keys and values?
You return from inside the loop which is a common mistake that can be avoided altogether by using a dict comprehension, at least in this simple case:
As @Loocid comment, the return statement shouldn't be inside the for loop, so the correct code would be:
You have your "return d", inside you loop. So, what happens is that -1) The function begins2) The for loop executes once:a) adds 0 to the dictionary at key 0,b) encounters return d, them thinks- 'Okay! I got a return statement. I gotta exit! 'c) And Boom! Your function is done withSo, just move your return d out of you for loop. So, the exiting of the function will take place when, the loop is over.So your new code should be:
