Is there an easy way to pass a complete data structure from C++ to Python and vice-versa easily with multiple data types?I have a complex class with pointer objects of floats, longs etc. I could convert this into a json string and parse it both ways, but this would be really slow.However, if we had a special format, that has takes this data, but also stores meta data of the start/end of the json string, it would parse much faster. Is there anything like this?
I would personally recommend serializing your data into JSON in C++ using e.g. rapidjson or Qt and then to transfer the resulting string to Python using the C API bindings for Python and deserializing it into Python Dictionary there. One-way or two-way transfer should be easy enough.Note about the C API bindings however. I have used it in the past and it was not pleasant experience in any way or form. Eventually you will make it work and do what you want but it will cost you some nerves.Lastly do not worry about performance. Since you are using Python (an interpreted language) you are apparently not doing anything performance critical anyway so cost of the JSON (de)serialization can be ignored here.Good luck because you are going to need it with the Python's C API bindings.
