I wrote a recursion function to get all subsets out of a list of integers. For example, given a list [1, 2, 3], the return will be [[],[1],[2],[3],[1, 2],[1, 3],[2, 3],[1, 2, 3]].Here is my code:I print out the subset in each recursion and they are right. However, the final return res is always empty. Anyone knows why? Appreciate it! 
Pretty close!  The issue is that subset is being appended to res, but later modified.  What you want is a "frozen" version of what subset is then, not a "reference" to what it will eventually be.So instead of res.append(subset), consider appending a copy of the list, for example with:And you'll get your expected result:
