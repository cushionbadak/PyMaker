I want to get the output of a python script which is made to run in cmd to a variable in the host script. I am partially able to do it but not getting the desired output. Please guys before downvoting and closing this question, note that this is different from other questions regarding the same issueHere is the code that i wrote as my script that needs to be run:Here is the out that i need(i get the output when i run the script natively):Note that i want the output to be stored in my variable every time a new character is printed on the screen. i.e in realtime. here is the code that i wrote using subprocesses to get the output of the file:But unfortunately, it is outputting only this:Clearly, i have lost my progressbar! and that is essential for what i'm working on! How do i make sure that even the progressbar is stored in the variable.NOTE - I STRICTLY NEED THE OUTPUT TO BE STORED IN A VARIABLE SO THAT I CAN REFERENCE IT IN THE FUTURE.
The progress bar will only be displayed in a terminal.https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/7.x/api/#click.progressbarBy default, this progress bar will not be rendered if the file is not a terminal.
