The structure of the project is:project- main.py- session.py- spider.pyThere is a class in session.py:And another class in spider.py:When I import class Spider from spider.py in main.py like this:And run main.py, I get:Session created.  Main function.  Spider created.  It confuses me. I think __init__ is the initial function used when initializing an instance, but in this case the __init__ function of Session is called when Session is imported in spider.py. I think it must be related to the default value of __init__ function in spider.py, but why?
The default values of parameters get evaluated only once in python.  This is documented here and also here as stated by JETM.Therefore a isntance of Session is created when you import spider as default value for the sess parameter of the spiders __init__ method.If you do not wish such a behavior you can use None as default value and create the Sesssion instance inside the __init__ method if no other value was provided as pointed out by MatsLindh and FHTMitchel like this:
