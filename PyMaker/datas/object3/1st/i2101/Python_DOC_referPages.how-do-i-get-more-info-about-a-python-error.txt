I'm trying to run a python script on Ubuntu 16.04; the script runs fine on Ubuntu 14.04, but I keep getting kind of a vague object has no attribute error.It seems this exception class is still active so not sure what the problem is. I've installed python-urllib3 and python3-urllib3 (even though python on the 16.04 system is a symlink to python-2.7) with no luck. This is my error and line 507 from the code. Any way to get more info about the error?update: As noted by @a_guest. Had to make this change. Why it runs fine on 14.04 I don't know. Maybe this was the difference bewteen 2.7.6 and 2.7.12:
You linked the documentation for Python 3 however you seem to be using Python 2. urllib on Python 2 doesn't have that error module, just as the error states.urllib2 on the other hand has this class, so you can use urllib2.URLError instead. 
That error means that the urllib module contains nothing called error.My urllib doesn't have an error submodule.
Note that Ubuntu 16.04 /usr/bin/python is a symlink to python2. If you want to use python 3.x, you should  change the first line of your script from to(Note: the "#!" at the beginning of this line is called "shebang".)Alternatively you can create a virtual environment so that when you activate it, it will run python 3.
