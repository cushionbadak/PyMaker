I'm trying to get files uploaded through the Django admin site to be placed on a network drive. Lets say the path to this drive is '\\FILESERVER\Django'.My initial thought was to just set my media root to the same path I'd use to access the drive via File Explorer:An Example Model:But when I upload a file, It just creates the folder on my local C: drive. (e.g. C:\FILESERVER\Django\articles). Is there a way I can tell Django that this is supposed to be a path to a network drive?Note: This is a Django 2.0.4 app running on a windows machine.
I believe what you're looking for is in pathlib. Have a look here:https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#methods-and-propertiesSomething like PureWindowsPath('//FILESERVER/Django').drive should do the trick for MEDIA_ROOT, IIRC.
If you use a network file server,you may need  a customized django file storage class.
