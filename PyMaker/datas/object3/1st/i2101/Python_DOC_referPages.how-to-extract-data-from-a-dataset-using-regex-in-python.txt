I have a dataset and I would like to extract the appositive feature from this dataset. I want to store the data inside dataset in two list. In find_atr list I stored the data where the coref tag includes coref_coreftype="atr". For the find_ident list I want to store the data of coref_coreftype="ident" So we have on the last coref tag in this dataset another coref tag that has coref_coref_class="empty". I dont want to store that data that has the tag coref_coref_class="empty". Now on the regex I mentioned that it should only include those that the coref_coref_class="set_.*?" not coref_coref_class="empty" but it still store the data of coref_coref_class="empty", where it should only store the coref_coref_class="set_.*?".How to avoid:
I reduced your dataset file to:And tried this code, which is almost the same you provided:And got this output, which seems right to me:
