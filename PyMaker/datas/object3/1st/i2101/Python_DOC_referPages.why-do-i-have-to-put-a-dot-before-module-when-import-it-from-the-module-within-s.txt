I am learning Python and feel import function is some different from that of Java.I have a code hierarchy like below:./test.py./pack/__init__.py./pack/submod.py./pack/anothersubmod.pytest.py runs as above. When I re-write submod.py as:Python gives me an error saying anothersubmod can not be found...I guess submod and anothersubmod are in same directory thus they shall refer to each other with their module (file) name, why should I have to add a dot before anothersubmod?
The Java equivalent would be to explicitly reference pack everywhere, like:The Python equivalent of that would be:That is correct Python and actually preferred style. Python also has the ability to use relative paths in import statements (from . style), but they tend to cause more confusion. PEP 8 recommends using absolute imports everywhere whenever possible:Absolute imports are recommended, as they are usually more readable and tend to be better behaved (or at least give better error messages) if the import system is incorrectly configured.
