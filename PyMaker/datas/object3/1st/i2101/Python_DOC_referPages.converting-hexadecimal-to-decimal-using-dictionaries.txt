Basically:I am trying to convert hex to decimal using dictionaries but I can't figure out how I would convert it. I have tried using a for loop to iterate over the hexadecimal value that the user enters, and to convert each one by multiplying it to a power of 16 depending on the length of hex. For example, if the user enters F21, the program should recognise that the length is 3 so should start by multiplying 15(F) by 16^2 and add this to 2*16^1 and add this to 1*16^0. But I come across so many errorsHexadecimal to Decimal Dictionary:Note:I am not trying to use this solution as I am trying to practice dictionaries
Since you are converting to decimals, the default base for integers, you should make the values of hex_to_demical integers rather than strings, so that you can perform numeric operations on each translated hex number:with the above code,would return:
Simply look over both the index i and the digit n of the hex string using enumerate(), and do the computation n_dec*16**i (e.g. with n_dec = 15 when n = F). Specifically, we have n_dec = int(hex_to_decimal[n]), with the int() needed because you store the values of your dict as strs. Finally, sum everything up:The reversed() is needed because the first (hexadecimal) digits refer to the larger values.The str() is used just to keep the final decimal result as a str, just as the values in your dict.
A one-liner, using enumerate and sum:
