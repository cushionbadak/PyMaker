I have an input file1 of two columns(tab-separted):And input file2 which have one column:what I want is to search an element from file2 in file1, and return the corresponding value in c1. If there is more than one matched value, then return all together in one column.Here is what should the output file be like:277 would be left empty because it does not exist.Any suggestion will be helpful.
