what does this error mean?this is my code:i have sorted my list from max to min. Now i want to print 3 worth averages but i got that error. i have done with with changing 3 to -4 but it didnt work too
.reverse() reverses your list in-place and returns None:insorted_averages is now None. sorted_averages is reversed though...read (4) in the python doc under mutable sequence types.
