I am writing a weight average function,There are four exceptions and I am stuck in how to set these conditions:a weight is less than 0 or greater than 100the weights do not add to 100the number of weights and grades are not equala grade is below 0 Here's my code:I am not sure which part I was missing in my code. 
I cleaned up your code a little bit:You can't use a for statement as part of an if/elif condition, but you can simplify your loop so that it can be checked (without iterating through the whole list) by using any. You  should also calculate the total_weight once, to reduce duplicate computations. sum can also take a comprehension to get your total.
I just solve this question when I change the order
