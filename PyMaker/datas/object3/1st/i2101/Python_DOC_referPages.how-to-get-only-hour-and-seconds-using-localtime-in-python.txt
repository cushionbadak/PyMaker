How do I get hour and seconds separate using this..This results in this..I just need to know how to get the hour and seconds separate, and if that's not possible with localtime() then how else could I do it?I'm not that good at coding but am trying to work on a project and can't find any informative documentation on what I need.
The time.strftime function is what you're after:Convert a tuple or struct_time representing a time as returned by gmtime() or localtime() to a string as specified by the format argument.To get the required output, use the following format string:
You can use the built in split function, which splits strings into array elements by checking for patterns. Default is ' ', e.g.will returnSo, applying this:will return:we want to extract the 4th element of the array, and arrays start at 0, so:this returns:now, we need to split again, this time the ':' character:this returns:now, for the last part:extract the individual values:
import timesecondVariable=time.localtime()[5]hourVariable=time.localtime()[3]
