I have a dict which is in the following form:I whould like to have a csv file where the first line is the keys of the dict and the next line the vectors in a column shape.Like: what I have for now is the first line but I don't understand how to write the vectors properly.All vectors have the same length.
Simple option using the zip built-in (no pandas dependency, eventhough pandas allows for less code lines):Note how I unpack val_list using the asterisk (*); without that unpacking this won't work as expected.Edited my code to have a fixed ordering to prevent mismatch between column header and content.
