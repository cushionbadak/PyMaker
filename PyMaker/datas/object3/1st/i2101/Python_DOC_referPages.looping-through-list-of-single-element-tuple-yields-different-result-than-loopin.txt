I have sqlite queries that output lists of tuples.  I'm running into a situation that I don't understand why looping through a list of single-element tuples yields a different output compared to looping through a list of multi-element tuples.  Take the following lists as an example:When I loop through the first query:I get the following:Whereas when I loop through the second query:I get the following:So why the difference in output when looping over a list of single-element tuples vs multi-element tuples?  Is there a different way of building the loop such that I don't have to handle the output differently?  Right now whenever I'm looping through the list of single-element tuples I need to build the print statement like this:I guess it just seems weird that Python is handling the two differently in how it parses the lists.  In other words, why isn't it outputting the second loop like this:
You are not comparing apple to apple.In your question, you are expecting that two differently unpacked loop to behave the same.
You should loop through 1-item tuples by unpacking the tuple just like you do with 2-item tuples (note the comma):
