Try any of the below :
The backslash character (\) has a special meaning when it appears in a string (or bytes) literal in Python. Backslash is used to escape characters that otherwise have a special meaning, such as newline, backslash itself, or the quote character.In your example, Python is trying to escape the U, H, D and p characters because they have backslashes in front of them!Fortunately, Python provides us with a syntax that allows us to write strings containing literal backslash characters. Both string and bytes literals may optionally be prefixed with a letter 'r' or 'R'; such strings are called raw strings and treat backslashes as literal characters.Now the backslash characters are treated as normal characters, and no escaping is attempted.You can read more about this in the Python reference documentation about literals https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#literals
