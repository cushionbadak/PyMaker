Natural Text
I have a python project that uses flask. I want to run a python file that imports another local file but every time I try to run the python file, it gives me ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'localfile'which is caused by the other local file I've imported.Here is the sample code I've used for importingI hope you guys can help me with this.Edited:Here's my file tree.
It's because there's no module localfile in the directory folder1.You may use a relative import like from .. import localfile. That means "from a parent directory, import module localfile".But to prevent relative import hell, I really suggest to use absolute imports instead:Script app/web/folder1/current_file.py:And run it using python -m app.web.folder1.current_file.Some further reading:What's wrong with relative imports in Python?PEP 328 introduced in Python 2.5 (the whole PEP 328)Absolute vs. Relative ImportThe import system in Python's language reference
