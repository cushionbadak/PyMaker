Natural Text
I have a list of strings like my_list = {'(.,0)', '[6,.)', '(b)' , '(,2]'}. I need to write a code which checks if the strings in the list are compatible with any of formats bellow:format1: '/(/./,/a float number/)'format2: '/[/float number/,/./)' For instance '(.,0)' is compatible with format1 and '[6,.)' is compatible with format2. I also checked here but could not find how to check for float?
'\d*\.?\d*' may help you check float.Try these two regular expressions:( I assume your example is correct and your description to pattern2 is actually closedbracket float comma dot parenthesis)
