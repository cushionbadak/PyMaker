I started learning Python code recently and one simple print statement is giving me trouble since last 4 days.Problem: the print statement is not working inside the validatePostcode(postcode) method for if-statement. The assigned value is 200 (status code) which is printing fine without the if-statement. Also, when I compare with the True (result value) for that API it works fine without if-statement, why it is not working after I apply the if and try to compare?Error: 
This piece of code (which is generating the error):Should beBecause python expects an indented block after the conditional, just like the message error is saying to you
You should indent the print statement like so:You can read more about this here!
From https://docs.python.org/2.0/ref/indentation.html: Leading whitespace (spaces and tabs) at the beginning of a logical line is used to compute the indentation level of the line, which in turn is used to determine the grouping of statements.By doing Python interprets the two lines as two different groups of statements. What you should do is:
Need to add an indent after the if statement. You can do so by pressing return after typing the colon
