This question already has an answer here:Generate all subsets of size k (containing k elements) in Python                    3 answers                I would like to store a list of elements based on the requirements like this:Loop the list and check each stringIf this string, then store the other strings within the list except the current string.When loop to "I" or "have" or "something" or "buy", then other elements will be stored inside the list except the current looped element. For example, we loop to "something" so "I", "have", "to", "buy" will be stored. My code:My expected output:
Try this
since you're only checking words that are already in the list, you could just reduce the problem down to:output:
OutputTry this simple code
You are essentially looking for all combinations of 4 elements (without replacements) from list of 5 elements.Use itertools.combinations:
Use itertools.combinations like this instead:                        Note that itertools.combinations will generate tuples by default. Which I've converted to list type objects using map.
try this
