I tried to use len(self.inbox) before to return how many elements are in the list that holds the tuples, however, I couldn't get that to work, so I'm trying to make it so when a new element is added to inbox list, it will add one to x which will basically take the role of len().However, when I run the program, the print at the end will return 0, even though I add a new message with inbox().add_new_arrival(...).It should return 1 but it doesn't, and I'm not understanding.
You are running message_count() on a new instance of your inbox class (inbox()), which is instantiated with an inbox of length zero.You might consider assigning an instance of your inbox class to a variable, using that object as you need.:
Since your inbox class is basically a wrapper around a list, you could make it a subclass of UserList and have access to all list methods.
