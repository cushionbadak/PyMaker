I have a set of lists similar to this one:I want to obtain the maximum value in each list without taking in consideration the 'NA' values.When I use the max() function I got following error:TypeError: '>' not supported between instances of 'str' and 'datetime.datetime'
you can use a generator expression to exclude items you do not want to compare:note that list is not a good variable in python. you overwrite the built-in list.
You could do something like this:By doing this you are creating a new list that will contain only datetime elements, and then you can easily get the maximum value by using the max() function.Or if you don't want to create a new list at all you can just do this:
You may opt to filter the wrong elements first:
If you are open to use pandas, you can let a library decide what is error and what is not.returns:
Take elements from list ignoring 'NA' and do a max():Note that I used lst instead of list because it shadows the built-in list.
Output:1900-01-01 16:49:00
