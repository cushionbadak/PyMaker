I am a beginner and I am trying to get the sum of the last element of each line of a file. Could anyone tell me what is wrong? 
There are several problems in your code. Firstly, f.close() is never reached, since return above it will exit the function. It might be better if you start using with open() as instead (it automatically closes the file when done).It is good practice to use the with keyword when dealing with file  objects. This has the advantage that the file is properly closed after  its suite finishes, even if an exception is raised on the way.Secondly, if the last character in a line can not be converted to an int, then a ValueError will be raised. When using try: you should handle only the error(s) you are expecting. All other errors should propagate through your code, so that you know when something is wrong. Below is an improved version of your code. To capture multiple consecutive digits per line, I'd rather use regular expressions:r'\d+$' is the pattern you are searching for in the line string. r'blabla' is a raw string, \d means a digit, + means one or more of the previous (that would be one or more \d), and finally $ matches the end of the line.
You are try to convert string character to integer in following statementint(lastElement)Just print value of lastElement variable in your code e.g. print "Value of lastElement:-", lastElementlastElement % 2 == 0 Will not work because type of lastElement variable in string so this statement will raise TypeError exception.No statement will run after return statement, in code file is closed f.close() after return statement.Use if loop to check result of % operation is equal to 0 or not.lastElement % 2 == 0 this will return True or False value so every lastElement will append in the list e.g.e.g. of exceptionUse Exception handling to catch value error:-
you are trying to convert string to integer at line: so it is giving error. You can put this line  inside try block to remove error.
