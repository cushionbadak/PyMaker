Sorry if this is REALLY bad, i'm new at python so please excuse my ignorance. I'm trying to create a method which can take a word as a parameter and return that word with HTML font tags with rainbow colors.Yeah I know it's pretty bad, like I said, i'm new. However, when this script is executed, the 'b' value is never increased. So the output always returns a correct rainbow up to the green color. Please tell me what i'm doing wrong! 
It might be easier to get rainbow colors using HSV color space. Then colorsys.hsv_to_rgb() function allows to convert from HSV to RGB:Test script:Example:
I'm not sure what you were trying to do precisely, but that block of conditionals seemed awfully inelegant, so I skipped it and wrote this solution:This uses a sine wave¹ to produce undulating values between 0 and 255 for each channel before printing the tags with each character.This is unrelated, but also notice that I used the string format() method instead of the deprecated method you were using in your code.One more protip: avoid naming a variable 'string' at the very least because it is easy to confuse a variable 'string' with Python's string module, though you're unlikely to be importing that any time soon.¹This seems like a good place to learn about sine waves
