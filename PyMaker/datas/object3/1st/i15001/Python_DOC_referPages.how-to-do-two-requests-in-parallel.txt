I have the following code which requests something from Amazon's API:Each of these requests takes about 1s waiting for Amazon to return data. How would I run both of these in parallel, so it would (ideally) take 1s to run, instead of 2s?
You can use a multiprocessing.Pool to parallelize the requests:this has the nice effect of being able to parallelize any given number of requests. By default, a worker per core is created, you can change the number by passing it a parameter to the Pool.
