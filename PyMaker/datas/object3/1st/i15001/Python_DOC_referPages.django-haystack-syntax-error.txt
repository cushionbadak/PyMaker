I am trying to run a Django project that works fine on my collegue's machine, but I get an error from haystack when trying to runserver.I have haystack included in your installed apps.Linux ubuntu 3.5.0-44-generic #67-Ubuntu SMP Tue Nov 12 19:36:14 UTC 2013 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/LinuxPython 3.2.3pip 6.0.8 from /usr/local/lib/python3.2/dist-packages (python 3.2)Any ideas are welcomeThanks
This appears to be a Python version issue. Python 3.2 does not have the u prefix for strings, because strings are unicode by default in Python 3. The prefix was reintroduced in Python 3.3 to make compatibility with 2.7 easier. See the 3.3 release notes.Note that the PyPI page for Haystack 2.3.1 mentions 3.3+ as a requirement.You should upgrade your Python version to 3.3.
