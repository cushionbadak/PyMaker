How can I multiply everything in my list by a number or how can I just apply a random function to my elements?I have no idea how to do this.
list comprehension:y = [x*2 for x in l]lambda function:y = map(lambda for x: x * 5, in l)looping each element of the list:for x in l:
There are hundreds of ways to achieve this. To get each element of the list you can use the following:
My mistake, i meant through decimals, my question was not clear enough. I'm running a function F through all the elements in my list but it is only going through the whole numbers in the list but i want it to run through decimals as well.x = f(y) for y in x:and my list is x = [0,2] but i need it to run through the decimal values as well.
