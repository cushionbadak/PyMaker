Natural Text
I would like when there is an error that it would display what line the error occurred at.  I am unsure how I can obtain the line # that the error happened at though.  Any help would be appreciated.
Using traceback.extract_tb:I added limit=1 for efficiency, to avoid loading the (possibly) huge traceback. You can't avoid indexing the list ([-1] to get the last element) though.
