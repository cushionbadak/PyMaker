My problem is : When I test my "isProduct" method, i get the error message saying:So, I looked for this problem, and I found I had to add 'self' before calling my method. I did. But still, it says :Don't mind what the methods say, my problem concerns the attributes, class and self.Here is my code, what am I doing (very) wrong ?
As others have noted you need to create an instance of your World class to access it outside of the class. And inside the class you normally should access it via self, not via the class name. Soprobably should beHowever the isProduct() method may not do what you want it to, since it returns after it's processed the first column of the first row.It's normal in Python to initialize a class (when necessary) using its __init__() method. This is explained in the official Python docs tutorial and in the tutorial linked by Andr√© Laszlo in the comments to your question.  Rather than doing simply doI didn't mention this earlier, because I suspected that the logic in isProduct() was wrong, since the return statement means that the method breaks out of those nested for loops after it tests the first value.
You need an instance of "World" to access the methods from outside that class:
You have created a class with an instance method but have not instantiated the class. try it like so:
I think your last "if" bit of code doesn't belong to any def you have because of wrong indentation,that is if that is meant to be inside your class. Otherwise you need to instantiate you class into a variable to hold a reference (don't use self keyword from outside the class body)
