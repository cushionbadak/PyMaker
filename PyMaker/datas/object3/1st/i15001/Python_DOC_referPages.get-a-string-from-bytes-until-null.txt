Given a bytes object and an index, I want to read a string from the bytes between the index and the next null(\x00). For example:I can do the following:Since the bytes object is very large, I would like an efficient version of addr_to_str. I am new to Python and not knowing how the interpreter treats the split() call when I only want to access the first split result. Or is the .decode() necessary?Question: Is there a better and pythonic way to do addr_to_str()?
How about (in Python 2):This scans the string once looking for a null, and then creates a slice.
