I am making Raspberry Pi program by using python.I want to write unittest of my python code.How can I get output status of GPIO?test target class is bellow. I want to check outputs after calling stop, brake, rotateClockwise and rotateCounterClockwise.
If you trust RPi.GPIO library, I think it is a good stating point, you can patch it by unittest.mock framework. patch RPi.GPIO.output give to you the possibility to break the dependency from HW and sense the calls to that function.   That could be your test classFew notes:In python-2.7 use mock available by pip instead of unittest.mockI'm using autospec=True almost in every test if you are wondering why take a look thisMy tests should raise almost 1 bug in your code: typo in brake method
