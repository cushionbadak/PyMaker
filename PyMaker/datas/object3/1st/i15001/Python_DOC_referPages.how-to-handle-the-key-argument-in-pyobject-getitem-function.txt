Natural Text
I am writing a python module from a c library of my own, I need to know how to handle the PyObject_GetItem() function, specifically the key argument, the documentation is not very helpful and I have seen an example where the solution isbut the problem is, that I would like to be able to know whether key is a string or an integer.I could use the PyObject_Hash() methdod if there is a way to differentitate a string key from an integer key since I can also compute the hash value corresponding to the string using the Python hash function, but i'd rather not do that because I already have a binary search implemented on the list that I am trying to be able to access via subscripting in python.I also triedand for the string to check which one succeeds, but then the interpreter throws an exception because the key is not a tuple.
I just found out the way to do it properly, there is a PyUnicode_Check() macro that takes a single PyObject parameter and returns 0 if the object is not a unicode object, so it returns 0 for the int key, and non-zero for the string key. That was exactly what I needed since now I can proceed to extract the text and perform a binary search in my list.Also, there is a PyObject_TypeCheck() function which returns the type of an object, very useful in this case too.
