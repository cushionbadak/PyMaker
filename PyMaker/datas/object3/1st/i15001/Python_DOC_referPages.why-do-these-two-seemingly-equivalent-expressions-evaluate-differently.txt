Why do these two seemingly equivalent expressions evaluate differently?This works:But this does not:Whats going on here??? I think that the two if's should be equivalent.    
It's due to how Python reads expressions.U < p == True is read as U < p and p == True. This is clearly not what we want.As namit said, we can fix this using brackets: (U < p) == True. Or just use U < p, as in the original code.If you want to learn more, the Python language reference explains this feature in detail:Comparisons can be chained arbitrarily, e.g., x < y <= z is equivalent to x < y and y <= z, except that y is evaluated only once (but in both cases z is not evaluated at all when x < y is found to be false).
change if  U < p== True :toif  (U < p)== True :lets take an example:
