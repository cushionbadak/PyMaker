I'm trying to get stock data from Yahoo! Finance using Python 2.7.9, but I only need data for the 3rd Friday of the month. I have a function to get the data, but need a way to get the dates. I want something like this:So that calling get_third_fris(6) will return a 6-item-long list of 3rd Fridays following the current date. The dates need to be Unix timestamps.(I have pretty much no experience with time or datetime, so please explain what your code is doing.)Thanks!
You can use the calendar module to list weeks, then grab the Friday of that week.You can format to Unix timestamp, but it's non-trivial. I'll refer you to this excellent answer which has info based on whether or not your date is timezone-aware.
You can use standard python functions to find the third friday of this month:We can apply the above function to get the timestamps of the next fridays:Output:
How about a more straightforward answer:
We do not need to import anything other than datetime. We can assume 7 days in a week and weekday 0 == Monday.
its easy to use dateutil to get the next fridaythis leverages the fact that there is always a week between fridays ... although Im not sure this answers your question it should at the very least provide you with a good starting point
Using dateutil.relativedelta:Or using dateutil.rrule:Here's a brute force solution (15x times faster):OutputSee Converting datetime.date to UTC timestamp in PythonHere's comparison with other solutions and tests (for all possible 400 years patterns).
I generalized @pourhaus answer to find the nth day of any month:
This is what you wanted right?
