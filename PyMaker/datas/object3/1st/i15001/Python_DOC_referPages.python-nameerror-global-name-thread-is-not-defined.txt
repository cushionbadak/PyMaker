A built-in module with the name thread already exists.When you are trying to import using from thread import Thread it is trying to search for the attribute named Thread which does not exists in the built-in thread module.When a module named spam is imported, the interpreter first searches for a built-in module with that name. If not found, it then searches for a file named spam.py in a list of directories given by the variable sys.path.sys.path is initialized from these locations:The directory containing the input script (or the current directory).PYTHONPATH (a list of directory names, with the same syntax as the shell variable PATH).The installation-dependent default.For more hereIt is recommended that you use a user defined module name that is different than the built-in module name.
