Write a function average that accepts a tuple that contains integer elements as an argument and returns the average value of the elements within the argument. my answer:Why wrong? How to do?Thanks!!!
Your function only works for those two specific inputs. The goal is to write a function that returns the correct average for all valid inputs.You should use python's builtin functions sum and len for thisFor Python 2 you have to wrap the sum(values) (or the len(values), either part of the division is good) inside a call to float.Starting with Python 3.4 you can use the function mean from the statistics module.or shorter as your function is just another name for statistic's mean
Try:Add a float to the sum function to work for Python 2.
