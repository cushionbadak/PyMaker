I have gone through Find intersection of two lists?, Intersection of Two Lists Of Strings, Getting intersection of two lists in python. However, I could not solve this problem of finding intersection between two string lists using Python.I have two variables.  How to find that '23@N0' is a part of both A and B?I tried using intersect(a,b) as mentioned in http://www.saltycrane.com/blog/2008/01/how-to-find-intersection-and-union-of/But, when I try to convert A into set, it throws an error:To convert this into a set, I used the method in TypeError: unhashable type: 'list' when using built-in set function where the list can be converted using into a tuple and then the tuple can be converted into a set. However, this returns a null set as the intersection.Can you help me find the intersection?
You can use flatten function of compiler.ast module to flatten your sub-list and then apply set intersection like this
Your datastructure is a bit strange, as it is a list of one-element lists of strings; you'd want to reduce it to a list of strings, then you can apply the previous solutions:Thus a list like: can be converted to iterator that iterates over '23@N0', '12@N1'with itertools.chain(*), thus we have simple oneliner:
The problem is that your lists contain sublists so they cannot be converted to sets. Try this:
In case you have to fit it on a fortune cookie:
You have two lists of lists with one item each. In order to convert that to a set you have to make it a list of strings:Now you can get the intersection:
Output:set(['23@N0'])If each of your list has sublists of only 1 element you can try this.
My preference is to use itertools.chain from the standard library:
