I want to call ping from Python and get the output.  I tried the following:However, this prints to the console, which I don't want.Is there a way to not print to the console and just get the result?
To get the output of a command, use subprocess.check_output.  It raises an error if the command fails, so surround it in a try block.To use ping to know whether an address is responding, use its return value, which is 0 for success.  subprocess.check_call will raise and error if the return value is not 0.  To suppress output, redirect stdout and stderr.  With Python 3 you can use subprocess.DEVNULL rather than opening the null file in a block.In general, use subprocess calls, which, as the docs describe, are intended to replace os.system.
If you only need to check if the ping was successful, look at the status code; ping returns 2 for a failed ping, 0 for a success.I'd use subprocess.Popen() (and not subprocess.check_call() as that raises an exception when ping reports the host is down, complicating handling). Redirect stdout to a pipe so you can read it from Python:You can switch to subprocess.DEVNULL* if you want to ignore the output; use proc.wait() to wait for ping to exit; you can add -q to have ping do less work, as it'll produce less output with that switch:In both cases, proc.returncode can tell you more about why the ping failed, depending on your ping implementation. See man ping for details. On OS X the manpage states:and man sysexits lists further error codes.The latter form (ignoring the output) can be simplified by using subprocess.call(), which combines the proc.wait() with a proc.returncode return:* subprocess.DEVNULL is new in Python 3.3; use open(os.devnull, 'wb') in it's place in older Python versions, making use of the os.devnull value, e.g.:
