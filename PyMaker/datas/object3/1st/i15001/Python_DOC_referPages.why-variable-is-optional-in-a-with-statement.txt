This question already has an answer here:Meaning of “with” statement without “as” keyword                    1 answer                I learnt recently the 'with' statement in python and its usage, mainly from the article Understanding Python's "with" statement and the official documentation for with statement.The most used example is understandable for meok so we open the file x.txt, we perform some tasks with it and it is automatically closed. The f variable is used to read in the file and do other tasks.But in the official documentation, the target variable after the expression is optional:I didn't find any example of with statement used without a target variable. Is there cases where this variable is not necessary?
Yes there are, you can find a couple of them in this answer :   What is the python "with" statement designed for?The most straightforward I can think of is the thread lock (also listed in the previous link):For the record I'd also quote the with doc :The with statement is used to wrap the execution of a block with methods [...]. This allows common try...except...finally usage patterns to be encapsulated for convenient reuse.As you don't always need a variable in try...except...finally, you do not absolutely need a target variable in a with statement.
hope it helps.
