Natural Text
This is my code. I am getting the error like as follows. I am new to python. kindly explain this.
Remove b, you are opening in binary mode hence the bytes error:  You can actually remove both as the default mode is r.
You are opening file in rb means read binary please open it in read mode. change your code toThis will open file in read mode (not binary).
The last line of the trace tells where the error first occurred.  Since you opened the file in binary mode, python is reading bytes. Your file is csv and opening it in read mode will suffice.So instead of rb use r
