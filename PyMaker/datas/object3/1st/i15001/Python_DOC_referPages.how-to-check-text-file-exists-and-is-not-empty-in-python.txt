Natural Text
I wrote a script to read text file in python.Here is the code.    I would like to check if the file exists and is not empty file but this code gives me an error.I would also like to check if program can write to output file. Command: ERROR:
To check whether file is present and is not empty, you need to call the combination of os.path.exists and os.path.getsize with the "and" condition. For example:As an alternative, you may also use try/except with the os.path.getsize (without using os.path.exists) because it raisesOSError if the file does not exist or if you do not have the permission to access the file. For example:  References from the Python 3 document os.path.getsize() will:Return the size, in bytes, of path. Raise OSError if the file does not exist or is inaccessible.For empty file, it will return 0. For example:whereas os.path.exists(path) will:Return True if path refers to an existing path or an open file descriptor. Returns False for broken symbolic links. On some platforms, this function may return False if permission is not granted to execute os.stat() on the requested file, even if the path physically exists.
