How can I perform some cleanup action when a python object is destroyed (for any reason)?
Extend the class of the object:
I would recommend you read this: __del__and think really hard if __del__ will do what you want as most likely it will not... due to peculiar nature of garbage collection.If you really need to release a resource I recommend using context managers and with statement.
