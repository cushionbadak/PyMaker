My class is inherited from OrderedDict and I want to to reinitialise the dictionary. But simplified code below changes only values of keys - order of elements remains the same: So the question is: what is happening inside OrderedDict.__init__ here and is it supposed to work this way? 
OrderedDict.__init__() doesn't clear the dictionary. It merely uses the equivalent of self.update() to add the elements to the dictionary. All you did was add already existing keys.You'd have to first remove those keys or clear the dictionary altogether:Demo:You can always look at the source code for most Python library modules; the collections documentation links you to the source code with the OrdededDict class.
