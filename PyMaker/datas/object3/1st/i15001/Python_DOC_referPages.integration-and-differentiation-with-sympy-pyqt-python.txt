I'm creating a system which quizes the user on integration and differentiation using python 3. when i display questions they are in a form like:How could I change it to a form like:Also I want it so when users type in equivalent answers it is still recognised 
For simple display replacement you could use:Then you could use it versus user input to compare their input answer versus yours.From the python docs:
If the intention is to use sympy, then the following will work:Expressions can then be simplified and compared using sympy's tools. If it was preferable to not use sp.Integer() explicitly to prevent Python from doing the divisions, one could substitute it into the original expression string using regular expressions before using sp.sympify() to convert the string into a SymPy expression.
