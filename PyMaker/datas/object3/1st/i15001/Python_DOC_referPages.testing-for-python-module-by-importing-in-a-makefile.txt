I am trying to create a generate Makefile.  Is there a way to test whether a python module exists and then perform different actions in the Makefile based on that?I have tried something like thishowever doing this does not produce any result.  Also if the module does not exist, python throws an error- how to store this information rather than simply crashing?
Consider making use of Python's imp module. Specifically, imp.find_module should be exactly what you're looking for.
