I wrote one application for phone and email addresses but when I want to print the data I got memory address instead of the data.The code is following:
The default representation for custom classes is to print their name and their id():You can give a class a __repr__ method to change the default representation, or a __str__ method to control how  instances are converted to strings (such as by the print function).Note that when printing a list or other container, the contents of that list will be shown by representations (repr() is used, not str()).Note that in your code, you only ever load the first person in the file; you never store a list of instances, you instead replace the contents of the file  with a new pickle every time you call addPerson().
This isn't anything to do with pickle; if you just created a Person directly and printed it you would get the same result. That's because you haven't told Python how it should print that type of object, and so it uses the default which is the memory address.To fix this, add a __str__ method to the class:
