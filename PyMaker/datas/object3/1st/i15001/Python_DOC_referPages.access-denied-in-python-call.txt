Natural Text
I'm trying to do a SVN ignore through a Python script.I am trying to run a command like:Here's the Python error message that I get:It's saying that I don't have access to do this. However, when I try to run this command in a CMD.EXE shell, everything works fine.EDITMaybe this is a clue, perhaps I can't escape characters like this
The problem is that you are not handling escape sequences properly.  \b denotes a backspace character and \f denotes a formfeed:This makes your paths invalid.  To fix the problem, simply use a raw-string:By prefixing the string literal with r, we tell Python to not interpret escape sequences.
