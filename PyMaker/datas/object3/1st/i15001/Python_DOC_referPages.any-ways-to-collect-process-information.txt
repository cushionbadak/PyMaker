I currently run:but how can I do this in Python without writing the same quoted command in my code?For executing bash commands I use os.system('<cmd>') or will call through subprocess, but I am looking something that won't hold any bash commands in it.
You can just sort the output from subprocess.check_output():This goes one better on the sort -k5 output in that it extracts the second column and sorts it numerically.Note that no sub-shell is created (no bash commands are being executed here); Python executes the ps command directly. This is the easiest way to get process information without installing third-party libraries.If you really wanted to avoid executing external commands, you'll have to use an add-on library. I recommend the psutil library here:See the psutil.Process() class documentation for details on what each proc object offers in the way of information and functionality.
