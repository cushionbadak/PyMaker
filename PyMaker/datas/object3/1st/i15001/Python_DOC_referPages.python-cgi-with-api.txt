I am quite new to python, I have built some applications in python with CGI and I found cgi is much easier compare to a framework as i have full control on everything.Tried to build a web api through below module but it end up with a web page rather than an api.Import cgiImport cgitbI would like to create a web api, as I am familiar with cgi i would like to create it (web api) through python cgi,I have been looking for a good documentation but i dint find any. It would be helpful if someone can give me a clue. I really appreciate your help.
CGI applications are nothing but backend of HTTP kind protocol, so I guess you could naturally build REST API on top of it: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transferAlso python have good build-in support for HTTP for better understanding from inside (in case u like to keep control on everything): https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html#module-http.serverAnyway, when your getting better in it your best bet to switch on a framework like these: https://www.djangoproject.com/ http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/
