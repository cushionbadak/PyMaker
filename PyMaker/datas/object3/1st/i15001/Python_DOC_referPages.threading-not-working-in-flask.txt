I'm trying to use threading in my flask app, like:When calling 127.0.0.1:5000/index in the browser, the result in the server console is not what I expected:I want the do_sth_else() function to run in some other thread, while the index() function go on returning the response right away, which means I should see the above result in defferent order.So I want to know:Why the index() function kept waiting until do_sth_else() is finishedHow do I get the app working as I wantedThanks!
t = threading.Thread(do_sth_else()) calls do_sth_else() and pass it's result to Thread.You should use it like t = threading.Thread(do_sth_else).
For actual parallelization in Python, you should use the multiprocessing module to fork multiple processes that execute in parallel.Python threads provide interleaving, but are in fact executed serially, not in parallel.This applies to CPython due to the existence of global interpreter lock, otherwise true concurrency is bound to number of cpu's you have
This example working as you want (tested on Python 3.4.3)
