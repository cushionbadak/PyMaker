I want to convert a string, which contains a file path, to a raw string, so the '\' characters are not considered escapes. So if I'm using something like this in Python 3, can I convert path to a raw string? I've tried using the encode method for strings, but that does not work. Also, I am not looking for solutions to replace the string '\' with '\'. I feel this process would take too long for how many paths I would have to process. So are there any simple conversions to convert path into a raw string?
Yes there is a simple solution to this,  you can try using path = r'c:\Users' or you can also use path = 'c:\\Users' whichever you feel like
As per the Python 3 documentation:Both string and bytes literals may optionally be prefixed with a letter 'r' or 'R'; such strings are called raw strings and treat backslashes as literal characters.So in your case, path = r'c:\Users' should suffice.If the data is already stored in a variable then it's important to realise that it already is a raw string. The \ character is used only to help you represent escaped characters in string literals. So;From what you describe, therefore, you don't have anything to do.
