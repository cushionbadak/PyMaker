I write a little script to use collins website for translation. heres my code:I have some questions:I can't use re.search on p. it raises this error: TypeError: can't use a string pattern on a bytes-like objectis there a way to use re.search without saving it?After saving file I should reopen it to use re.search otherwise it raises this error: TypeError: must be str, not bytes why this error happens?in this program I want to extract information between <span class="def"> and </span> from first match. but pattern that I wrote not work good in all cases. for example translate('three') is good. out put is : "totaling one more than two" but for translate('tree') out put is:"a treelike bush or shrub   â‡’ a rose tree"is there a way to correct this pattern. regular expression or any other tools?
When you call read on the response returned by urllib, you get a bytes object, which you need to decode to convert it to a string.Change toYou should read this https://docs.python.org/3/howto/unicode.html to understand why because issues like this come up a lot.Also, you probably don't want to parse HTML using regex. Some better alternatives for Python are mentioned here.
