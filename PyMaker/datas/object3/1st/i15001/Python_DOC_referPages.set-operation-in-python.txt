I have a two list of objects say example i want to have two different list. 1) matching items 2) not matching items I am able to get the matching element #1 like belowbut how can i get the not matching elements in a efficient way. I can use not in but is there any other way of doing this. Thanks ,
You can use the various set methods such as intersection, difference, symmetric_difference, and union
You can get it by using match:
Here's a possibility:
set is best way to get matching and non matching items.By List compression:
I think you can take advantage of the built-in type set which basically has unordered distinct elements. I also encourage you to try the shorthand notation to perform the operations union, intersection, and difference.A refresher of set operations from a math perspectiveSuppose A and B are sets.The union of A and B is the set A∪B = {x: x ∈ A or x ∈ B}The intersection of A and B is the set A∩B = {x: x ∈ A and x ∈ B}The difference of A and B is the set A-B = {x: x ∈ A and x ∉ B}The symmetric difference of A and B is the set A∆B = A∪B - A∩B
