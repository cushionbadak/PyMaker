I find python struct.unpack() is quite handy to read binary data generated by other programs. Question: How to read 16-bytes long double out of a binary file? The following C code writes 1.01 three times to a binary file, using 4-byte float, 8-byte double and 16-byte long double respectively. In python, I can read the float and double with no problem.  I do not find description of 16-byte long double in module struct format character section. 
Python does not support binary128s natively, hence you won't find support for them in the standard library. You will need to use NumPy (specifically numpy.frombuffer()) to convert from bytes to a binary128.
