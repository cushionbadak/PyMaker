I tried to find a simple solution to know how many arguments have the user input into the *args of a Python function but to no avail. So I guess it would be faster to ask the experts here.Say:So is there a way to know that if the user does foo(1,2,3,4) we know that he/she has inputted 4 arguments?Thank you for your attention and help!
Use len.The type of args can be found out with the built-in function type.
Since args is probably a sequence or a collection, you could just use len() to get the number of items.  
I think that is as simple as len(args) because the args is nothing but a tuple so you can apply other operations as well which are applicable to tuples.
