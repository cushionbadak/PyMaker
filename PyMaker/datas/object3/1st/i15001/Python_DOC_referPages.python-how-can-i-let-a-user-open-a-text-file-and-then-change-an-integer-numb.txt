I've asked a similar question but to no avail.I am a novice programming student and I've only been taught some basic techniques. Part of a task is to create a recipe program which I've mostly done, there is just one part preventing me from finishing. I am supposed to allow a user to call a previously created text file (I've done this bit), then after this the contents of this file should be displayed for them to see (I've also done this bit), however the user should be able to recalculate the servings and therefore change the quantity of the ingredients. So if the user entered: "I want 2 servings" and the original quantity for 1 serving was 100g it should now output 200g.It is really frustrating me and my teacher expects this work tomorrow. Below is what I am supposed to allow the user to do.The user should be able to retrieve the recipe and have the ingredients recalculated for a different number of people.• The program should ask the user to input the number of people.• The program should output:• the recipe name• the new number of people• the revised quantities with units for this number of people.I will post my actual code below to show what I have done so far, which is to allow a user to view and make a new recipe. But the revised quantities bit is missing.I apologise if the code is messy or unorganised, I am new to this.Code so far:EDIT:Below is an example creation of a text file (recipe) and it's output (the file is called bread.txt) Note the outputs are a bit messy, I will fix that once I can get the core of the program to work.Creating a recipeViewing a recipeAnd here is the output if you enter V:This recipe makes bread.txtI look forward to your replies.
It looks like your recipe files look like this:So basically you want to read four lines at a time, discard the first, then assign the rest to something useful.When we exit the with block, ingredients will be a list of dictionaries that can be used as follows:You should be able to leverage all that to finish your assignment!
