I am making a linkedlist, and I had to add in some different functions such as max, min , count and index for my list. I now have to add a remove function which is this snippet of code.I am basically just trying to link over the next node in the sequence, so that the built-in garbage remover will remove that node from the sequence. However, I am getting the following error message, which I know has to do something with my instance.Process finished with exit code 0Why is it printing out this weird ListNode.ListNode object at the end?Here is my testing code:This is my code for my ListNode class:This is my code for my LinkedList class:If anyone could help me out to find out why my removeItem function isn't working that would be helpful!On a side note, I'm also trying to make a doubly linked list of this list, I know I need to add a prev_node function into my ListNode function, but what else do I need to add? Thanks again!
If your method is returning a <LinkNode object at 0xmemoryaddr> string then it is working fine. You are printing the removed node, and Python is using the default repr() representation for that instance.If you wanted to make it more readable, you could give the ListNode a object.__repr__ method:This then will print ListNode(99, None) instead of the <ListNode object at 0xmemoryaddr> string Python defaulted to:One thing you do have to take into account: you need to adjust the length of the list too; on successful removal, subtract 1 from self.size.
