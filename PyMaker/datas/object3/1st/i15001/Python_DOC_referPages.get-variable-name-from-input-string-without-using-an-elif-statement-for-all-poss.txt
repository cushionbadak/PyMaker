I'm new to programming in Python 3.4.3 but I've started my first project that will help me as a chemist. I've created a series of code that asks the user to input the name of a chemical (e.g. water or ethanol) and then returns a list of chemical properties of the chemical. My code is below. I left out the chemical data I hard coded to make it easier to read hopefully.When executed, if the input is chemical1 what will be produced is:Basically, I have a huge list of chemicals with their data hard coded into the script and a large number of elif statements to account for each chemical (there are now 26 chemicals). The whole thing works perfectly but I would like to reduce the number of elif statements in order to reduce the number of lines of code. Perhaps by writing a for loop or some other expression as suggested by a friend of mine who has some experience with Python. I'm still a beginner so I'm not sure of all the different methods.I tried this:but when I ran the script I got an error that said:The idea is that when I input a chemical e.g. chemical2, I want chemicalName put straight into print (chemicalName.getData()) with the value of chemical2 which then prints the data I inputted for chemical2 = Chemical("Data\nData\nData")I'm not sure what I can do at this point. To give you all an idea, I have around 150 lines of code with all the elif statements so any ideas or feedback is very welcome.
You can use a dictionary and work like this
