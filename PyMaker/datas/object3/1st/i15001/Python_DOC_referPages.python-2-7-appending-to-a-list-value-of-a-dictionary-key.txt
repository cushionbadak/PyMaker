I have the following data:and I want to create a dictionary which contains key-list value, how can I do this with a dictionary comprehension?i.e.:I have tried the following but the list gets overwritten on every iteration.
You can use this dict-comprehension:Note, however, that this is pretty inefficient, as it will loop the entire list n+1 times!Better use just a plain-old for loop:Alternatively, you could also use itertools.groupy (as discovered by yourself):In all cases, d ends up being {1: [2, 3, 4], 2: [1, 2, 3]}
You could use defaultdict from collections module.
