I have a list like and I'd like a list with ['005','003','002']. What I'm looking for is something like map([:1], mylist). Does it exist?
You can use list comprehension, to strip the first character like thisif you want to use the map function, you need to pass a function to it, which does the same stripping, like thisHere we pass a lambda expression to the map, which gets each and every item and returns the stripped string.Alternatively, you can use the str.lstrip function idiomatically, like thisThe same lstrip function can be used with map like thisNote: If you are using Python 3.x, then the map returns an iterable map object. You need to iterate it and convert that to a list, like thisAs, scott_fakename mentioned in the comments, you can give the functional touch to this problem, like thisThis uses operator.itemgetter and slice function (which does the same job as the [1:] form).
