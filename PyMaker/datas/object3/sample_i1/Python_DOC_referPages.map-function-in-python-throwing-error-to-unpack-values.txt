I am trying to run the following speed of code It works fine and gives me an expected outputBut if I try with punctDict = {'(':' ( ',')':' ) ','t':'','n':''}The above for loop throws an exception as 
The problem is that you're using for keys,value to unpack a string with only one character in it. Observe the difference in output between this:and this:Notice that in the second example, 't' and 'n' just become 't' and 'n', and single-character strings cannot be unpacked using the comma notation. Since you're only re.escape()-ing the keys of your punctDict, you should not expect to get both keys and values in your for loop. The keys,value that you are running here isn't actually accessing the keys and values of punctDict both re.escape()-d, but rather only escaping the keys and trying to split the string (and succeeding because the string has only 2 characters. You can see the same behaviour if you compare this:with this:and even this:
map() function outputs an iterator, which cannot unpack to a key and value tuple.For going around that you can use a dictionary comprehension to map your dictionary keys to escape it.Here's a sample:
