Natural Text
I have a really weird problem with lxml, I try to parse my xml file with iterparse as follow:It is pretty simple and works almost perfectly, shortly it goes through my xml file, if an elem is  it checks if the language attribute is 'en' or 'de', it then checks if the  got a  child, if yes it writes its value into a fileThere is ONE < seg > in the file that seems not existing, returning None when doing elem.find('seg'), you can see it here and you have it in its context below <seg>! keine Spalten und Ventile</seg>.I don't understand why this tag which seems perfectly fine creates a problem (since I can't use its .text), note that every other  tag is find well
In the lxml docs there is this warning:WARNING: During the 'start' event, any content of the element, such as  the descendants, following siblings or text, is not yet available and  should not be accessed. Only attributes are guaranteed to be set.Maybe instead of using find() from tu to get the seg element, change your "if" statement to match seg and the "end" event. You can use getparent() to get the xml:lang attribute value from the parent tu.Example ("test.xml" with an additional "tu" element for testing)Python 3.xPrinted Output
I'm not sure if this is what you're looking (I'm pretty new to this myself), butGenerates this output:Again, apologies if this isn't what you're after.
