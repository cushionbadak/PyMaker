I've inherited some code and was curious as why it is being used and how it works. The code is as follows:No issue with the right hand side of the assignment, it's simply passing paramaters  to a sql string. I'm curious as to the strSQL: str = portion. What exactly is this doing as sql.SWAP_SQL.format(*sql_clauses) and strsql appear to have the exact same sql string?
Python 3 (i think .5 but maybe earlier) introduced type hints for methods and variables. The hints do not enforce the types (you can but not by default), they are there mostly for readability (basically just hinting the proper format).Pep-484 has some more details on method/class type hints, Pep-526 has syntax guidelines for variable type hints (your example), and you can also check typing library documentation. 
That is a type hint. It's hinting that the type of strsql is a str.
