When getting values from a dictionary, I have seen people use two methods:dict.get(key)dict.get(key, {})They seem to do the same thing.  What is the difference, and which is the more standard method?Thank you in advance!
The second parameter to dict.get is optional: it's what's returned if the key isn't found. If you don't supply it, it will return None.So:
From the documentation:get(key[, default])  Return the value for key if key is in the dictionary, else default. If default is not given, it defaults to None, so that this method never raises a KeyError.The typical way to look things up in a dictionary is d[key], which will raise KeyError when the key is not present.When you don't want to search for documentation, you can do:which will display the docstring for the the get method for dictionary d.
