Natural Text
I have a text file with data I would like to import into an Access database.  The text file contains a few paragraphs that I want to go into one row. I've separated where I want each row by "@@@"So here's an example of what I have: @@@ I would like to go to school because it's so much fun. Blah Blah Blah Blah. I am having so much fun today. @@@ I am so happy for no reason. Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah. I am having so much fun today. I would like this to appear like this: ID | Reporttext1  | I would like to go to school because it's so much fun. Blah Blah  Blah Blah. I am having so much fun today.2  | I am so happy for no reason. Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah. I am  having so much fun today.However, I know I am close with my code, but I am getting this: ID | Reporttext1  | I would like to go to school because it's so much fun. Blah Blah  Blah Blah.2  | I am having so much fun today.3  | I am so happy for no reason. Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah. I am  having so much 4  | I am having so much fun today.I tried an IF statement to only add the ID if there was "@@@" in the line, but I couldn't get it to work. If I did that though, I figure it should work. I have ID and reporttext using a semicolon for the delimiter. Here's my code: 
You can combine split("@@@") and enumerate(iterable,start_index) in conjunction with a generator expression:Output:Doku:split()enumerate()
