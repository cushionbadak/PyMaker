I am fairly new to python as my school teaches visual basic using the .NET framework and I recently got a Raspberry Pi 3B+.I am trying to create a program that I was recently asked to create on Visual Basic. I have looked at other forms on this TypeError but cannot see a way to fix my code.The Purpose is to have an inputted number of "Usernames" Created from the first 3 letters of the entered names and have one of the endings randomly selected to be put at the end of the three letters.These are the lines With Errorsprint("Name: "+Names[0:NameNumber])print("Username: "+str(Names[0][0:3])+str(Ending[EndingNumber]))This is the ErrorTypeError: Can't convert 'list' object to str implicitly
make two changes in your code print("Name: "+Names[i]) instead print("Name: "+Names[0:NameNumber])and print("Username: "+str(Names[i][0:3])+str(Ending[EndingNumber])) instead print("Username: "+str(Names[0][0:3])+str(Ending[EndingNumber]))
Cause:The Names here is a list type. You are add a string to a list. Python must make explicit type convertion and add operatoration between string and list is not allowed. So raise Type Error.Fix:I guess you are tring to go throught the Names and print element out.But the program you write has some other logic/data structure problems so it cannot results corrcectly I think. I suggesut you read some python tutorials first to have a basic understanding of python data structure...
In your loop, you want the ith name (the name at index i).Replace by:
