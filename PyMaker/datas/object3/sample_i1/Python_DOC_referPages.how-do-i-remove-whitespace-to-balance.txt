I just started Python as my first language two and a half weeks ago so please bear in mind that I probably took the longest route to create this code. That in mind, any advice you have for the rest of the code is greatly appreciated.Anyways, on to my question: I'm trying to get everything to line up nicely regardless of the item_name the user enters. Of course, the longer a name the user enters, the farther it pushes the rest of the line. Does anyone have any advice to remove a certain amount of whitespace depending on the length of item_name? I've never posted code like this before so I might not do it right, but here's the specific print section for what I'm having issues with:Here's the first half of the code before the above: I won't give the final section because that's simply me printing the subtotal, tax, and grand total. Here's the output when I enter 3 items with same number of characters in the name:If I enter any character different from the others, the prices and quantities get pushed around. If it's too complicated to do, just tell me. I just hate having them not be able to line up.    
The format() function and its format string syntax are a better way to format strings than the old % formatting.In this case the align characters < and > can help and the output code becomes something like:
