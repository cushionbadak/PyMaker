So, I've tried a lot of things from the Internet, but nothing helps me. I have main.py file and I have a neighbour folder 'A' and folder 'B' in 'A'. How can I import .py files from 'B' to main.py? P.S I've tested variant about init.py, but it causes unresolved import error
Folder A and B should have empty __init__.py files in it. More about this in docs a_file.pyb_file.pymain.pyrunning main.py file will print out message Printing from A folder function
