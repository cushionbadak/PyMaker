I am a window user, and I have install python 3.6 on my computer. In order to use jupyter notebookd, I downloaded atom, i have ipython and pandas installed already. After my installation, I find after entering the command 'jupyter notebook' on the command-line , my browser will not open jupyter notebook, instead i got the follow error message error message:So, what is the problem? I am new to python and jupyter notebook. Thank you very much.
Install anaconda , "Anaconda is a free and open-source distribution of the Python and R programming languages for scientific computing, that aims to simplify package management and deployment " (As on google) and then try Jupyter notebooklink: https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/
Since the error seems to come from the tornado package,i would try to reinstall tornado if this does not help I made the experience that the conda packages often work better in windows: so just reinstall jupyter notebook (best in a new env) using anacondaBest of luck, installing jupyter notebook used to make me a lot of troubles as well.
It is because Python3.5 has its own version typing (https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html), and it is incompatible with the installed version of jupyter/tornadoUpgrade to python3.6 could solve the problem.
I think it will be better to create a virtual environment. Then, re-install jupyter notebook under that environment.Visit https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-jupyter-notebook-with-python-3-on-ubuntu-18-04
