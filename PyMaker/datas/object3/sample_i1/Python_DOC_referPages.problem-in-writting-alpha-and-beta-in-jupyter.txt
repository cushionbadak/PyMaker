I am plotting curves using Getdist inside the jupyter. For labeling the parameters I have a problem.I write \zeta, \chi, \gamma, \Omega, \omega and I have no problem in them and the symbolic shape of them appear without no problem, but as I want to write \beta and \alpha I get some errorsthis is part of the too long errorThis is part of the related code:I really do not understand the issue, and I am confused.
it's because '\a' is a string literal for ascii character 7 ascii table just like '\t' is for tab and '\n' is for newline.we can check this using the built-in function ord() which returns the corresponding ASCII table index for the supplied character - docon the other hand, '\o' doesn't correspond to any character.to get around this, just prepend r(as in raw string) before the string like this my_string_variable = r'alpha\omega'
