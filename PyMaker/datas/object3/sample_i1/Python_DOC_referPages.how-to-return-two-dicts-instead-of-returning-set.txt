result: ({}, {})But I need {}, {}How to do it?I am trying to return data from function but getting:See:
Those are the same thing, only ({}, {}) is printed in a non-ambiguous way.The function is returning a tuple (more closely 2-tuple), not a set as your title says.
foo() will give you a 2-tuple of two dictionaries. Fetch the return value, and index or unpack the tuple to get individual access to your two dictionaries.In the example you gave, unpacking is apparently the better way to go, but in some cases you might want to keep the returned tuple and access its elements later with indexing.
