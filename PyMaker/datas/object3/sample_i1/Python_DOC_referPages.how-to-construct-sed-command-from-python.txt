I have a string that contains quotes like this:Problem is when I use it as a string in python it adds a backslash before single quotes, as seen here:Why is this happening and what can I do about it?
It's just escaped in the repl. If you print it out, it will show there is no slash added:
The ExplanationWhat you're seeing is the representation of your string as produced by the repr function. repr outputs strings in such a way that they're valid python literals; in other words, you can copy/paste the output of repr(string) into a python program without getting a syntax error:Because your string contains both single quotes ' and double quotes ", python has to escape one of those quotes in order to produce a valid string literal. The same way you escaped your double quotes with backslashes:Python instead chooses to escape the single quotes:Of course, both of these strings are completely identical. Those backslashes are only there for escaping purposes, they don't actually exist in the string. You can confirm this by printing the string, which outputs the string's real value:The SolutionThere's nothing to solve! What are you still doing here? Scroll up and read the explanation again!
