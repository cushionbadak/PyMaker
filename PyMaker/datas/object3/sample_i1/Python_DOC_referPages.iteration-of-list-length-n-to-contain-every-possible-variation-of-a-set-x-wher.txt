itertools.permutation(iterate, r) provides a way to provide a set of permutations of either length r or len(iterate). However it does not work if -r > len(iterate)Take this example.list(intertools.permutation([0, 1, 2])) returns...[(0, 1, 2), (0, 2, 1), (1, 0, 2), (1, 2, 0), (2, 0, 1), (2, 1, 0)]This is expected.But lets say that we would like r to be larger than the length of the iterate. i.e. if you iterate a set [0, 1, 2] over a length of 4 you would hope to get this sort of answer as below.however when you try list(itertools.permutation([0, 1, 2], 4)) it returns [] i.e. emptyIf anyone knows of a way to do this please tell me.
Try with itertools.product(*iterables, repeat=1)In your case you could use list(itertools.product(range(3), repeat=4))
