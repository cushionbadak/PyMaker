This question already has an answer here:Sorting a dictionary by value then key                    3 answers                The correct output should be: dictionary={'b': 5, 'k': 5, 'a': 2}Used the following approach: but the output is coming as {'k': 5, 'b': 5, 'a': 2}edit1: I am using Python 3
Your python version may not keep the order in which you entered your key-value pairs. In which case you can use collections.OrderedDictif your python version is <= 3.5 dicts will lose their order; in python 3.6 the order-keeping is considered an implementation detail and should not be relied on. starting from python 3.7 this is considered to be part of the language specification.so starting from python 3.7 your code will not need OrderedDict and you can work with the regular dict.
