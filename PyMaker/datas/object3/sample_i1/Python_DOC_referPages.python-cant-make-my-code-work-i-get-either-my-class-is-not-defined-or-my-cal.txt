I'm doing a mine sweeper game, and here is the whole code: https://codeshare.io/5zxyXWI'm trying different code to make this work, at line 82(from the whole code):  The error I get is that my class is marked, as an invalid syntax, So I found this:  invalid syntax when create a instance of classBut as far as I can see play_game() is to the fully to the right. And even if I add a doc string, it still complains.So I found this NameError: name 'Game' is not defined, but it is but, shall I really take self.play_game=play_gameoutside the class???Okey so It looks something like this now: Then I got: Note! I choose to delete the g in the g = class playGame()So the invalid syntax, disappeared. (even though I don't agree that is the answer but)--So I don't know what to do here. I want to make it work. If it should run properly it should:ask me the size of the grid.ask me how many mines in the grid.play.the end.
You are definitely struggling with basics.Second attempt is good, but:You have to remove nested function play_game from __init__ function.Change object initialization code.
You need to instantiate an object of your class. With your updated code, after you define the class, what are you supposed to do next? Obviously can't just let it sit there, you have to instantiate an object (variable) to that class. So you've defined the class playGameThis will instantiate the PlayGame class and assign it to the object myInstance. Everything defined within def __init__ will be executed as well.
