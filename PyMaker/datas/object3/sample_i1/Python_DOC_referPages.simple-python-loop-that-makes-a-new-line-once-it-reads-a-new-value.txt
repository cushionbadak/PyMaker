I am new to python. I am trying to apply a loop over a sorted list. the idea is whenever the loop reads a new value different from the previous one it makes a new line before it (the editor I am using is jupyter notebook)what I've tried is The expected output should be something like thisbut unfortunately this code didn't do the job. Thanks for your help, I appreciate it.
You can simply do that by comparing the elements in the sorted list, as follows:Output:
Initialize a last var to keep track and iterate over your list, only printing a newline when the element differs from lastOutput
More fancy; groupby():
If the current number isn't equal to previous one, print a new line before printing the item.
With your code, you are using i to iterate through the array d but then using i to access the element of the array d[i] thus i == d[i] will be true for the first three iterations then after that it'll be false (e.g. i = 2, d[2] = 1, therefore (i == d[i]) == False. Also, no need for an elif clause since you are only worried about one case. Use a variable to keep track of the previous element in the array and that should do the trick.Edit: sorry read the code wrong, explanation should be better now
