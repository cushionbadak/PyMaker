Natural Text
I have a dictionary data that I need to write it into a CSV file under the heading Form Name Type & Definition, the dictionary data to write is in the code snippet below.writeData.pyHowever, after I executed the python script above, data was written correctly under the heading Form, Name, and Type. Yet, under the heading Definition, the data was expanded to some more column be young its heading Definition. I searched around but no clue why it expands column like this, or the amount of data is limited inside on csv column? What's wrong with this, how can I write its data in correct column of CSV file? Thanks.
The problem is that csv delimiter each column by a special character. In your case, you are using a comma ','. But in your text also commas occur. So the csv takes this as a delimiter and interprets it as a new column. You can switch from comma to semicolon ';' as a delimiter. But even then you have to ensure that there are no semicolons in your original text.If you make it this way you need to change these lines:But I would suggest using a library, like @Nathaniel suggests
You may have success converting your dictionary to a data frame and then saving it to a csv:Without some example data, it is difficult to test this on your data.
It did not expand into adjacent columns; because of the size of the text, it doesn't fit the column width, and Excel's default is to draw that text over adjacent columns.  You can verify this is the case by selecting cells that it appears to have expanded into, and seeing they are in fact empty.  You can also change the way these cells are displayed, "wrapping" their contents within the column provided (making the rows taller).
