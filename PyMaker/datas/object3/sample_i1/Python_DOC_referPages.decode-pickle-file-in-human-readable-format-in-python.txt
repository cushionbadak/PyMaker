I am new to handling data structure. When I tried to read pickle data and result looks like below:b'\x80\x03}q\x00(X\x05\x00\x00\x00Phoneq\x01}q\x02(cnumpy.core.multiarray\nscalar\nq\x03cnumpy\ndtype\nq\x04X\x02\x00\x00\x00i8q\x05K\x00K\x01\x87q\x06Rq\x07(K\x03X\x01\x00\x00\x00......... long lineHow can I convert this to human-readable format in python? 
When a data is dumped, pickle produce a bytes string. This is what you have.For instance:Produces the bytes string:note: I split the long line in 3 parts for readability.Python defines several protocols, names HIGHEST_PROTOCOL and DEFAULT_PROTOCOL. So, If you change the protocol you can have a different result.To read this bytes string, you need to use pickle.load (or pickle.loads to read from a bytes string).For instance:You get:Cool, but if your data contains instance of unknown type, you wonâ€™t be able to deserialize it.Here is an example:The del statement is here to simulate an unknown type. The result will be:For more info, the protocols are specified in the Python documentation.
I would recommend looking at the Python documentation, in particular the pickle module docs. Your current code is importing pickle, but it's not actually using pickle, since you're just loading the file using read(). Using pickle.load() or another pickle method should do the trick.For example:Editing to add the mandatory pickle warning from the docs:Warning: The pickle module is not secure against erroneous or maliciously  constructed data. Never unpickle data received from an untrusted or   unauthenticated source. (Unpickling an unknown file leaves you open to having arbitrary code executed on your computer, so be careful what you unpickle!)
