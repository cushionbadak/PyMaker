Hello I would like to useto see what's going on with some variables, however im using Docker which means by default it's not printing anything.Can someone tell me how I can pass these print commands to the docker container ?
This is because Python buffers its output by default.An easy way to change this behavior is to use the PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1 environment variable: docker run -e PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1 <your_image>An other way is to call the python command with the -u option.
Maybe you should run your container with the privileged option to share /dev (therefore, sharing /dev/stdout).This is working for me:print.py:Dockerfile:Commands:Hope it helps.
