I have a folder in which there are subfolders corresponding to 10 different classes, and the names of these subfolders are my labels. I came up with the following code to read the images into a Numpy array and save the labels.The error I'm getting is os.chdir(roots)  FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'U'When I print(root) it gives the correct subfolder paths. How do I handle this error?EDIT : Got it working by removing for roots in root since os.walk returns a 3 tuple for each directory where root gives us the directory paths.
root will be a string; the name of the current directory of os.walk.will iterate over that string; roots will iterate over root one character at the time... os.chdir(some character) will not work.
As docs on os.walk() say, first item in each 3-tuple it returns is a string.As such, for roots in root: iterates over characters of the string.You need to read carefully what kind of data structure os.walk() returns and restructure your script accordingly.
Others already pointed out what is wrong, so I will not repeat it.I'll just add that you should useor whatever function isn't working as you expect it to, inside the interpreter before asking a question.You handle this error as follows:
