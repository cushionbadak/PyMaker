I'm a JS dev trying to learn a bit of Python while working on a Raspberry-Pi3 project that reads data from a Bluetooth temperature sensor.I need to write the data to my file.txt every 10 seconds, how could I do that please? I found similar topic here (Run certain code every n seconds ), but I don't know how to make it work in my current scenario.   
You can use the time module to pause the program for 10 seconds on each iteration;However this will block the rest of the program running, although a simple multi-threading script to call the writing function would suffice.And in relation to the code you are using, insert the sleep call within the poll function and wrap what you have there. If you want to loop the program 10 times then;Or if you want it to run forever until you KeyboardInterrupt or exit somehow:
you need some kind of loop that polls your sensor - I do not see one glancing over your code. You got while and for loops in JS as well - look them up in http://docs.python.org/3/tutorial if you are unsure about the syntax. store the time you wrote to a variable , sleep a bit poll the next value, check if 10s passed, write if, else not. (or simply sleep 10s between polls if you do not want intermediate values printed  Readup about loops:for statementlooping techniquesOutput:More remarks:use with open(filename,mode) as f: and scope the file opeations below it - it will autoclose your file after scope and handle exceptions by closing the filehandle as well. Using mode "w" will truncate the file before writing to it - you might want to use append instead: reading and writing files
