I want to process quite big ARFF files in scikit-learn. The files are in a zip archive and I do not want to unpack the archive to a folder before processing. Hence, I use the zipfile module of Python 3.6:However, this yields the following error:According to loadarff documentation, loadarff requires a file-like object.According to zipfile documentation, open returns a file-like ZipExtFile.Hence, my question is how to use what ZipFile.open returns as the ARFF input to loadarff.Note: If I unzip manually and load the ARFF directly with data = loadarff( 'datafile.arff' ), all is fine.
Read zfile into a in-memory BytesIO object. Use TextIOWrapper with encoding='utf-8'. Use this in-memory buffered text object in loadarff.Edit: Turnsout zfile.open() returns a file-like object so the above can be accomplished by :Thanks @Bernhard
