I am trying to add and extend the items of a list in a loop as follows:The result of the above code is something like this:But, my desired output should something like this:
In python two sequence types can be concatenated with a + operator. This can also happen in-place with the += operatorInstead ofyou should usein your loop.Another way of adding all items from one list to another is the extend method of the list . In contrast to the append method which adds the given item as a whole to the list, extend appends all its items to the list:
You can use extend() instead of append() it will add the elements from the passed in list rather than the list itself.
Pythonic way to combine two lists items together as a single list item is to use "extend" keyword instead of append.
