I don't understand how indexing of a numpy ndarray works, when using a custom class instance as the index.I have the following code:I expect to get the same result (6) from both print functions. But from the second one, where the class instance is used a the index, I receive an error:If I call the __index__ method explicitly withit works. But this defeats the purpose of the magic method.If I call the array with just one index, everything works fine:So what I don't get:The ndarray can use the output of the __index__ method for multiple dimensions. Seen when calling it explicitly.The ndarray does coll the __index__ method. Seen in the second example.But for some reason, this does not work at the same time. Why?Did I miss something, or does the ndarray not support this kind of indexing?I just want to add, that it apparently doesn't matter, how the __index__ method outputs its result. I tried:None of them worked for me.
As mentioned here, __index__ method Must return an integer.That's why your attempt didn't work, while the "one index" example worked.
