Python list are zeroed indexed. That means the first index of a list starts from 0. So the indexes for hastag_list are 0, 1, 2. However, randint(1,3) is inclusive, so tag will sometimes randomly be assigned 3.It should start to become clear what the problem is. Since the maximum index of hashtag_list is 2, and tag is sometimes 3, then sometimes you will be indexing hashtag_list out of range. The simple solution would be to use randint(0, 2) rather than randint(1, 3). However, a cleaner solution would be to use random.choice to choose a random option from hashtag_list:
randint(a, b) produces a random integer in the range [a, b] inclusive, those sometimes when it doesn't work it's producing 3, and 3 is beyond the list. Change it to randint(0, 2), because in Python (and many other languages), a list with n elements' indices start from 0 and end at n - 1. Thus:
Change tag = randint(1,3) to tag = randint(0,2)
