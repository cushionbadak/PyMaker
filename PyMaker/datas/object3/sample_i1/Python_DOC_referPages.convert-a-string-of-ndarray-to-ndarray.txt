I have a string of ndarray. I want to convert it back to ndarray.I tried  newval = np.fromstring(val, dtype=float). But it gives ValueError: string size must be a multiple of element sizeAlso I tried newval = ast.literal_eval(val). This gives String of ndarrayHow can I convert this back to ndarray?
To expand upon my comment:If you're trying to parse a human-readable string representation of a NumPy array you've acquired from somewhere, you're already doing something you shouldn't.Instead use numpy.save() and numpy.load() to persist NumPy arrays in an efficient binary format.Maybe use .savetxt() if you need human readability at the expense of precision and processing speed... but never consider str(arr) to be something you can ever parse again.However, to answer your question, if you're absolutely desperate and don't have a way to get the array into a better format...EDIT: For the case OP mentioned in the comments,I am storing these arrays in LevelDB as key value pairs. The arrays are fasttext vectors. In levelDB vector (value) for each ngram (key) are stored. Is what you mentioned above applicable here?Yes â€“ you'd use BytesIO from the io module to emulate an in-memory "file" NumPy can write into, then put that buffer into LevelDB, and reverse the process (read from LevelDB into an empty BytesIO and pass it to NumPy) to read:
