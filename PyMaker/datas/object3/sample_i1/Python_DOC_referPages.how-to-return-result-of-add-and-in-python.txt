I'm trying to write a function that will sum values in a for loop.I've tried:I am getting a syntax error, however I am unsure why as this seems correct to me.
The correct way to do this is the sum function with a generator expression. A generator expression is similar to the loop you were trying for, but bounded by parentheses (which can be the same as the call parens when it's the only argument, as with sum):Note that totalnum is never assigned (you can't assign as part of a return), but it doesn't have to be; the value from sum is returned directly without storing it in a named variable at all.If totalnum is some existing global that must be updated, you'll need to split this into three lines, one to declare totalnum a global (so it doesn't become a local due to being assigned), one to increment totalnum, one to return it:
Use existing sum() function.Or, if you need a starting value:If you absolutely must implement it yourself:
According to [Python 3]: The return statement:return_stmt ::=  "return" [expression_list]totalnum = totalnum + item['quantity'] for item in self.cart.values() is not an expression but a statement, hence the SynraxError.One way of doing it, is using [Python 3]: sum(iterable[, start]):The "old style" approach:
Why don't you do it like this:
