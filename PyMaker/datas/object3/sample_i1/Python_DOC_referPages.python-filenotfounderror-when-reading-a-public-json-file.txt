I have a public viewable JSON file that is hosted on s3. I can access the file directly by clicking on the public url to the s3 object and view the JSON in my browser fine. Anyone on the internet can view the file easily.Yet with the below code is ran in Python (using Lambda connected to an API trigger) I get [Errno 2] No such file or directory: as the errorMessage, and FileNotFoundError as the errorType.What am I missing here? Since the file is a publicly viewable JSON file I would assume I wouldn't be forced to use boto3 library and formally handshake to the file in order to read the file (with object = s3.get_object(Bucket=bucket_names,Key=object_name) for example) - would I?
