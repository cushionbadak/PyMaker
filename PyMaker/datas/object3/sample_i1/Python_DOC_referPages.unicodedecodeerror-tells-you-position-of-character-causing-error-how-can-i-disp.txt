When opening/reading a file using something like it is possible to get an error such as I know I can use a vscode extension to locate the character in the csv_file at position 1678. But is there a way I can do it with python. Naively, something like. Or even better, getting the line numberI'm looking for a way of making the standard UnicodeDecodeError message more useful than just telling me a character position.
The UnicodeError has quite a bit of information in its attributes.By catching the exception, you can exploit this to find the offending bytes:In order to determine the line number, you can maybe do something like this (inside the except clause):... but I'm not sure if e.object is always a (byte) string (this could cause extra trouble for huge files), so I don't know if it always works.Also, in a CSV file, the number of newlines might be greater than the number of logical rows, in case there are newlines inside some the cells.
