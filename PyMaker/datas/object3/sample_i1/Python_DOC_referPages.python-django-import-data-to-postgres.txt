I am new to Django and wondering how to insert the data from a excel/csv/txt file into Postgres using Django. I was able to successfully connect to database and create a table but ca you guys help me with how to import and export data using Django modelsEdit:was successfully able to load the data into table, but was only able to load 2 rows, it has more than 1000 rows, where am i doing wrong ?? Please suggest
It would be helpful if you post some more details but I think this will not change the method you take. For example, you have to import Book data from csv (use native csv reader) / excel (use openpyxl), which has fields, like title, isbn, page_count and etc.First of all, my recommendations would be to rely on django's ORM and create model (Book) with corresponding fields. Then just read the source file and do the main job - insert (for efficiency reasons, I recommend to use bulk_create):In addition, for dumping data based on model, please use built-in capability of django:and voila. Hope it helps
