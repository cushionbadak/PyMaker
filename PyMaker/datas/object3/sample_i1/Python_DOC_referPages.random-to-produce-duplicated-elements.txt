When working with random modulethe result is not randomly completelyHow could produce a result as to generate duplicated elements.
sample is the wrong tool, as you've seen. Instead, you could use choices:
You can try use Python's standard random.choices where you can specify optional weights for each element you generate. Docs:Output
You can use numpy.random.choiceOutput:
What you're looking for is random.choices - New in Python version 3.6. - The function definition is below; and you can read more here.You can assign weights in order to give a specific element precedence over others. - Although I believe the example below would satisfy your needs.ExampleAlternatively in older Python versions you can use random.choice as shown below; although it simply support one argument, a sequence.ExampleOutput
