Using the command:I get 10 numbers (for example 10,20,30, etc.)How can I check that each next element is greater than the previous one?
Or you can change the foreach loop to for in range()
Here's one interesting approach. Say your list is called any_number_list. Then You could use following syntax:You pack two arrays using zip and iterate through them, adding difference to new array called sequence  if difference is less than 0. If, at the end, this array contains any number, then this is not monotonously non-falling sequence.
