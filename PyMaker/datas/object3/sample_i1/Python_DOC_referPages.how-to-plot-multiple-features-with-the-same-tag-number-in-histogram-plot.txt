Natural Text
I have a text file including 8 features and 1 class. The data of my file is (data.txt):In the above file, the first 8 columns are the features. They are tagged with a number that could be 1 or 2 or 3. The last column is the class name (HIGH). Now I want to plot these features based on the tag numbers. I can do it for 3 first column by this code:Here is the result:However I could not plot the other 5 columns because I did not know how to put them next to each other as there are only 3 align options (left, mid and right). What I am looking at is a histogram plot for all 8 features that separates the features based on the tag number. A graph like this:
You don't need a histogram here and you can easily generate the required figure using a bar chart because you are just plotting a single frequency here. The idea is as follows:Use Counter module from collections to get the frequency of 1, 2, and 3.The x-positions for your bar chart will be centered around 1, 2 and 3. However, to have the desired effect, you can tweak the x-positions by offsetting them: first 4 bars to the left of 1, 2, 3 and the next 4 bars to the right of 1, 2, 3. This can be done using an offset parameter (j-4)*0.1 which you add to the x-values. Here 0.1 serves as a nice choice of bar width.You don't need an additional loop over i here since it is always 0df.ix is deprecated in the newer pandas versions. You will have to use df.iloc instead.Following is how you can do it.
