I have a python script which every 10 minutes sends me an email with everything written in the console. I am running this with the crontab in my ubuntu 18.04 vps.Sometimes it doesn't send the mail so I assume that when an error happens execution stops but how can I get the errors to be written in a txt file so I can analyze the error ?
Logging ModuleTo demonstrate the approach with the logging module, this would be the general approachAnd if I cat file_dir.txtPrint to FileAs I pointed out in the comments, you could accomplish this with print as well (I'm not sure you will be applauded for it)cat my_errors.txtNote that logging.exception includes the traceback in this case, which is one of the many huge benefits of that moduleEditIn the interest of completeness, the traceback module leverages a similar approach as print, where you can supply a file handle:This will include all of the information you want from logging
You can use the logging module as suggested in the comments (possibly superior but outside the scope of my knowledge), or catch the errors with try and except like:Although this is generally frowned upon to catch all exceptions, because then should your program fail for whatever reason it will get gobbled up in the except clause so a better approach is to figure out what specific error you are encountering like IndexError and then just catch this specific error like:
