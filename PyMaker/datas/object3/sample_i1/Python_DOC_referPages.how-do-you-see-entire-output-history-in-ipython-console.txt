in ipython, I can use %hist or %history to print recent history, but this only prints history from current session.I would like to print all history, similar as bash historycommand does. What I am trying to do is to get complete history, so that I can then search with regex, see what commands followed after specified commands, and so onSpeaking of history, can it also print timecodes?SIDE NOTE:In bash, I have written a simple script which prints history and I can grep it for keywords. I see times when certain commands were executed. I can specify -A n or -B n, where n is a number of lines AFTER or BEFORE a given command.This is very handy, because I can easily find what I did when, and what followed, ...I am looking for something similar for ipython
In ipython enter:It does not print time codes but it does print session/line number.
First use %hist -o -g -f ipython_history.md to output the history (input and output) to a text file.
