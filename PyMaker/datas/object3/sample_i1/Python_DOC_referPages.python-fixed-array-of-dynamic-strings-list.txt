I would like to fill iteratively an array of fixed size where each item is a list of strings. For example, let's consider the following strings list: I want to obtain the following array of 3 items (no ordering is required):I have the following piece of code:But I get this result:Where am I wrong please?Thank you for your help!
The problem is due to the following: res = [[]] * 3 will create three lists, but all three are the same object. So whenever you append or extend one of them it will be added to "all" (they are all the same object after all). You can easily check this by replacing it with:res = [[],[],[]] which will then give you the expected answer. Consider these snippets:WhileAlternatively you can create the nested list like this: res = [[] for i in range(3)]
You can use itertools.groupby and group the elements in the list (having been sorted) according to the first element. You can use operator.itemgetter to efficiently fetch the first substring in each string:
You can use list comprehension :OUTPUT :
