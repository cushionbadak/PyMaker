I'm looking for a method to get the day from a certain date. I have files named with the pattern "yyyymmdd.mp3" (e.g. 20190301.mp3). In my country, that day would be a Friday. I would like to obtain the information "Friday" from the string shown above and add it to the name of the file like "friday-20190301.mp3". Is there some way to do this with Python? Thanks in advance!
Pretty similar to @ALFA's answer, but this is a full solution:
Output: Friday-20190301.mp3
Use datetime and strftime:Once you obtained the weekday, you can change the filename using the replace function.
