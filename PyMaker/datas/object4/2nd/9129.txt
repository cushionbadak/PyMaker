docs:


(limit=None, most_recent_first=False)Â¶
Format the traceback as a list of lines with newlines. Use the
 module to retrieve lines from the source code.
If limit is set, format the limit most recent frames if limit
is positive. Otherwise, format the  oldest frames.
If most_recent_first is , the order of the formatted frames
is reversed, returning the most recent frame first instead of last.
Similar to the  function, except that
 does not include newlines.
Example:


Output:
