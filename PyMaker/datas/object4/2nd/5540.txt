docs:


class (_factory=None, *, policy=policy.compat32)Â¶
Works like  except that the input to the
 method must be a string.  This is of limited
utility, since the only way for such a message to be valid is for it to
contain only ASCII text or, if  is
, no binary attachments.

Changed in version 3.3: Added the policy keyword.
