Â¶
A string indicating how the  function behaves for
floats.  If the string has value  then for a finite
float ,  aims to produce a short string with the
property that .  This is the usual behaviour
in Python 3.1 and later.  Otherwise,  has value
 and  behaves in the same way as it did in
versions of Python prior to 3.1.

New in version 3.1.
