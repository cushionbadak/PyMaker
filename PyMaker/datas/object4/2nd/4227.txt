Timer Objects¶
This class represents an action that should be run only after a certain amount
of time has passed — a timer.   is a subclass of 
and as such also functions as an example of creating custom threads.
Timers are started, as with threads, by calling their 
method.  The timer can be stopped (before its action has begun) by calling the
 method.  The interval the timer will wait before
executing its action may not be exactly the same as the interval specified by
the user.
For example:




class (interval, function, args=None, kwargs=None)¶
Create a timer that will run function with arguments args and  keyword
arguments kwargs, after interval seconds have passed.
If args is  (the default) then an empty list will be used.
If kwargs is  (the default) then an empty dict will be used.

Changed in version 3.3: changed from a factory function to a class.



()¶
Stop the timer, and cancel the execution of the timer’s action.  This will
only work if the timer is still in its waiting stage.
