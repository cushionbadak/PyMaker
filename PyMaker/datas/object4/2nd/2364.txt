(file, flag='r', mode=0o666)¶
Open the database file file and return a corresponding object.
If the database file already exists, the  function is used to
determine its type and the appropriate module is used; if it does not exist,
the first module listed above that can be imported is used.
The optional flag argument can be:






Value
Meaning




Open existing database for reading only
(default)


Open existing database for reading and
writing


Open database for reading and writing,
creating it if it doesn’t exist


Always create a new, empty database, open
for reading and writing



The optional mode argument is the Unix mode of the file, used only when the
database has to be created.  It defaults to octal  (and will be
modified by the prevailing umask).
