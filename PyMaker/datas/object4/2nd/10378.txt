(sound, flags)Â¶
Call the underlying  function from the Platform API.  The
sound parameter may be a filename, a system sound alias, audio data as a
bytes-like object, or .  Its
interpretation depends on the value of flags, which can be a bitwise ORed
combination of the constants described below. If the sound parameter is
, any currently playing waveform sound is stopped. If the system
indicates an error,  is raised.
