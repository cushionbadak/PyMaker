FileCookieJar subclasses and co-operation with web browsers¶
The following  subclasses are provided for reading and
writing.


class (filename, delayload=None, policy=None)¶
A  that can load from and save cookies to disk in the
Mozilla  file format (which is also used by the Lynx and Netscape
browsers).

Note
This loses information about RFC 2965 cookies, and also about newer or
non-standard cookie-attributes such as .


Warning
Back up your cookies before saving if you have cookies whose loss / corruption
would be inconvenient (there are some subtleties which may lead to slight
changes in the file over a load / save round-trip).

Also note that cookies saved while Mozilla is running will get clobbered by
Mozilla.



class (filename, delayload=None, policy=None)¶
A  that can load from and save cookies to disk in format
compatible with the libwww-perl library’s  file format.  This is
convenient if you want to store cookies in a human-readable file.
