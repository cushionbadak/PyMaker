(source, filename, mode, flags=0, dont_inherit=False, optimize=-1)¶
Compile the source into a code or AST object.  Code objects can be executed
by  or .  source can either be a normal string, a
byte string, or an AST object.  Refer to the  module documentation
for information on how to work with AST objects.
The filename argument should give the file from which the code was read;
pass some recognizable value if it wasn’t read from a file ( is
commonly used).
The mode argument specifies what kind of code must be compiled; it can be
 if source consists of a sequence of statements,  if it
consists of a single expression, or  if it consists of a single
interactive statement (in the latter case, expression statements that
evaluate to something other than  will be printed).
The optional arguments flags and dont_inherit control which future
statements affect the compilation of source.  If neither
is present (or both are zero) the code is compiled with those future
statements that are in effect in the code that is calling .  If the
flags argument is given and dont_inherit is not (or is zero) then the
future statements specified by the flags argument are used in addition to
those that would be used anyway. If dont_inherit is a non-zero integer then
the flags argument is it – the future statements in effect around the call
to compile are ignored.
Future statements are specified by bits which can be bitwise ORed together to
specify multiple statements.  The bitfield required to specify a given feature
can be found as the  attribute on
the  instance in the  module.
The argument optimize specifies the optimization level of the compiler; the
default value of  selects the optimization level of the interpreter as
given by  options.  Explicit levels are  (no optimization;
 is true),  (asserts are removed,  is false)
or  (docstrings are removed too).
This function raises  if the compiled source is invalid,
and  if the source contains null bytes.
If you want to parse Python code into its AST representation, see
.

Note
When compiling a string with multi-line code in  or
 mode, input must be terminated by at least one newline
character.  This is to facilitate detection of incomplete and complete
statements in the  module.


Warning
It is possible to crash the Python interpreter with a
sufficiently large/complex string when compiling to an AST
object due to stack depth limitations in Python’s AST compiler.


Changed in version 3.2: Allowed use of Windows and Mac newlines.  Also input in  mode
does not have to end in a newline anymore.  Added the optimize parameter.


Changed in version 3.5: Previously,  was raised when null bytes were encountered
in source.
