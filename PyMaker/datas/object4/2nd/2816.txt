docs:


(pathOrFile)Â¶
Read a plist file. pathOrFile may be either a file name or a (readable
and binary) file object. Returns the unpacked root object (which usually
is a dictionary).
This function calls  to do the actual work, see the documentation
of  for an explanation of the keyword arguments.

Deprecated since version 3.4: Use  instead.


Changed in version 3.7: Dict values in the result are now normal dicts.  You no longer can use
attribute access to access items of these dictionaries.
