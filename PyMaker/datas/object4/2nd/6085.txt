Finding interesting elements¶
 has some useful methods that help iterate recursively over all
the sub-tree below it (its children, their children, and so on).  For example,
:


 finds only elements with a tag which are direct
children of the current element.   finds the first child
with a particular tag, and  accesses the element’s text
content.   accesses the element’s attributes:


More sophisticated specification of which elements to look for is possible by
using XPath.
