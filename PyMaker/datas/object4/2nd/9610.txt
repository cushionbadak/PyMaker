(path=None, prefix='', onerror=None)Â¶
Yields  for all modules recursively on
path, or, if path is , all accessible modules.
path should be either  or a list of paths to look for modules in.
prefix is a string to output on the front of every module name on output.
Note that this function must import all packages (not all modules!) on
the given path, in order to access the  attribute to find
submodules.
onerror is a function which gets called with one argument (the name of the
package which was being imported) if any exception occurs while trying to
import a package.  If no onerror function is supplied, s
are caught and ignored, while all other exceptions are propagated,
terminating the search.
Examples:



Note
Only works for a finder which defines an 
method. This interface is non-standard, so the module also provides
implementations for  and
.


Changed in version 3.3: Updated to be based directly on  rather than relying
on the package internal PEP 302 import emulation.
