(args, *, stdin=None, stderr=None, shell=False, cwd=None, encoding=None, errors=None, universal_newlines=None, timeout=None, text=None)¶
Run command with arguments and return its output.
If the return code was non-zero it raises a . The
 object will have the return code in the
 attribute and any output in the
 attribute.
This is equivalent to:


The arguments shown above are merely some common ones.
The full function signature is largely the same as that of  -
most arguments are passed directly through to that interface.
However, explicitly passing  to inherit the parent’s
standard input file handle is not supported.
By default, this function will return the data as encoded bytes. The actual
encoding of the output data may depend on the command being invoked, so the
decoding to text will often need to be handled at the application level.
This behaviour may be overridden by setting text, encoding, errors,
or universal_newlines to  as described in
Frequently Used Arguments and .
To also capture standard error in the result, use
