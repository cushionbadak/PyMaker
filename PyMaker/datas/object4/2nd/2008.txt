class (*pathsegments)¶
A generic class that represents the system’s path flavour (instantiating
it creates either a  or a ):


Each element of pathsegments can be either a string representing a
path segment, an object implementing the  interface
which returns a string, or another path object:


When pathsegments is empty, the current directory is assumed:


When several absolute paths are given, the last is taken as an anchor
(mimicking ’s behaviour):


However, in a Windows path, changing the local root doesn’t discard the
previous drive setting:


Spurious slashes and single dots are collapsed, but double dots ()
are not, since this would change the meaning of a path in the face of
symbolic links:


(a naïve approach would make  equivalent
to , which is wrong if  is a symbolic link
to another directory)
Pure path objects implement the  interface, allowing them
to be used anywhere the interface is accepted.

Changed in version 3.6: Added support for the  interface.
