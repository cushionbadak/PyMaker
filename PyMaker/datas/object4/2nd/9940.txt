(file_or_dir)Â¶
If file_or_dir is a directory and not a symbolic link, then recursively
descend the directory tree named by file_or_dir, checking all 
files along the way.  If file_or_dir is an ordinary Python source file, it
is checked for whitespace related problems.  The diagnostic messages are
written to standard output using the  function.
