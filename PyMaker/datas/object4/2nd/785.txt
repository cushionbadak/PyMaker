docs:


(string[, pos[, endpos]])Â¶
If the whole string matches this regular expression, return a corresponding
match object.  Return  if the string does not
match the pattern; note that this is different from a zero-length match.
The optional pos and endpos parameters have the same meaning as for the
 method.



New in version 3.4.
