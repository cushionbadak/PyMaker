Compound shapes¶
To use compound turtle shapes, which consist of several polygons of different
color, you must use the helper class  explicitly as described
below:

Create an empty Shape object of type “compound”.

Add as many components to this object as desired, using the
 method.
For example:



Now add the Shape to the Screen’s shapelist and use it:





Note
The  class is used internally by the 
method in different ways.  The application programmer has to deal with the
Shape class only when using compound shapes like shown above!
