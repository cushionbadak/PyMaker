Translation of docstrings into different languages¶
There is a utility to create a dictionary the keys of which are the method names
and the values of which are the docstrings of the public methods of the classes
Screen and Turtle.


(filename="turtle_docstringdict")¶




Parameters:filename – a string, used as filename



Create and write docstring-dictionary to a Python script with the given
filename.  This function has to be called explicitly (it is not used by the
turtle graphics classes).  The docstring dictionary will be written to the
Python script .  It is intended to serve as a template
for translation of the docstrings into different languages.

If you (or your students) want to use  with online help in your
native language, you have to translate the docstrings and save the resulting
file as e.g. .
If you have an appropriate entry in your  file this dictionary
will be read in at import time and will replace the original English docstrings.
At the time of this writing there are docstring dictionaries in German and in
Italian.  (Requests please to glingl@aon.at.)
