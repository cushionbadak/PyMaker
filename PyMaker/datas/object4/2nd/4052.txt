Return typesÂ¶
By default functions are assumed to return the C  type.  Other
return types can be specified by setting the  attribute of the
function object.
Here is a more advanced example, it uses the  function, which expects
a string pointer and a char, and returns a pointer to a string:


If you want to avoid the  calls above, you can set the
 attribute, and the second argument will be converted from a
single character Python bytes object into a C char:


You can also use a callable Python object (a function or a class for example) as
the  attribute, if the foreign function returns an integer.  The
callable will be called with the integer the C function returns, and the
result of this call will be used as the result of your function call. This is
useful to check for error return values and automatically raise an exception:


 is a function which will call Windows  api to
get the string representation of an error code, and returns an exception.
 takes an optional error code parameter, if no one is used, it calls
 to retrieve it.
Please note that a much more powerful error checking mechanism is available
through the  attribute; see the reference manual for details.
