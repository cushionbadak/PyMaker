(sigset)Â¶
Suspend execution of the calling thread until the delivery of one of the
signals specified in the signal set sigset.  The function accepts the
signal and removes it from the pending list of signals. If one of the
signals in sigset is already pending for the calling thread, the function
will return immediately with information about that signal. The signal
handler is not called for the delivered signal. The function raises an
 if it is interrupted by a signal that is not in
sigset.
The return value is an object representing the data contained in the
 structure, namely: , ,
, , , ,
.
Availability: Unix (see the man page sigwaitinfo(2) for further
information).

New in version 3.3.


Changed in version 3.5: The function is now retried if interrupted by a signal not in sigset
and the signal handler does not raise an exception (see PEP 475 for
the rationale).
