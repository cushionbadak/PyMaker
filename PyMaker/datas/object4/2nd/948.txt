 — Completion function for GNU readline¶
Source code: Lib/rlcompleter.py

The  module defines a completion function suitable for the
 module by completing valid Python identifiers and keywords.
When this module is imported on a Unix platform with the  module
available, an instance of the  class is automatically created
and its  method is set as the  completer.
Example:


The  module is designed for use with Python’s
interactive mode.  Unless Python is run with the
 option, the module is automatically imported and configured
(see Readline configuration).
On platforms without , the  class defined by
this module can still be used for custom purposes.

Completer Objects¶
Completer objects have the following method:


(text, state)¶
Return the stateth completion for text.
If called for text that doesn’t include a period character (), it will
complete from names currently defined in ,  and
keywords (as defined by the  module).
If called for a dotted name, it will try to evaluate anything without obvious
side-effects (functions will not be evaluated, but it can generate calls to
) up to the last part, and find matches for the rest via the
 function.  Any exception raised during the evaluation of the
expression is caught, silenced and  is returned.
