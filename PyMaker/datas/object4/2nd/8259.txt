User-defined generic typesÂ¶
A user-defined class can be defined as a generic class.


 as a base class defines that the class  takes a
single type parameter  . This also makes  valid as a type within the
class body.
The  base class uses a metaclass that defines
 so that  is valid as a type:


A generic type can have any number of type variables, and type variables may
be constrained:


Each type variable argument to  must be distinct.
This is thus invalid:


You can use multiple inheritance with :


When inheriting from generic classes, some type variables could be fixed:


In this case  has a single parameter, .
Using a generic class without specifying type parameters assumes
 for each position. In the following example,  is
not generic but implicitly inherits from :


User defined generic type aliases are also supported. Examples:


The metaclass used by  is a subclass of .
A generic class can be an ABC by including abstract methods or properties,
and generic classes can also have ABCs as base classes without a metaclass
conflict. Generic metaclasses are not supported. The outcome of parameterizing
generics is cached, and most types in the typing module are hashable and
comparable for equality.
