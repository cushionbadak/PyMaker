 — Determine type of sound file¶
Source code: Lib/sndhdr.py

The  provides utility functions which attempt to determine the type
of sound data which is in a file.  When these functions are able to determine
what type of sound data is stored in a file, they return a
, containing five attributes: (,
, , , ). The value for type
indicates the data type and will be one of the strings , ,
, , , , , , ,
, , or .  The sampling_rate will be either the actual
value or  if unknown or difficult to decode.  Similarly, channels will be
either the number of channels or  if it cannot be determined or if the
value is difficult to decode.  The value for frames will be either the number
of frames or .  The last item in the tuple, bits_per_sample, will either
be the sample size in bits or  for A-LAW or  for u-LAW.


(filename)¶
Determines the type of sound data stored in the file filename using
.  If it succeeds, returns a namedtuple as described above, otherwise
 is returned.

Changed in version 3.5: Result changed from a tuple to a namedtuple.




(filename)¶
Determines the type of sound data stored in a file based on the file  header.
The name of the file is given by filename.  This function returns a namedtuple as
described above on success, or .

Changed in version 3.5: Result changed from a tuple to a namedtuple.
