¶
If the module is a package (either regular or namespace), the module
object’s  attribute must be set.  The value must be
iterable, but may be empty if  has no further significance.
If  is not empty, it must produce strings when iterated
over. More details on the semantics of  are given
below.
Non-package modules should not have a  attribute.
