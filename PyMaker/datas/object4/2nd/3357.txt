()¶
On Unix, return the current processor time as a floating point number expressed
in seconds.  The precision, and in fact the very definition of the meaning of
“processor time”, depends on that of the C function of the same name.
On Windows, this function returns wall-clock seconds elapsed since the first
call to this function, as a floating point number, based on the Win32 function
. The resolution is typically better than one
microsecond.

Deprecated since version 3.3, will be removed in version 3.8: The behaviour of this function depends on the platform: use
 or  instead, depending on your
requirements, to have a well defined behaviour.
