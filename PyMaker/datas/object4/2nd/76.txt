3.3.3.4. Preparing the class namespaceÂ¶
Once the appropriate metaclass has been identified, then the class namespace
is prepared. If the metaclass has a  attribute, it is called
as  (where the
additional keyword arguments, if any, come from the class definition).
If the metaclass has no  attribute, then the class namespace
is initialised as an empty ordered mapping.
