docs:


(fd[, eventmask])¶
Register a file descriptor with the polling object.  Future calls to the
 method will then check whether the file descriptor has any
pending I/O events.  fd can be either an integer, or an object with a
 method that returns an integer.  File objects
implement , so they can also be used as the argument.
eventmask is an optional bitmask describing the type of events you want to
check for, and can be a combination of the constants ,
, and , described in the table below.  If not
specified, the default value used will check for all 3 types of events.






Constant
Meaning




There is data to read


There is urgent data to read


Ready for output: writing will not block


Error condition of some sort


Hung up


Stream socket peer closed connection, or
shut down writing half of connection


Invalid request: descriptor not open



Registering a file descriptor that’s already registered is not an error, and has
the same effect as registering the descriptor exactly once.
