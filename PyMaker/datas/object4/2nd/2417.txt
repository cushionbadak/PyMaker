¶
You can change this attribute to a callable that accepts the cursor and the
original row as a tuple and will return the real result row.  This way, you can
implement more advanced ways of returning results, such  as returning an object
that can also access columns by name.
Example:


If returning a tuple doesn’t suffice and you want name-based access to
columns, you should consider setting  to the
highly-optimized  type.  provides both
index-based and case-insensitive name-based access to columns with almost no
memory overhead. It will probably be better than your own custom
dictionary-based approach or even a db_row based solution.
