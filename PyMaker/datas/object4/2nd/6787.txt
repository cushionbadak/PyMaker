class (host, port=None, [timeout, ]source_address=None, blocksize=8192)¶
An  instance represents one transaction with an HTTP
server.  It should be instantiated passing it a host and optional port
number.  If no port number is passed, the port is extracted from the host
string if it has the form , else the default HTTP port (80) is
used.  If the optional timeout parameter is given, blocking
operations (like connection attempts) will timeout after that many seconds
(if it is not given, the global default timeout setting is used).
The optional source_address parameter may be a tuple of a (host, port)
to use as the source address the HTTP connection is made from.
The optional blocksize parameter sets the buffer size in bytes for
sending a file-like message body.
For example, the following calls all create instances that connect to the server
at the same host and port:



Changed in version 3.2: source_address was added.


Changed in version 3.4: The  strict parameter was removed. HTTP 0.9-style “Simple Responses” are
not longer supported.


Changed in version 3.7: blocksize parameter was added.
