¶
Specify a list of commands for breakpoint number bpnumber.  The commands
themselves appear on the following lines.  Type a line containing just
 to terminate the commands. An example:


To remove all commands from a breakpoint, type  and follow it
immediately with ; that is, give no commands.
With no bpnumber argument,  refers to the last breakpoint set.
You can use breakpoint commands to start your program up again.  Simply use
the  command, or ,
or any other command that resumes execution.
Specifying any command resuming execution
(currently , , ,
, ,  and their abbreviations)
terminates the command list (as if
that command was immediately followed by end). This is because any time you
resume execution (even with a simple next or step), you may encounter another
breakpoint—which could have its own command list, leading to ambiguities about
which list to execute.
If you use the ‘silent’ command in the command list, the usual message about
stopping at a breakpoint is not printed.  This may be desirable for breakpoints
that are to print a specific message and then continue.  If none of the other
commands print anything, you see no sign that the breakpoint was reached.
