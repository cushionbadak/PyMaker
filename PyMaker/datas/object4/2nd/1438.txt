class (indent=1, width=80, depth=None, stream=None, *, compact=False)¶
Construct a  instance.  This constructor understands
several keyword parameters.  An output stream may be set using the stream
keyword; the only method used on the stream object is the file protocol’s
 method.  If not specified, the  adopts
.  The
amount of indentation added for each recursive level is specified by indent;
the default is one.  Other values can cause output to look a little odd, but can
make nesting easier to spot.  The number of levels which may be printed is
controlled by depth; if the data structure being printed is too deep, the next
contained level is replaced by .  By default, there is no constraint on
the depth of the objects being formatted.  The desired output width is
constrained using the width parameter; the default is 80 characters.  If a
structure cannot be formatted within the constrained width, a best effort will
be made.  If compact is false (the default) each item of a long sequence
will be formatted on a separate line.  If compact is true, as many items
as will fit within the width will be formatted on each output line.

Changed in version 3.4: Added the compact parameter.
