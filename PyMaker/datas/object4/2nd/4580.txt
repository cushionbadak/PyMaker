Context Variables¶


class (name[, *, default])¶
This class is used to declare a new Context Variable, e.g.:


The required name parameter is used for introspection and debug
purposes.
The optional keyword-only default parameter is returned by
 when no value for the variable is found
in the current context.
Important: Context Variables should be created at the top module
level and never in closures.   objects hold strong
references to context variables which prevents context variables
from being properly garbage collected.


¶
The name of the variable.  This is a read-only property.

New in version 3.7.1.




([default])¶
Return a value for the context variable for the current context.
If there is no value for the variable in the current context,
the method will:

return the value of the default argument of the method,
if provided; or
return the default value for the context variable,
if it was created with one; or
raise a .




(value)¶
Call to set a new value for the context variable in the current
context.
The required value argument is the new value for the context
variable.
Returns a  object that can be used
to restore the variable to its previous value via the
 method.



(token)¶
Reset the context variable to the value it had before the
 that created the token was used.
For example:






class ¶
Token objects are returned by the  method.
They can be passed to the  method to revert
the value of the variable to what it was before the corresponding
set.


¶
A read-only property.  Points to the  object
that created the token.



¶
A read-only property.  Set to the value the variable had before
the  method call that created the token.
It points to  is the variable was not set
before the call.
