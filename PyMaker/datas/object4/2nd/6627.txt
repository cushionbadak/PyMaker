class (proxies=None)¶
Cause requests to go through a proxy. If proxies is given, it must be a
dictionary mapping protocol names to URLs of proxies. The default is to read
the list of proxies from the environment variables
.  If no proxy environment variables are set, then
in a Windows environment proxy settings are obtained from the registry’s
Internet Settings section, and in a Mac OS X environment proxy information
is retrieved from the OS X System Configuration Framework.
To disable autodetected proxy pass an empty dictionary.
The  environment variable can be used to specify hosts
which shouldn’t be reached via proxy; if set, it should be a comma-separated
list of hostname suffixes, optionally with  appended, for example
.


Note
 will be ignored if a variable  is set;
see the documentation on .
