5.3.3. Import hooksÂ¶
The import machinery is designed to be extensible; the primary mechanism for
this are the import hooks.  There are two types of import hooks: meta
hooks and import path hooks.
Meta hooks are called at the start of import processing, before any other
import processing has occurred, other than  cache look up.
This allows meta hooks to override  processing, frozen
modules, or even built-in modules.  Meta hooks are registered by adding new
finder objects to , as described below.
Import path hooks are called as part of  (or
) processing, at the point where their associated path
item is encountered.  Import path hooks are registered by adding new callables
to  as described below.
