(message, category, filename, lineno, line=None)Â¶
Format a warning the standard way.  This returns a string which may contain
embedded newlines and ends in a newline.  line is a line of source code to
be included in the warning message; if line is not supplied,
 will try to read the line specified by filename and
lineno.
