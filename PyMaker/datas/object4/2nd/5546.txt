class (_class=None, *, policy=policy.compat32)¶

Changed in version 3.3: Removed the strict argument.  Added the policy keyword.


Changed in version 3.6: _class defaults to the policy .



(fp, headersonly=False)¶

instead of a file-like object.  Calling this method on a string is
equivalent to wrapping text in a  instance first
and calling .
Optional headersonly is as with the  method.
