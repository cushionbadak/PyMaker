docs:


¶
A special constant that is assumed to be  by 3rd party static
type checkers. It is  at runtime. Usage:


Note that the first type annotation must be enclosed in quotes, making it a
“forward reference”, to hide the  reference from the
interpreter runtime.  Type annotations for local variables are not
evaluated, so the second annotation does not need to be enclosed in quotes.

New in version 3.5.2.
