class (attrs)Â¶
This is an implementation of the  interface (see section
The Attributes Interface).  This is a dictionary-like object which
represents the element attributes in a  call. In addition
to the most useful dictionary operations, it supports a number of other
methods as described by the interface. Objects of this class should be
instantiated by readers; attrs must be a dictionary-like object containing
a mapping from attribute names to attribute values.
