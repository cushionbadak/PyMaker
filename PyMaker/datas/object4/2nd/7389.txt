Â¶
The string representation in dotted decimal notation. Leading zeroes
are never included in the representation.
As IPv4 does not define a shorthand notation for addresses with octets
set to zero, these two attributes are always the same as 
for IPv4 addresses. Exposing these attributes makes it easier to
write display code that can handle both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
