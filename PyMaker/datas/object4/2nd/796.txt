(template)Â¶
Return the string obtained by doing backslash substitution on the template
string template, as done by the  method.
Escapes such as  are converted to the appropriate characters,
and numeric backreferences (, ) and named backreferences
(, ) are replaced by the contents of the
corresponding group.

Changed in version 3.5: Unmatched groups are replaced with an empty string.
