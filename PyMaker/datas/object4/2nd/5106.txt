docs:


(buffer[, nbytes[, flags]])¶
Receive data from the socket, writing it into buffer instead of creating a
new bytestring.  The return value is a pair  where nbytes is
the number of bytes received and address is the address of the socket sending
the data.  See the Unix manual page recv(2) for the meaning of the
optional argument flags; it defaults to zero.  (The format of address
depends on the address family — see above.)
