 — Scrolled Text Widget¶
Source code: Lib/tkinter/scrolledtext.py

The  module provides a class of the same name which
implements a basic text widget which has a vertical scroll bar configured to do
the “right thing.”  Using the  class is a lot easier than
setting up a text widget and scroll bar directly.  The constructor is the same
as that of the  class.
The text widget and scrollbar are packed together in a , and the
methods of the  and  geometry managers are acquired
from the  object.  This allows the  widget to
be used directly to achieve most normal geometry management behavior.
Should more specific control be necessary, the following attributes are
available:


¶
The frame which surrounds the text and scroll bar widgets.



¶
The scroll bar widget.
