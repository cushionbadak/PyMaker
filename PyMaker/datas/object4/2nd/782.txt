Regular Expression Objects¶
Compiled regular expression objects support the following methods and
attributes:


(string[, pos[, endpos]])¶
Scan through string looking for the first location where this regular
expression produces a match, and return a corresponding match object.  Return  if no position in the string matches the
pattern; note that this is different from finding a zero-length match at some
point in the string.
The optional second parameter pos gives an index in the string where the
search is to start; it defaults to .  This is not completely equivalent to
slicing the string; the  pattern character matches at the real beginning
of the string and at positions just after a newline, but not necessarily at the
index where the search is to start.
The optional parameter endpos limits how far the string will be searched; it
will be as if the string is endpos characters long, so only the characters
from pos to  will be searched for a match.  If endpos is less
than pos, no match will be found; otherwise, if rx is a compiled regular
expression object,  is equivalent to
.





(string[, pos[, endpos]])¶
If zero or more characters at the beginning of string match this regular
expression, return a corresponding match object.
Return  if the string does not match the pattern; note that this is
different from a zero-length match.
The optional pos and endpos parameters have the same meaning as for the
 method.


If you want to locate a match anywhere in string, use
 instead (see also search() vs. match()).



(string[, pos[, endpos]])¶
If the whole string matches this regular expression, return a corresponding
match object.  Return  if the string does not
match the pattern; note that this is different from a zero-length match.
The optional pos and endpos parameters have the same meaning as for the
 method.



New in version 3.4.




(string, maxsplit=0)¶
Identical to the  function, using the compiled pattern.



(string[, pos[, endpos]])¶
Similar to the  function, using the compiled pattern, but
also accepts optional pos and endpos parameters that limit the search
region like for .



(string[, pos[, endpos]])¶
Similar to the  function, using the compiled pattern, but
also accepts optional pos and endpos parameters that limit the search
region like for .



(repl, string, count=0)¶
Identical to the  function, using the compiled pattern.



(repl, string, count=0)¶
Identical to the  function, using the compiled pattern.



¶
The regex matching flags.  This is a combination of the flags given to
, any  inline flags in the pattern, and implicit
flags such as  if the pattern is a Unicode string.



¶
The number of capturing groups in the pattern.



¶
A dictionary mapping any symbolic group names defined by  to group
numbers.  The dictionary is empty if no symbolic groups were used in the
pattern.



¶
The pattern string from which the pattern object was compiled.


Changed in version 3.7: Added support of  and .  Compiled
regular expression objects are considered atomic.
