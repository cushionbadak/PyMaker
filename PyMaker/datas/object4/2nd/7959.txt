How to configure Screen and Turtles¶
The built-in default configuration mimics the appearance and behaviour of the
old turtle module in order to retain best possible compatibility with it.
If you want to use a different configuration which better reflects the features
of this module or which better fits to your needs, e.g. for use in a classroom,
you can prepare a configuration file  which will be read at import
time and modify the configuration according to its settings.
The built in configuration would correspond to the following turtle.cfg:


Short explanation of selected entries:

The first four lines correspond to the arguments of the 
method.
Line 5 and 6 correspond to the arguments of the method
.
shape can be any of the built-in shapes, e.g: arrow, turtle, etc.  For more
info try .
If you want to use no fillcolor (i.e. make the turtle transparent), you have
to write  (but all nonempty strings must not have quotes in
the cfg-file).
If you want to reflect the turtle its state, you have to use .
If you set e.g.  the docstringdict
 will be loaded at import time (if
present on the import path, e.g. in the same directory as .
The entries exampleturtle and examplescreen define the names of these
objects as they occur in the docstrings.  The transformation of
method-docstrings to function-docstrings will delete these names from the
docstrings.
using_IDLE: Set this to  if you regularly work with IDLE and its -n
switch (“no subprocess”).  This will prevent  to enter the
mainloop.

There can be a  file in the directory where  is
stored and an additional one in the current working directory.  The latter will
override the settings of the first one.
The  directory contains a  file.  You can
study it as an example and see its effects when running the demos (preferably
not from within the demo-viewer).
