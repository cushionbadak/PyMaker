docs:

How many bytes should tokens use?Â¶
To be secure against
brute-force attacks,
tokens need to have sufficient randomness.  Unfortunately, what is
considered sufficient will necessarily increase as computers get more
powerful and able to make more guesses in a shorter period.  As of 2015,
it is believed that 32 bytes (256 bits) of randomness is sufficient for
the typical use-case expected for the  module.
For those who want to manage their own token length, you can explicitly
specify how much randomness is used for tokens by giving an 
argument to the various  functions.  That argument is taken
as the number of bytes of randomness to use.
Otherwise, if no argument is provided, or if the argument is ,
the  functions will use a reasonable default instead.

Note
That default is subject to change at any time, including during
maintenance releases.
