docs:


(failobj=None)Â¶
Return the  parameter of the Content-Type header,
coerced to lower case.  If there is no Content-Type header, or if
that header has no  parameter, failobj is returned.
Note that this method differs from  which returns the
 instance for the default encoding of the message body.
