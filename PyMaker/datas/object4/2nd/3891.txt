docs:


(aliased=0, terse=0)Â¶
Returns a single string identifying the underlying platform with as much useful
information as possible.
The output is intended to be human readable rather than machine parseable. It
may look different on different platforms and this is intended.
If aliased is true, the function will use aliases for various platforms that
report system names which differ from their common names, for example SunOS will
be reported as Solaris.  The  function is used to implement
this.
Setting terse to true causes the function to return only the absolute minimum
information needed to identify the platform.
