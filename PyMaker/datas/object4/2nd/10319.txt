docs:


(key)¶
Writes all the attributes of a key to the registry.
key is an already open key, or one of the predefined
HKEY_* constants.
It is not necessary to call  to change a key. Registry changes are
flushed to disk by the registry using its lazy flusher.  Registry changes are
also flushed to disk at system shutdown.  Unlike , the
 method returns only when all the data has been written to the
registry. An application should only call  if it requires
absolute certainty that registry changes are on disk.

Note
If you don’t know whether a  call is required, it probably
isn’t.
