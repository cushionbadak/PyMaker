StreamRecoder Objects¶
The  translates data from one encoding to another,
which is sometimes useful when dealing with different encoding environments.
The design is such that one can use the factory functions returned by the
 function to construct the instance.


class (stream, encode, decode, Reader, Writer, errors='strict')¶
Creates a  instance which implements a two-way conversion:
encode and decode work on the frontend — the data visible to
code calling  and , while Reader and Writer
work on the backend — the data in stream.
You can use these objects to do transparent transcodings from e.g. Latin-1
to UTF-8 and back.
The stream argument must be a file-like object.
The encode and decode arguments must
adhere to the  interface. Reader and
Writer must be factory functions or classes providing objects of the
 and  interface respectively.
Error handling is done in the same way as defined for the stream readers and
writers.

 instances define the combined interfaces of
 and  classes. They inherit all other
methods and attributes from the underlying stream.
