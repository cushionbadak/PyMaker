Standard Interpreter Types¶
This module provides names for many of the types that are required to
implement a Python interpreter. It deliberately avoids including some of
the types that arise only incidentally during processing such as the
 type.
Typical use of these names is for  or
 checks.
Standard names are defined for the following types:


¶

¶
The type of user-defined functions and functions created by
  expressions.



¶
The type of generator-iterator objects, created by
generator functions.



¶
The type of coroutine objects, created by
 functions.

New in version 3.5.




¶
The type of asynchronous generator-iterator objects, created by
asynchronous generator functions.

New in version 3.6.




¶
The type for code objects such as returned by .



¶
The type of methods of user-defined class instances.



¶

¶
The type of built-in functions like  or , and
methods of built-in classes.  (Here, the term “built-in” means “written in
C”.)



¶
The type of methods of some built-in data types and base classes such as
 or .

New in version 3.7.




¶
The type of bound methods of some built-in data types and base classes.
For example it is the type of .

New in version 3.7.




¶
The type of methods of some built-in data types such as .

New in version 3.7.




¶
The type of unbound class methods of some built-in data types such as
.

New in version 3.7.




class (name, doc=None)¶
The type of modules. Constructor takes the name of the
module to be created and optionally its docstring.

Note
Use  to create a new module if you
wish to set the various import-controlled attributes.



¶
The docstring of the module. Defaults to .



¶
The loader which loaded the module. Defaults to .

Changed in version 3.4: Defaults to . Previously the attribute was optional.




¶
The name of the module.



¶
Which package a module belongs to. If the module is top-level
(i.e. not a part of any specific package) then the attribute should be set
to , else it should be set to the name of the package (which can be
 if the module is a package itself). Defaults to .

Changed in version 3.4: Defaults to . Previously the attribute was optional.





class (tb_next, tb_frame, tb_lasti, tb_lineno)¶
The type of traceback objects such as found in .
See the language reference for details of the
available attributes and operations, and guidance on creating tracebacks
dynamically.



¶
The type of frame objects such as found in  if  is a
traceback object.
See the language reference for details of the
available attributes and operations.



¶
The type of objects defined in extension modules with , such
as  or .  This type is used as
descriptor for object attributes; it has the same purpose as the
 type, but for classes defined in extension modules.



¶
The type of objects defined in extension modules with , such
as .  This type is used as descriptor for simple C
data members which use standard conversion functions; it has the same purpose
as the  type, but for classes defined in extension modules.

CPython implementation detail: In other implementations of Python, this type may be identical to
.




class (mapping)¶
Read-only proxy of a mapping. It provides a dynamic view on the mapping’s
entries, which means that when the mapping changes, the view reflects these
changes.

New in version 3.3.




Return  if the underlying mapping has a key key, else
.




Return the item of the underlying mapping with key key.  Raises a
 if key is not in the underlying mapping.




Return an iterator over the keys of the underlying mapping.  This is a
shortcut for .




Return the number of items in the underlying mapping.



()¶
Return a shallow copy of the underlying mapping.



(key[, default])¶
Return the value for key if key is in the underlying mapping, else
default.  If default is not given, it defaults to , so that
this method never raises a .



()¶
Return a new view of the underlying mapping’s items (
pairs).



()¶
Return a new view of the underlying mapping’s keys.



()¶
Return a new view of the underlying mapping’s values.
