docs:


(key, msg, digest)Â¶
Return digest of msg for given secret key and digest. The
function is equivalent to , but
uses an optimized C or inline implementation, which is faster for messages
that fit into memory. The parameters key, msg, and digest have
the same meaning as in .
CPython implementation detail, the optimized C implementation is only used
when digest is a string and name of a digest algorithm, which is
supported by OpenSSL.

New in version 3.7.
