docs:


class (request, client_address, server)¶
Create an HTTP handler for the given request (i.e. a socket), client_address
(a  tuple), and server ( instance).
You do not need to create instances of this class directly; they are
automatically created as needed by  objects.  You can,
however, subclass this class and supply it as a handler_class to the
 function.  Some possibly relevant methods for overriding in
subclasses:


()¶
Returns a dictionary containing the WSGI environment for a request.  The default
implementation copies the contents of the  object’s
 dictionary attribute and then adds various headers derived
from the HTTP request.  Each call to this method should return a new dictionary
containing all of the relevant CGI environment variables as specified in
PEP 3333.



()¶
Return the object that should be used as the  stream. The default
implementation just returns .



()¶
Process the HTTP request.  The default implementation creates a handler instance
using a  class to implement the actual WSGI application
interface.
