Power and logarithmic functions¶


(x)¶
Return e raised to the power x, where e is the base of natural
logarithms.



(x[, base])¶
Returns the logarithm of x to the given base. If the base is not
specified, returns the natural logarithm of x. There is one branch cut, from 0
along the negative real axis to -∞, continuous from above.



(x)¶
Return the base-10 logarithm of x. This has the same branch cut as
.



(x)¶
Return the square root of x. This has the same branch cut as .
