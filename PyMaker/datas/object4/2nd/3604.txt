docs:


(default_name)¶
Modify the filename of a log file when rotating.
This is provided so that a custom filename can be provided.
The default implementation calls the ‘namer’ attribute of the handler,
if it’s callable, passing the default name to it. If the attribute isn’t
callable (the default is ), the name is returned unchanged.




Parameters:default_name – The default name for the log file.




New in version 3.3.
