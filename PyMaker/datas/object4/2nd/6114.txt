docs:


¶
A dictionary containing the element’s attributes.  Note that while the
attrib value is always a real mutable Python dictionary, an ElementTree
implementation may choose to use another internal representation, and
create the dictionary only if someone asks for it.  To take advantage of
such implementations, use the dictionary methods below whenever possible.
