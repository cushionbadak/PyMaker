 — WSGI conformance checker¶
When creating new WSGI application objects, frameworks, servers, or middleware,
it can be useful to validate the new code’s conformance using
.  This module provides a function that creates WSGI
application objects that validate communications between a WSGI server or
gateway and a WSGI application object, to check both sides for protocol
conformance.
Note that this utility does not guarantee complete PEP 3333 compliance; an
absence of errors from this module does not necessarily mean that errors do not
exist.  However, if this module does produce an error, then it is virtually
certain that either the server or application is not 100% compliant.
This module is based on the  module from Ian Bicking’s “Python
Paste” library.


(application)¶
Wrap application and return a new WSGI application object.  The returned
application will forward all requests to the original application, and will
check that both the application and the server invoking it are conforming to
the WSGI specification and to RFC 2616.
Any detected nonconformance results in an  being raised;
note, however, that how these errors are handled is server-dependent.  For
example,  and other servers based on
 (that don’t override the error handling methods to do
something else) will simply output a message that an error has occurred, and
dump the traceback to  or some other error stream.
This wrapper may also generate output using the  module to
indicate behaviors that are questionable but which may not actually be
prohibited by PEP 3333.  Unless they are suppressed using Python command-line
options or the  API, any such warnings will be written to
 (not , unless they happen to be the same
object).
