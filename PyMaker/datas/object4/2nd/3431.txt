choicesÂ¶
Some command-line arguments should be selected from a restricted set of values.
These can be handled by passing a container object as the choices keyword
argument to .  When the command line is
parsed, argument values will be checked, and an error message will be displayed
if the argument was not one of the acceptable values:


Note that inclusion in the choices container is checked after any type
conversions have been performed, so the type of the objects in the choices
container should match the type specified:


Any object that supports the  operator can be passed as the choices
value, so  objects,  objects, custom containers,
etc. are all supported.
