docs:


(object)¶
Return true if the object is a method descriptor, but not if
, ,  or 
are true.
This, for example, is true of .  An object passing this test
has a  method but not a 
method, but beyond that the set of attributes varies.  A
 attribute is usually
sensible, and  often is.
Methods implemented via descriptors that also pass one of the other tests
return false from the  test, simply because the
other tests promise more – you can, e.g., count on having the
 attribute (etc) when an object passes .
