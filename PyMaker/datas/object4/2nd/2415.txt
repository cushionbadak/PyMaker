docs:


(enabled)Â¶
This routine allows/disallows the SQLite engine to load SQLite extensions
from shared libraries.  SQLite extensions can define new functions,
aggregates or whole new virtual table implementations.  One well-known
extension is the fulltext-search extension distributed with SQLite.
Loadable extensions are disabled by default. See [1].

New in version 3.2.
