()¶
Returns a dictionary containing the WSGI environment for a request.  The default
implementation copies the contents of the  object’s
 dictionary attribute and then adds various headers derived
from the HTTP request.  Each call to this method should return a new dictionary
containing all of the relevant CGI environment variables as specified in
PEP 3333.
