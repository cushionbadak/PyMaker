Post-init processingÂ¶
The generated  code will call a method named

However, if any  fields are defined, they will also be
passed to  in the order they were defined in the
class.  If no  method is generated, then
 will not automatically be called.
Among other uses, this allows for initializing field values that
depend on one or more other fields.  For example:


See the section below on init-only variables for ways to pass
parameters to .  Also see the warning about how
 handles  fields.
