Hyperbolic functions¶


(x)¶
Return the inverse hyperbolic cosine of x. There is one branch cut,
extending left from 1 along the real axis to -∞, continuous from above.



(x)¶
Return the inverse hyperbolic sine of x. There are two branch cuts:
One extends from  along the imaginary axis to ,
continuous from the right.  The other extends from  along
the imaginary axis to , continuous from the left.



(x)¶
Return the inverse hyperbolic tangent of x. There are two branch cuts: One
extends from  along the real axis to , continuous from below. The
other extends from  along the real axis to , continuous from
above.
