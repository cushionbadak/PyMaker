(cls[, ...])¶
Called to create a new instance of class cls.   is a static
method (special-cased so you need not declare it as such) that takes the class
of which an instance was requested as its first argument.  The remaining
arguments are those passed to the object constructor expression (the call to the
class).  The return value of  should be the new object instance
(usually an instance of cls).
Typical implementations create a new instance of the class by invoking the
superclass’s  method using 
with appropriate arguments and then modifying the newly-created instance
as necessary before returning it.
If  returns an instance of cls, then the new instance’s
 method will be invoked like , where
self is the new instance and the remaining arguments are the same as were
passed to .
If  does not return an instance of cls, then the new instance’s
 method will not be invoked.
 is intended mainly to allow subclasses of immutable types (like
int, str, or tuple) to customize instance creation.  It is also commonly
overridden in custom metaclasses in order to customize class creation.
