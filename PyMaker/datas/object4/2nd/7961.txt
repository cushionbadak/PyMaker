Changes since Python 2.6Â¶

The methods ,  and
 have been eliminated.
Methods with these names and functionality are now available only
as methods of . The functions derived from these remain
available. (In fact already in Python 2.6 these methods were merely
duplications of the corresponding
/-methods.)
The method  has been eliminated.
The behaviour of  and 
have changed slightly: now  every filling-process must be completed with an
 call.
A method  has been added. It returns a boolean
value:  if a filling process is under way,  otherwise.
This behaviour corresponds to a  call without arguments in
Python 2.6.
