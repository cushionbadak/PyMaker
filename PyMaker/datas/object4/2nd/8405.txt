(module, name, pm=False)¶
Debug the doctests for an object.
The module and name arguments are the same as for function
 above.  The synthesized Python script for the named object’s
docstring is written to a temporary file, and then that file is run under the
control of the Python debugger, .
A shallow copy of  is used for both local and global
execution context.
Optional argument pm controls whether post-mortem debugging is used.  If pm
has a true value, the script file is run directly, and the debugger gets
involved only if the script terminates via raising an unhandled exception.  If
it does, then post-mortem debugging is invoked, via ,
passing the traceback object from the unhandled exception.  If pm is not
specified, or is false, the script is run under the debugger from the start, via
passing an appropriate  call to .
