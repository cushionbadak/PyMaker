(package, resource)Â¶
Get a resource from a package.
This is a wrapper for the loader
 API.  The
package argument should be the name of a package, in standard module format
().  The resource argument should be in the form of a relative
filename, using  as the path separator.  The parent directory name
 is not allowed, and nor is a rooted name (starting with a ).
The function returns a binary string that is the contents of the specified
resource.
For packages located in the filesystem, which have already been imported,
this is the rough equivalent of:


If the package cannot be located or loaded, or it uses a loader
which does not support ,
then  is returned.  In particular, the loader for
namespace packages does not support
.
