class (name, loader, *, origin=None, loader_state=None, is_package=None)¶
A specification for a module’s import-system-related state.  This is
typically exposed as the module’s  attribute.  In the
descriptions below, the names in parentheses give the corresponding
attribute available directly on the module object.
E.g. .  Note however that
while the values are usually equivalent, they can differ since there is
no synchronization between the two objects.  Thus it is possible to update
the module’s  at runtime, and this will not be automatically
reflected in .

New in version 3.4.
