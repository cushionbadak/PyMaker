docs:


(iterator, encoding, errors='strict', **kwargs)Â¶
Uses an incremental decoder to iteratively decode the input provided by
iterator. This function is a generator.
The errors argument (as well as any
other keyword argument) is passed through to the incremental decoder.
This function requires that the codec accept  objects
to decode. Therefore it does not support text-to-text encoders such as
, although  may be used equivalently with
.
