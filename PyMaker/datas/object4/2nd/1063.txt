 — UTF-8 codec with BOM signature¶
This module implements a variant of the UTF-8 codec: On encoding a UTF-8 encoded
BOM will be prepended to the UTF-8 encoded bytes. For the stateful encoder this
is only done once (on the first write to the byte stream).  For decoding an
optional UTF-8 encoded BOM at the start of the data will be skipped.
