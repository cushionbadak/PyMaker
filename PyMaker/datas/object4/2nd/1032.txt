docs:


(object[, final])¶
Decodes object (taking the current state of the decoder into account)
and returns the resulting decoded object. If this is the last call to
 final must be true (the default is false). If final is
true the decoder must decode the input completely and must flush all
buffers. If this isn’t possible (e.g. because of incomplete byte sequences
at the end of the input) it must initiate error handling just like in the
stateless case (which might raise an exception).
