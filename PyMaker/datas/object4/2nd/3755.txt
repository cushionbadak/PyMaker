Window Objects¶
Window objects, as returned by  and  above, have
the following methods and attributes:


(ch[, attr])¶

(y, x, ch[, attr])
Paint character ch at  with attributes attr, overwriting any
character previously painter at that location.  By default, the character
position and attributes are the current settings for the window object.

Note
Writing outside the window, subwindow, or pad raises a .
Attempting to write to the lower right corner of a window, subwindow,
or pad will cause an exception to be raised after the character is printed.




(str, n[, attr])¶

(y, x, str, n[, attr])
Paint at most n characters of the character string str at
 with attributes
attr, overwriting anything previously on the display.



(str[, attr])¶

(y, x, str[, attr])
Paint the character string str at  with attributes
attr, overwriting anything previously on the display.

Note
Writing outside the window, subwindow, or pad raises .
Attempting to write to the lower right corner of a window, subwindow,
or pad will cause an exception to be raised after the string is printed.




(attr)¶
Remove attribute attr from the “background” set applied to all writes to the
current window.



(attr)¶
Add attribute attr from the “background” set applied to all writes to the
current window.



(attr)¶
Set the “background” set of attributes to attr.  This set is initially
 (no attributes).



(ch[, attr])¶
Set the background property of the window to the character ch, with
attributes attr.  The change is then applied to every character position in
that window:

The attribute of every character in the window  is changed to the new
background attribute.
Wherever  the  former background character appears, it is changed to the new
background character.




(ch[, attr])¶
Set the window’s background.  A window’s background consists of a character and
any combination of attributes.  The attribute part of the background is combined
(OR’ed) with all non-blank characters that are written into the window.  Both
the character and attribute parts of the background are combined with the blank
characters.  The background becomes a property of the character and moves with
the character through any scrolling and insert/delete line/character operations.



([ls[, rs[, ts[, bs[, tl[, tr[, bl[, br]]]]]]]])¶
Draw a border around the edges of the window. Each parameter specifies  the
character to use for a specific part of the border; see the table below for more
details.

Note
A  value for any parameter will cause the default character to be used for
that parameter.  Keyword parameters can not be used.  The defaults are listed
in this table:








Parameter
Description
Default value



ls
Left side


rs
Right side


ts
Top


bs
Bottom


tl
Upper-left corner


tr
Upper-right corner


bl
Bottom-left corner


br
Bottom-right corner







([vertch, horch])¶
Similar to , but both ls and rs are vertch and both ts and
bs are horch.  The default corner characters are always used by this function.



(attr)¶

(num, attr)

(y, x, attr)

(y, x, num, attr)
Set the attributes of num characters at the current cursor position, or at
position  if supplied. If num is not given or is ,
the attribute will be set on all the characters to the end of the line.  This
function moves cursor to position  if supplied. The changed line
will be touched using the  method so that the contents will
be redisplayed by the next window refresh.



()¶
Like , but also cause the whole window to be repainted upon next
call to .



(flag)¶
If flag is , the next call to  will clear the window
completely.



()¶
Erase from cursor to the end of the window: all lines below the cursor are
deleted, and then the equivalent of  is performed.



()¶
Erase from cursor to the end of the line.



()¶
Update the current cursor position of all the ancestors of the window to
reflect the current cursor position of the window.



([y, x])¶
Delete any character at .



()¶
Delete the line under the cursor. All following lines are moved up by one line.



(begin_y, begin_x)¶

(nlines, ncols, begin_y, begin_x)
An abbreviation for “derive window”,  is the same as calling
, except that begin_y and begin_x are relative to the origin
of the window, rather than relative to the entire screen.  Return a window
object for the derived window.



(ch[, attr])¶
Add character ch with attribute attr, and immediately  call 
on the window.



(y, x)¶
Test whether the given pair of screen-relative character-cell coordinates are
enclosed by the given window, returning  or .  It is useful for
determining what subset of the screen windows enclose the location of a mouse
event.



¶
Encoding used to encode method arguments (Unicode strings and characters).
The encoding attribute is inherited from the parent window when a subwindow
is created, for example with . By default, the locale
encoding is used (see ).

New in version 3.3.




()¶
Clear the window.



()¶
Return a tuple  of co-ordinates of upper-left corner.



()¶
Return the given window’s current background character/attribute pair.



([y, x])¶
Get a character. Note that the integer returned does not have to be in ASCII
range: function keys, keypad keys and so on are represented by numbers higher
than 255.  In no-delay mode, return  if there is no input, otherwise
wait until a key is pressed.



([y, x])¶
Get a wide character. Return a character for most keys, or an integer for
function keys, keypad keys, and other special keys.
In no-delay mode, raise an exception if there is no input.

New in version 3.3.




([y, x])¶
Get a character, returning a string instead of an integer, as 
does. Function keys, keypad keys and other special keys return a multibyte
string containing the key name.  In no-delay mode, raise an exception if
there is no input.



()¶
Return a tuple  of the height and width of the window.



()¶
Return the beginning coordinates of this window relative to its parent window
as a tuple .  Return  if this window has no
parent.



()¶

(n)

(y, x)

(y, x, n)
Read a bytes object from the user, with primitive line editing capacity.



()¶
Return a tuple  of current cursor position  relative to the window’s
upper-left corner.



(ch, n)¶

(y, x, ch, n)
Display a horizontal line starting at  with length n consisting of
the character ch.



(flag)¶
If flag is , curses no longer considers using the hardware insert/delete
character feature of the terminal; if flag is , use of character insertion
and deletion is enabled.  When curses is first initialized, use of character
insert/delete is enabled by default.



(flag)¶
If flag is ,  will try and use hardware line
editing facilities. Otherwise, line insertion/deletion are disabled.



(flag)¶
If flag is , any change in the window image automatically causes the
window to be refreshed; you no longer have to call  yourself.
However, it may degrade performance considerably, due to repeated calls to
wrefresh.  This option is disabled by default.



([y, x])¶
Return the character at the given position in the window. The bottom 8 bits are
the character proper, and upper bits are the attributes.



(ch[, attr])¶

(y, x, ch[, attr])
Paint character ch at  with attributes attr, moving the line from
position x right by one character.



(nlines)¶
Insert nlines lines into the specified window above the current line.  The
nlines bottom lines are lost.  For negative nlines, delete nlines lines
starting with the one under the cursor, and move the remaining lines up.  The
bottom nlines lines are cleared.  The current cursor position remains the
same.



()¶
Insert a blank line under the cursor. All following lines are moved down by one
line.



(str, n[, attr])¶

(y, x, str, n[, attr])
Insert a character string (as many characters as will fit on the line) before
the character under the cursor, up to n characters.   If n is zero or
negative, the entire string is inserted. All characters to the right of the
cursor are shifted right, with the rightmost characters on the line being lost.
The cursor position does not change (after moving to y, x, if specified).



(str[, attr])¶

(y, x, str[, attr])
Insert a character string (as many characters as will fit on the line) before
the character under the cursor.  All characters to the right of the cursor are
shifted right, with the rightmost characters on the line being lost.  The cursor
position does not change (after moving to y, x, if specified).



([n])¶

(y, x[, n])
Return a bytes object of characters, extracted from the window starting at the
current cursor position, or at y, x if specified. Attributes are stripped
from the characters.  If n is specified,  returns a string
at most n characters long (exclusive of the trailing NUL).



(line)¶
Return  if the specified line was modified since the last call to
; otherwise return .  Raise a 
exception if line is not valid for the given window.



()¶
Return  if the specified window was modified since the last call to
; otherwise return .



(flag)¶
If flag is , escape sequences generated by some keys (keypad,  function keys)
will be interpreted by . If flag is , escape sequences will be
left as is in the input stream.



(flag)¶
If flag is , cursor is left where it is on update, instead of being at “cursor
position.”  This reduces cursor movement where possible. If possible the cursor
will be made invisible.
If flag is , cursor will always be at “cursor position” after an update.



(new_y, new_x)¶
Move cursor to .



(y, x)¶
Move the window inside its parent window.  The screen-relative parameters of
the window are not changed.  This routine is used to display different parts of
the parent window at the same physical position on the screen.



(new_y, new_x)¶
Move the window so its upper-left corner is at .



(flag)¶
If flag is ,  will be non-blocking.



(flag)¶
If flag is , escape sequences will not be timed out.
If flag is , after a few milliseconds, an escape sequence will not be
interpreted, and will be left in the input stream as is.



()¶
Mark for refresh but wait.  This function updates the data structure
representing the desired state of the window, but does not force an update of
the physical screen.  To accomplish that, call  .



(destwin[, sminrow, smincol, dminrow, dmincol, dmaxrow, dmaxcol])¶
Overlay the window on top of destwin. The windows need not be the same size,
only the overlapping region is copied. This copy is non-destructive, which means
that the current background character does not overwrite the old contents of
destwin.
To get fine-grained control over the copied region, the second form of
 can be used. sminrow and smincol are the upper-left
coordinates of the source window, and the other variables mark a rectangle in
the destination window.



(destwin[, sminrow, smincol, dminrow, dmincol, dmaxrow, dmaxcol])¶
Overwrite the window on top of destwin. The windows need not be the same size,
in which case only the overlapping region is copied. This copy is destructive,
which means that the current background character overwrites the old contents of
destwin.
To get fine-grained control over the copied region, the second form of
 can be used. sminrow and smincol are the upper-left
coordinates of the source window, the other variables mark a rectangle in the
destination window.



(file)¶
Write all data associated with the window into the provided file object.  This
information can be later retrieved using the  function.



(beg, num)¶
Indicate that the num screen lines, starting at line beg, are corrupted and
should be completely redrawn on the next  call.



()¶
Touch the entire window, causing it to be completely redrawn on the next
 call.



([pminrow, pmincol, sminrow, smincol, smaxrow, smaxcol])¶
Update the display immediately (sync actual screen with previous
drawing/deleting methods).
The 6 optional arguments can only be specified when the window is a pad created
with .  The additional parameters are needed to indicate what part
of the pad and screen are involved. pminrow and pmincol specify the upper
left-hand corner of the rectangle to be displayed in the pad.  sminrow,
smincol, smaxrow, and smaxcol specify the edges of the rectangle to be
displayed on the screen.  The lower right-hand corner of the rectangle to be
displayed in the pad is calculated from the screen coordinates, since the
rectangles must be the same size.  Both rectangles must be entirely contained
within their respective structures.  Negative values of pminrow, pmincol,
sminrow, or smincol are treated as if they were zero.



(nlines, ncols)¶
Reallocate storage for a curses window to adjust its dimensions to the
specified values.  If either dimension is larger than the current values, the
window’s data is filled with blanks that have the current background
rendition (as set by ) merged into them.



([lines=1])¶
Scroll the screen or scrolling region upward by lines lines.



(flag)¶
Control what happens when the cursor of a window is moved off the edge of the
window or scrolling region, either as a result of a newline action on the bottom
line, or typing the last character of the last line.  If flag is , the
cursor is left on the bottom line.  If flag is , the window is scrolled up
one line.  Note that in order to get the physical scrolling effect on the
terminal, it is also necessary to call .



(top, bottom)¶
Set the scrolling region from line top to line bottom. All scrolling actions
will take place in this region.



()¶
Turn off the standout attribute.  On some terminals this has the side effect of
turning off all attributes.



()¶
Turn on attribute A_STANDOUT.



(begin_y, begin_x)¶

(nlines, ncols, begin_y, begin_x)
Return a sub-window, whose upper-left corner is at , and
whose width/height is ncols/nlines.



(begin_y, begin_x)¶

(nlines, ncols, begin_y, begin_x)
Return a sub-window, whose upper-left corner is at , and
whose width/height is ncols/nlines.
By default, the sub-window will extend from the specified position to the lower
right corner of the window.



()¶
Touch each location in the window that has been touched in any of its ancestor
windows.  This routine is called by , so it should almost never
be necessary to call it manually.



(flag)¶
If flag is , then  is called automatically
whenever there is a change in the window.



()¶
Touch all locations in ancestors of the window that have been changed in  the
window.



(delay)¶
Set blocking or non-blocking read behavior for the window.  If delay is
negative, blocking read is used (which will wait indefinitely for input).  If
delay is zero, then non-blocking read is used, and  will
return  if no input is waiting.  If delay is positive, then
 will block for delay milliseconds, and return  if there is
still no input at the end of that time.



(start, count[, changed])¶
Pretend count lines have been changed, starting with line start.  If
changed is supplied, it specifies whether the affected lines are marked as
having been changed (changed) or unchanged (changed).



()¶
Pretend the whole window has been changed, for purposes of drawing
optimizations.



()¶
Mark all lines in  the  window  as unchanged since the last call to
.



(ch, n)¶

(y, x, ch, n)
Display a vertical line starting at  with length n consisting of the
character ch.
