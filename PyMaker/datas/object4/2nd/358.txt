class (object)¶

class (name, bases, dict)
With one argument, return the type of an object.  The return value is a
type object and generally the same object as returned by
.
The  built-in function is recommended for testing the type
of an object, because it takes subclasses into account.
With three arguments, return a new type object.  This is essentially a
dynamic form of the  statement. The name string is the
class name and becomes the  attribute; the bases
tuple itemizes the base classes and becomes the 
attribute; and the dict dictionary is the namespace containing definitions
for class body and is copied to a standard dictionary to become the
 attribute.  For example, the following two
statements create identical  objects:


See also Type Objects.

Changed in version 3.6: Subclasses of  which don’t override  may no
longer use the one-argument form to get the type of an object.
