docs:


class (fget=None, fset=None, fdel=None, doc=None)¶
Return a property attribute.
fget is a function for getting an attribute value.  fset is a function
for setting an attribute value. fdel is a function for deleting an attribute
value.  And doc creates a docstring for the attribute.
A typical use is to define a managed attribute :


If c is an instance of C,  will invoke the getter,
 will invoke the setter and  the deleter.
If given, doc will be the docstring of the property attribute. Otherwise, the
property will copy fget’s docstring (if it exists).  This makes it possible to
create read-only properties easily using  as a decorator:


The  decorator turns the  method into a “getter”
for a read-only attribute with the same name, and it sets the docstring for
voltage to “Get the current voltage.”
A property object has , ,
and  methods usable as decorators that create a
copy of the property with the corresponding accessor function set to the
decorated function.  This is best explained with an example:


This code is exactly equivalent to the first example.  Be sure to give the
additional functions the same name as the original property ( in this
case.)
The returned property object also has the attributes , , and
 corresponding to the constructor arguments.

Changed in version 3.5: The docstrings of property objects are now writeable.
