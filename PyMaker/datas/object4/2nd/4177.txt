docs:


()¶
Return the ‘thread identifier’ of the current thread.  This is a nonzero
integer.  Its value has no direct meaning; it is intended as a magic cookie
to be used e.g. to index a dictionary of thread-specific data.  Thread
identifiers may be recycled when a thread exits and another thread is
created.

New in version 3.3.
