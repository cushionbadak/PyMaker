5.6. Replacing the standard import systemÂ¶
The most reliable mechanism for replacing the entire import system is to
delete the default contents of , replacing them
entirely with a custom meta path hook.
If it is acceptable to only alter the behaviour of import statements
without affecting other APIs that access the import system, then replacing
the builtin  function may be sufficient. This technique
may also be employed at the module level to only alter the behaviour of
import statements within that module.
To selectively prevent import of some modules from a hook early on the
meta path (rather than disabling the standard import system entirely),
it is sufficient to raise  directly from
 instead of returning
. The latter indicates that the meta path search should continue,
while raising an exception terminates it immediately.
