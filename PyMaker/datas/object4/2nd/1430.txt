docs:


(gen_func)Â¶
This function transforms a generator function into a
coroutine function which returns a generator-based coroutine.
The generator-based coroutine is still a generator iterator,
but is also considered to be a coroutine object and is
awaitable.  However, it may not necessarily implement
the  method.
If gen_func is a generator function, it will be modified in-place.
If gen_func is not a generator function, it will be wrapped. If it
returns an instance of , the instance
will be wrapped in an awaitable proxy object.  All other types
of objects will be returned as is.

New in version 3.5.
