time zone and DST adjustments,  should return their sum.  If
the UTC offset isn’t known, return .  Else the value returned must be a
 object strictly between  and
 (the magnitude of the offset must be less
than one day).  Most implementations of  will probably look
like one of these two:


If  does not return ,  should not return
 either.
The default implementation of  raises
