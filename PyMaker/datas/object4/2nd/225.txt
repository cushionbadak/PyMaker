()¶
Starts the execution of a generator function or resumes it at the last
executed yield expression.  When a generator function is resumed with a
 method, the current yield expression always
evaluates to .  The execution then continues to the next yield
expression, where the generator is suspended again, and the value of the
 is returned to ’s caller.  If the
generator exits without yielding another value, a 
exception is raised.
This method is normally called implicitly, e.g. by a  loop, or
by the built-in  function.
