(delta)Â¶
This opcode performs several operations before a with block starts.  First,
it loads  from the context manager and pushes it onto
the stack for later use by .  Then,
 is called, and a finally block pointing to delta
is pushed.  Finally, the result of calling the enter method is pushed onto
the stack.  The next opcode will either ignore it (), or
store it in (a) variable(s) (, , or
).

New in version 3.2.
