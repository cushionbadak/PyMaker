(how, mask)Â¶
Fetch and/or change the signal mask of the calling thread.  The signal mask
is the set of signals whose delivery is currently blocked for the caller.
Return the old signal mask as a set of signals.
The behavior of the call is dependent on the value of how, as follows.

: The set of blocked signals is the union of the current
set and the mask argument.
: The signals in mask are removed from the current
set of blocked signals.  It is permissible to attempt to unblock a
signal which is not blocked.
: The set of blocked signals is set to the mask
argument.

mask is a set of signal numbers (e.g. {,
}). Use  for a full mask
including all signals.
For example,  reads the
signal mask of the calling thread.
Availability: Unix. See the man page sigprocmask(3) and
pthread_sigmask(3) for further information.
