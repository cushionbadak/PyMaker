(line)Â¶
Hook method executed just before the command line line is interpreted, but
after the input prompt is generated and issued.  This method is a stub in
; it exists to be overridden by subclasses.  The return value is
used as the command which will be executed by the  method; the
 implementation may re-write the command or simply return line
unchanged.
