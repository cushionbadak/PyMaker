Undocumented Modules¶
Here’s a quick listing of modules that are currently undocumented, but that
should be documented.  Feel free to contribute documentation for them!  (Send
via email to docs@python.org.)
The idea and original contents for this chapter were taken from a posting by
Fredrik Lundh; the specific contents of this chapter have been substantially
revised.

Platform specific modules¶
These modules are used to implement the  module, and are not
documented beyond this mention.  There’s little need to document these.


— Implementation of  on Win32 and Win64 platforms.

— Implementation of  on POSIX.
