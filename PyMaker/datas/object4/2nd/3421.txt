attempt is made to create an argument with an option string that is already in
use:


Sometimes (e.g. when using parents) it may be useful to simply override any
older arguments with the same option string.  To get this behavior, the value
 can be supplied to the  argument of

Note that  objects only remove an action if all of its
option strings are overridden.  So, in the example above, the old 
action is retained as the  action, because only the  option
string was overridden.
