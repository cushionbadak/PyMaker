extract_dir is the name of the target directory where the archive is
unpacked. If not provided, the current working directory is used.
format is the archive format: one of “zip”, “tar”, “gztar”, “bztar”, or
“xztar”.  Or any other format registered with

will use the archive file name extension and see if an unpacker was
registered for that extension.  In case none is found,
a  is raised.
