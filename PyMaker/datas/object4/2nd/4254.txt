docs:


([timeout])¶
If the optional argument timeout is  (the default), the method
blocks until the process whose  method is called terminates.
If timeout is a positive number, it blocks at most timeout seconds.
Note that the method returns  if its process terminates or if the
method times out.  Check the process’s  to determine if
it terminated.
A process can be joined many times.
A process cannot join itself because this would cause a deadlock.  It is
an error to attempt to join a process before it has been started.
