Flag¶
The last variation is .  Like , 
members can be combined using the bitwise operators (&, |, ^, ~).  Unlike
, they cannot be combined with, nor compared against, any
other  enumeration, nor .  While it is possible to
specify the values directly it is recommended to use  as the
value and let  select an appropriate value.

New in version 3.6.

Like , if a combination of  members results in no
flags being set, the boolean evaluation is :


Individual flags should have values that are powers of two (1, 2, 4, 8, …),
while combinations of flags won’t:


Giving a name to the “no flags set” condition does not change its boolean
value:



Note
For the majority of new code,  and  are strongly
recommended, since  and  break some
semantic promises of an enumeration (by being comparable to integers, and
thus by transitivity to other unrelated enumerations).  
and  should be used only in cases where  and
 will not do; for example, when integer constants are replaced
with enumerations, or for interoperability with other systems.
