Supporting a variable number of context managers¶
The primary use case for  is the one given in the class
documentation: supporting a variable number of context managers and other
cleanup operations in a single  statement. The variability
may come from the number of context managers needed being driven by user
input (such as opening a user specified collection of files), or from
some of the context managers being optional:


As shown,  also makes it quite easy to use 
statements to manage arbitrary resources that don’t natively support the
context management protocol.
