(section, option, value)Â¶
If the given section exists, set the given option to the specified value;
otherwise raise .  While it is possible to use
 (or  with raw parameters
set to true) for internal storage of non-string values, full
functionality (including interpolation and output to files) can only be
achieved using string values.
This method lets users assign non-string values to keys internally.  This
behaviour is unsupported and will cause errors when attempting to write
to a file or get it in non-raw mode.  Use the mapping protocol API
which does not allow such assignments to take place.
