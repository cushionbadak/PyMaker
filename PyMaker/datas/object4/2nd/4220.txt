 Example¶
Semaphores are often used to guard resources with limited capacity, for example,
a database server.  In any situation where the size of the resource is fixed,
you should use a bounded semaphore.  Before spawning any worker threads, your
main thread would initialize the semaphore:


Once spawned, worker threads call the semaphore’s acquire and release methods
when they need to connect to the server:


The use of a bounded semaphore reduces the chance that a programming error which
causes the semaphore to be released more than it’s acquired will go undetected.
