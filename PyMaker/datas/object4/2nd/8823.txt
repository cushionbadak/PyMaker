docs:


(name, deprecated=False, *, required_on())Â¶
This function imports and returns the named module. Unlike a normal
import, this function raises  if the module
cannot be imported.
Module and package deprecation messages are suppressed during this import
if deprecated is .  If a module is required on a platform but
optional for others, set required_on to an iterable of platform prefixes
which will be compared against .

New in version 3.1.
