docs:

Raising errors in a callbackÂ¶
The callback function should raise  if there are any
problems with the option or its argument(s).   catches this and
terminates the program, printing the error message you supply to stderr.  Your
message should be clear, concise, accurate, and mention the option at fault.
Otherwise, the user will have a hard time figuring out what they did wrong.
