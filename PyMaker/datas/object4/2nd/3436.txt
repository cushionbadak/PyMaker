Action classes¶
Action classes implement the Action API, a callable which returns a callable
which processes arguments from the command-line. Any object which follows
this API may be passed as the  parameter to
.


class (option_strings, dest, nargs=None, const=None, default=None, type=None, choices=None, required=False, help=None, metavar=None)¶

Action objects are used by an ArgumentParser to represent the information
needed to parse a single argument from one or more strings from the
command line. The Action class must accept the two positional arguments
plus any keyword arguments passed to 
except for the  itself.
Instances of Action (or return value of any callable to the 
parameter) should have attributes “dest”, “option_strings”, “default”, “type”,
“required”, “help”, etc. defined. The easiest way to ensure these attributes
are defined is to call .
Action instances should be callable, so subclasses must override the
 method, which should accept four parameters:

 - The ArgumentParser object which contains this action.
 - The  object that will be returned by
.  Most actions add an attribute to this
object using .
 - The associated command-line arguments, with any type conversions
applied.  Type conversions are specified with the type keyword argument to
.
 - The option string that was used to invoke this action.
The  argument is optional, and will be absent if the action
is associated with a positional argument.

The  method may perform arbitrary actions, but will typically set
attributes on the  based on  and .
