(value[, format_spec])¶
Convert a value to a “formatted” representation, as controlled by
format_spec.  The interpretation of format_spec will depend on the type
of the value argument, however there is a standard formatting syntax that
is used by most built-in types: Format Specification Mini-Language.
The default format_spec is an empty string which usually gives the same
effect as calling .
A call to  is translated to
 which bypasses the instance
dictionary when searching for the value’s  method.  A
 exception is raised if the method search reaches
 and the format_spec is non-empty, or if either the
format_spec or the return value are not strings.

Changed in version 3.4:  raises 
if format_spec is not an empty string.
