¶
Make , , , , , ,  and 
perform ASCII-only matching instead of full Unicode matching.  This is only
meaningful for Unicode patterns, and is ignored for byte patterns.
Corresponds to the inline flag .
Note that for backward compatibility, the  flag still
exists (as well as its synonym  and its embedded
counterpart ), but these are redundant in Python 3 since
matches are Unicode by default for strings (and Unicode matching
isn’t allowed for bytes).
