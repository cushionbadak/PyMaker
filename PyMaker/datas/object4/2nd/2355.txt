(value, file[, version])¶
Write the value on the open file.  The value must be a supported type.  The
file must be a writeable binary file.
If the value has (or contains an object that has) an unsupported type, a
 exception is raised — but garbage data will also be written
to the file.  The object will not be properly read back by .
The version argument indicates the data format that  should use
(see below).
