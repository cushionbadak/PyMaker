docs:


(name, path=None)Â¶
Find the loader for a module, optionally within the specified path. If the
module is in , then  is
returned (unless the loader would be  or is not set, in which case
 is raised). Otherwise a search using 
is done.  is returned if no loader is found.
A dotted name does not have its parents implicitly imported as that requires
loading them and that may not be desired. To properly import a submodule you
will need to import all parent packages of the submodule and use the correct
argument to path.

New in version 3.3.


Changed in version 3.4: If  is not set, raise , just like when the
attribute is set to .


Deprecated since version 3.4: Use  instead.
