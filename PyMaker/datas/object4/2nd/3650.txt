class (capacity, flushLevel=ERROR, target=None, flushOnClose=True)¶
Returns a new instance of the  class. The instance is
initialized with a buffer size of capacity. If flushLevel is not specified,
 is used. If no target is specified, the target will need to be
set using  before this handler does anything useful. If
flushOnClose is specified as , then the buffer is not flushed when
the handler is closed. If not specified or specified as , the previous
behaviour of flushing the buffer will occur when the handler is closed.

Changed in version 3.6: The flushOnClose parameter was added.



()¶
Calls , sets the target to  and clears the
buffer.



()¶
For a , flushing means just sending the buffered

this happens. Override if you want different behavior.



(target)¶
Sets the target handler for this handler.



(record)¶
Checks for buffer full or a record at the flushLevel or higher.
