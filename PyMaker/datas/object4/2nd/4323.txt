(typecode_or_type, size_or_initializer, *, lock=True)¶
Return a ctypes array allocated from shared memory.  By default the return
value is actually a synchronized wrapper for the array.
typecode_or_type determines the type of the elements of the returned array:
it is either a ctypes type or a one character typecode of the kind used by
the  module.  If size_or_initializer is an integer, then it
determines the length of the array, and the array will be initially zeroed.
Otherwise, size_or_initializer is a sequence which is used to initialize
the array and whose length determines the length of the array.
If lock is  (the default) then a new lock object is created to
synchronize access to the value.  If lock is a  or
 object then that will be used to synchronize access to the
value.  If lock is  then access to the returned object will not be
automatically protected by a lock, so it will not necessarily be
“process-safe”.
Note that lock is a keyword only argument.
Note that an array of  has value and raw
attributes which allow one to use it to store and retrieve strings.
