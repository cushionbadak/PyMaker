docs:


(bytes[, flags])Â¶
Send data to the socket.  The socket must be connected to a remote socket.  The
optional flags argument has the same meaning as for  above.
Returns the number of bytes sent. Applications are responsible for checking that
all data has been sent; if only some of the data was transmitted, the
application needs to attempt delivery of the remaining data. For further
information on this topic, consult the Socket Programming HOWTO.

Changed in version 3.5: If the system call is interrupted and the signal handler does not raise
an exception, the method now retries the system call instead of raising
an  exception (see PEP 475 for the rationale).
