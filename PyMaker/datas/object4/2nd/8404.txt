(module, name)¶
Convert the doctest for an object to a script.
Argument module is a module object, or dotted name of a module, containing the
object whose doctests are of interest.  Argument name is the name (within the
module) of the object with the doctests of interest.  The result is a string,
containing the object’s docstring converted to a Python script, as described for
 above.  For example, if module 
contains a top-level function , then


prints a script version of function ’s docstring, with doctests
converted to code, and the rest placed in comments.
