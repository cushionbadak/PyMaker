class (host='', port=IMAP4_PORT)Â¶
This class implements the actual IMAP4 protocol.  The connection is created and
protocol version (IMAP4 or IMAP4rev1) is determined when the instance is
initialized. If host is not specified,  (the local host) is used. If
port is omitted, the standard IMAP4 port (143) is used.
The  class supports the  statement.  When used
like this, the IMAP4  command is issued automatically when the
 statement exits.  E.g.:



Changed in version 3.5: Support for the  statement was added.
