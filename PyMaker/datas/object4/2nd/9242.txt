docs:


(interval)¶
Set the interpreter’s “check interval”.  This integer value determines how often
the interpreter checks for periodic things such as thread switches and signal
handlers.  The default is , meaning the check is performed every 100
Python virtual instructions. Setting it to a larger value may increase
performance for programs using threads.  Setting it to a value  0 checks
every virtual instruction, maximizing responsiveness as well as overhead.

Deprecated since version 3.2: This function doesn’t have an effect anymore, as the internal logic for
thread switching and asynchronous tasks has been rewritten.  Use
 instead.
