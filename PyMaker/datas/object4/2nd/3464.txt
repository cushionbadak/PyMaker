Partial parsing¶


(args=None, namespace=None)¶

Sometimes a script may only parse a few of the command-line arguments, passing
the remaining arguments on to another script or program. In these cases, the
 method can be useful.  It works much like
 except that it does not produce an error when
extra arguments are present.  Instead, it returns a two item tuple containing
the populated namespace and the list of remaining argument strings.



Warning
Prefix matching rules apply to
. The parser may consume an option even if it’s just
a prefix of one of its known options, instead of leaving it in the remaining
arguments list.
