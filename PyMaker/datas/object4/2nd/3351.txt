Multi-threadingÂ¶
 objects are thread-safe to the extent that the operating system
calls (such as  under Unix) they wrap are thread-safe too.
Binary buffered objects (instances of ,
,  and )
protect their internal structures using a lock; it is therefore safe to call
them from multiple threads at once.
 objects are not thread-safe.
