(input, output)Â¶
Encode the contents of the binary input file and write the resulting base64
encoded data to the output file. input and output must be file
objects. input will be read until  returns
an empty bytes object.  inserts a newline character ()
after every 76 bytes of the output, as well as ensuring that the output
always ends with a newline, as per RFC 2045 (MIME).
