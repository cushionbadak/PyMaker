docs:


Â¶
List of Unix shell-style wildcard test name patterns that test methods
have to match to be included in test suites (see  option).
If this attribute is not  (the default), all test methods to be
included in test suites must match one of the patterns in this list.
Note that matches are always performed using ,
so unlike patterns passed to the  option, simple substring patterns
will have to be converted using  wildcards.
This affects all the  methods.

New in version 3.7.
