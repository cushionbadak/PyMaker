(key, message)¶
Replace the message corresponding to key with message. Raise a
 exception if no message already corresponds to key.
As with , parameter message may be a 
instance, an  instance, a string, a byte
string, or a file-like object (which should be open in binary mode). If
message is an
instance of the appropriate format-specific  subclass
(e.g., if it’s an  instance and this is an
 instance), its format-specific information is
used. Otherwise, the format-specific information of the message that
currently corresponds to key is left unchanged.
