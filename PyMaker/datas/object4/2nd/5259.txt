docs:


¶
Register a callback function that will be called after the TLS Client Hello
handshake message has been received by the SSL/TLS server when the TLS client
specifies a server name indication. The server name indication mechanism
is specified in RFC 6066 section 3 - Server Name Indication.
Only one callback can be set per .  If sni_callback
is set to  then the callback is disabled. Calling this function a
subsequent time will disable the previously registered callback.
The callback function will be called with three
arguments; the first being the , the second is a string
that represents the server name that the client is intending to communicate
(or  if the TLS Client Hello does not contain a server name)
and the third argument is the original . The server name
argument is text. For internationalized domain name, the server
name is an IDN A-label ().
A typical use of this callback is to change the ’s
 attribute to a new object of type
 representing a certificate chain that matches the server
name.
Due to the early negotiation phase of the TLS connection, only limited
methods and attributes are usable like
 and .
, ,
 and  methods require that
the TLS connection has progressed beyond the TLS Client Hello and therefore
will not contain return meaningful values nor can they be called safely.
The sni_callback function must return  to allow the
TLS negotiation to continue.  If a TLS failure is required, a constant
 can be
returned.  Other return values will result in a TLS fatal error with
.
If an exception is raised from the sni_callback function the TLS
connection will terminate with a fatal TLS alert message
.
This method will raise  if the OpenSSL library
had OPENSSL_NO_TLSEXT defined when it was built.

New in version 3.7.
