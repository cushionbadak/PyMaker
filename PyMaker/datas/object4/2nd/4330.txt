docs:


(obj[, lock])Â¶
Return a process-safe wrapper object for a ctypes object which uses lock to
synchronize access.  If lock is  (the default) then a
 object is created automatically.
A synchronized wrapper will have two methods in addition to those of the
object it wraps:  returns the wrapped object and
 returns the lock object used for synchronization.
Note that accessing the ctypes object through the wrapper can be a lot slower
than accessing the raw ctypes object.

Changed in version 3.5: Synchronized objects support the context manager protocol.
