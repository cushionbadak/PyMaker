docs:


() → float¶
Return the value (in fractional seconds) of a monotonic clock, i.e. a clock
that cannot go backwards.  The clock is not affected by system clock updates.
The reference point of the returned value is undefined, so that only the
difference between the results of consecutive calls is valid.

New in version 3.3.


Changed in version 3.5: The function is now always available and always system-wide.
