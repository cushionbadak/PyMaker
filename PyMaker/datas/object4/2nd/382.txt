Bitwise Operations on Integer Types¶
Bitwise operations only make sense for integers. The result of bitwise
operations is calculated as though carried out in two’s complement with an
infinite number of sign bits.
The priorities of the binary bitwise operations are all lower than the numeric
operations and higher than the comparisons; the unary operation  has the
same priority as the other unary numeric operations ( and ).
This table lists the bitwise operations sorted in ascending priority:







Operation
Result
Notes




bitwise or of x and
y
(4)


bitwise exclusive or of
x and y
(4)


bitwise and of x and
y
(4)


x shifted left by n bits
(1)(2)


x shifted right by n bits
(1)(3)


the bits of x inverted
 



Notes:

Negative shift counts are illegal and cause a  to be raised.
A left shift by n bits is equivalent to multiplication by 
without overflow check.
A right shift by n bits is equivalent to division by  without
overflow check.
Performing these calculations with at least one extra sign extension bit in
a finite two’s complement representation (a working bit-width of
 or more) is sufficient to get the
same result as if there were an infinite number of sign bits.
