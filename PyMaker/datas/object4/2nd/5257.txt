docs:


(protocols)Â¶
Specify which protocols the socket should advertise during the SSL/TLS
handshake. It should be a list of ASCII strings, like , ordered by preference. The selection of a protocol will happen
during the handshake, and will play out according to RFC 7301. After a
successful handshake, the  method will
return the agreed-upon protocol.
This method will raise  if  is
False.
OpenSSL 1.1.0 to 1.1.0e will abort the handshake and raise 
when both sides support ALPN but cannot agree on a protocol. 1.1.0f+
behaves like 1.0.2,  returns None.

New in version 3.5.
