Default factory functionsÂ¶

If a  specifies a , it is called with
zero arguments when a default value for the field is needed.  For
example, to create a new instance of a list, use:


If a field is excluded from  (using )

factory function will always be called from the generated
 function.  This happens because there is no other
way to give the field an initial value.
