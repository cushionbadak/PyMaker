(key)Â¶
If the  attribute is , this raises a
 exception with the key as argument.
If  is not , it is called without arguments
to provide a default value for the given key, this value is inserted in
the dictionary for the key, and returned.
If calling  raises an exception this exception is
propagated unchanged.
This method is called by the  method of the
 class when the requested key is not found; whatever it
returns or raises is then returned or raised by .
Note that  is not called for any operations besides
. This means that  will, like normal
dictionaries, return  as a default rather than using
.
