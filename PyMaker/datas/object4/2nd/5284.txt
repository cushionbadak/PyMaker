Client-side operation¶
This example creates a SSL context with the recommended security settings
for client sockets, including automatic certificate verification:


If you prefer to tune security settings yourself, you might create
a context from scratch (but beware that you might not get the settings
right):


(this snippet assumes your operating system places a bundle of all CA
certificates in ; if not, you’ll get an
error and have to adjust the location)
When you use the context to connect to a server, 
validates the server certificate: it ensures that the server certificate
was signed with one of the CA certificates, and checks the signature for
correctness:


You may then fetch the certificate:


Visual inspection shows that the certificate does identify the desired service
(that is, the HTTPS host ):


Now the SSL channel is established and the certificate verified, you can
proceed to talk with the server:
