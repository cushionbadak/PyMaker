Module API¶
 exposes two functions for programmatic use:


()¶
Returns a string specifying the bundled version of pip that will be
installed when bootstrapping an environment.



(root=None, upgrade=False, user=False, altinstall=False, default_pip=False, verbosity=0)¶
Bootstraps  into the current or designated environment.
root specifies an alternative root directory to install relative to.
If root is , then installation uses the default install location
for the current environment.
upgrade indicates whether or not to upgrade an existing installation
of an earlier version of  to the bundled version.
user indicates whether to use the user scheme rather than installing
globally.
By default, the scripts  and  will be installed (where
X.Y stands for the current version of Python).
If altinstall is set, then  will not be installed.
If default_pip is set, then  will be installed in addition to
the two regular scripts.
Setting both altinstall and default_pip will trigger
.
verbosity controls the level of output to  from the
bootstrapping operation.

Note
The bootstrapping process has side effects on both  and
. Invoking the command line interface in a subprocess
instead allows these side effects to be avoided.


Note
The bootstrapping process may install additional modules required by
, but other software should not assume those dependencies will
always be present by default (as the dependencies may be removed in a
future version of ).
