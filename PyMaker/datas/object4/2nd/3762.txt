(ch[, attr])¶
Set the background property of the window to the character ch, with
attributes attr.  The change is then applied to every character position in
that window:

The attribute of every character in the window  is changed to the new
background attribute.
Wherever  the  former background character appears, it is changed to the new
background character.
