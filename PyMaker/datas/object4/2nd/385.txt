docs:


(length, byteorder, *, signed=False)¶
Return an array of bytes representing an integer.


The integer is represented using length bytes.  An 
is raised if the integer is not representable with the given number of
bytes.
The byteorder argument determines the byte order used to represent the
integer.  If byteorder is , the most significant byte is at the
beginning of the byte array.  If byteorder is , the most
significant byte is at the end of the byte array.  To request the native
byte order of the host system, use  as the byte order
value.
The signed argument determines whether two’s complement is used to
represent the integer.  If signed is  and a negative integer is
given, an  is raised. The default value for signed
is .

New in version 3.2.
