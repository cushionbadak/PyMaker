class (logger, extra)¶
Returns an instance of  initialized with an
underlying  instance and a dict-like object.


(msg, kwargs)¶
Modifies the message and/or keyword arguments passed to a logging call in
order to insert contextual information. This implementation takes the object
passed as extra to the constructor and adds it to kwargs using key
‘extra’. The return value is a (msg, kwargs) tuple which has the
(possibly modified) versions of the arguments passed in.
