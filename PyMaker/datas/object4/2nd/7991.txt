class (instream=None, infile=None, posix=False, punctuation_chars=False)¶
A  instance or subclass instance is a lexical analyzer
object.  The initialization argument, if present, specifies where to read
characters from.  It must be a file-/stream-like object with
 and  methods, or
a string.  If no argument is given, input will be taken from .
The second optional argument is a filename string, which sets the initial
value of the  attribute.  If the instream
argument is omitted or equal to , this second argument
defaults to “stdin”.  The posix argument defines the operational mode:
when posix is not true (default), the  instance will
operate in compatibility mode.  When operating in POSIX mode,
 will try to be as close as possible to the POSIX shell
parsing rules.  The punctuation_chars argument provides a way to make the
behaviour even closer to how real shells parse.  This can take a number of
values: the default value, , preserves the behaviour seen under
Python 3.5 and earlier.  If set to , then parsing of the characters
 is changed: any run of these characters (considered punctuation
characters) is returned as a single token.  If set to a non-empty string of
characters, those characters will be used as the punctuation characters.  Any
characters in the  attribute that appear in
punctuation_chars will be removed from .  See
Improved Compatibility with Shells for more information.

Changed in version 3.6: The punctuation_chars parameter was added.
