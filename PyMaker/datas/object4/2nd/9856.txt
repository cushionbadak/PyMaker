 — Constants used with Python parse trees¶
Source code: Lib/token.py

This module provides constants which represent the numeric values of leaf nodes
of the parse tree (terminal tokens).  Refer to the file 
in the Python distribution for the definitions of the names in the context of
the language grammar.  The specific numeric values which the names map to may
change between Python versions.
The module also provides a mapping from numeric codes to names and some
functions.  The functions mirror definitions in the Python C header files.


¶
Dictionary mapping the numeric values of the constants defined in this module
back to name strings, allowing more human-readable representation of parse trees
to be generated.



(x)¶
Return true for terminal token values.



(x)¶
Return true for non-terminal token values.



(x)¶
Return true if x is the marker indicating the end of input.

The token constants are:

The following token type values aren’t used by the C tokenizer but are needed for
the  module.


¶
Token value used to indicate a comment.



¶
Token value used to indicate a non-terminating newline.  The
 token indicates the end of a logical line of Python code;
 tokens are generated when a logical line of code is continued over
multiple physical lines.



¶
Token value that indicates the encoding used to decode the source bytes
into text. The first token returned by  will
always be an  token.


Changed in version 3.5: Added  and  tokens.


Changed in version 3.7: Added ,  and  tokens.


Changed in version 3.7: Removed  and  tokens. “async” and “await” are
now tokenized as  tokens.
