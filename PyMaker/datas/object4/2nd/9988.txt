Â¶
Control how the generated byte-code files are invalidated at runtime.
The  value, means that  files with the source timestamp
and size embedded will be generated. The  and
 values cause hash-based pycs to be generated. Hash-based
pycs embed a hash of the source file contents rather than a timestamp. See
Cached bytecode invalidation for more information on how Python validates
bytecode cache files at runtime.
The default is  if the  environment
variable is not set, and  if the 
environment variable is set.
