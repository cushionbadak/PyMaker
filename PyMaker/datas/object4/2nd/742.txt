docs:


class (template)¶
The constructor takes a single argument which is the template string.


(mapping, **kwds)¶
Performs the template substitution, returning a new string.  mapping is
any dictionary-like object with keys that match the placeholders in the
template.  Alternatively, you can provide keyword arguments, where the
keywords are the placeholders.  When both mapping and kwds are given
and there are duplicates, the placeholders from kwds take precedence.



(mapping, **kwds)¶
Like , except that if placeholders are missing from
mapping and kwds, instead of raising a  exception, the
original placeholder will appear in the resulting string intact.  Also,
unlike with , any other appearances of the  will
simply return  instead of raising .
While other exceptions may still occur, this method is called “safe”
because it always tries to return a usable string instead of
raising an exception.  In another sense,  may be
anything other than safe, since it will silently ignore malformed
templates containing dangling delimiters, unmatched braces, or
placeholders that are not valid Python identifiers.

 instances also provide one public data attribute:


¶
This is the object passed to the constructor’s template argument.  In
general, you shouldn’t change it, but read-only access is not enforced.
