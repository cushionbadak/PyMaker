(x)¶
Return the error function at
x.
The  function can be used to compute traditional statistical

New in version 3.2.




(x)¶
Return the complementary error function at x.  The complementary error
function is defined as
.  It is used for large values of x where a subtraction
from one would cause a loss of significance.

New in version 3.2.

Return the Gamma function at
x.

New in version 3.2.
