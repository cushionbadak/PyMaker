docs:


([group1, ...])Â¶
Returns one or more subgroups of the match.  If there is a single argument, the
result is a single string; if there are multiple arguments, the result is a
tuple with one item per argument. Without arguments, group1 defaults to zero
(the whole match is returned). If a groupN argument is zero, the corresponding
return value is the entire matching string; if it is in the inclusive range
[1..99], it is the string matching the corresponding parenthesized group.  If a
group number is negative or larger than the number of groups defined in the
pattern, an  exception is raised. If a group is contained in a
part of the pattern that did not match, the corresponding result is .
If a group is contained in a part of the pattern that matched multiple times,
the last match is returned.


If the regular expression uses the  syntax, the groupN
arguments may also be strings identifying groups by their group name.  If a
string argument is not used as a group name in the pattern, an 
exception is raised.
A moderately complicated example:


Named groups can also be referred to by their index:


If a group matches multiple times, only the last match is accessible:
