Constants added by the  module¶
The  module (which is imported automatically during startup, except
if the  command-line option is given) adds several constants to the
built-in namespace.  They are useful for the interactive interpreter shell and
should not be used in programs.


(code=None)¶

(code=None)¶
Objects that when printed, print a message like “Use quit() or Ctrl-D
(i.e. EOF) to exit”, and when called, raise  with the
specified exit code.

¶
Objects that when printed or called, print the text of copyright or
credits, respectively.



¶
Object that when printed, prints the message “Type license() to see the
full license text”, and when called, displays the full license text in a
pager-like fashion (one screen at a time).
