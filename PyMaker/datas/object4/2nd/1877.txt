(*iterables, repeat=1)¶
Cartesian product of input iterables.
Roughly equivalent to nested for-loops in a generator expression. For example,
 returns the same as .
The nested loops cycle like an odometer with the rightmost element advancing
on every iteration.  This pattern creates a lexicographic ordering so that if
the input’s iterables are sorted, the product tuples are emitted in sorted
order.
To compute the product of an iterable with itself, specify the number of
repetitions with the optional repeat keyword argument.  For example,
 means the same as .
This function is roughly equivalent to the following code, except that the
actual implementation does not build up intermediate results in memory:
