docs:


(suffix=None, prefix=None, dir=None)Â¶
This function securely creates a temporary directory using the same rules as .
The resulting object can be used as a context manager (see
Examples).  On completion of the context or destruction
of the temporary directory object the newly created temporary directory
and all its contents are removed from the filesystem.
The directory name can be retrieved from the  attribute of the
returned object.  When the returned object is used as a context manager, the
 will be assigned to the target of the  clause in
the  statement, if there is one.
The directory can be explicitly cleaned up by calling the
 method.

New in version 3.2.
