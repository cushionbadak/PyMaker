Introduction¶
This module allows high-level and efficient I/O multiplexing, built upon the
 module primitives. Users are encouraged to use this module
instead, unless they want precise control over the OS-level primitives used.
It defines a  abstract base class, along with several
concrete implementations (, …),
that can be used to wait for I/O readiness notification on multiple file
objects. In the following, “file object” refers to any object with a
 method, or a raw file descriptor. See file object.
 is an alias to the most efficient implementation
available on the current platform: this should be the default choice for most
users.

Note
The type of file objects supported depends on the platform: on Windows,
sockets are supported, but not pipes, whereas on Unix, both are supported
(some other types may be supported as well, such as fifos or special file
devices).
