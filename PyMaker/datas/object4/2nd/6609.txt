()¶
Transcode CGI variables from  to PEP 3333 “bytes in unicode”
strings, returning a new dictionary.  This function is used by
 and  in place of directly using
, which is not necessarily WSGI-compliant on all platforms
and web servers using Python 3 – specifically, ones where the OS’s
actual environment is Unicode (i.e. Windows), or ones where the environment
is bytes, but the system encoding used by Python to decode it is anything
other than ISO-8859-1 (e.g. Unix systems using UTF-8).
If you are implementing a CGI-based handler of your own, you probably want
to use this routine instead of just copying values out of 
directly.

New in version 3.2.
