class (request, client_address, server)¶
This class is used to serve either files or output of CGI scripts from the
current directory and below. Note that mapping HTTP hierarchic structure to
local directory structure is exactly as in .

Note
CGI scripts run by the  class cannot execute
redirects (HTTP code 302), because code 200 (script output follows) is
sent prior to execution of the CGI script.  This pre-empts the status
code.

The class will however, run the CGI script, instead of serving it as a file,
if it guesses it to be a CGI script.  Only directory-based CGI are used —
the other common server configuration is to treat special extensions as
denoting CGI scripts.
The  and  functions are modified to run CGI scripts
and serve the output, instead of serving files, if the request leads to
somewhere below the  path.
The  defines the following data member:


¶
This defaults to  and describes directories to
treat as containing CGI scripts.

The  defines the following method:


()¶
This method serves the  request type, only allowed for CGI
scripts.  Error 501, “Can only POST to CGI scripts”, is output when trying
to POST to a non-CGI url.

Note that CGI scripts will be run with UID of user nobody, for security
reasons.  Problems with the CGI script will be translated to error 403.
