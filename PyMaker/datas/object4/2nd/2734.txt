(filenames, encoding=None)¶
Attempt to read and parse an iterable of filenames, returning a list of
filenames which were successfully parsed.
If filenames is a string, a  object or a
path-like object, it is treated as
a single filename.  If a file named in filenames cannot be opened, that
file will be ignored.  This is designed so that you can specify an
iterable of potential configuration file locations (for example, the
current directory, the user’s home directory, and some system-wide
directory), and all existing configuration files in the iterable will be
read.
If none of the named files exist, the 
instance will contain an empty dataset.  An application which requires
initial values to be loaded from a file should load the required file or
files using  before calling  for any
optional files:



New in version 3.2: The encoding parameter.  Previously, all files were read using the
default encoding for .


New in version 3.6.1: The filenames parameter accepts a path-like object.


New in version 3.7: The filenames parameter accepts a  object.
