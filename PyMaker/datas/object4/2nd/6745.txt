Structured Parse Results¶
The result objects from the ,   and
 functions are subclasses of the  type.
These subclasses add the attributes listed in the documentation for
those functions, the encoding and decoding support described in the
previous section, as well as an additional method:


()¶
Return the re-combined version of the original URL as a string. This may
differ from the original URL in that the scheme may be normalized to lower
case and empty components may be dropped. Specifically, empty parameters,
queries, and fragment identifiers will be removed.
For  results, only empty fragment identifiers will be removed.
For  and  results, all noted changes will be
made to the URL returned by this method.
The result of this method remains unchanged if passed back through the original
parsing function:



The following classes provide the implementations of the structured parse
results when operating on  objects:


class (url, fragment)¶
Concrete class for  results containing 
data. The  method returns a 
instance.

New in version 3.2.




class (scheme, netloc, path, params, query, fragment)¶
Concrete class for  results containing 
data. The  method returns a 
instance.
