(name)Â¶
Remove directories recursively.  Works like  except that, if the
leaf directory is successfully removed,   tries to
successively remove every parent directory mentioned in  path until an error
is raised (which is ignored, because it generally means that a parent directory
is not empty). For example,  will first remove
the directory , and then remove  and  if
they are empty. Raises  if the leaf directory could not be
successfully removed.

Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a path-like object.
