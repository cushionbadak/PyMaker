data for MSI validation.

This module contains table contents for the standard sequence tables:
AdminExecuteSequence, AdminUISequence, AdvtExecuteSequence,
InstallExecuteSequence, and InstallUISequence.

This module contains definitions for the UIText and ActionText tables, for the
standard installer actions.
