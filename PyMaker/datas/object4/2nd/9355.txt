Catching exceptions from  methods¶
It is occasionally desirable to catch exceptions from an 
method implementation, without inadvertently catching exceptions from
the  statement body or the context manager’s 
method. By using  the steps in the context management
protocol can be separated slightly in order to allow this:


Actually needing to do this is likely to indicate that the underlying API
should be providing a direct resource management interface for use with
// statements, but not
all APIs are well designed in that regard. When a context manager is the
only resource management API provided, then  can make it
easier to handle various situations that can’t be handled directly in a
 statement.
