docs:


()Â¶
Open a new pseudo-terminal pair. Return a pair of file descriptors
 for the pty and the tty, respectively. The new file
descriptors are non-inheritable. For a (slightly) more
portable approach, use the  module.
Availability: some flavors of Unix.

Changed in version 3.4: The new file descriptors are now non-inheritable.
