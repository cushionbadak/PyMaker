class (object='')¶

class (object=b'', encoding='utf-8', errors='strict')
Return a string version of object.  If object is not
provided, returns the empty string.  Otherwise, the behavior of 
depends on whether encoding or errors is given, as follows.
If neither encoding nor errors is given,  returns
, which is the “informal” or nicely
printable string representation of object.  For string objects, this is
the string itself.  If object does not have a 
method, then  falls back to returning
.
If at least one of encoding or errors is given, object should be a
bytes-like object (e.g.  or ).  In
this case, if object is a  (or ) object,
then  is equivalent to
.  Otherwise, the bytes
object underlying the buffer object is obtained before calling
.  See Binary Sequence Types — bytes, bytearray, memoryview and
Buffer Protocol for information on buffer objects.
Passing a  object to  without the encoding
or errors arguments falls under the first case of returning the informal
string representation (see also the  command-line option to
Python).  For example:
