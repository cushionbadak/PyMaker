class ¶
A specialized alternative to , for use when deploying on
Microsoft’s IIS web server, without having set the config allowPathInfo
option (IIS>=7) or metabase allowPathInfoForScriptMappings (IIS<7).
By default, IIS gives a  that duplicates the  at
the front, causing problems for WSGI applications that wish to implement
routing. This handler strips any such duplicated path.
IIS can be configured to pass the correct , but this causes
another bug where  is wrong. Luckily this variable is
rarely used and is not guaranteed by WSGI. On IIS<7, though, the
setting can only be made on a vhost level, affecting all other script
mappings, many of which break when exposed to the  bug.
For this reason IIS<7 is almost never deployed with the fix. (Even IIS7
rarely uses it because there is still no UI for it.)
There is no way for CGI code to tell whether the option was set, so a
separate handler class is provided.  It is used in the same way as
, i.e., by calling , where
 is the WSGI application object you wish to invoke.

New in version 3.2.
