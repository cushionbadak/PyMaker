class ¶


(x, y)¶
Returns the name of the element at position x y, or the empty string
if the point does not lie within any element.
x and y are pixel coordinates relative to the widget.



(statespec, callback=None, *args, **kw)¶
Test the widget’s state. If a callback is not specified, returns 
if the widget state matches statespec and  otherwise. If callback
is specified then it is called with args if widget state matches
statespec.



(statespec=None)¶
Modify or inquire widget state. If statespec is specified, sets the
widget state according to it and return a new statespec indicating
which flags were changed. If statespec is not specified, returns
the currently-enabled state flags.

statespec will usually be a list or a tuple.
