Comparison with ¶
There are fundamental differences between the pickle protocols and
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation):

JSON is a text serialization format (it outputs unicode text, although
most of the time it is then encoded to ), while pickle is
a binary serialization format;
JSON is human-readable, while pickle is not;
JSON is interoperable and widely used outside of the Python ecosystem,
while pickle is Python-specific;
JSON, by default, can only represent a subset of the Python built-in
types, and no custom classes; pickle can represent an extremely large
number of Python types (many of them automatically, by clever usage
of Python’s introspection facilities; complex cases can be tackled by
implementing specific object APIs).

serialization and deserialization.
