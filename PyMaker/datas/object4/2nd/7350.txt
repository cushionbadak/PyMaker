docs:


class (allow_none=False, encoding=None, use_builtin_types=False)Â¶
Create a new instance to handle XML-RPC requests in a CGI environment.  The
allow_none and encoding parameters are passed on to 
and control the XML-RPC responses that will be returned from the server.
The use_builtin_types parameter is passed to the
 function and controls which types are processed
when date/times values or binary data are received; it defaults to false.

Changed in version 3.3: The use_builtin_types flag was added.
