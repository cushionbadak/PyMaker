Maximum key value



On VT100s and their software emulations, such as X terminal emulators, there are
normally at least four function keys (, ,
, ) available, and the arrow keys mapped to
, ,  and  in
the obvious way.  If your machine has a PC keyboard, it is safe to expect arrow
keys and twelve function keys (older PC keyboards may have only ten function
keys); also, the following keypad mappings are standard:






Keycap
Constant



Insert
KEY_IC

Delete
KEY_DC

Home
KEY_HOME

End
KEY_END

Page Up
KEY_PPAGE

Page Down
KEY_NPAGE



The following table lists characters from the alternate character set. These are
inherited from the VT100 terminal, and will generally be  available on software
emulations such as X terminals.  When there is no graphic available, curses
falls back on a crude printable ASCII approximation.

Note
These are available only after  has  been called.
