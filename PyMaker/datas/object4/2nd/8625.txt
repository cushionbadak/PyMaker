 is a module level variable that controls the way mock objects
respond to  (only for Python 2.6 or more recent). The default is ,
which uses the filtering described below, to only show useful members. If you
dislike this filtering, or need to switch it off for diagnostic purposes, then
set .
With filtering on,  shows only useful attributes and will
include any dynamically created attributes that wouldn’t normally be shown.
If the mock was created with a spec (or autospec of course) then all the
attributes from the original are shown, even if they haven’t been accessed
yet:


Many of the not-very-useful (private to  rather than the thing being
mocked) underscore and double underscore prefixed attributes have been
filtered from the result of calling  on a . If you dislike this
behaviour you can switch it off by setting the module level switch
:


Alternatively you can just use  (instance members) and
 (type members) to bypass the filtering irrespective of
.
