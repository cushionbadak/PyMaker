class ¶
A  subclass that walks the abstract syntax tree and
allows modification of nodes.
The  will walk the AST and use the return value of
the visitor methods to replace or remove the old node.  If the return value
of the visitor method is , the node will be removed from its
location, otherwise it is replaced with the return value.  The return value
may be the original node in which case no replacement takes place.
Here is an example transformer that rewrites all occurrences of name lookups

method for the node first.
For nodes that were part of a collection of statements (that applies to all
statement nodes), the visitor may also return a list of nodes rather than
just a single node.
Usually you use the transformer like this:
