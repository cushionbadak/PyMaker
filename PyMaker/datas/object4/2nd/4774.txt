docs:


coroutine ()Â¶
Schedule all currently open asynchronous generator objects to
close with an  call.  After calling this method,
the event loop will issue a warning if a new asynchronous generator
is iterated. This should be used to reliably finalize all scheduled
asynchronous generators.
Note that there is no need to call this function when
 is used.
Example:



New in version 3.6.
