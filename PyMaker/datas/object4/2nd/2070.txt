(mode=0o666, exist_ok=True)¶
Create a file at this given path.  If mode is given, it is combined
with the process’  value to determine the file mode and access
flags.  If the file already exists, the function succeeds if exist_ok
is true (and its modification time is updated to the current time),
otherwise  is raised.
