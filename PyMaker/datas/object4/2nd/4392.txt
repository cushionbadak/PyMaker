Address FormatsÂ¶

An  address is a tuple of the form  where
hostname is a string and port is an integer.
An  address is a string representing a filename on the
filesystem.

An  address is a string of the form
.  To use  to connect to a named
pipe on a remote computer called ServerName one should use an address of the
form  instead.



Note that any string beginning with two backslashes is assumed by default to be
an  address rather than an  address.
