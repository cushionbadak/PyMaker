(sub[, start[, end]])¶

(sub[, start[, end]])¶
Return the lowest index in the data where the subsequence sub is found,
such that sub is contained in the slice .  Optional
arguments start and end are interpreted as in slice notation.  Return
 if sub is not found.
The subsequence to search for may be any bytes-like object or an
integer in the range 0 to 255.

Note
The  method should be used only if you need to know the
position of sub.  To check if sub is a substring or not, use the
 operator:




Changed in version 3.3: Also accept an integer in the range 0 to 255 as the subsequence.
