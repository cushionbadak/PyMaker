docs:


(prefix, uri)Â¶
Begin the scope of a prefix-URI Namespace mapping.
The information from this event is not necessary for normal Namespace
processing: the SAX XML reader will automatically replace prefixes for element
and attribute names when the  feature is enabled (the
default).
There are cases, however, when applications need to use prefixes in character
data or in attribute values, where they cannot safely be expanded automatically;
the  and  events supply the
information to the application to expand prefixes in those contexts itself, if
necessary.
Note that  and  events are not
guaranteed to be properly nested relative to each-other: all
 events will occur before the corresponding
 event, and all  events will occur
after the corresponding  event, but their order is not
guaranteed.
