docs:


()Â¶
Returns the message for this  instance after merging any
user-supplied arguments with the message. If the user-supplied message
argument to the logging call is not a string,  is called on it to
convert it to a string. This allows use of user-defined classes as
messages, whose  method can return the actual format string to
be used.
