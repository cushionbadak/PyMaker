(sequence)Â¶
This function accepts a parse tree represented as a sequence and builds an
internal representation if possible.  If it can validate that the tree conforms
to the Python grammar and all nodes are valid node types in the host version of
Python, an ST object is created from the internal representation and returned
to the called.  If there is a problem creating the internal representation, or
if the tree cannot be validated, a  exception is raised.  An
ST object created this way should not be assumed to compile correctly; normal
exceptions raised by compilation may still be initiated when the ST object is
passed to .  This may indicate problems not related to syntax
(such as a  exception), but may also be due to constructs such
as the result of parsing , which escapes the Python parser but is
checked by the bytecode compiler.
Sequences representing terminal tokens may be represented as either two-element
lists of the form  or as three-element lists of the form .  If the third element is present, it is assumed to be a valid
line number.  The line number may be specified for any subset of the terminal
symbols in the input tree.
