IncrementalDecoder Objects¶
The  class is used for decoding an input in multiple
steps. It defines the following methods which every incremental decoder must
define in order to be compatible with the Python codec registry.


class (errors='strict')¶
Constructor for an  instance.
All incremental decoders must provide this constructor interface. They are free
to add additional keyword arguments, but only the ones defined here are used by
the Python codec registry.
The  may implement different error handling schemes
by providing the errors keyword argument. See Error Handlers for
possible values.
The errors argument will be assigned to an attribute of the same name.
Assigning to this attribute makes it possible to switch between different error
handling strategies during the lifetime of the 
object.


(object[, final])¶
Decodes object (taking the current state of the decoder into account)
and returns the resulting decoded object. If this is the last call to
 final must be true (the default is false). If final is
true the decoder must decode the input completely and must flush all
buffers. If this isn’t possible (e.g. because of incomplete byte sequences
at the end of the input) it must initiate error handling just like in the
stateless case (which might raise an exception).



()¶
Reset the decoder to the initial state.



()¶
Return the current state of the decoder. This must be a tuple with two
items, the first must be the buffer containing the still undecoded
input. The second must be an integer and can be additional state
info. (The implementation should make sure that  is the most common
additional state info.) If this additional state info is  it must be
possible to set the decoder to the state which has no input buffered and
 as the additional state info, so that feeding the previously
buffered input to the decoder returns it to the previous state without
producing any output. (Additional state info that is more complicated than
integers can be converted into an integer by marshaling/pickling the info
and encoding the bytes of the resulting string into an integer.)



(state)¶
Set the state of the decoder to state. state must be a decoder state
returned by .
