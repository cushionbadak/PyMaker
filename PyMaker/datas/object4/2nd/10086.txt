¶
Pops exception type and result of ‘exit’ function call from the stack.
If the stack represents an exception, and the function call returns a
‘true’ value, this information is “zapped” and replaced with a single
 to prevent  from re-raising the
exception.  (But non-local gotos will still be resumed.)
