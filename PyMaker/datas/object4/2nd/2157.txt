Â¶
Set-group-ID bit.  This bit has several special uses.  For a directory
it indicates that BSD semantics is to be used for that directory:
files created there inherit their group ID from the directory, not
from the effective group ID of the creating process, and directories
created there will also get the  bit set.  For a
file that does not have the group execution bit ()
set, the set-group-ID bit indicates mandatory file/record locking
(see also ).
