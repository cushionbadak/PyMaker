(mapping, **kwds)¶
Like , except that if placeholders are missing from
mapping and kwds, instead of raising a  exception, the
original placeholder will appear in the resulting string intact.  Also,
unlike with , any other appearances of the  will
simply return  instead of raising .
While other exceptions may still occur, this method is called “safe”
because it always tries to return a usable string instead of
raising an exception.  In another sense,  may be
anything other than safe, since it will silently ignore malformed
templates containing dangling delimiters, unmatched braces, or
placeholders that are not valid Python identifiers.
