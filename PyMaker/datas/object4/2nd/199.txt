¶
 is optional. If set, this attribute’s value must be a
string.  The import system may opt to leave  unset if it
has no semantic meaning (e.g. a module loaded from a database).
If  is set, it may also be appropriate to set the
 attribute which is the path to any compiled version of
the code (e.g. byte-compiled file). The file does not need to exist
to set this attribute; the path can simply point to where the
compiled file would exist (see PEP 3147).
It is also appropriate to set  when  is not
set.  However, that scenario is quite atypical.  Ultimately, the
loader is what makes use of  and/or .  So
if a loader can load from a cached module but otherwise does not load
from a file, that atypical scenario may be appropriate.
