(block=True, timeout=None)Â¶

raises the  exception if no item was available within that time.
Otherwise (block is false), return an item if one is immediately available,
else raise the  exception (timeout is ignored in that case).
Prior to 3.0 on POSIX systems, and for all versions on Windows, if
block is true and timeout is , this operation goes into
an uninterruptible wait on an underlying lock. This means that no exceptions
can occur, and in particular a SIGINT will not trigger a .
