docs:


(str)Â¶
Interpret the argument as though it had been typed in response to the prompt.
This may be overridden, but should not normally need to be; see the
 and  methods for useful execution hooks.  The
return value is a flag indicating whether interpretation of commands by the
interpreter should stop.  If there is a  method for the command
str, the return value of that method is returned, otherwise the return value
from the  method is returned.
