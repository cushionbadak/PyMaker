This example compares two strings, considering blanks to be “junk”:


 returns a float in [0, 1], measuring the similarity of the

Note that the last tuple returned by  is always a
dummy, , and this is the only case in which the last
tuple element (number of elements matched) is .
If you want to know how to change the first sequence into the second, use
