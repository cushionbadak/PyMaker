(cert, hostname)Â¶
Verify that cert (in decoded format as returned by
) matches the given hostname.  The rules
applied are those for checking the identity of HTTPS servers as outlined
in RFC 2818, RFC 5280 and RFC 6125.  In addition to HTTPS, this
function should be suitable for checking the identity of servers in
various SSL-based protocols such as FTPS, IMAPS, POPS and others.
 is raised on failure. On success, the function
returns nothing:



New in version 3.2.


Changed in version 3.3.3: The function now follows RFC 6125, section 6.4.3 and does neither
match multiple wildcards (e.g.  or ) nor
a wildcard inside an internationalized domain names (IDN) fragment.
IDN A-labels such as  are still supported,
but  no longer matches .


Changed in version 3.5: Matching of IP addresses, when present in the subjectAltName field
of the certificate, is now supported.


Changed in version 3.7: The function is no longer used to TLS connections. Hostname matching
is now performed by OpenSSL.
Allow wildcard when it is the leftmost and the only character
in that segment. Partial wildcards like  are no
longer supported.


Deprecated since version 3.7.
