docs:


([backlog])Â¶
Enable a server to accept connections.  If backlog is specified, it must
be at least 0 (if it is lower, it is set to 0); it specifies the number of
unaccepted connections that the system will allow before refusing new
connections. If not specified, a default reasonable value is chosen.

Changed in version 3.5: The backlog parameter is now optional.
