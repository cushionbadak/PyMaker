docs:


(parent, index, iid=None, **kw)¶
Creates a new item and returns the item identifier of the newly created
item.
parent is the item ID of the parent item, or the empty string to create
a new top-level item. index is an integer, or the value “end”,
specifying where in the list of parent’s children to insert the new item.
If index is less than or equal to zero, the new node is inserted at
the beginning; if index is greater than or equal to the current number
of children, it is inserted at the end. If iid is specified, it is used
as the item identifier; iid must not already exist in the tree.
Otherwise, a new unique identifier is generated.
See Item Options for the list of available points.
