Reading and writing compressed files¶


(filename, mode="rb", *, format=None, check=-1, preset=None, filters=None, encoding=None, errors=None, newline=None)¶
Open an LZMA-compressed file in binary or text mode, returning a file
object.
The filename argument can be either an actual file name (given as a
,  or path-like object), in
which case the named file is opened, or it can be an existing file object
to read from or write to.
The mode argument can be any of , , , ,
, ,  or  for binary mode, or ,
, , or  for text mode. The default is .
When opening a file for reading, the format and filters arguments have
the same meanings as for . In this case, the check
and preset arguments should not be used.
When opening a file for writing, the format, check, preset and
filters arguments have the same meanings as for .
For binary mode, this function is equivalent to the 
constructor: . In this case, the encoding,
errors and newline arguments must not be provided.
For text mode, a  object is created, and wrapped in an
 instance with the specified encoding, error
handling behavior, and line ending(s).

Changed in version 3.4: Added support for the ,  and  modes.


Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a path-like object.




class (filename=None, mode="r", *, format=None, check=-1, preset=None, filters=None)¶
Open an LZMA-compressed file in binary mode.
An  can wrap an already-open file object, or operate
directly on a named file. The filename argument specifies either the file
object to wrap, or the name of the file to open (as a ,
 or path-like object). When wrapping an
existing file object, the wrapped file will not be closed when the
 is closed.
The mode argument can be either  for reading (default),  for
overwriting,  for exclusive creation, or  for appending. These
can equivalently be given as , ,  and 
respectively.
If filename is a file object (rather than an actual file name), a mode of
 does not truncate the file, and is instead equivalent to .
When opening a file for reading, the input file may be the concatenation of
multiple separate compressed streams. These are transparently decoded as a
single logical stream.
When opening a file for reading, the format and filters arguments have
the same meanings as for . In this case, the check
and preset arguments should not be used.
When opening a file for writing, the format, check, preset and
filters arguments have the same meanings as for .
 supports all the members specified by
, except for  and .
Iteration and the  statement are supported.
The following method is also provided:


(size=-1)¶
Return buffered data without advancing the file position. At least one
byte of data will be returned, unless EOF has been reached. The exact
number of bytes returned is unspecified (the size argument is ignored).

Note
While calling  does not change the file position of
the , it may change the position of the underlying
file object (e.g. if the  was constructed by passing a
file object for filename).



Changed in version 3.4: Added support for the  and  modes.


Changed in version 3.5: The  method now accepts an argument of
.


Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a path-like object.
