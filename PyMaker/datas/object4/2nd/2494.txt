(De)compression of files¶


(filename, mode='r', compresslevel=9, encoding=None, errors=None, newline=None)¶
Open a bzip2-compressed file in binary or text mode, returning a file
object.
As with the constructor for , the filename argument can be
an actual filename (a  or  object), or an existing
file object to read from or write to.
The mode argument can be any of , , , ,
, ,  or  for binary mode, or ,
, , or  for text mode. The default is .
The compresslevel argument is an integer from 1 to 9, as for the
 constructor.
For binary mode, this function is equivalent to the 
constructor: . In
this case, the encoding, errors and newline arguments must not be
provided.
For text mode, a  object is created, and wrapped in an
 instance with the specified encoding, error
handling behavior, and line ending(s).

New in version 3.3.


Changed in version 3.4: The  (exclusive creation) mode was added.


Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a path-like object.




class (filename, mode='r', buffering=None, compresslevel=9)¶
Open a bzip2-compressed file in binary mode.
If filename is a  or  object, open the named file
directly. Otherwise, filename should be a file object, which will
be used to read or write the compressed data.
The mode argument can be either  for reading (default),  for
overwriting,  for exclusive creation, or  for appending. These
can equivalently be given as , ,  and 
respectively.
If filename is a file object (rather than an actual file name), a mode of
 does not truncate the file, and is instead equivalent to .
The buffering argument is ignored. Its use is deprecated.
If mode is  or , compresslevel can be an integer between
 and  specifying the level of compression:  produces the
least compression, and  (default) produces the most compression.
If mode is , the input file may be the concatenation of multiple
compressed streams.
 provides all of the members specified by the
, except for  and .
Iteration and the  statement are supported.
 also provides the following method:


([n])¶
Return buffered data without advancing the file position. At least one
byte of data will be returned (unless at EOF). The exact number of bytes
returned is unspecified.

Note
While calling  does not change the file position of
the , it may change the position of the underlying file
object (e.g. if the  was constructed by passing a file
object for filename).


New in version 3.3.



Changed in version 3.1: Support for the  statement was added.


Changed in version 3.3: The , , , ,
 and  methods were added.


Changed in version 3.3: Support was added for filename being a file object instead of an
actual filename.


Changed in version 3.3: The  (append) mode was added, along with support for reading
multi-stream files.


Changed in version 3.4: The  (exclusive creation) mode was added.


Changed in version 3.5: The  method now accepts an argument of
.


Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a path-like object.
