docs:


(timeout=None)Â¶
Wait until notified or until a timeout occurs. If the calling thread has
not acquired the lock when this method is called, a  is
raised.
This method releases the underlying lock, and then blocks until it is
awakened by a  or  call for the same
condition variable in another thread, or until the optional timeout
occurs.  Once awakened or timed out, it re-acquires the lock and returns.
When the timeout argument is present and not , it should be a
floating point number specifying a timeout for the operation in seconds
(or fractions thereof).
When the underlying lock is an , it is not released using
its  method, since this may not actually unlock the lock
when it was acquired multiple times recursively.  Instead, an internal
interface of the  class is used, which really unlocks it
even when it has been recursively acquired several times. Another internal
interface is then used to restore the recursion level when the lock is
reacquired.
The return value is  unless a given timeout expired, in which
case it is .

Changed in version 3.2: Previously, the method always returned .
