descriptionÂ¶
Most calls to the  constructor will use the
 keyword argument.  This argument gives a brief description of
what the program does and how it works.  In help messages, the description is

various arguments:


By default, the description will be line-wrapped so that it fits within the
given space.  To change this behavior, see the formatter_class argument.
