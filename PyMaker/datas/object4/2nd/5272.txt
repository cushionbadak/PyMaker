docs:


¶
Enable TLS 1.3 post-handshake client authentication. Post-handshake auth
is disabled by default and a server can only request a TLS client
certificate during the initial handshake. When enabled, a server may
request a TLS client certificate at any time after the handshake.
When enabled on client-side sockets, the client signals the server that
it supports post-handshake authentication.
When enabled on server-side sockets,  must
be set to  or , too. The
actual client cert exchange is delayed until
 is called and some I/O is
performed.

Note
Only available with OpenSSL 1.1.1 and TLS 1.3 enabled. Without TLS 1.3
support, the property value is None and can’t be modified


New in version 3.7.1.
