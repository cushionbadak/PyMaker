()¶
Tests grouped by a  are always accessed by iteration.
Subclasses can lazily provide tests by overriding . Note
that this method may be called several times on a single suite (for
example when counting tests or comparing for equality) so the tests
returned by repeated iterations before  must be the
same for each call iteration. After , callers should
not rely on the tests returned by this method unless the caller uses a
subclass that overrides  to preserve
test references.

Changed in version 3.2: In earlier versions the  accessed tests directly rather
than through iteration, so overriding  wasn’t sufficient
for providing tests.


Changed in version 3.4: In earlier versions the  held references to each
 after . Subclasses can restore
that behavior by overriding .
