docs:


(failobj=None)Â¶
Return a list containing the character set names in the message.  If the
message is a multipart, then the list will contain one element
for each subpart in the payload, otherwise, it will be a list of length 1.
Each item in the list will be a string which is the value of the
 parameter in the Content-Type header for the
represented subpart.  If the subpart has no Content-Type
header, no  parameter, or is not of the text main
MIME type, then that item in the returned list will be failobj.
