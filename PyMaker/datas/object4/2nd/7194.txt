docs:


(code, message=None)Â¶
Adds a response header to the headers buffer and logs the accepted
request. The HTTP response line is written to the internal buffer,
followed by Server and Date headers. The values for these two headers
are picked up from the  and
 methods, respectively. If the server does not
intend to send any other headers using the  method,
then  should be followed by an 
call.

Changed in version 3.3: Headers are stored to an internal buffer and 
needs to be called explicitly.
