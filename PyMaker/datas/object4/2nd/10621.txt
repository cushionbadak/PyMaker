How do I find a module or application to perform task X?¶
Check the Library Reference to see if there’s a relevant
standard library module.  (Eventually you’ll learn what’s in the standard
library and will be able to skip this step.)
For third-party packages, search the Python Package Index or try Google or
another Web search engine.  Searching for “Python” plus a keyword or two for
your topic of interest will usually find something helpful.
