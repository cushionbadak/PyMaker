()¶
Discard all session cookies.
Discards all contained cookies that have a true  attribute
(usually because they had either no  or  cookie-attribute,
or an explicit  cookie-attribute).  For interactive browsers, the end
of a session usually corresponds to closing the browser window.
Note that the  method won’t save session cookies anyway, unless you
ask otherwise by passing a true ignore_discard argument.
