Differ Objects¶
Note that -generated deltas make no claim to be minimal
diffs. To the contrary, minimal diffs are often counter-intuitive, because they
synch up anywhere possible, sometimes accidental matches 100 pages apart.
Restricting synch points to contiguous matches preserves some notion of
locality, at the occasional cost of producing a longer diff.
The  class has this constructor:


class (linejunk=None, charjunk=None)
Optional keyword parameters linejunk and charjunk are for filter functions
(or ):
linejunk: A function that accepts a single string argument, and returns true
if the string is junk.  The default is , meaning that no line is
considered junk.
charjunk: A function that accepts a single character argument (a string of
length 1), and returns true if the character is junk. The default is ,
meaning that no character is considered junk.
These junk-filtering functions speed up matching to find
differences and do not cause any differing lines or characters to
be ignored.  Read the description of the
 method’s isjunk
parameter for an explanation.
 objects are used (deltas generated) via a single method:


(a, b)¶
Compare two sequences of lines, and generate the delta (a sequence of lines).
Each sequence must contain individual single-line strings ending with
newlines.  Such sequences can be obtained from the
 method of file-like objects.  The delta
generated also consists of newline-terminated strings, ready to be
printed as-is via the  method of a
file-like object.
