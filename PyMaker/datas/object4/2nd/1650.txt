docs:


(f)¶
Classmethod that converts a float to a decimal number, exactly.
Note Decimal.from_float(0.1) is not the same as Decimal(‘0.1’).
Since 0.1 is not exactly representable in binary floating point, the
value is stored as the nearest representable value which is
0x1.999999999999ap-4.  That equivalent value in decimal is
0.1000000000000000055511151231257827021181583404541015625.
