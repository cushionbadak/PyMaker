(input=None, timeout=None)¶
Interact with process: Send data to stdin.  Read data from stdout and stderr,
until end-of-file is reached.  Wait for process to terminate.  The optional
input argument should be data to be sent to the child process, or
, if no data should be sent to the child.  If streams were opened in
text mode, input must be a string.  Otherwise, it must be bytes.
 returns a tuple .
The data will be strings if streams were opened in text mode; otherwise,
bytes.
Note that if you want to send data to the process’s stdin, you need to create
the Popen object with .  Similarly, to get anything other than
 in the result tuple, you need to give  and/or
 too.
If the process does not terminate after timeout seconds, a
 exception will be raised.  Catching this exception and
retrying communication will not lose any output.
The child process is not killed if the timeout expires, so in order to
cleanup properly a well-behaved application should kill the child process and
finish communication:



Note
The data read is buffered in memory, so do not use this method if the data
size is large or unlimited.


Changed in version 3.3: timeout was added.
