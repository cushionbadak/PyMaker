docs:


(f=None, limit=None, file=None)Â¶
Print up to limit stack trace entries (starting from the invocation
point) if limit is positive.  Otherwise, print the last 
entries.  If limit is omitted or , all entries are printed.
The optional f argument can be used to specify an alternate stack frame
to start.  The optional file argument has the same meaning as for
.

Changed in version 3.5: Added negative limit support.
