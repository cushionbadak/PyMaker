(address[, timeout[, source_address]])¶
Connect to a TCP service listening on the Internet address (a 2-tuple
), and return the socket object.  This is a higher-level
function than : if host is a non-numeric hostname,
it will try to resolve it for both  and ,
and then try to connect to all possible addresses in turn until a
connection succeeds.  This makes it easy to write clients that are
compatible to both IPv4 and IPv6.
Passing the optional timeout parameter will set the timeout on the
socket instance before attempting to connect.  If no timeout is
supplied, the global default timeout setting returned by
 is used.
If supplied, source_address must be a 2-tuple  for the
socket to bind to as its source address before connecting.  If host or port
are ‘’ or 0 respectively the OS default behavior will be used.

Changed in version 3.2: source_address was added.
