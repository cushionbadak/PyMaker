(fullname, ddir=None, force=False, rx=None, quiet=0, legacy=False, optimize=-1, invalidation_mode=py_compile.PycInvalidationMode.TIMESTAMP)Â¶
Compile the file with path fullname. Return a true value if the file
compiled successfully, and a false value otherwise.
If ddir is given, it is prepended to the path to the file being compiled
for use in compilation time tracebacks, and is also compiled in to the
byte-code file, where it will be used in tracebacks and other messages in
cases where the source file does not exist at the time the byte-code file is
executed.
If rx is given, its search method is passed the full path name to the
file being compiled, and if it returns a true value, the file is not
compiled and  is returned.
If quiet is  or  (the default), the filenames and other
information are printed to standard out. Set to , only errors are
printed. Set to , all output is suppressed.
If legacy is true, byte-code files are written to their legacy locations
and names, which may overwrite byte-code files created by another version of
Python.  The default is to write files to their PEP 3147 locations and
names, which allows byte-code files from multiple versions of Python to
coexist.
optimize specifies the optimization level for the compiler.  It is passed to
the built-in  function.
invalidation_mode should be a member of the
 enum and controls how the generated
pycs are invalidated at runtime.

New in version 3.2.


Changed in version 3.5: quiet parameter was changed to a multilevel value.


Changed in version 3.5: The legacy parameter only writes out  files, not  files
no matter what the value of optimize is.


Changed in version 3.7: The invalidation_mode parameter was added.
