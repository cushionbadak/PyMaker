Module Functions¶
The  module defines the following functions:


(word, salt=None)¶
word will usually be a user’s password as typed at a prompt or  in a graphical
interface.  The optional salt is either a string as returned from
, one of the  values (though not all
may be available on all platforms), or a full encrypted password
including salt, as returned by this function.  If salt is not
provided, the strongest method will be used (as returned by
).
Checking a password is usually done by passing the plain-text password
as word and the full results of a previous  call,
which should be the same as the results of this call.
salt (either a random 2 or 16 character string, possibly prefixed with
 to indicate the method) which will be used to perturb the
encryption algorithm.  The characters in salt must be in the set
, with the exception of Modular Crypt Format which
prefixes a .
Returns the hashed password as a string, which will be composed of
characters from the same alphabet as the salt.
Since a few crypt(3) extensions allow different values, with
different sizes in the salt, it is recommended to use  the full crypted
password as salt when checking for a password.

Changed in version 3.3: Accept  values in addition to strings for salt.




(method=None, *, rounds=None)¶
Return a randomly generated salt of the specified method.  If no
method is given, the strongest method available as returned by
 is used.
The return value is a string suitable for passing as the salt argument
to .
rounds specifies the number of rounds for ,
 and .
For  and  it must be an integer between
 and , the default is .  For
 it must be a power of two between  (24)
and  (231), the default is 
(212).

New in version 3.3.


Changed in version 3.7: Added the rounds parameter.
