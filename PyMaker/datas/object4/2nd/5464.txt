docs:


([offset[, size]])Â¶
Flushes changes made to the in-memory copy of a file back to disk. Without
use of this call there is no guarantee that changes are written back before
the object is destroyed.  If offset and size are specified, only
changes to the given range of bytes will be flushed to disk; otherwise, the
whole extent of the mapping is flushed.  offset must be a multiple of the
 or .
(Windows version) A nonzero value returned indicates success; zero
indicates failure.
(Unix version) A zero value is returned to indicate success. An
exception is raised when the call failed.
