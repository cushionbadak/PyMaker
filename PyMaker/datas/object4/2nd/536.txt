()¶

()¶
Return a copy of the sequence with all the uppercase ASCII characters
converted to their corresponding lowercase counterpart.
For example:


Lowercase ASCII characters are those byte values in the sequence

Note
The bytearray version of this method does not operate in place - it
always produces a new object, even if no changes were made.
