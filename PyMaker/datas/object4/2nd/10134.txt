docs:


(argc)Â¶
Calls a callable object with positional (if any) and keyword arguments.
argc indicates the total number of positional and keyword arguments.
The top element on the stack contains a tuple of keyword argument names.
Below that are keyword arguments in the order corresponding to the tuple.
Below that are positional arguments, with the right-most parameter on
top.  Below the arguments is a callable object to call.
 pops all arguments and the callable object off the stack,
calls the callable object with those arguments, and pushes the return value
returned by the callable object.

Changed in version 3.6: Keyword arguments are packed in a tuple instead of a dictionary,
argc indicates the total number of arguments.
