docs:


exception Â¶
Raised when an operation or function is applied to an object of inappropriate
type.  The associated value is a string giving details about the type mismatch.
This exception may be raised by user code to indicate that an attempted
operation on an object is not supported, and is not meant to be. If an object
is meant to support a given operation but has not yet provided an
implementation,  is the proper exception to raise.
Passing arguments of the wrong type (e.g. passing a  when an
 is expected) should result in a , but passing
arguments with the wrong value (e.g. a number outside expected boundaries)
should result in a .
