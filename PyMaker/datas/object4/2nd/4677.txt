An asyncio lock can be used to guarantee exclusive access to a
shared resource.

This method waits until the lock is unlocked, sets it to
locked and returns .



()¶
Release the lock.
When the lock is locked, reset it to unlocked and return.
If the lock is unlocked, a  is raised.



()¶
Return  if the lock is locked.
