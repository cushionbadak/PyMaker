Module Contents¶
The  contains the following functions:


(name, factory)¶
Register the factory function with the name name.  The factory function
should return an object which implements the 
interface.  The factory function can return the same object every time, or a new
one for each call, as appropriate for the specific implementation (e.g. if that
implementation supports some customization).



(name=None, features=())¶
Return a suitable DOM implementation. The name is either well-known, the
module name of a DOM implementation, or . If it is not , imports
the corresponding module and returns a  object if the
import succeeds.  If no name is given, and if the environment variable
 is set, this variable is used to find the implementation.
If name is not given, this examines the available implementations to find one
with the required feature set.  If no implementation can be found, raise an
.  The features list must be a sequence of  pairs which are passed to the  method on available
 objects.

Some convenience constants are also provided:


¶
The value used to indicate that no namespace is associated with a node in the
DOM.  This is typically found as the  of a node, or used as
the namespaceURI parameter to a namespaces-specific method.



¶
The namespace URI associated with the reserved prefix , as defined by
Namespaces in XML (section 4).



¶
The namespace URI for namespace declarations, as defined by Document Object
Model (DOM) Level 2 Core Specification (section 1.1.8).



¶
The URI of the XHTML namespace as defined by XHTML 1.0: The Extensible
HyperText Markup Language (section 3.1.1).

In addition,  contains a base  class and the DOM
exception classes.  The  class provided by this module does not
implement any of the methods or attributes defined by the DOM specification;
concrete DOM implementations must provide those.  The  class
provided as part of this module does provide the constants used for the
 attribute on concrete  objects; they are located
within the class rather than at the module level to conform with the DOM
specifications.
