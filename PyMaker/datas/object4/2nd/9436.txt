docs:


(obj)¶
Returns  if the object is currently tracked by the garbage collector,
 otherwise.  As a general rule, instances of atomic types aren’t
tracked and instances of non-atomic types (containers, user-defined
objects…) are.  However, some type-specific optimizations can be present
in order to suppress the garbage collector footprint of simple instances
(e.g. dicts containing only atomic keys and values):



New in version 3.1.
