Import resolution and custom importers¶
Import resolution, by default, uses the builtin  function
to do its importing. You may want to replace this with your own importing
mechanism: if so, you can replace the  attribute of the
 or its superclass, the
 class. However, you need to be
careful because of the way functions are accessed from classes via
descriptors. If you are using a Python callable to do your imports, and you
want to define it at class level rather than instance level, you need to wrap
it with . For example:


You don’t need to wrap with  if you’re setting the import
callable on a configurator instance.
