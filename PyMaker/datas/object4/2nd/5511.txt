docs:


(boundary)Â¶
Set the  parameter of the Content-Type header to
boundary.   will always quote boundary if
necessary.  A  is raised if the
message object has no Content-Type header.
Note that using this method is subtly different from deleting the old
Content-Type header and adding a new one with the new
boundary via , because  preserves
the order of the Content-Type header in the list of
headers.
