Test cases¶


class (methodName='runTest')¶
Instances of the  class represent the logical test units
in the  universe.  This class is intended to be used as a base
class, with specific tests being implemented by concrete subclasses.  This class
implements the interface needed by the test runner to allow it to drive the
tests, and methods that the test code can use to check for and report various
kinds of failure.
Each instance of  will run a single base method: the method
named methodName.
In most uses of , you will neither change
the methodName nor reimplement the default  method.

Changed in version 3.2:  can be instantiated successfully without providing a
methodName. This makes it easier to experiment with 
from the interactive interpreter.

 instances provide three groups of methods: one group used
to run the test, another used by the test implementation to check conditions
and report failures, and some inquiry methods allowing information about the
test itself to be gathered.
Methods in the first group (running the test) are:


()¶
Method called to prepare the test fixture.  This is called immediately
before calling the test method; other than  or ,
any exception raised by this method will be considered an error rather than
a test failure. The default implementation does nothing.



()¶
Method called immediately after the test method has been called and the
result recorded.  This is called even if the test method raised an
exception, so the implementation in subclasses may need to be particularly
careful about checking internal state.  Any exception, other than
 or , raised by this method will be
considered an additional error rather than a test failure (thus increasing
the total number of reported errors). This method will only be called if
the  succeeds, regardless of the outcome of the test method.
The default implementation does nothing.



()¶
A class method called before tests in an individual class are run.
 is called with the class as the only argument
and must be decorated as a :


See Class and Module Fixtures for more details.

See Class and Module Fixtures for more details.

New in version 3.2.




(result=None)¶
Run the test, collecting the result into the  object
passed as result.  If result is omitted or , a temporary
result object is created (by calling the 
method) and used. The result object is returned to ’s
caller.
The same effect may be had by simply calling the 
instance.

Changed in version 3.3: Previous versions of  did not return the result. Neither did
calling an instance.




(reason)¶
Calling this during a test method or  skips the current
test.  See Skipping tests and expected failures for more information.

New in version 3.1.




(msg=None, **params)¶
Return a context manager which executes the enclosed code block as a
subtest.  msg and params are optional, arbitrary values which are
displayed whenever a subtest fails, allowing you to identify them
clearly.
A test case can contain any number of subtest declarations, and
they can be arbitrarily nested.
See Distinguishing test iterations using subtests for more information.

New in version 3.4.




()¶
Run the test without collecting the result.  This allows exceptions raised
by the test to be propagated to the caller, and can be used to support
running tests under a debugger.

The  class provides several assert methods to check for and
report failures.  The following table lists the most commonly used methods
(see the tables below for more assert methods):

All the assert methods accept a msg argument that, if specified, is used
as the error message on failure (see also ).
Note that the msg keyword argument can be passed to ,
, , 
only when they are used as a context manager.


(first, second, msg=None)¶
Test that first and second are equal.  If the values do not
compare equal, the test will fail.
In addition, if first and second are the exact same type and one of
list, tuple, dict, set, frozenset or str or any type that a subclass
registers with  the type-specific equality
function will be called in order to generate a more useful default
error message (see also the list of type-specific methods).

Changed in version 3.1: Added the automatic calling of type-specific equality function.


Changed in version 3.2:  added as the default type equality
function for comparing strings.




(first, second, msg=None)¶
Test that first and second are not equal.  If the values do
compare equal, the test will fail.



(expr, msg=None)¶

(expr, msg=None)¶
Test that expr is true (or false).
Note that this is equivalent to  and not to  (use  for the latter).  This method
should also be avoided when more specific methods are available (e.g.
 instead of ), because they
provide a better error message in case of failure.



(first, second, msg=None)¶

(first, second, msg=None)¶
Test that first and second evaluate (or don’t evaluate) to the
same object.

New in version 3.1.




(expr, msg=None)¶

(expr, msg=None)¶
Test that expr is (or is not) .

New in version 3.1.




(first, second, msg=None)¶

(first, second, msg=None)¶
Test that first is (or is not) in second.

New in version 3.1.




(obj, cls, msg=None)¶

(obj, cls, msg=None)¶
Test that obj is (or is not) an instance of cls (which can be a
class or a tuple of classes, as supported by ).
To check for the exact type, use .

New in version 3.2.


It is also possible to check the production of exceptions, warnings, and
log messages using the following methods:

(exception, callable, *args, **kwds)¶

(exception, *, msg=None)
Test that an exception is raised when callable is called with any
positional or keyword arguments that are also passed to
.  The test passes if exception is raised, is an
error if another exception is raised, or fails if no exception is raised.
To catch any of a group of exceptions, a tuple containing the exception
classes may be passed as exception.
If only the exception and possibly the msg arguments are given,
return a context manager so that the code under test can be written
inline rather than as a function:


When used as a context manager,  accepts the
additional keyword argument msg.
The context manager will store the caught exception object in its
 attribute.  This can be useful if the intention
is to perform additional checks on the exception raised:



Changed in version 3.1: Added the ability to use  as a context manager.


Changed in version 3.2: Added the  attribute.


Changed in version 3.3: Added the msg keyword argument when used as a context manager.




(exception, regex, callable, *args, **kwds)¶

(exception, regex, *, msg=None)
Like  but also tests that regex matches
on the string representation of the raised exception.  regex may be
a regular expression object or a string containing a regular expression
suitable for use by .  Examples:


or:



New in version 3.1: Added under the name .


Changed in version 3.2: Renamed to .


Changed in version 3.3: Added the msg keyword argument when used as a context manager.




(warning, callable, *args, **kwds)¶

(warning, *, msg=None)
Test that a warning is triggered when callable is called with any
positional or keyword arguments that are also passed to
.  The test passes if warning is triggered and
fails if it isn’t.  Any exception is an error.
To catch any of a group of warnings, a tuple containing the warning
classes may be passed as warnings.
If only the warning and possibly the msg arguments are given,
return a context manager so that the code under test can be written
inline rather than as a function:


When used as a context manager,  accepts the
additional keyword argument msg.
The context manager will store the caught warning object in its
 attribute, and the source line which triggered the
warnings in the  and  attributes.
This can be useful if the intention is to perform additional checks
on the warning caught:


This method works regardless of the warning filters in place when it
is called.

New in version 3.2.


Changed in version 3.3: Added the msg keyword argument when used as a context manager.




(warning, regex, callable, *args, **kwds)¶

(warning, regex, *, msg=None)
Like  but also tests that regex matches on the
message of the triggered warning.  regex may be a regular expression
object or a string containing a regular expression suitable for use
by .  Example:


or:



New in version 3.2.


Changed in version 3.3: Added the msg keyword argument when used as a context manager.




(logger=None, level=None)¶
A context manager to test that at least one message is logged on
the logger or one of its children, with at least the given
level.
If given, logger should be a  object or a
 giving the name of a logger.  The default is the root
logger, which will catch all messages.
If given, level should be either a numeric logging level or
its string equivalent (for example either  or
).  The default is .
The test passes if at least one message emitted inside the 
block matches the logger and level conditions, otherwise it fails.
The object returned by the context manager is a recording helper
which keeps tracks of the matching log messages.  It has two
attributes:


¶
A list of  objects of the matching
log messages.



¶
A list of  objects with the formatted output of
matching messages.

(first, second, places=7, msg=None, delta=None)¶

(first, second, places=7, msg=None, delta=None)¶
Test that first and second are approximately (or not approximately)
equal by computing the difference, rounding to the given number of
decimal places (default 7), and comparing to zero.  Note that these
methods round the values to the given number of decimal places (i.e.
like the  function) and not significant digits.
If delta is supplied instead of places then the difference
between first and second must be less or equal to (or greater than) delta.
Supplying both delta and places raises a .

Changed in version 3.2:  automatically considers almost equal objects
that compare equal.   automatically fails
if the objects compare equal.  Added the delta keyword argument.

(text, regex, msg=None)¶

(text, regex, msg=None)¶
Test that a regex search matches (or does not match) text.  In case
of failure, the error message will include the pattern and the text (or
the pattern and the part of text that unexpectedly matched).  regex
may be a regular expression object or a string containing a regular
expression suitable for use by .

New in version 3.1: Added under the name .


Changed in version 3.2: The method  has been renamed to
.


New in version 3.2: .


New in version 3.5: The name  is a deprecated alias
for .




(first, second, msg=None)¶
Test that sequence first contains the same elements as second,
regardless of their order. When they don’t, an error message listing the
differences between the sequences will be generated.
Duplicate elements are not ignored when comparing first and
second. It verifies whether each element has the same count in both
sequences. Equivalent to:

but works with sequences of unhashable objects as well.

New in version 3.2.


The  method dispatches the equality check for objects of
the same type to different type-specific methods.  These methods are already
implemented for most of the built-in types, but it’s also possible to
register new methods using :


(typeobj, function)¶
Registers a type-specific method called by  to check
if two objects of exactly the same typeobj (not subclasses) compare
equal.  function must take two positional arguments and a third msg=None
keyword argument just as  does.  It must raise
 when inequality
between the first two parameters is detected – possibly providing useful
information and explaining the inequalities in details in the error
message.

New in version 3.1.


The list of type-specific methods automatically used by

that it’s usually not necessary to invoke these methods directly.

(first, second, msg=None)¶
Test that the multiline string first is equal to the string second.
When not equal a diff of the two strings highlighting the differences
will be included in the error message. This method is used by default
when comparing strings with .

New in version 3.1.




(first, second, msg=None, seq_type=None)¶
Tests that two sequences are equal.  If a seq_type is supplied, both
first and second must be instances of seq_type or a failure will
be raised.  If the sequences are different an error message is
constructed that shows the difference between the two.
This method is not called directly by , but
it’s used to implement  and
.

New in version 3.1.




(first, second, msg=None)¶

(first, second, msg=None)¶
Tests that two lists or tuples are equal.  If not, an error message is
constructed that shows only the differences between the two.  An error
is also raised if either of the parameters are of the wrong type.
These methods are used by default when comparing lists or tuples with
.

New in version 3.1.




(first, second, msg=None)¶
Tests that two sets are equal.  If not, an error message is constructed
that lists the differences between the sets.  This method is used by
default when comparing sets or frozensets with .
Fails if either of first or second does not have a 
method.

New in version 3.1.




(first, second, msg=None)¶
Test that two dictionaries are equal.  If not, an error message is
constructed that shows the differences in the dictionaries. This
method will be used by default to compare dictionaries in
calls to .

New in version 3.1.


Finally the  provides the following methods and attributes:


(msg=None)¶
Signals a test failure unconditionally, with msg or  for
the error message.



¶
This class attribute gives the exception raised by the test method.  If a
test framework needs to use a specialized exception, possibly to carry
additional information, it must subclass this exception in order to “play
fair” with the framework.  The initial value of this attribute is
.



¶
This class attribute determines what happens when a custom failure message
is passed as the msg argument to an assertXYY call that fails.
 is the default value. In this case, the custom message is appended
to the end of the standard failure message.
When set to , the custom message replaces the standard message.
The class setting can be overridden in individual test methods by assigning
an instance attribute, self.longMessage, to  or  before
calling the assert methods.
The class setting gets reset before each test call.

New in version 3.1.




¶
This attribute controls the maximum length of diffs output by assert
methods that report diffs on failure. It defaults to 80*8 characters.
Assert methods affected by this attribute are
 (including all the sequence comparison
methods that delegate to it),  and
.
Setting  to  means that there is no maximum length of
diffs.

New in version 3.2.


Testing frameworks can use the following methods to collect information on
the test:


()¶
Return the number of tests represented by this test object.  For
 instances, this will always be .



()¶
Return an instance of the test result class that should be used for this
test case class (if no other result instance is provided to the
 method).
For  instances, this will always be an instance of
; subclasses of  should override this
as necessary.



()¶
Return a string identifying the specific test case.  This is usually the
full name of the test method, including the module and class name.



()¶
Returns a description of the test, or  if no description
has been provided.  The default implementation of this method
returns the first line of the test method’s docstring, if available,
or .

Changed in version 3.1: In 3.1 this was changed to add the test name to the short description
even in the presence of a docstring.  This caused compatibility issues
with unittest extensions and adding the test name was moved to the
 in Python 3.2.




(function, *args, **kwargs)¶
Add a function to be called after  to cleanup resources
used during the test. Functions will be called in reverse order to the
order they are added (LIFO).  They
are called with any arguments and keyword arguments passed into
 when they are added.
If  fails, meaning that  is not called,
then any cleanup functions added will still be called.

New in version 3.1.




()¶
This method is called unconditionally after , or
after  if  raises an exception.
It is responsible for calling all the cleanup functions added by
. If you need cleanup functions to be called
prior to  then you can call 
yourself.
 pops methods off the stack of cleanup
functions one at a time, so it can be called at any time.

New in version 3.1.





class (testFunc, setUp=None, tearDown=None, description=None)¶
This class implements the portion of the  interface which
allows the test runner to drive the test, but does not provide the methods
which test code can use to check and report errors.  This is used to create
test cases using legacy test code, allowing it to be integrated into a
-based test framework.


Deprecated aliases¶
