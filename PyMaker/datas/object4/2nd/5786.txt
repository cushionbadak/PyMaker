(msg, fp=None, level=0, include_default=False)¶
Prints an indented representation of the content types of the message object
structure.  For example:


Optional fp is a file-like object to print the output to.  It must be
suitable for Python’s  function.  level is used internally.
include_default, if true, prints the default type as well.
