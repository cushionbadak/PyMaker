docs:


(name=None)¶
Return a logger with the specified name or, if name is , return a
logger which is the root logger of the hierarchy. If specified, the name is
typically a dot-separated hierarchical name like ‘a’, ‘a.b’ or ‘a.b.c.d’.
Choice of these names is entirely up to the developer who is using logging.
All calls to this function with a given name return the same logger instance.
This means that logger instances never need to be passed between different parts
of an application.
