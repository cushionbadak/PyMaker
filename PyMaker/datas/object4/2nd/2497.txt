([n])Â¶
Return buffered data without advancing the file position. At least one
byte of data will be returned (unless at EOF). The exact number of bytes
returned is unspecified.

Note
While calling  does not change the file position of
the , it may change the position of the underlying file
object (e.g. if the  was constructed by passing a file
object for filename).


New in version 3.3.
