Footnotes



[1]Don’t confuse this with the  module





[2]This is why  functions cannot be pickled:  all
 functions share the same name:  .





[3]The exception raised will likely be an  or an
 but it could be something else.





[4]The  module uses this protocol for shallow and deep copying
operations.





[5]The limitation on alphanumeric characters is due to the fact
the persistent IDs, in protocol 0, are delimited by the newline
character.  Therefore if any kind of newline characters occurs in
persistent IDs, the resulting pickle will become unreadable.
