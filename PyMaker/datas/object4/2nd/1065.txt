Data Types¶
The modules described in this chapter provide a variety of specialized data
types such as dates and times, fixed-type arrays, heap queues, synchronized
queues, and sets.
Python also provides some built-in data types, in particular,
, ,  and , and
.  The  class is used to hold
Unicode strings, and the  class is used to hold binary data.
The following modules are documented in this chapter:
