docs:


(val, symbol=True, grouping=False, international=False)¶
Formats a number val according to the current  settings.
The returned string includes the currency symbol if symbol is true, which is
the default. If grouping is true (which is not the default), grouping is done
with the value. If international is true (which is not the default), the
international currency symbol is used.
Note that this function will not work with the ‘C’ locale, so you have to set a
locale via  first.
