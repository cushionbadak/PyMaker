docs:


¶
This constant is meant to be used with the detect_types parameter of the
 function.
Setting this makes the SQLite interface parse the column name for each column it
returns.  It will look for a string formed [mytype] in there, and then decide
that ‘mytype’ is the type of the column. It will try to find an entry of
‘mytype’ in the converters dictionary and then use the converter function found
there to return the value. The column name found in 
is only the first word of the column name, i.  e. if you use something like
 in your SQL, then we will parse out everything until the
first blank for the column name: the column name would simply be “x”.
