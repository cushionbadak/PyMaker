class (tag, attrib={}, **extra)¶
Element class.  This class defines the Element interface, and provides a
reference implementation of this interface.
The element name, attribute names, and attribute values can be either
bytestrings or Unicode strings.  tag is the element name.  attrib is
an optional dictionary, containing element attributes.  extra contains
additional attributes, given as keyword arguments.


¶
A string identifying what kind of data this element represents (the
element type, in other words).



¶

¶
These attributes can be used to hold additional data associated with
the element.  Their values are usually strings but may be any
application-specific object.  If the element is created from
an XML file, the text attribute holds either the text between
the element’s start tag and its first child or end tag, or , and
the tail attribute holds either the text between the element’s
end tag and the next tag, or .  For the XML data


the a element has  for both text and tail attributes,
the b element has text  and tail ,
the c element has text  and tail ,
and the d element has text  and tail .
To collect the inner text of an element, see , for
example .
Applications may store arbitrary objects in these attributes.



¶
A dictionary containing the element’s attributes.  Note that while the
attrib value is always a real mutable Python dictionary, an ElementTree
implementation may choose to use another internal representation, and
create the dictionary only if someone asks for it.  To take advantage of
such implementations, use the dictionary methods below whenever possible.

The following dictionary-like methods work on the element attributes.


()¶
Resets an element.  This function removes all subelements, clears all
attributes, and sets the text and tail attributes to .



(key, default=None)¶
Gets the element attribute named key.
Returns the attribute value, or default if the attribute was not found.



()¶
Returns the element attributes as a sequence of (name, value) pairs.  The
attributes are returned in an arbitrary order.



()¶
Returns the elements attribute names as a list.  The names are returned
in an arbitrary order.



(key, value)¶
Set the attribute key on the element to value.

The following methods work on the element’s children (subelements).


(subelement)¶
Adds the element subelement to the end of this element’s internal list
of subelements.  Raises  if subelement is not an
.



(subelements)¶
Appends subelements from a sequence object with zero or more elements.
Raises  if a subelement is not an .

New in version 3.2.




(match, namespaces=None)¶
Finds the first subelement matching match.  match may be a tag name
or a path.  Returns an element instance
or .  namespaces is an optional mapping from namespace prefix
to full name.



(match, namespaces=None)¶
Finds all matching subelements, by tag name or
path.  Returns a list containing all matching
elements in document order.  namespaces is an optional mapping from
namespace prefix to full name.



(match, default=None, namespaces=None)¶
Finds text for the first subelement matching match.  match may be
a tag name or a path.  Returns the text content
of the first matching element, or default if no element was found.
Note that if the matching element has no text content an empty string
is returned. namespaces is an optional mapping from namespace prefix
to full name.



()¶

Deprecated since version 3.2: Use  or iteration.




(tag=None)¶

Deprecated since version 3.2: Use method  instead.




(index, subelement)¶
Inserts subelement at the given position in this element.  Raises
 if subelement is not an .



(tag=None)¶
Creates a tree iterator with the current element as the root.
The iterator iterates over this element and all elements below it, in
document (depth first) order.  If tag is not  or , only
elements whose tag equals tag are returned from the iterator.  If the
tree structure is modified during iteration, the result is undefined.

New in version 3.2.




(match, namespaces=None)¶
Finds all matching subelements, by tag name or
path.  Returns an iterable yielding all
matching elements in document order. namespaces is an optional mapping
from namespace prefix to full name.

New in version 3.2.




()¶
Creates a text iterator.  The iterator loops over this element and all
subelements, in document order, and returns all inner text.

New in version 3.2.




(tag, attrib)¶
Creates a new element object of the same type as this element.  Do not
call this method, use the  factory function instead.



(subelement)¶
Removes subelement from the element.  Unlike the find* methods this
method compares elements based on the instance identity, not on tag value
or contents.

 objects also support the following sequence type methods
for working with subelements: ,
, ,
.
Caution: Elements with no subelements will test as .  This behavior
will change in future versions.  Use specific  or  test instead.
