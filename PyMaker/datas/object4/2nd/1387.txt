Weak Reference Objects¶
Weak reference objects have no methods and no attributes besides
. A weak reference object allows the referent to be
obtained, if it still exists, by calling it:


If the referent no longer exists, calling the reference object returns
:


Testing that a weak reference object is still live should be done using the
expression .  Normally, application code that needs to use
a reference object should follow this pattern:


Using a separate test for “liveness” creates race conditions in threaded
applications; another thread can cause a weak reference to become invalidated
before the weak reference is called; the idiom shown above is safe in threaded
applications as well as single-threaded applications.
Specialized versions of  objects can be created through subclassing.
This is used in the implementation of the  to reduce
the memory overhead for each entry in the mapping.  This may be most useful to
associate additional information with a reference, but could also be used to
insert additional processing on calls to retrieve the referent.
This example shows how a subclass of  can be used to store
additional information about an object and affect the value that’s returned when
the referent is accessed:
