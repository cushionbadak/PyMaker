docs:


(fd, family, type, proto=0)¶
Duplicate the file descriptor fd (an integer as returned by a file object’s
 method) and build a socket object from the result.  Address
family, socket type and protocol number are as for the  function
above. The file descriptor should refer to a socket, but this is not checked —
subsequent operations on the object may fail if the file descriptor is invalid.
This function is rarely needed, but can be used to get or set socket options on
a socket passed to a program as standard input or output (such as a server
started by the Unix inet daemon).  The socket is assumed to be in blocking mode.
The newly created socket is non-inheritable.

Changed in version 3.4: The returned socket is now non-inheritable.
