docs:


(encoding=None, namespace_separator=None)¶
Creates and returns a new  object.   encoding, if specified,
must be a string naming the encoding  used by the XML data.  Expat doesn’t
support as many encodings as Python does, and its repertoire of encodings can’t
be extended; it supports UTF-8, UTF-16, ISO-8859-1 (Latin1), and ASCII.  If
encoding [1] is given it will override the implicit or explicit encoding of the
document.
Expat can optionally do XML namespace processing for you, enabled by providing a
value for namespace_separator.  The value must be a one-character string; a
 will be raised if the string has an illegal length (
is considered the same as omission).  When namespace processing is enabled,
element type names and attribute names that belong to a namespace will be
expanded.  The element name passed to the element handlers
 and  will be the
concatenation of the namespace URI, the namespace separator character, and the
local part of the name.  If the namespace separator is a zero byte ()
then the namespace URI and the local part will be concatenated without any
separator.
For example, if namespace_separator is set to a space character () and
the following document is parsed:


 will receive the following strings for each
element:


Due to limitations in the  library used by ,
the  instance returned can only be used to parse a single
XML document.  Call  for each document to provide unique
parser instances.
