 — The password database¶

This module provides access to the Unix user account and password database.  It
is available on all Unix versions.
Password database entries are reported as a tuple-like object, whose attributes
correspond to the members of the  structure (Attribute field below,
see ):

The uid and gid items are integers, all others are strings.  is
raised if the entry asked for cannot be found.

Note
In traditional Unix the field  usually contains a password
encrypted with a DES derived algorithm (see module ).  However most
modern unices  use a so-called shadow password system.  On those unices the
pw_passwd field only contains an asterisk () or the  letter 
where the encrypted password is stored in a file  which is
not world readable.  Whether the pw_passwd field contains anything useful is
system-dependent.  If available, the  module should be used where
access to the encrypted password is required.

It defines the following items:


(uid)¶
Return the password database entry for the given numeric user ID.



(name)¶
Return the password database entry for the given user name.



()¶
Return a list of all available password database entries, in arbitrary order.
