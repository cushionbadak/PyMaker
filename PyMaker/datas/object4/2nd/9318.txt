(instance, **changes)¶
Creates a new object of the same type of , replacing
fields with values from .  If  is not a Data
Class, raises .  If values in  do not
specify fields, raises .
The newly returned object is created by calling the 
method of the dataclass.  This ensures that
, if present, is also called.
Init-only variables without default values, if any exist, must be
specified on the call to  so that they can be passed to
 and .
It is an error for  to contain any fields that are
defined as having .  A  will be raised
in this case.
Be forewarned about how  fields work during a call to
.  They are not copied from the source object, but
rather are initialized in , if they’re
initialized at all.  It is expected that  fields will
be rarely and judiciously used.  If they are used, it might be wise
to have alternate class constructors, or perhaps a custom
 (or similarly named) method which handles instance
copying.
