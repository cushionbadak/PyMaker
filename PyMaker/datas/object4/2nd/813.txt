search() vs. match()Â¶
Python offers two different primitive operations based on regular expressions:
 checks for a match only at the beginning of the string, while
 checks for a match anywhere in the string (this is what Perl
does by default).
For example:


Regular expressions beginning with  can be used with  to
restrict the match at the beginning of the string:


Note however that in  mode  only matches at the
beginning of the string, whereas using  with a regular expression
beginning with  will match at the beginning of each line.
