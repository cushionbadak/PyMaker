class ¶
This class may be initialized with seconds since the epoch, a time
tuple, an ISO 8601 time/date string, or a 
instance.  It has the following methods, supported mainly for internal
use by the marshalling/unmarshalling code:


(string)¶
Accept a string as the instance’s new time value.



(out)¶
Write the XML-RPC encoding of this  item to the out stream
object.

It also supports certain of Python’s built-in operators through rich comparison
and  methods.
