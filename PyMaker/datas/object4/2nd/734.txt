(key, args, kwargs)¶
Retrieve a given field value.  The key argument will be either an
integer or a string.  If it is an integer, it represents the index of the
positional argument in args; if it is a string, then it represents a
named argument in kwargs.
The args parameter is set to the list of positional arguments to
, and the kwargs parameter is set to the dictionary of
keyword arguments.
For compound field names, these functions are only called for the first
component of the field name; Subsequent components are handled through
normal attribute and indexing operations.
So for example, the field expression ‘0.name’ would cause
 to be called with a key argument of 0.  The 
attribute will be looked up after  returns by calling the
built-in  function.
If the index or keyword refers to an item that does not exist, then an
 or  should be raised.
