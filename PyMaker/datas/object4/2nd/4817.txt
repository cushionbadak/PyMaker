Unix signals¶


(signum, callback, *args)¶
Set callback as the handler for the signum signal.
The callback will be invoked by loop, along with other queued callbacks
and runnable coroutines of that event loop. Unlike signal handlers
registered using , a callback registered with this
function is allowed to interact with the event loop.
Raise  if the signal number is invalid or uncatchable.
Raise  if there is a problem setting up the handler.
Use  to pass keyword arguments to callback.
Like , this function must be invoked in the main
thread.



(sig)¶
Remove the handler for the sig signal.
Return  if the signal handler was removed, or  if
no handler was set for the given signal.
Availability: Unix.
