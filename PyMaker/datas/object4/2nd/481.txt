(iterable)¶

(iterable)¶
Return a bytes or bytearray object which is the concatenation of the
binary data sequences in iterable.  A  will be raised
if there are any values in iterable that are not bytes-like
objects, including  objects.  The
separator between elements is the contents of the bytes or
bytearray object providing this method.
