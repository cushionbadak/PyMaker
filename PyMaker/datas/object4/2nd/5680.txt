(payload)Â¶
Add the given payload to the current payload, which must be  or
a list of  objects before the call. After the call, the
payload will always be a list of  objects.  If you want to
set the payload to a scalar object (e.g. a string), use
 instead.
This is a legacy method.  On the
 class its functionality is
replaced by  and the
related  and  methods.
