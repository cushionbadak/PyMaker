docs:


(tag=None)Â¶
Creates a tree iterator with the current element as the root.
The iterator iterates over this element and all elements below it, in
document (depth first) order.  If tag is not  or , only
elements whose tag equals tag are returned from the iterator.  If the
tree structure is modified during iteration, the result is undefined.

New in version 3.2.
