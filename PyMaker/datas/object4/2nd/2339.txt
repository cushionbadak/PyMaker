 — Register  support functions¶
Source code: Lib/copyreg.py

The  module offers a way to define functions used while pickling
specific objects.  The  and  modules use those functions
when pickling/copying those objects.  The module provides configuration
information about object constructors which are not classes.
Such constructors may be factory functions or class instances.


(object)¶
Declares object to be a valid constructor.  If object is not callable (and
hence not valid as a constructor), raises .



(type, function, constructor=None)¶
Declares that function should be used as a “reduction” function for objects
of type type.  function should return either a string or a tuple
containing two or three elements.
The optional constructor parameter, if provided, is a callable object which
can be used to reconstruct the object when called with the tuple of arguments
returned by function at pickling time.   will be raised if
object is a class or constructor is not callable.
See the  module for more details on the interface
expected of function and constructor.  Note that the
 attribute of a pickler
object or subclass of  can also be used for
declaring reduction functions.


Example¶
The example below would like to show how to register a pickle function and how
it will be used:
