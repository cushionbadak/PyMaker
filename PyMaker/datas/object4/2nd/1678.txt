docs:


(exp, rounding=None, context=None)¶
Return a value equal to the first operand after rounding and having the
exponent of the second operand.


Unlike other operations, if the length of the coefficient after the
quantize operation would be greater than precision, then an
 is signaled. This guarantees that, unless there
is an error condition, the quantized exponent is always equal to that of
the right-hand operand.
Also unlike other operations, quantize never signals Underflow, even if
the result is subnormal and inexact.
If the exponent of the second operand is larger than that of the first
then rounding may be necessary.  In this case, the rounding mode is
determined by the  argument if given, else by the given
 argument; if neither argument is given the rounding mode of
the current thread’s context is used.
An error is returned whenever the resulting exponent is greater than
 or less than .
