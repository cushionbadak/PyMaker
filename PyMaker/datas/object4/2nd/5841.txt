(key, default=None)¶

(key)¶
Return a representation of the message corresponding to key. If no such
message exists, default is returned if the method was called as
 and a  exception is raised if the method was
called as . The message is represented as an instance
of the appropriate format-specific  subclass unless a
custom message factory was specified when the  instance
was initialized.
