Repr Objects¶
 instances provide several attributes which can be used to provide
size limits for the representations of different object types,  and methods
which format specific object types.


¶
Depth limit on the creation of recursive representations.  The default is .

¶
Limits on the number of entries represented for the named object type.  The
default is  for ,  for , and   for
the others.



¶
Maximum number of characters in the representation for an integer.  Digits
are dropped from the middle.  The default is .



¶
Limit on the number of characters in the representation of the string.  Note
that the “normal” representation of the string is used as the character source:
if escape sequences are needed in the representation, these may be mangled when
the representation is shortened.  The default is .



¶
This limit is used to control the size of object types for which no specific
formatting method is available on the  object. It is applied in a
similar manner as .  The default is .



(obj)¶
The equivalent to the built-in  that uses the formatting imposed by
the instance.



(obj, level)¶
Recursive implementation used by .  This uses the type of obj to
determine which formatting method to call, passing it obj and level.  The
type-specific methods should call  to perform recursive formatting,
with  for the value of level in the recursive  call.



(obj, level)
Formatting methods for specific types are implemented as methods with a name
based on the type name.  In the method name, TYPE is replaced by
. Dispatch to these methods is
handled by . Type-specific methods which need to recursively
format a value should call .
