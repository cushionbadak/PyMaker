Arguments containing ¶
The  method attempts to give errors whenever
the user has clearly made a mistake, but some situations are inherently
ambiguous.  For example, the command-line argument  could either be an

The  method is cautious here: positional
arguments may only begin with  if they look like negative numbers and
there are no options in the parser that look like negative numbers:


If you have positional arguments that must begin with  and don’t look
like negative numbers, you can insert the pseudo-argument  which tells
 that everything after that is a positional
argument:
