docs:


(data)Â¶
Read a plist data from a bytes object.  Return the root object.
See  for a description of the keyword arguments.

Deprecated since version 3.4: Use  instead.


Changed in version 3.7: Dict values in the result are now normal dicts.  You no longer can use
attribute access to access items of these dictionaries.
