(name, mode=0o777, exist_ok=False)¶
Recursive directory creation function.  Like , but makes all
intermediate-level directories needed to contain the leaf directory.
The mode parameter is passed to  for creating the leaf
directory; see the mkdir() description for how it
is interpreted.  To set the file permission bits of any newly-created parent
directories you can set the umask before invoking .  The
file permission bits of existing parent directories are not changed.
If exist_ok is  (the default), an  is raised if the
target directory already exists.

Note
 will become confused if the path elements to create
include  (eg. “..” on UNIX systems).

This function handles UNC paths correctly.

New in version 3.2: The exist_ok parameter.


Changed in version 3.4.1: Before Python 3.4.1, if exist_ok was  and the directory existed,
 would still raise an error if mode did not match the
mode of the existing directory. Since this behavior was impossible to
implement safely, it was removed in Python 3.4.1. See bpo-21082.


Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a path-like object.


Changed in version 3.7: The mode argument no longer affects the file permission bits of
newly-created intermediate-level directories.
