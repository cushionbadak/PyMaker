(path, flags, mode=0o777, *, dir_fd=None)Â¶
Open the file path and set various flags according to flags and possibly
its mode according to mode.  When computing mode, the current umask value
is first masked out.  Return the file descriptor for the newly opened file.
The new file descriptor is non-inheritable.
For a description of the flag and mode values, see the C run-time documentation;
flag constants (like  and ) are defined in
the  module.  In particular, on Windows adding
 is needed to open files in binary mode.
This function can support paths relative to directory descriptors with the dir_fd parameter.

Changed in version 3.4: The new file descriptor is now non-inheritable.


Note
This function is intended for low-level I/O.  For normal usage, use the
built-in function , which returns a file object with
 and  methods (and many more).  To
wrap a file descriptor in a file object, use .


New in version 3.3: The dir_fd argument.


Changed in version 3.5: If the system call is interrupted and the signal handler does not raise an
exception, the function now retries the system call instead of raising an
 exception (see PEP 475 for the rationale).


Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a path-like object.
