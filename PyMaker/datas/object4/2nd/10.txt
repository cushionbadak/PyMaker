2.1.2. Physical linesÂ¶
A physical line is a sequence of characters terminated by an end-of-line
sequence.  In source files and strings, any of the standard platform line
termination sequences can be used - the Unix form using ASCII LF (linefeed),
the Windows form using the ASCII sequence CR LF (return followed by linefeed),
or the old Macintosh form using the ASCII CR (return) character.  All of these
forms can be used equally, regardless of platform. The end of input also serves
as an implicit terminator for the final physical line.
When embedding Python, source code strings should be passed to Python APIs using
the standard C conventions for newline characters (the  character,
representing ASCII LF, is the line terminator).
