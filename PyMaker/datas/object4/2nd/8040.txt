File Handlers¶
Tk allows you to register and unregister a callback function which will be
called from the Tk mainloop when I/O is possible on a file descriptor.
Only one handler may be registered per file descriptor. Example code:

For sockets, the  or
 methods will work fine; for other files,
use raw reads or .

may either be an object with a  method (such as

argument is an ORed combination of any of the three constants below.
The callback is called as follows:
