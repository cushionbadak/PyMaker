(key)Â¶
In Babyl mailboxes, the headers of a message are not stored contiguously
with the body of the message. To generate a file-like representation, the
headers and body are copied together into an  instance,
which has an API identical to that of a
file. As a result, the file-like object is truly independent of the
underlying mailbox but does not save memory compared to a string
representation.
