¶
With a lineno argument, set a break there in the current file.  With a
function argument, set a break at the first executable statement within
that function.  The line number may be prefixed with a filename and a colon,
to specify a breakpoint in another file (probably one that hasn’t been loaded
yet).  The file is searched on .  Note that each breakpoint
is assigned a number to which all the other breakpoint commands refer.
If a second argument is present, it is an expression which must evaluate to
true before the breakpoint is honored.
Without argument, list all breaks, including for each breakpoint, the number
of times that breakpoint has been hit, the current ignore count, and the
associated condition if any.
