docs:


(iterable, r)Â¶
Return r length subsequences of elements from the input iterable
allowing individual elements to be repeated more than once.
Combinations are emitted in lexicographic sort order.  So, if the
input iterable is sorted, the combination tuples will be produced
in sorted order.
Elements are treated as unique based on their position, not on their
value.  So if the input elements are unique, the generated combinations
will also be unique.
Roughly equivalent to:


The code for  can be also expressed as
a subsequence of  after filtering entries where the elements
are not in sorted order (according to their position in the input pool):


The number of items returned is  when .
