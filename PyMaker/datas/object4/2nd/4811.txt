DNS¶


coroutine (host, port, *, family=0, type=0, proto=0, flags=0)¶
Asynchronous version of .



coroutine (sockaddr, flags=0)¶
Asynchronous version of .


Changed in version 3.7: Both getaddrinfo and getnameinfo methods were always documented
to return a coroutine, but prior to Python 3.7 they were, in fact,
returning  objects.  Starting with Python 3.7
both methods are coroutines.
