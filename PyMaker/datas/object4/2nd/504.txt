([chars])¶

([chars])¶
Return a copy of the sequence with specified leading bytes removed.  The
chars argument is a binary sequence specifying the set of byte values to
be removed - the name refers to the fact this method is usually used with
ASCII characters.  If omitted or , the chars argument defaults
to removing ASCII whitespace.  The chars argument is not a prefix;
rather, all combinations of its values are stripped:


The binary sequence of byte values to remove may be any
bytes-like object.

Note
The bytearray version of this method does not operate in place -
it always produces a new object, even if no changes were made.
