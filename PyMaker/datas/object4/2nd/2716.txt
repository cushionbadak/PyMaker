Supported INI File Structure¶
A configuration file consists of sections, each led by a  header,
followed by key/value entries separated by a specific string ( or  by
default [1]).  By default, section names are case sensitive but keys are not
[1].  Leading and trailing whitespace is removed from keys and values.
Values can be omitted, in which case the key/value delimiter may also be left
out.  Values can also span multiple lines, as long as they are indented deeper
than the first line of the value.  Depending on the parser’s mode, blank lines
may be treated as parts of multiline values or ignored.
Configuration files may include comments, prefixed by specific
characters ( and  by default [1]).  Comments may appear on
their own on an otherwise empty line, possibly indented. [1]
