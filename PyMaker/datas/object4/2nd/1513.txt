docs:

 member typeÂ¶
 members are instances of their  class, and are
normally accessed as .  Under certain circumstances they
can also be accessed as , but you should never do
this as that lookup may fail or, worse, return something besides the
 member you are looking for (this is another good reason to use
all-uppercase names for members):



Changed in version 3.5.
