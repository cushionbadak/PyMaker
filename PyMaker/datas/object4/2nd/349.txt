(object)Â¶
Return a string containing a printable representation of an object.  For many
types, this function makes an attempt to return a string that would yield an
object with the same value when passed to , otherwise the
representation is a string enclosed in angle brackets that contains the name
of the type of the object together with additional information often
including the name and address of the object.  A class can control what this
function returns for its instances by defining a  method.
