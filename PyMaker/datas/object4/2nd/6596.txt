¶
If the  attribute is set, this attribute’s value is used to
set the default  WSGI environment variable, and also to set a
default  header in HTTP responses.  It is ignored for handlers (such
as  and ) that are not HTTP origin
servers.

Changed in version 3.3: The term “Python” is replaced with implementation specific term like
“CPython”, “Jython” etc.
