 — Python class browser support¶
Source code: Lib/pyclbr.py

The  module provides limited information about the
functions, classes, and methods defined in a Python-coded module.  The
information is sufficient to implement a module browser.  The
information is extracted from the Python source code rather than by
importing the module, so this module is safe to use with untrusted code.
This restriction makes it impossible to use this module with modules not
implemented in Python, including all standard and optional extension
modules.


(module, path=None)¶
Return a dictionary mapping module-level class names to class
descriptors.  If possible, descriptors for imported base classes are
included.  Parameter module is a string with the name of the module
to read; it may be the name of a module within a package.  If given,
path is a sequence of directory paths prepended to ,
which is used to locate the module source code.



(module, path=None)¶
Return a dictionary-based tree containing a function or class
descriptors for each function and class defined in the module with a
 or  statement.  The returned dictionary maps
module-level function and class names to their descriptors.  Nested
objects are entered into the children dictionary of their parent.  As
with readmodule, module names the module to be read and path is
prepended to sys.path.  If the module being read is a package, the
returned dictionary has a key  whose value is a list
containing the package search path.


New in version 3.7: Descriptors for nested definitions.  They are accessed through the
new children attribute.  Each has a new parent attribute.

The descriptors returned by these functions are instances of
Function and Class classes.  Users are not expected to create instances
of these classes.

Function Objects¶
Class  instances describe functions defined by def
statements.  They have the following attributes:


¶
Name of the file in which the function is defined.



¶
The name of the module defining the function described.



¶
The name of the function.



¶
The line number in the file where the definition starts.



¶
For top-level functions, None.  For nested functions, the parent.

New in version 3.7.




¶
A dictionary mapping names to descriptors for nested functions and
classes.

New in version 3.7.




Class Objects¶
Class  instances describe classes defined by class
statements.  They have the same attributes as Functions and two more.


¶
Name of the file in which the class is defined.



¶
The name of the module defining the class described.



¶
The name of the class.



¶
The line number in the file where the definition starts.



¶
For top-level classes, None.  For nested classes, the parent.

New in version 3.7.




¶
A dictionary mapping names to descriptors for nested functions and
classes.

New in version 3.7.




¶
A list of  objects which describe the immediate base
classes of the class being described.  Classes which are named as
superclasses but which are not discoverable by 
are listed as a string with the class name instead of as
 objects.



¶
A dictionary mapping method names to line numbers.  This can be
derived from the newer children dictionary, but remains for
back-compatibility.
