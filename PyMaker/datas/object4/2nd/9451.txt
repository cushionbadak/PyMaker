docs:


(path)Â¶
Return the name of the module named by the file path, without including the
names of enclosing packages. The file extension is checked against all of
the entries in . If it matches,
the final path component is returned with the extension removed.
Otherwise,  is returned.
Note that this function only returns a meaningful name for actual
Python modules - paths that potentially refer to Python packages will
still return .

Changed in version 3.3: The function is based directly on .
