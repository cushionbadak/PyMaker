class (path, factory=None, create=True)¶
A subclass of  for mailboxes in mbox format. Parameter factory
is a callable object that accepts a file-like message representation (which
behaves as if opened in binary mode) and returns a custom representation. If
factory is ,  is used as the default message
representation. If create is , the mailbox is created if it does not
exist.
The mbox format is the classic format for storing mail on Unix systems. All
messages in an mbox mailbox are stored in a single file with the beginning of
each message indicated by a line whose first five characters are “From “.
Several variations of the mbox format exist to address perceived shortcomings in
the original. In the interest of compatibility,  implements the
original format, which is sometimes referred to as mboxo. This means that
the Content-Length header, if present, is ignored and that any
occurrences of “From ” at the beginning of a line in a message body are
transformed to “>From ” when storing the message, although occurrences of “>From
” are not transformed to “From ” when reading the message.
Some  methods implemented by  deserve special
remarks:


(key)¶
Using the file after calling  or  on the
 instance may yield unpredictable results or raise an
exception.

Three locking mechanisms are used—dot locking and, if available, the
 and  system calls.
