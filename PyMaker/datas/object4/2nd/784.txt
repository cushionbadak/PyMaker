docs:


(string[, pos[, endpos]])Â¶
If zero or more characters at the beginning of string match this regular
expression, return a corresponding match object.
Return  if the string does not match the pattern; note that this is
different from a zero-length match.
The optional pos and endpos parameters have the same meaning as for the
 method.


If you want to locate a match anywhere in string, use
 instead (see also search() vs. match()).
