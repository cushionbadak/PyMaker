Truth Value TestingÂ¶
Any object can be tested for truth value, for use in an  or
 condition or as operand of the Boolean operations below.
By default, an object is considered true unless its class defines either a
 method that returns  or a  method that
returns zero, when called with the object. [1]  Here are most of the built-in
objects considered false:



constants defined to be false:  and .
zero of any numeric type: , , , ,

empty sequences and collections: , , , , ,


Operations and built-in functions that have a Boolean result always return 
or  for false and  or  for true, unless otherwise stated.
(Important exception: the Boolean operations  and  always return
one of their operands.)
