Â¶
Under Windows, this gives you the native
Windows error code.  The  attribute is then an approximate
translation, in POSIX terms, of that native error code.
Under Windows, if the winerror constructor argument is an integer,
the  attribute is determined from the Windows error code,
and the errno argument is ignored.  On other platforms, the
winerror argument is ignored, and the  attribute
does not exist.
