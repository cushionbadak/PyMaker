class (f, fieldnames=None, restkey=None, restval=None, dialect='excel', *args, **kwds)Â¶
Create an object that operates like a regular reader but maps the
information in each row to an 
whose keys are given by the optional fieldnames parameter.
The fieldnames parameter is a sequence.  If fieldnames is
omitted, the values in the first row of file f will be used as the
fieldnames.  Regardless of how the fieldnames are determined, the ordered
dictionary preserves their original ordering.
If a row has more fields than fieldnames, the remaining data is put in a
list and stored with the fieldname specified by restkey (which defaults
to ).  If a non-blank row has fewer fields than fieldnames, the
missing values are filled-in with .
All other optional or keyword arguments are passed to the underlying
 instance.

Changed in version 3.6: Returned rows are now of type .
