Traceback¶


class ¶
Sequence of  instances sorted from the oldest frame to the
most recent frame.
A traceback contains at least  frame. If the  module
failed to get a frame, the filename  at line number  is
used.
When a snapshot is taken, tracebacks of traces are limited to
 frames. See the  function.
The  attribute is an instance of 
instance.

Changed in version 3.7: Frames are now sorted from the oldest to the most recent, instead of most recent to oldest.



(limit=None, most_recent_first=False)¶
Format the traceback as a list of lines with newlines. Use the
 module to retrieve lines from the source code.
If limit is set, format the limit most recent frames if limit
is positive. Otherwise, format the  oldest frames.
If most_recent_first is , the order of the formatted frames
is reversed, returning the most recent frame first instead of last.
Similar to the  function, except that
 does not include newlines.
