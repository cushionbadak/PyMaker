 — Encode and decode binhex4 files¶
Source code: Lib/binhex.py

This module encodes and decodes files in binhex4 format, a format allowing
representation of Macintosh files in ASCII. Only the data fork is handled.
The  module defines the following functions:


(input, output)¶
Convert a binary file with filename input to binhex file output. The
output parameter can either be a filename or a file-like object (any object
supporting a  and  method).



(input, output)¶
Decode a binhex file input. input may be a filename or a file-like object
supporting  and  methods. The resulting file is written
to a file named output, unless the argument is  in which case the
output filename is read from the binhex file.

The following exception is also defined:


exception ¶
Exception raised when something can’t be encoded using the binhex format (for
example, a filename is too long to fit in the filename field), or when input is
not properly encoded binhex data.

Support module containing ASCII-to-binary and binary-to-ASCII conversions.



Notes¶
There is an alternative, more powerful interface to the coder and decoder, see
the source for details.
If you code or decode textfiles on non-Macintosh platforms they will still use
the old Macintosh newline convention (carriage-return as end of line).
