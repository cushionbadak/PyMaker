fromfile_prefix_charsÂ¶
Sometimes, for example when dealing with a particularly long argument lists, it
may make sense to keep the list of arguments in a file rather than typing it out
at the command line.  If the  argument is given to the
 constructor, then arguments that start with any of the
specified characters will be treated as files, and will be replaced by the
arguments they contain.  For example:


Arguments read from a file must by default be one per line (but see also
) and are treated as if they
were in the same place as the original file referencing argument on the command
line.  So in the example above, the expression 
is considered equivalent to the expression .
The  argument defaults to , meaning that
arguments will never be treated as file references.
