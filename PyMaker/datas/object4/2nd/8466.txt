(warning, callable, *args, **kwds)¶

(warning, *, msg=None)
Test that a warning is triggered when callable is called with any
positional or keyword arguments that are also passed to
.  The test passes if warning is triggered and
fails if it isn’t.  Any exception is an error.
To catch any of a group of warnings, a tuple containing the warning
classes may be passed as warnings.
If only the warning and possibly the msg arguments are given,
return a context manager so that the code under test can be written
inline rather than as a function:


When used as a context manager,  accepts the
additional keyword argument msg.
The context manager will store the caught warning object in its
 attribute, and the source line which triggered the
warnings in the  and  attributes.
This can be useful if the intention is to perform additional checks
on the warning caught:


This method works regardless of the warning filters in place when it
is called.

New in version 3.2.


Changed in version 3.3: Added the msg keyword argument when used as a context manager.
