docs:


(theyear, w=2, l=1, c=6, m=3)Â¶
Return a m-column calendar for an entire year as a multi-line string.
Optional parameters w, l, and c are for date column width, lines per
week, and number of spaces between month columns, respectively. Depends on
the first weekday as specified in the constructor or set by the
 method.  The earliest year for which a calendar
can be generated is platform-dependent.
