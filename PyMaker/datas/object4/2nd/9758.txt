docs:


class (loader)¶
A class which postpones the execution of the loader of a module until the
module has an attribute accessed.
This class only works with loaders that define
 as control over what module type
is used for the module is required. For those same reasons, the loader’s
 method must return  or a
type for which its  attribute can be mutated along with not
using slots. Finally, modules which substitute the object
placed into  will not work as there is no way to properly
replace the module references throughout the interpreter safely;
 is raised if such a substitution is detected.

Note
For projects where startup time is critical, this class allows for
potentially minimizing the cost of loading a module if it is never used.
For projects where startup time is not essential then use of this class is
heavily discouraged due to error messages created during loading being
postponed and thus occurring out of context.


New in version 3.5.


Changed in version 3.6: Began calling , removing the
compatibility warning for  and
.



classmethod (loader)¶
A static method which returns a callable that creates a lazy loader. This
is meant to be used in situations where the loader is passed by class
instead of by instance.
