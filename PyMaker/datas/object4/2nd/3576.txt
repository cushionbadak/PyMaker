Access to external objectsÂ¶
There are times where a configuration needs to refer to objects
external to the configuration, for example .  If the
configuration dict is constructed using Python code, this is
straightforward, but a problem arises when the configuration is
provided via a text file (e.g. JSON, YAML).  In a text file, there is
no standard way to distinguish  from the literal string
.  To facilitate this distinction, the configuration
system looks for certain special prefixes in string values and
treat them specially.  For example, if the literal string
 is provided as a value in the configuration,
then the  will be stripped off and the remainder of the
value processed using normal import mechanisms.
The handling of such prefixes is done in a way analogous to protocol
handling: there is a generic mechanism to look for prefixes which
match the regular expression 
whereby, if the  is recognised, the  is processed
in a prefix-dependent manner and the result of the processing replaces
the string value.  If the prefix is not recognised, then the string
value will be left as-is.
