()Â¶
Returns information identifying the current operating system.
The return value is an object with five attributes:

 - operating system name
 - name of machine on network (implementation-defined)
 - operating system release
 - operating system version
 - hardware identifier

For backwards compatibility, this object is also iterable, behaving
like a five-tuple containing , ,
, , and 
in that order.
Some systems truncate  to 8 characters or to the
leading component; a better way to get the hostname is
  or even
.
Availability: recent flavors of Unix.

Changed in version 3.3: Return type changed from a tuple to a tuple-like object
with named attributes.
