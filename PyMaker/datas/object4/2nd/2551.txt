docs:


(member, path=None, pwd=None)Â¶
Extract a member from the archive to the current working directory; member
must be its full name or a  object.  Its file information is
extracted as accurately as possible.  path specifies a different directory
to extract to.  member can be a filename or a  object.
pwd is the password used for encrypted files.
Returns the normalized path created (a directory or new file).

Note
If a member filename is an absolute path, a drive/UNC sharepoint and
leading (back)slashes will be stripped, e.g.:  becomes
 on Unix, and  becomes  on Windows.
And all  components in a member filename will be removed, e.g.:
 becomes .  On Windows illegal
characters (, , , , , , and )
replaced by underscore ().


Changed in version 3.6: Calling  on a closed ZipFile will raise a
.  Previously, a  was raised.


Changed in version 3.6.2: The path parameter accepts a path-like object.
