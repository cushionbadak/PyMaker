The Packer¶
The packer is one of Tk’s geometry-management mechanisms.    Geometry managers
are used to specify the relative positioning of the positioning of widgets
within their container - their mutual master.  In contrast to the more
cumbersome placer (which is used less commonly, and we do not cover here), the
packer takes qualitative relationship specification - above, to the left of,
filling, etc - and works everything out to determine the exact placement
coordinates for you.
The size of any master widget is determined by the size of the “slave widgets”
inside.  The packer is used to control where slave widgets appear inside the
master into which they are packed.  You can pack widgets into frames, and frames
into other frames, in order to achieve the kind of layout you desire.
Additionally, the arrangement is dynamically adjusted to accommodate incremental
changes to the configuration, once it is packed.
Note that widgets do not appear until they have had their geometry specified
with a geometry manager.  It’s a common early mistake to leave out the geometry
specification, and then be surprised when the widget is created but nothing
appears.  A widget will appear only after it has had, for example, the packer’s
 method applied to it.
The pack() method can be called with keyword-option/value pairs that control
where the widget is to appear within its container, and how it is to behave when
the main application window is resized.  Here are some examples:
