class ¶
Type variable.
Usage:


Type variables exist primarily for the benefit of static type
checkers.  They serve as the parameters for generic types as well
as for generic function definitions.  See class Generic for more
information on generic types.  Generic functions work as follows:


The latter example’s signature is essentially the overloading
of  and .  Also note
that if the arguments are instances of some subclass of ,
the return type is still plain .
At runtime,  will raise .  In general,
 and  should not be used with types.
Type variables may be marked covariant or contravariant by passing
 or .  See PEP 484 for more
details.  By default type variables are invariant.  Alternatively,
a type variable may specify an upper bound using .
This means that an actual type substituted (explicitly or implicitly)
for the type variable must be a subclass of the boundary type,
see PEP 484.
