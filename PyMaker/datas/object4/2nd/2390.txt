docs:


¶
This constant is meant to be used with the detect_types parameter of the
 function.
Setting it makes the  module parse the declared type for each
column it returns.  It will parse out the first word of the declared type,
i. e.  for “integer primary key”, it will parse out “integer”, or for
“number(10)” it will parse out “number”. Then for that column, it will look
into the converters dictionary and use the converter function registered for
that type there.
