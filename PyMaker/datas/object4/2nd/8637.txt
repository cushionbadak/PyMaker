Mocking Classes¶
A common use case is to mock out classes instantiated by your code under test.
When you patch a class, then that class is replaced with a mock. Instances
are created by calling the class. This means you access the “mock instance”
by looking at the return value of the mocked class.
In the example below we have a function  that instantiates 
and calls a method on it. The call to  replaces the class  with a
mock. The  instance is the result of calling the mock, so it is configured
by modifying the mock .
