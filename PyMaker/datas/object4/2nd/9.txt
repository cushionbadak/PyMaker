2.1.1. Logical linesÂ¶
The end of a logical line is represented by the token NEWLINE.  Statements
cannot cross logical line boundaries except where NEWLINE is allowed by the
syntax (e.g., between statements in compound statements). A logical line is
constructed from one or more physical lines by following the explicit or
implicit line joining rules.
