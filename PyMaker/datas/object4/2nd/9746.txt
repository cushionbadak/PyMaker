(path, debug_override=None, *, optimization=None)¶
Return the PEP 3147/PEP 488 path to the byte-compiled file associated
with the source path.  For example, if path is  the return
value would be  for Python 3.2.
The  string comes from the current magic tag (see
; if  is not defined then
 will be raised).
The optimization parameter is used to specify the optimization level of the
bytecode file. An empty string represents no optimization, so
 with an optimization of  will result in a
bytecode path of .  causes
the interpter’s optimization level to be used. Any other value’s string
representation being used, so  with an optimization of
 will lead to the bytecode path of
. The string representation
of optimization can only be alphanumeric, else  is raised.
The debug_override parameter is deprecated and can be used to override
the system’s value for . A  value is the equivalent of
setting optimization to the empty string. A  value is the same as
setting optimization to . If both debug_override an optimization
are not  then  is raised.

New in version 3.4.


Changed in version 3.5: The optimization parameter was added and the debug_override parameter
was deprecated.


Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a path-like object.
