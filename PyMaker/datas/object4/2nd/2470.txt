(data, wbits=MAX_WBITS, bufsize=DEF_BUF_SIZE)¶
Decompresses the bytes in data, returning a bytes object containing the
uncompressed data.  The wbits parameter depends on
the format of data, and is discussed further below.
If bufsize is given, it is used as the initial size of the output
buffer.  Raises the  exception if any error occurs.
The wbits parameter controls the size of the history buffer
(or “window size”), and what header and trailer format is expected.
It is similar to the parameter for , but accepts
more ranges of values:

+8 to +15: The base-two logarithm of the window size.  The input
must include a zlib header and trailer.
0: Automatically determine the window size from the zlib header.
Only supported since zlib 1.2.3.5.
−8 to −15: Uses the absolute value of wbits as the window size
logarithm.  The input must be a raw stream with no header or trailer.
+24 to +31 = 16 + (8 to 15): Uses the low 4 bits of the value as
the window size logarithm.  The input must include a gzip header and
trailer.
+40 to +47 = 32 + (8 to 15): Uses the low 4 bits of the value as
the window size logarithm, and automatically accepts either
the zlib or gzip format.

When decompressing a stream, the window size must not be smaller
than the size originally used to compress the stream; using a too-small
value may result in an  exception. The default wbits value
corresponds to the largest window size and requires a zlib header and
trailer to be included.
bufsize is the initial size of the buffer used to hold decompressed data.  If
more space is required, the buffer size will be increased as needed, so you
don’t have to get this value exactly right; tuning it will only save a few calls
to .

Changed in version 3.6: wbits and bufsize can be used as keyword arguments.
