(_name, _value, **_params)Â¶
Extended header setting.  This method is similar to 
except that additional header parameters can be provided as keyword
arguments.  _name is the header field to add and _value is the
primary value for the header.
For each item in the keyword argument dictionary _params, the key is
taken as the parameter name, with underscores converted to dashes (since
dashes are illegal in Python identifiers).  Normally, the parameter will
be added as  unless the value is , in which case
only the key will be added.
If the value contains non-ASCII characters, the charset and language may
be explicitly controlled by specifying the value as a three tuple in the
format , where  is a string
naming the charset to be used to encode the value,  can
usually be set to  or the empty string (see RFC 2231 for other
possibilities), and  is the string value containing non-ASCII
code points.  If a three tuple is not passed and the value contains
non-ASCII characters, it is automatically encoded in RFC 2231 format
using a  of  and a  of .
Here is an example:


This will add a header that looks like
