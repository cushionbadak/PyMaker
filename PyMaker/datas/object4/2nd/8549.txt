(module='__main__', defaultTest=None, argv=None, testRunner=None, testLoader=unittest.defaultTestLoader, exit=True, verbosity=1, failfast=None, catchbreak=None, buffer=None, warnings=None)¶
A command-line program that loads a set of tests from module and runs them;
this is primarily for making test modules conveniently executable.
The simplest use for this function is to include the following line at the
end of a test script:


You can run tests with more detailed information by passing in the verbosity
argument:


The defaultTest argument is either the name of a single test or an
iterable of test names to run if no test names are specified via argv.  If
not specified or  and no test names are provided via argv, all
tests found in module are run.
The argv argument can be a list of options passed to the program, with the
first element being the program name.  If not specified or ,
the values of  are used.
The testRunner argument can either be a test runner class or an already
created instance of it. By default  calls  with
an exit code indicating success or failure of the tests run.
The testLoader argument has to be a  instance,
and defaults to .
 supports being used from the interactive interpreter by passing in the
argument . This displays the result on standard output without
calling :


The failfast, catchbreak and buffer parameters have the same
effect as the same-name command-line options.
The warnings argument specifies the warning filter
that should be used while running the tests.  If it’s not specified, it will
remain  if a  option is passed to python
(see Warning control),
otherwise it will be set to .
Calling  actually returns an instance of the  class.
This stores the result of the tests run as the  attribute.

Changed in version 3.1: The exit parameter was added.


Changed in version 3.2: The verbosity, failfast, catchbreak, buffer
and warnings parameters were added.


Changed in version 3.4: The defaultTest parameter was changed to also accept an iterable of
test names.
