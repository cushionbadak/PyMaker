docs:


(*[, name][, kind][, default][, annotation])Â¶

Create a new Parameter instance based on the instance replaced was invoked
on.  To override a  attribute, pass the corresponding
argument.  To remove a default value or/and an annotation from a
Parameter, pass .




Changed in version 3.4: In Python 3.3 Parameter objects were allowed to have  set
to  if their  was set to .
This is no longer permitted.
