(fd, name)Â¶
Return system configuration information relevant to an open file. name
specifies the configuration value to retrieve; it may be a string which is the
name of a defined system value; these names are specified in a number of
standards (POSIX.1, Unix 95, Unix 98, and others).  Some platforms define
additional names as well.  The names known to the host operating system are
given in the  dictionary.  For configuration variables not
included in that mapping, passing an integer for name is also accepted.
If name is a string and is not known,  is raised.  If a
specific value for name is not supported by the host system, even if it is
included in , an  is raised with
 for the error number.
As of Python 3.3, this is equivalent to .
