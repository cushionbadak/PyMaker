¶
Perform case-insensitive matching; expressions like  will also
match lowercase letters.  Full Unicode matching (such as  matching
) also works unless the  flag is used to disable
non-ASCII matches.  The current locale does not change the effect of this
flag unless the  flag is also used.
Corresponds to the inline flag .
Note that when the Unicode patterns  or  are used in
combination with the  flag, they will match the 52 ASCII
letters and 4 additional non-ASCII letters: ‘İ’ (U+0130, Latin capital
letter I with dot above), ‘ı’ (U+0131, Latin small letter dotless i),
‘ſ’ (U+017F, Latin small letter long s) and ‘K’ (U+212A, Kelvin sign).
If the  flag is used, only letters ‘a’ to ‘z’
and ‘A’ to ‘Z’ are matched.
