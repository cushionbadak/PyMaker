 Objects¶
 objects are callable objects created by . They
have three read-only attributes:


¶
A callable object or function.  Calls to the  object will be
forwarded to  with new arguments and keywords.



¶
The leftmost positional arguments that will be prepended to the positional
arguments provided to a  object call.



¶
The keyword arguments that will be supplied when the  object is
called.

 objects are like  objects in that they are
callable, weak referencable, and can have attributes.  There are some important
differences.  For instance, the  and  attributes
are not created automatically.  Also,  objects defined in
classes behave like static methods and do not transform into bound methods
during instance attribute look-up.
