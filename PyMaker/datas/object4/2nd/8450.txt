docs:


(msg=None, **params)Â¶
Return a context manager which executes the enclosed code block as a
subtest.  msg and params are optional, arbitrary values which are
displayed whenever a subtest fails, allowing you to identify them
clearly.
A test case can contain any number of subtest declarations, and
they can be arbitrarily nested.
See Distinguishing test iterations using subtests for more information.

New in version 3.4.
