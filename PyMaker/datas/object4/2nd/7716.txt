(singular, plural, n)Â¶
Like , but consider plural forms. If a translation is found,
apply the plural formula to n, and return the resulting message (some
languages have more than two plural forms). If no translation is found, return
singular if n is 1; return plural otherwise.
The Plural formula is taken from the catalog header. It is a C or Python
expression that has a free variable n; the expression evaluates to the index
of the plural in the catalog. See
the GNU gettext documentation
for the precise syntax to be used in  files and the
formulas for a variety of languages.
