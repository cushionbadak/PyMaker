Tuples¶
Tuples are immutable sequences, typically used to store collections of
heterogeneous data (such as the 2-tuples produced by the 
built-in). Tuples are also used for cases where an immutable sequence of
homogeneous data is needed (such as allowing storage in a  or
 instance).


class ([iterable])¶
Tuples may be constructed in a number of ways:

Using a pair of parentheses to denote the empty tuple: 
Using a trailing comma for a singleton tuple:  or 
Separating items with commas:  or 
Using the  built-in:  or 

The constructor builds a tuple whose items are the same and in the same
order as iterable’s items.  iterable may be either a sequence, a
container that supports iteration, or an iterator object.  If iterable
is already a tuple, it is returned unchanged. For example,
 returns  and
 returns .
If no argument is given, the constructor creates a new empty tuple, .
Note that it is actually the comma which makes a tuple, not the parentheses.
The parentheses are optional, except in the empty tuple case, or
when they are needed to avoid syntactic ambiguity. For example,
 is a function call with three arguments, while
 is a function call with a 3-tuple as the sole argument.
Tuples implement all of the common sequence
operations.

For heterogeneous collections of data where access by name is clearer than
access by index,  may be a more appropriate
choice than a simple tuple object.
