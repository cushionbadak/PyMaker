Python Shell window¶
With IDLE’s Shell, one enters, edits, and recalls complete statements.
Most consoles and terminals only work with a single physical line at a time.
When one pastes code into Shell, it is not compiled and possibly executed
until one hits Return.  One may edit pasted code first.
If one pastes more that one statement into Shell, the result will be a
 when multiple statements are compiled as if they were one.
The editing features described in previous subsections work when entering
code interactively.  IDLE’s Shell window also responds to the following keys.

C-c interrupts executing command

C-d sends end-of-file; closes window if typed at a  prompt

Alt-/ (Expand word) is also useful to reduce typing
Command history

Alt-p retrieves previous command matching what you have typed. On
macOS use C-p.
Alt-n retrieves next. On macOS use C-n.
Return while on any previous command retrieves that command
