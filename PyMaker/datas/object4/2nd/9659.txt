docs:


(fullname)Â¶
Return the code object for a module, or  if the module does not
have a code object (as would be the case, for example, for a built-in
module).  Raise an  if loader cannot find the
requested module.

Note
While the method has a default implementation, it is suggested that
it be overridden if possible for performance.


Changed in version 3.4: No longer abstract and a concrete implementation is provided.
