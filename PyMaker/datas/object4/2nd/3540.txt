Thread Safety¶
The logging module is intended to be thread-safe without any special work
needing to be done by its clients. It achieves this though using threading
locks; there is one lock to serialize access to the module’s shared data, and
each handler also creates a lock to serialize access to its underlying I/O.
If you are implementing asynchronous signal handlers using the 
module, you may not be able to use logging from within such handlers. This is
because lock implementations in the  module are not always
re-entrant, and so cannot be invoked from such signal handlers.
