(x, y)¶
Return , as defined by the platform C library. Note that the
Python expression  may not return the same result.  The intent of the C
standard is that  be exactly (mathematically; to infinite
precision) equal to  for some integer n such that the result has
the same sign as x and magnitude less than .  Python’s 
returns a result with the sign of y instead, and may not be exactly computable
for float arguments. For example,  is , but
the result of Python’s  is , which cannot be
represented exactly as a float, and rounds to the surprising .  For
this reason, function  is generally preferred when working with
floats, while Python’s  is preferred when working with integers.
