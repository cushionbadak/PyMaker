class (**kw)¶
This concrete  is the backward compatibility policy.  It
replicates the behavior of the email package in Python 3.2.  The
 module also defines an instance of this class,
, that is used as the default policy.  Thus the default
behavior of the email package is to maintain compatibility with Python 3.2.
The following attributes have values that are different from the
 default:


¶
The default is .

The class provides the following concrete implementations of the
abstract methods of :


(sourcelines)¶
The name is parsed as everything up to the ‘’ and returned
unmodified.  The value is determined by stripping leading whitespace off
the remainder of the first line, joining all subsequent lines together,
and stripping any trailing carriage return or linefeed characters.



(name, value)¶
The name and value are returned unmodified.



(name, value)¶
If the value contains binary data, it is converted into a
 object using the  charset.
Otherwise it is returned unmodified.



(name, value)¶
Headers are folded using the  folding
algorithm, which preserves existing line breaks in the value, and wraps
each resulting line to the .  Non-ASCII binary data are
CTE encoded using the  charset.



(name, value)¶
Headers are folded using the  folding
algorithm, which preserves existing line breaks in the value, and wraps
each resulting line to the .  If  is
, non-ascii binary data is CTE encoded using the 
charset.  Otherwise the original source header is used, with its existing
line breaks and any (RFC invalid) binary data it may contain.
