docs:


(data, interval=1)¶
Return the median of grouped continuous data, calculated as the 50th
percentile, using interpolation.  If data is empty, 
is raised.  data can be a sequence or iterator.


In the following example, the data are rounded, so that each value represents
the midpoint of data classes, e.g. 1 is the midpoint of the class 0.5–1.5, 2
is the midpoint of 1.5–2.5, 3 is the midpoint of 2.5–3.5, etc.  With the data
given, the middle value falls somewhere in the class 3.5–4.5, and
interpolation is used to estimate it:


Optional argument interval represents the class interval, and defaults
to 1.  Changing the class interval naturally will change the interpolation:


This function does not check whether the data points are at least
interval apart.

CPython implementation detail: Under some circumstances,  may coerce data points to
floats.  This behaviour is likely to change in the future.
