Trigonometric functions¶


(x)¶
Return the arc cosine of x. There are two branch cuts: One extends right from
1 along the real axis to ∞, continuous from below. The other extends left from
-1 along the real axis to -∞, continuous from above.



(x)¶
Return the arc sine of x. This has the same branch cuts as .



(x)¶
Return the arc tangent of x. There are two branch cuts: One extends from
 along the imaginary axis to , continuous from the right. The
other extends from  along the imaginary axis to , continuous
from the left.



(x)¶
Return the cosine of x.



(x)¶
Return the sine of x.



(x)¶
Return the tangent of x.
