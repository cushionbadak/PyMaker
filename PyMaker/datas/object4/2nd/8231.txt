Automatic indentationÂ¶
After a block-opening statement, the next line is indented by 4 spaces (in the
Python Shell window by one tab).  After certain keywords (break, return etc.)
the next line is dedented.  In leading indentation, Backspace deletes up
to 4 spaces if they are there. Tab inserts spaces (in the Python
Shell window one tab), number depends on Indent width. Currently, tabs
are restricted to four spaces due to Tcl/Tk limitations.
See also the indent/dedent region commands on the
Format menu.
