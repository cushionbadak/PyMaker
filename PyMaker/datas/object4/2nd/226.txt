(value)¶
Resumes the execution and “sends” a value into the generator function.  The
value argument becomes the result of the current yield expression.  The
 method returns the next value yielded by the generator, or
raises  if the generator exits without yielding another
value.  When  is called to start the generator, it must be called
with  as the argument, because there is no yield expression that
could receive the value.
