Read-only Transports¶


()¶
Return  if the transport is receiving new data.

New in version 3.7.




()¶
Pause the receiving end of the transport.  No data will be passed to
the protocol’s 
method until  is called.

Changed in version 3.7: The method is idempotent, i.e. it can be called when the
transport is already paused or closed.




()¶
Resume the receiving end.  The protocol’s
 method
will be called once again if some data is available for reading.

Changed in version 3.7: The method is idempotent, i.e. it can be called when the
transport is already reading.
