docs:


(file, encoding="us-ascii", xml_declaration=None, default_namespace=None, method="xml", *, short_empty_elements=True)¶
Writes the element tree to a file, as XML.  file is a file name, or a
file object opened for writing.  encoding [1] is the output
encoding (default is US-ASCII).
xml_declaration controls if an XML declaration should be added to the
file.  Use  for never,  for always, 
for only if not US-ASCII or UTF-8 or Unicode (default is ).
default_namespace sets the default XML namespace (for “xmlns”).
method is either ,  or  (default is
).
The keyword-only short_empty_elements parameter controls the formatting
of elements that contain no content.  If  (the default), they are
emitted as a single self-closed tag, otherwise they are emitted as a pair
of start/end tags.
The output is either a string () or binary ().
This is controlled by the encoding argument.  If encoding is
, the output is a string; otherwise, it’s binary.  Note that
this may conflict with the type of file if it’s an open
file object; make sure you do not try to write a string to a
binary stream and vice versa.

New in version 3.4: The short_empty_elements parameter.
