Protocol versionsÂ¶
SSL versions 2 and 3 are considered insecure and are therefore dangerous to
use.  If you want maximum compatibility between clients and servers, it is
recommended to use  or
 as the protocol version. SSLv2 and SSLv3 are
disabled by default.


The SSL context created above will only allow TLSv1.2 and later (if
supported by your system) connections to a server. 
implies certificate validation and hostname checks by default. You have to
load certificates into the context.
