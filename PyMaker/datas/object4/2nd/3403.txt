Adding argumentsÂ¶
Filling an  with information about program arguments is
done by making calls to the  method.
Generally, these calls tell the  how to take the strings
on the command line and turn them into objects.  This information is stored and
used when  is called. For example:


Later, calling  will return an object with
two attributes,  and .  The  attribute
will be a list of one or more ints, and the  attribute will be
either the  function, if  was specified at the command line,
or the  function if it was not.
