 Objects¶

New in version 3.5.

 objects represent a call stack ready for formatting.


class ¶


classmethod (frame_gen, *, limit=None, lookup_lines=True, capture_locals=False)¶
Construct a  object from a frame generator (such as
is returned by  or
).
If limit is supplied, only this many frames are taken from frame_gen.
If lookup_lines is , the returned 
objects will not have read their lines in yet, making the cost of
creating the  cheaper (which may be valuable if it
may not actually get formatted). If capture_locals is  the
local variables in each  are captured as object
representations.



classmethod (a_list)¶
Construct a  object from a supplied list of
 objects or old-style list of tuples.  Each tuple
should be a 4-tuple with filename, lineno, name, line as the elements.



()¶
Returns a list of strings ready for printing.  Each string in the
resulting list corresponds to a single frame from the stack.
Each string ends in a newline; the strings may contain internal
newlines as well, for those items with source text lines.
For long sequences of the same frame and line, the first few
repetitions are shown, followed by a summary line stating the exact
number of further repetitions.

Changed in version 3.6: Long sequences of repeated frames are now abbreviated.
