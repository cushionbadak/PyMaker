How do I parcel out work among a bunch of worker threads?¶
The easiest way is to use the new  module,
especially the  class.
Or, if you want fine control over the dispatching algorithm, you can write
your own logic manually.  Use the  module to create a queue
containing a list of jobs.  The  class maintains a
list of objects and has a  method that adds items to the queue and
a  method to return them.  The class will take care of the locking
necessary to ensure that each job is handed out exactly once.
Here’s a trivial example:


When run, this will produce the following output:


Consult the module’s documentation for more details; the 
class provides a featureful interface.
