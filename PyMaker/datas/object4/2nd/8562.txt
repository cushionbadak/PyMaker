The Mock Class¶
 is a flexible mock object intended to replace the use of stubs and
test doubles throughout your code. Mocks are callable and create attributes as
new mocks when you access them [1]. Accessing the same attribute will always
return the same mock. Mocks record how you use them, allowing you to make
assertions about what your code has done to them.
 is a subclass of  with all the magic methods
pre-created and ready to use. There are also non-callable variants, useful
when you are mocking out objects that aren’t callable:
 and 
The  decorators makes it easy to temporarily replace classes
in a particular module with a  object. By default  will create
a  for you. You can specify an alternative class of  using
the new_callable argument to .


class (spec=None, side_effect=None, return_value=DEFAULT, wraps=None, name=None, spec_set=None, unsafe=False, **kwargs)¶
Create a new  object.  takes several optional arguments
that specify the behaviour of the Mock object:

spec: This can be either a list of strings or an existing object (a
class or instance) that acts as the specification for the mock object. If
you pass in an object then a list of strings is formed by calling dir on
the object (excluding unsupported magic attributes and methods).
Accessing any attribute not in this list will raise an .
If spec is an object (rather than a list of strings) then
 returns the class of the spec object. This
allows mocks to pass  tests.

spec_set: A stricter variant of spec. If used, attempting to set
or get an attribute on the mock that isn’t on the object passed as
spec_set will raise an .

side_effect: A function to be called whenever the Mock is called. See
the  attribute. Useful for raising exceptions or
dynamically changing return values. The function is called with the same
arguments as the mock, and unless it returns , the return
value of this function is used as the return value.
Alternatively side_effect can be an exception class or instance. In
this case the exception will be raised when the mock is called.
If side_effect is an iterable then each call to the mock will return
the next value from the iterable.
A side_effect can be cleared by setting it to .

return_value: The value returned when the mock is called. By default
this is a new Mock (created on first access). See the
 attribute.

unsafe: By default if any attribute starts with assert or
assret will raise an . Passing 
will allow access to these attributes.

New in version 3.5.


wraps: Item for the mock object to wrap. If wraps is not  then
calling the Mock will pass the call through to the wrapped object
(returning the real result). Attribute access on the mock will return a
Mock object that wraps the corresponding attribute of the wrapped
object (so attempting to access an attribute that doesn’t exist will
raise an ).
If the mock has an explicit return_value set then calls are not passed
to the wrapped object and the return_value is returned instead.

name: If the mock has a name then it will be used in the repr of the
mock. This can be useful for debugging. The name is propagated to child
mocks.


Mocks can also be called with arbitrary keyword arguments. These will be
used to set attributes on the mock after it is created. See the
 method for details.


(*args, **kwargs)¶
Assert that the mock was called at least once.



New in version 3.6.




(*args, **kwargs)¶
Assert that the mock was called exactly once.



New in version 3.6.




(*args, **kwargs)¶
This method is a convenient way of asserting that calls are made in a
particular way:





(*args, **kwargs)¶
Assert that the mock was called exactly once and that that call was
with the specified arguments.





(*args, **kwargs)¶
assert the mock has been called with the specified arguments.
The assert passes if the mock has ever been called, unlike
 and  that
only pass if the call is the most recent one, and in the case of
 it must also be the only call.





(calls, any_order=False)¶
assert the mock has been called with the specified calls.
The  list is checked for the calls.
If any_order is false (the default) then the calls must be
sequential. There can be extra calls before or after the
specified calls.
If any_order is true then the calls can be in any order, but
they must all appear in .





()¶
Assert the mock was never called.



New in version 3.5.




(*, return_value=False, side_effect=False)¶
The reset_mock method resets all the call attributes on a mock object:



Changed in version 3.6: Added two keyword only argument to the reset_mock function.

This can be useful where you want to make a series of assertions that
reuse the same object. Note that  doesn’t clear the
return value,  or any child attributes you have
set using normal assignment by default. In case you want to reset
return_value or , then pass the corresponding
parameter as . Child mocks and the return value mock
(if any) are reset as well.

Note
return_value, and  are keyword only
argument.




(spec, spec_set=False)¶
Add a spec to a mock. spec can either be an object or a
list of strings. Only attributes on the spec can be fetched as
attributes from the mock.
If spec_set is true then only attributes on the spec can be set.



(mock, attribute)¶
Attach a mock as an attribute of this one, replacing its name and
parent. Calls to the attached mock will be recorded in the
 and  attributes of this one.



(**kwargs)¶
Set attributes on the mock through keyword arguments.
Attributes plus return values and side effects can be set on child
mocks using standard dot notation and unpacking a dictionary in the
method call:


The same thing can be achieved in the constructor call to mocks:


 exists to make it easier to do configuration
after the mock has been created.



()¶
 objects limit the results of  to useful results.
For mocks with a spec this includes all the permitted attributes
for the mock.
See  for what this filtering does, and how to
switch it off.



(**kw)¶
Create the child mocks for attributes and return value.
By default child mocks will be the same type as the parent.
Subclasses of Mock may want to override this to customize the way
child mocks are made.
For non-callable mocks the callable variant will be used (rather than
any custom subclass).



¶
A boolean representing whether or not the mock object has been called:





¶
An integer telling you how many times the mock object has been called:





¶
Set this to configure the value returned by calling the mock:


The default return value is a mock object and you can configure it in
the normal way:


 can also be set in the constructor:





¶
This can either be a function to be called when the mock is called,
an iterable or an exception (class or instance) to be raised.
If you pass in a function it will be called with same arguments as the
mock and unless the function returns the  singleton the
call to the mock will then return whatever the function returns. If the
function returns  then the mock will return its normal
value (from the ).
If you pass in an iterable, it is used to retrieve an iterator which
must yield a value on every call.  This value can either be an exception
instance to be raised, or a value to be returned from the call to the
mock ( handling is identical to the function case).
An example of a mock that raises an exception (to test exception
handling of an API):


Using  to return a sequence of values:


Using a callable:


 can be set in the constructor. Here’s an example that
adds one to the value the mock is called with and returns it:


Setting  to  clears it:





¶
This is either  (if the mock hasn’t been called), or the
arguments that the mock was last called with. This will be in the
form of a tuple: the first member is any ordered arguments the mock
was called with (or an empty tuple) and the second member is any
keyword arguments (or an empty dictionary).


, along with members of the lists ,
 and  are  objects.
These are tuples, so they can be unpacked to get at the individual
arguments and make more complex assertions. See
calls as tuples.



¶
This is a list of all the calls made to the mock object in sequence
(so the length of the list is the number of times it has been
called). Before any calls have been made it is an empty list. The
 object can be used for conveniently constructing lists of
calls to compare with .


Members of  are  objects. These can be
unpacked as tuples to get at the individual arguments. See
calls as tuples.



¶
As well as tracking calls to themselves, mocks also track calls to
methods and attributes, and their methods and attributes:

unpacked as tuples to get at the individual arguments. See
calls as tuples.

magic methods and return value mocks.


Members of  are  objects. These can be
unpacked as tuples to get at the individual arguments. See
calls as tuples.

Note
The way  are recorded means that where nested
calls are made, the parameters of ancestor calls are not recorded
and so will always compare equal:






¶
Normally the  attribute of an object will return its type.
For a mock object with a ,  returns the spec class
instead. This allows mock objects to pass  tests for the
object they are replacing / masquerading as:


 is assignable to, this allows a mock to pass an
 check without forcing you to use a spec:






class (spec=None, wraps=None, name=None, spec_set=None, **kwargs)¶
A non-callable version of . The constructor parameters have the same
meaning of , with the exception of return_value and side_effect
which have no meaning on a non-callable mock.

Mock objects that use a class or an instance as a  or
 are able to pass  tests:


The  classes have support for mocking magic methods. See magic
methods for the full details.
The mock classes and the  decorators all take arbitrary keyword
arguments for configuration. For the  decorators the keywords are
passed to the constructor of the mock being created. The keyword arguments
are for configuring attributes of the mock:


The return value and side effect of child mocks can be set in the same way,
using dotted notation. As you can’t use dotted names directly in a call you
have to create a dictionary and unpack it using :


A callable mock which was created with a spec (or a spec_set) will
introspect the specification object’s signature when matching calls to
the mock.  Therefore, it can match the actual call’s arguments regardless
of whether they were passed positionally or by name:


This applies to ,
,  and
.  When Autospeccing, it will also
apply to method calls on the mock object.


Changed in version 3.4: Added signature introspection on specced and autospecced mock objects.




class (*args, **kwargs)¶
A mock intended to be used as a property, or other descriptor, on a class.
 provides  and  methods
so you can specify a return value when it is fetched.
Fetching a  instance from an object calls the mock, with
no args. Setting it calls the mock with the value being set.



Because of the way mock attributes are stored you can’t directly attach a
 to a mock object. Instead you can attach it to the mock type
object:



Calling¶
Mock objects are callable. The call will return the value set as the
 attribute. The default return value is a new Mock
object; it is created the first time the return value is accessed (either
explicitly or by calling the Mock) - but it is stored and the same one
returned each time.
Calls made to the object will be recorded in the attributes
like  and .
If  is set then it will be called after the call has
been recorded, so if  raises an exception the call is still
recorded.
The simplest way to make a mock raise an exception when called is to make
 an exception class or instance:


If  is a function then whatever that function returns is what
calls to the mock return. The  function is called with the
same arguments as the mock. This allows you to vary the return value of the
call dynamically, based on the input:


If you want the mock to still return the default return value (a new mock), or
any set return value, then there are two ways of doing this. Either return
 from inside , or return :


To remove a , and return to the default behaviour, set the
 to :


The  can also be any iterable object. Repeated calls to the mock
will return values from the iterable (until the iterable is exhausted and
a  is raised):


If any members of the iterable are exceptions they will be raised instead of
returned:




Deleting Attributes¶
Mock objects create attributes on demand. This allows them to pretend to be
objects of any type.
You may want a mock object to return  to a  call, or raise an
 when an attribute is fetched. You can do this by providing
an object as a  for a mock, but that isn’t always convenient.
You “block” attributes by deleting them. Once deleted, accessing an attribute
will raise an .




Mock names and the name attribute¶
Since “name” is an argument to the  constructor, if you want your
mock object to have a “name” attribute you can’t just pass it in at creation
time. There are two alternatives. One option is to use
:


A simpler option is to simply set the “name” attribute after mock creation:




Attaching Mocks as Attributes¶
When you attach a mock as an attribute of another mock (or as the return
value) it becomes a “child” of that mock. Calls to the child are recorded in
the  and  attributes of the
parent. This is useful for configuring child mocks and then attaching them to
the parent, or for attaching mocks to a parent that records all calls to the
children and allows you to make assertions about the order of calls between
mocks:


The exception to this is if the mock has a name. This allows you to prevent
the “parenting” if for some reason you don’t want it to happen.


Mocks created for you by  are automatically given names. To
attach mocks that have names to a parent you use the 
method:





[1]The only exceptions are magic methods and attributes (those that have
leading and trailing double underscores). Mock doesn’t create these but
instead raises an . This is because the interpreter
will often implicitly request these methods, and gets very confused to
get a new Mock object when it expects a magic method. If you need magic
method support see magic methods.
