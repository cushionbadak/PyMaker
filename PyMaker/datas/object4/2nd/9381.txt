docs:


(etype, value, tb, limit=None, file=None, chain=True)Â¶
Print exception information and stack trace entries from traceback object
tb to file. This differs from  in the following
ways:

if tb is not , it prints a header 
it prints the exception etype and value after the stack trace


if type(value) is  and value has the appropriate
format, it prints the line where the syntax error occurred with a caret
indicating the approximate position of the error.

The optional limit argument has the same meaning as for .
If chain is true (the default), then chained exceptions (the
 or  attributes of the exception) will be
printed as well, like the interpreter itself does when printing an unhandled
exception.

Changed in version 3.5: The etype argument is ignored and inferred from the type of value.
