Supported  names¶

 – name of the member
 – value of the member; can be set / modified in 
 – a lookup function used when a value is not found; may be
overridden
 – a list of names, either as a  or a ,
that will not be transformed into members, and will be removed from the final
class
 – used in Python 2/3 code to ensure member order is consistent
(class attribute, removed during class creation)
 – used by the Functional API and by
 to get an appropriate value for an enum member; may be
overridden


New in version 3.6: , , 


New in version 3.7: 

To help keep Python 2 / Python 3 code in sync an  attribute can
be provided.  It will be checked against the actual order of the enumeration
and raise an error if the two do not match:



Note
In Python 2 code the  attribute is necessary as definition
order is lost before it can be recorded.
