(y, x)Â¶
Return , in radians. The result is between  and .
The vector in the plane from the origin to point  makes this angle
with the positive X axis. The point of  is that the signs of both
inputs are known to it, so it can compute the correct quadrant for the angle.
For example,  and  are both , but  is .
