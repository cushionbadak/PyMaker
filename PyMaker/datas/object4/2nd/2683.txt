class ¶
The  class is used to deduce the format of a CSV file.
The  class provides two methods:


(sample, delimiters=None)¶
Analyze the given sample and return a  subclass
reflecting the parameters found.  If the optional delimiters parameter
is given, it is interpreted as a string containing possible valid
delimiter characters.



(sample)¶
Analyze the sample text (presumed to be in CSV format) and return
 if the first row appears to be a series of column headers.
