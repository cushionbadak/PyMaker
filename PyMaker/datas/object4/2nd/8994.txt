class (timer=None, timeunit=0.0, subcalls=True, builtins=True)¶
This class is normally only used if more precise control over profiling is
needed than what the  function provides.
A custom timer can be supplied for measuring how long code takes to run via
the timer argument. This must be a function that returns a single number
representing the current time. If the number is an integer, the timeunit
specifies a multiplier that specifies the duration of each unit of time. For
example, if the timer returns times measured in thousands of seconds, the
time unit would be .
Directly using the  class allows formatting profile results
without writing the profile data to a file:




()¶
Start collecting profiling data.



()¶
Stop collecting profiling data.



()¶
Stop collecting profiling data and record the results internally
as the current profile.



(sort=-1)¶
Create a  object based on the current
profile and print the results to stdout.



(filename)¶
Write the results of the current profile to filename.



(cmd)¶
Profile the cmd via .
