(delay, callback, *args, context=None)Â¶
Schedule callback to be called after the given delay
number of seconds (can be either an int or a float).
An instance of  is returned which can
be used to cancel the callback.
callback will be called exactly once.  If two callbacks are
scheduled for exactly the same time, the order in which they
are called is undefined.
The optional positional args will be passed to the callback when
it is called. If you want the callback to be called with keyword
arguments use .
An optional keyword-only context argument allows specifying a
custom  for the callback to run in.
The current context is used when no context is provided.

Changed in version 3.7: The context keyword-only parameter was added. See PEP 567
for more details.


Changed in version 3.7.1: In Python 3.7.0 and earlier with the default event loop implementation,
the delay could not exceed one day.
This has been fixed in Python 3.7.1.
