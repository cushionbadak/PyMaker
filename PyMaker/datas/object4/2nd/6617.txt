order given. handlers can be either instances of , or
subclasses of  (in which case it must be possible to call
the constructor without any parameters).  Instances of the following classes
will be in front of the handlers, unless the handlers contain them,
instances of them or subclasses of them:  (if proxy
settings are detected), , ,

, , .
If the Python installation has SSL support (i.e., if the  module
can be imported),  will also be added.
A  subclass may also change its 
attribute to modify its position in the handlers list.
