class (filename, mode='r', buffering=None, compresslevel=9)¶
Open a bzip2-compressed file in binary mode.
If filename is a  or  object, open the named file
directly. Otherwise, filename should be a file object, which will
be used to read or write the compressed data.
The mode argument can be either  for reading (default),  for
overwriting,  for exclusive creation, or  for appending. These
can equivalently be given as , ,  and 
respectively.
If filename is a file object (rather than an actual file name), a mode of
 does not truncate the file, and is instead equivalent to .
The buffering argument is ignored. Its use is deprecated.
If mode is  or , compresslevel can be an integer between
 and  specifying the level of compression:  produces the
least compression, and  (default) produces the most compression.
If mode is , the input file may be the concatenation of multiple
compressed streams.
 provides all of the members specified by the
, except for  and .
Iteration and the  statement are supported.
 also provides the following method:


([n])¶
Return buffered data without advancing the file position. At least one
byte of data will be returned (unless at EOF). The exact number of bytes
returned is unspecified.

Note
While calling  does not change the file position of
the , it may change the position of the underlying file
object (e.g. if the  was constructed by passing a file
object for filename).
