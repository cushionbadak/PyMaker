Testing WarningsÂ¶
To test warnings raised by code, use the  context
manager. With it you can temporarily mutate the warnings filter to facilitate
your testing. For instance, do the following to capture all raised warnings to
check:


One can also cause all warnings to be exceptions by using  instead of
. One thing to be aware of is that if a warning has already been
raised because of a / rule, then no matter what filters are
set the warning will not be seen again unless the warnings registry related to
the warning has been cleared.
Once the context manager exits, the warnings filter is restored to its state
when the context was entered. This prevents tests from changing the warnings
filter in unexpected ways between tests and leading to indeterminate test
results. The  function in the module is also restored to
its original value.  Note: this can only be guaranteed in a single-threaded
application. If two or more threads use the  context
manager at the same time, the behavior is undefined.
When testing multiple operations that raise the same kind of warning, it
is important to test them in a manner that confirms each operation is raising
a new warning (e.g. set warnings to be raised as exceptions and check the
operations raise exceptions, check that the length of the warning list
continues to increase after each operation, or else delete the previous
entries from the warnings list before each new operation).
