docs:


(module, pattern=None)Â¶
Return a suite of all test cases contained in the given module. This
method searches module for classes derived from  and
creates an instance of the class for each test method defined for the
class.

Note
While using a hierarchy of -derived classes can be
convenient in sharing fixtures and helper functions, defining test
methods on base classes that are not intended to be instantiated
directly does not play well with this method.  Doing so, however, can
be useful when the fixtures are different and defined in subclasses.

If a module provides a  function it will be called to
load the tests. This allows modules to customize test loading.
This is the load_tests protocol.  The pattern argument is passed as
the third argument to .

Changed in version 3.2: Support for  added.


Changed in version 3.5: The undocumented and unofficial use_load_tests default argument is
deprecated and ignored, although it is still accepted for backward
compatibility.  The method also now accepts a keyword-only argument
pattern which is passed to  as the third argument.
