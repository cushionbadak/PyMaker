Column Identifiers¶
Column identifiers take any of the following forms:

A symbolic name from the list of columns option.
An integer n, specifying the nth data column.
A string of the form #n, where n is an integer, specifying the nth display
column.

Notes:

Item’s option values may be displayed in a different order than the order
in which they are stored.
Column #0 always refers to the tree column, even if show=”tree” is not
specified.

A data column number is an index into an item’s option values list; a display
column number is the column number in the tree where the values are displayed.
Tree labels are displayed in column #0. If option displaycolumns is not set,
then data column n is displayed in column #n+1. Again, column #0 always
refers to the tree column.
