docs:


(name)¶
This method takes one parameter, the name of a method implemented by the XML-RPC
server. It returns an array of possible signatures for this method. A signature
is an array of types. The first of these types is the return type of the method,
the rest are parameters.
Because multiple signatures (ie. overloading) is permitted, this method returns
a list of signatures rather than a singleton.
Signatures themselves are restricted to the top level parameters expected by a
method. For instance if a method expects one array of structs as a parameter,
and it returns a string, its signature is simply “string, array”. If it expects
three integers and returns a string, its signature is “string, int, int, int”.
If no signature is defined for the method, a non-array value is returned. In
Python this means that the type of the returned  value will be something other
than list.
