6.12. Conditional expressions¶

Conditional expressions (sometimes called a “ternary operator”) have the lowest
priority of all Python operations.
The expression  first evaluates the condition, C rather than x.
If C is true, x is evaluated and its value is returned; otherwise, y is
evaluated and its value is returned.
See PEP 308 for more details about conditional expressions.
