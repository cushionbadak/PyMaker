coroutine ()Â¶
Returns an awaitable which when run starts to execute the asynchronous
generator or resumes it at the last executed yield expression.  When an
asynchronous generator function is resumed with an 
method, the current yield expression always evaluates to  in
the returned awaitable, which when run will continue to the next yield
expression. The value of the  of the yield
expression is the value of the  exception raised by
the completing coroutine.  If the asynchronous generator exits without
yielding another value, the awaitable instead raises a
 exception, signalling that the asynchronous
iteration has completed.
This method is normally called implicitly by a  loop.
