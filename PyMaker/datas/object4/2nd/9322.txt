Init-only variablesÂ¶
The other place where  inspects a type annotation is to
determine if a field is an init-only variable.  It does this by seeing
if the type of a field is of type .  If a field
is an , it is considered a pseudo-field called an init-only
field.  As it is not a true field, it is not returned by the
module-level  function.  Init-only fields are added as
parameters to the generated  method, and are passed to
the optional  method.  They are not otherwise used
by dataclasses.
For example, suppose a field will be initialized from a database, if a
value is not provided when creating the class:


In this case,  will return  objects for  and
, but not for .
