docs:


(msg, unixfrom=False, linesep=None)Â¶
Print the textual representation of the message object structure rooted
at msg to the output file specified when the 
instance was created.
If the  option 
is , generate the message as if the option were set to .
(This is required because strings cannot represent non-ASCII bytes.)
Convert any bytes with the high bit set as needed using an
ASCII-compatible Content-Transfer-Encoding.  That is,
transform parts with non-ASCII Content-Transfer-Encoding
(Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit) to an ASCII compatible
Content-Transfer-Encoding, and encode RFC-invalid non-ASCII
bytes in headers using the MIME  character set, thus
rendering them RFC-compliant.
If unixfrom is , print the envelope header delimiter used by
the Unix mailbox format (see ) before the first of the
RFC 5322 headers of the root message object.  If the root object has
no envelope header, craft a standard one.  The default is .
Note that for subparts, no envelope header is ever printed.
If linesep is not , use it as the separator character between
all the lines of the flattened message.  If linesep is  (the
default), use the value specified in the policy.

Changed in version 3.2: Added support for re-encoding  message bodies, and the
linesep argument.
