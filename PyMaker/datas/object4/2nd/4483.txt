class (*, dwFlags=0, hStdInput=None, hStdOutput=None, hStdError=None, wShowWindow=0, lpAttributeList=None)¶
Partial support of the Windows
STARTUPINFO
structure is used for  creation.  The following attributes can
be set by passing them as keyword-only arguments.

Changed in version 3.7: Keyword-only argument support was added.



¶
A bit field that determines whether certain 
attributes are used when the process creates a window.





¶
If  specifies , this attribute
is the standard input handle for the process. If
 is not specified, the default for standard
input is the keyboard buffer.



¶
If  specifies , this attribute
is the standard output handle for the process. Otherwise, this attribute
is ignored and the default for standard output is the console window’s
buffer.



¶
If  specifies , this attribute
is the standard error handle for the process. Otherwise, this attribute is
ignored and the default for standard error is the console window’s buffer.



¶
If  specifies , this attribute
can be any of the values that can be specified in the 
parameter for the

ignored.
 is provided for this attribute. It is used when
 is called with .



¶
A dictionary of additional attributes for process creation as given in
, see
UpdateProcThreadAttribute.
Supported attributes:

handle_list
Sequence of handles that will be inherited. close_fds must be true if
non-empty.
The handles must be temporarily made inheritable by
 when passed to the 
constructor, else  will be raised with Windows error
 (87).

Warning
In a multithreaded process, use caution to avoid leaking handles
that are marked inheritable when combining this feature with
concurrent calls to other process creation functions that inherit
all handles such as .  This also applies to
standard handle redirection, which temporarily creates inheritable
handles.




New in version 3.7.
