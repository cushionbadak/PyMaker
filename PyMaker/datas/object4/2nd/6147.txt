TreeBuilder Objects¶


class (element_factory=None)¶
Generic element structure builder.  This builder converts a sequence of
start, data, and end method calls to a well-formed element structure.  You
can use this class to build an element structure using a custom XML parser,
or a parser for some other XML-like format.  element_factory, when given,
must be a callable accepting two positional arguments: a tag and
a dict of attributes.  It is expected to return a new element instance.


()¶
Flushes the builder buffers, and returns the toplevel document
element.  Returns an  instance.



(data)¶
Adds text to the current element.  data is a string.  This should be
either a bytestring, or a Unicode string.



(tag)¶
Closes the current element.  tag is the element name.  Returns the
closed element.



(tag, attrs)¶
Opens a new element.  tag is the element name.  attrs is a dictionary
containing element attributes.  Returns the opened element.

In addition, a custom  object can provide the
following method:


(name, pubid, system)¶
Handles a doctype declaration.  name is the doctype name.  pubid is
the public identifier.  system is the system identifier.  This method
does not exist on the default  class.

New in version 3.2.
