()Â¶
If you have carried out a lot of deletions and would like to shrink the space
used by the  file, this routine will reorganize the database.  
objects will not shorten the length of a database file except by using this
reorganization; otherwise, deleted file space will be kept and reused as new
(key, value) pairs are added.
