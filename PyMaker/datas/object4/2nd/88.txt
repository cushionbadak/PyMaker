(self)¶
Called to implement the built-in function .  Should return the length
of the object, an integer  0.  Also, an object that doesn’t define a
 method and whose  method returns zero is
considered to be false in a Boolean context.

CPython implementation detail: In CPython, the length is required to be at most .
If the length is larger than  some features (such as
) may raise .  To prevent raising
 by truth value testing, an object must define a
 method.
