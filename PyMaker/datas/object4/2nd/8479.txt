docs:


(first, second, msg=None)¶
Test that sequence first contains the same elements as second,
regardless of their order. When they don’t, an error message listing the
differences between the sequences will be generated.
Duplicate elements are not ignored when comparing first and
second. It verifies whether each element has the same count in both
sequences. Equivalent to:

but works with sequences of unhashable objects as well.

New in version 3.2.
