docs:


(count)Â¶
This is similar to ,
but is used for  call syntax.  The stack item at
position  should be the corresponding callable .

New in version 3.5.


Changed in version 3.6: The position of the callable is determined by adding 2 to the opcode
argument instead of encoding it in the second byte of the argument.
