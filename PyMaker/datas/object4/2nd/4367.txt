docs:


(func[, args[, kwds[, callback[, error_callback]]]])Â¶
A variant of the  method which returns a result object.
If callback is specified then it should be a callable which accepts a
single argument.  When the result becomes ready callback is applied to
it, that is unless the call failed, in which case the error_callback
is applied instead.
If error_callback is specified then it should be a callable which
accepts a single argument.  If the target function fails, then
the error_callback is called with the exception instance.
Callbacks should complete immediately since otherwise the thread which
handles the results will get blocked.
