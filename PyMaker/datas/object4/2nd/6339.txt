docs:


(name, qname, attrs)Â¶
Signals the start of an element in namespace mode.
The name parameter contains the name of the element type as a  tuple, the qname parameter contains the raw XML 1.0 name used in
the source document, and the attrs parameter holds an instance of the
 interface (see
The AttributesNS Interface)
containing the attributes of the element.  If no namespace is associated with
the element, the uri component of name will be .  The object passed
as attrs may be re-used by the parser; holding on to a reference to it is not
a reliable way to keep a copy of the attributes.  To keep a copy of the
attributes, use the  method of the attrs object.
Parsers may set the qname parameter to , unless the
 feature is activated.
