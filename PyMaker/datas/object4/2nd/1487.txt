ComparisonsÂ¶
Enumeration members are compared by identity:


Ordered comparisons between enumeration values are not supported.  Enum
members are not integers (but see IntEnum below):


Equality comparisons are defined though:


Comparisons against non-enumeration values will always compare not equal
(again,  was explicitly designed to behave differently, see
below):
