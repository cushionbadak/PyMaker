 Examples and Recipes¶
This section shows various approaches to working with chained maps.
Example of simulating Python’s internal lookup chain:


Example of letting user specified command-line arguments take precedence over
environment variables which in turn take precedence over default values:


Example patterns for using the  class to simulate nested
contexts:


The  class only makes updates (writes and deletions) to the
first mapping in the chain while lookups will search the full chain.  However,
if deep writes and deletions are desired, it is easy to make a subclass that
updates keys found deeper in the chain:
