docs:


(path, data)Â¶
Optional abstract method which writes the specified bytes to a file
path. Any intermediate directories which do not exist are to be created
automatically.
When writing to the path fails because the path is read-only
(/), do not propagate the
exception.

Changed in version 3.4: No longer raises  when called.
