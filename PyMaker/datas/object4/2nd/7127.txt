class ¶
Forking and threading versions of each type of server can be created
using these mix-in classes.  For instance, 
is created as follows:


The mix-in class comes first, since it overrides a method defined in
.  Setting the various attributes also changes the
behavior of the underlying server mechanism.
 and the Forking classes mentioned below are
only available on POSIX platforms that support .
 waits until all child
processes complete, except if
 attribute is false.
 waits until all non-daemon
threads complete, except if
 attribute is false. Use
daemonic threads by setting

 now waits until all
child processes and non-daemonic threads complete.
Add a new  class
attribute to opt-in for the pre-3.7 behaviour.
