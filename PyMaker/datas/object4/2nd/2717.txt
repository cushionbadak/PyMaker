Interpolation of values¶
On top of the core functionality,  supports
interpolation.  This means values can be preprocessed before returning them
from  calls.


class ¶
The default implementation used by .  It enables
values to contain format strings which refer to other values in the same
section, or values in the special default section [1].  Additional default
values can be provided on initialization.
For example:


In the example above,  with interpolation set to
 would resolve  to the value of
 ( in this case).   in effect would
resolve to .  All interpolations are done on demand so
keys used in the chain of references do not have to be specified in any
specific order in the configuration file.
With  set to , the parser would simply return
 as the value of  and
 as the value of .



class ¶
An alternative handler for interpolation which implements a more advanced
syntax, used for instance in .  Extended interpolation is
using  to denote a value from a foreign section.
Interpolation can span multiple levels.  For convenience, if the
 part is omitted, interpolation defaults to the current section
(and possibly the default values from the special section).
For example, the configuration specified above with basic interpolation,
would look like this with extended interpolation:


Values from other sections can be fetched as well:
