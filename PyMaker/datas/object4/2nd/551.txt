docs:


()Â¶
Return the data in the buffer as a bytestring.  This is equivalent to
calling the  constructor on the memoryview.


For non-contiguous arrays the result is equal to the flattened list
representation with all elements converted to bytes. 
supports all format strings, including those that are not in
 module syntax.
