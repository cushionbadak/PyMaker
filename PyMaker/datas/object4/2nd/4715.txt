docs:


coroutine ()Â¶
Wait for the child process to terminate.
Set and return the  attribute.

Note
This method can deadlock when using  or
 and the child process generates so much output
that it blocks waiting for the OS pipe buffer to accept
more data. Use the  method when using pipes
to avoid this condition.
