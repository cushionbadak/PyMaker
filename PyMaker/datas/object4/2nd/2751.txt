docs:


(section)Â¶
Add a section named section to the instance.  If a section by the given
name already exists,  is raised.  If the
default section name is passed,  is raised.
Type of section is not checked which lets users create non-string named
sections.  This behaviour is unsupported and may cause internal errors.
