(name, value)¶
Header folding is controlled by the  policy setting.
A value is considered to be a ‘source value’ if and only if it does not
have a  attribute (having a  attribute means it is a
header object of some sort).  If a source value needs to be refolded
according to the policy, it is converted into a header object by
passing the name and the value with any CR and LF characters removed
to the .  Folding of a header object is done by
calling its  method with the current policy.
Source values are split into lines using .  If
the value is not to be refolded, the lines are rejoined using the
 from the policy and returned.  The exception is lines
containing non-ascii binary data.  In that case the value is refolded
regardless of the  setting, which causes the binary data
to be CTE encoded using the  charset.
