(files=None)Â¶
Initialize the internal data structures.  If given, files must be a sequence
of file names which should be used to augment the default type map.  If omitted,
the file names to use are taken from ; on Windows, the
current registry settings are loaded.  Each file named in files or
 takes precedence over those named before it.  Calling
 repeatedly is allowed.
Specifying an empty list for files will prevent the system defaults from
being applied: only the well-known values will be present from a built-in list.

Changed in version 3.2: Previously, Windows registry settings were ignored.
