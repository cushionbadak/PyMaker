docs:


()Â¶
Accept a connection. The socket must be bound to an address and listening for
connections. The return value is a pair  where conn is a
new socket object usable to send and receive data on the connection, and
address is the address bound to the socket on the other end of the connection.
The newly created socket is non-inheritable.

Changed in version 3.4: The socket is now non-inheritable.


Changed in version 3.5: If the system call is interrupted and the signal handler does not raise
an exception, the method now retries the system call instead of raising
an  exception (see PEP 475 for the rationale).
