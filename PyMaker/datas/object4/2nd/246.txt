6.9. Binary bitwise operationsÂ¶
Each of the three bitwise operations has a different priority level:

The  operator yields the bitwise AND of its arguments, which must be
integers.
The  operator yields the bitwise XOR (exclusive OR) of its arguments, which
must be integers.
The  operator yields the bitwise (inclusive) OR of its arguments, which
must be integers.
