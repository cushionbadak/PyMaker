Class Objects¶
Class  instances describe classes defined by class
statements.  They have the same attributes as Functions and two more.


¶
Name of the file in which the class is defined.



¶
The name of the module defining the class described.



¶
The name of the class.



¶
The line number in the file where the definition starts.



¶
For top-level classes, None.  For nested classes, the parent.

New in version 3.7.




¶
A dictionary mapping names to descriptors for nested functions and
classes.

New in version 3.7.




¶
A list of  objects which describe the immediate base
classes of the class being described.  Classes which are named as
superclasses but which are not discoverable by 
are listed as a string with the class name instead of as
 objects.



¶
A dictionary mapping method names to line numbers.  This can be
derived from the newer children dictionary, but remains for
back-compatibility.
