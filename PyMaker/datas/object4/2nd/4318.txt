docs:


(block=True, timeout=None)¶
Acquire a lock, blocking or non-blocking.
When invoked with the block argument set to , block until the
lock is in an unlocked state (not owned by any process or thread) unless
the lock is already owned by the current process or thread.  The current
process or thread then takes ownership of the lock (if it does not
already have ownership) and the recursion level inside the lock increments
by one, resulting in a return value of .  Note that there are
several differences in this first argument’s behavior compared to the
implementation of , starting with the name
of the argument itself.
When invoked with the block argument set to , do not block.
If the lock has already been acquired (and thus is owned) by another
process or thread, the current process or thread does not take ownership
and the recursion level within the lock is not changed, resulting in
a return value of .  If the lock is in an unlocked state, the
current process or thread takes ownership and the recursion level is
incremented, resulting in a return value of .
Use and behaviors of the timeout argument are the same as in
.  Note that some of these behaviors of timeout
differ from the implemented behaviors in .
