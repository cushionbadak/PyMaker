(test_case, module, name_of_module=None, extra=(), blacklist=())¶
Assert that the  variable of module contains all public names.
The module’s public names (its API) are detected automatically
based on whether they match the public name convention and were defined in
module.
The name_of_module argument can specify (as a string or tuple thereof) what
module(s) an API could be defined in order to be detected as a public
API. One case for this is when module imports part of its public API from
other modules, possibly a C backend (like  and its ).
The extra argument can be a set of names that wouldn’t otherwise be automatically
detected as “public”, like objects without a proper 
attribute. If provided, it will be added to the automatically detected ones.
The blacklist argument can be a set of names that must not be treated as part of
the public API even though their names indicate otherwise.
Example use:



New in version 3.6.
