class (...)¶

Deprecated since version 3.3.

 subclasses  providing default handling
for the following HTTP response codes: 301, 302, 303, 307 and 401.  For the 30x
response codes listed above, the Location header is used to fetch
the actual URL.  For 401 response codes (authentication required), basic HTTP
authentication is performed.  For the 30x response codes, recursion is bounded
by the value of the maxtries attribute, which defaults to 10.
For all other response codes, the method  is called
which you can override in subclasses to handle the error appropriately.

Note
According to the letter of RFC 2616, 301 and 302 responses to POST requests
must not be automatically redirected without confirmation by the user.  In
reality, browsers do allow automatic redirection of these responses, changing
the POST to a GET, and  reproduces this behaviour.

The parameters to the constructor are the same as those for .

Note
When performing basic authentication, a  instance calls
its  method.  The default implementation asks the
users for the required information on the controlling terminal.  A subclass may
override this method to support more appropriate behavior if needed.

The  class offers one additional method that should be
overloaded to provide the appropriate behavior:


(host, realm)¶
Return information needed to authenticate the user at the given host in the
specified security realm.  The return value should be a tuple, , which can be used for basic authentication.
The implementation prompts for this information on the terminal; an application
should override this method to use an appropriate interaction model in the local
environment.
