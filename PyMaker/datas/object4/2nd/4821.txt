docs:


awaitable (executor, func, *args)Â¶
Arrange for func to be called in the specified executor.
The executor argument should be an 
instance. The default executor is used if executor is .
Example:


This method returns a  object.
Use  to pass keyword arguments to func.

Changed in version 3.5.3:  no longer configures the
 of the thread pool executor it creates, instead
leaving it up to the thread pool executor
() to set the
default.
