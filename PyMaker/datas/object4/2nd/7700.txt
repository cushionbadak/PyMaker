()Â¶
Returns a bitmask indicating stereo mixer controls.  If a bit is set, the
corresponding control is stereo; if it is unset, the control is either
monophonic or not supported by the mixer (use in combination with
 to determine which).
See the code example for the  function for an example of getting
data from a bitmask.
