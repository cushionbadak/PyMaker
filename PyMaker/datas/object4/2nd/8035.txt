The Window Manager¶
In Tk, there is a utility command, , for interacting with the window
manager.  Options to the  command allow you to control things like titles,
placement, icon bitmaps, and the like.  In , these commands have
been implemented as methods on the  class.  Toplevel widgets are
subclassed from the  class, and so can call the  methods
directly.
To get at the toplevel window that contains a given widget, you can often just
refer to the widget’s master.  Of course if the widget has been packed inside of
a frame, the master won’t represent a toplevel window.  To get at the toplevel
window that contains an arbitrary widget, you can call the  method.
This method begins with an underscore to denote the fact that this function is
part of the implementation, and not an interface to Tk functionality.
Here are some examples of typical usage:
