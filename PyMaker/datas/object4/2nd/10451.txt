(fd, request, arg=0, mutate_flag=True)¶
This function is identical to the  function, except
that the argument handling is even more complicated.
The request parameter is limited to values that can fit in 32-bits.
Additional constants of interest for use as the request argument can be
found in the  module, under the same names as used in
the relevant C header files.
The parameter arg can be one of an integer, an object supporting the
read-only buffer interface (like ) or an object supporting
the read-write buffer interface (like ).
In all but the last case, behaviour is as for the 
function.
If a mutable buffer is passed, then the behaviour is determined by the value of
the mutate_flag parameter.
If it is false, the buffer’s mutability is ignored and behaviour is as for a
read-only buffer, except that the 1024 byte limit mentioned above is avoided –
so long as the buffer you pass is at least as long as what the operating system
wants to put there, things should work.
If mutate_flag is true (the default), then the buffer is (in effect) passed
to the underlying  system call, the latter’s return code is
passed back to the calling Python, and the buffer’s new contents reflect the
action of the .  This is a slight simplification, because if the
supplied buffer is less than 1024 bytes long it is first copied into a static
buffer 1024 bytes long which is then passed to  and copied back
into the supplied buffer.
If the  fails, an  exception is raised.
