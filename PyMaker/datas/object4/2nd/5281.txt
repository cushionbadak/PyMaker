Self-signed certificatesÂ¶
If you are going to create a server that provides SSL-encrypted connection
services, you will need to acquire a certificate for that service.  There are

certification authority.  Another common practice is to generate a self-signed
certificate.  The simplest way to do this is with the OpenSSL package, using
something like the following:


The disadvantage of a self-signed certificate is that it is its own root
certificate, and no one else will have it in their cache of known (and trusted)
root certificates.
