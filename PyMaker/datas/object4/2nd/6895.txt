docs:


(which, howmuch)¶
Retrieves the message header plus howmuch lines of the message after the
header of message number which. Result is in form .
The POP3 TOP command this method uses, unlike the RETR command, doesn’t set the
message’s seen flag; unfortunately, TOP is poorly specified in the RFCs and is
frequently broken in off-brand servers. Test this method by hand against the
POP3 servers you will use before trusting it.
