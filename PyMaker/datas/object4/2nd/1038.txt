class (stream, errors='strict')¶
Constructor for a  instance.
All stream writers must provide this constructor interface. They are free to add
additional keyword arguments, but only the ones defined here are used by the
Python codec registry.
The stream argument must be a file-like object open for writing
text or binary data, as appropriate for the specific codec.
The  may implement different error handling schemes by
providing the errors keyword argument. See Error Handlers for
the standard error handlers the underlying stream codec may support.
The errors argument will be assigned to an attribute of the same name.
Assigning to this attribute makes it possible to switch between different error
handling strategies during the lifetime of the  object.


(object)¶
Writes the object’s contents encoded to the stream.



(list)¶
Writes the concatenated list of strings to the stream (possibly by reusing
the  method). The standard bytes-to-bytes codecs
do not support this method.



()¶
Flushes and resets the codec buffers used for keeping state.
Calling this method should ensure that the data on the output is put into
a clean state that allows appending of new fresh data without having to
rescan the whole stream to recover state.
