class (checker=None, verbose=None, optionflags=0)¶
A subclass of  that raises an exception as soon as a
failure is encountered.  If an unexpected exception occurs, an
 exception is raised, containing the test, the
example, and the original exception.  If the output doesn’t match, then a
 exception is raised, containing the test, the example, and
the actual output.
For information about the constructor parameters and methods, see the
documentation for  in section Advanced API.
