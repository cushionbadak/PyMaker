(cmd, rest=None)¶
Initiate a transfer over the data connection.  If the transfer is active, send an
 or   command and the transfer command specified by cmd, and
accept the connection.  If the server is passive, send an  or 
command, connect to it, and start the transfer command.  Either way, return the
socket for the connection.
If optional rest is given, a  command is sent to the server, passing
rest as an argument.  rest is usually a byte offset into the requested file,
telling the server to restart sending the file’s bytes at the requested offset,
skipping over the initial bytes.  Note however that RFC 959 requires only that
rest be a string containing characters in the printable range from ASCII code
33 to ASCII code 126.  The  method, therefore, converts
rest to a string, but no check is performed on the string’s contents.  If the
server does not recognize the  command, an  exception
will be raised.  If this happens, simply call  without a
rest argument.
