7.7. The  statementÂ¶

A  statement is semantically equivalent to a yield
expression. The yield statement can be used to omit the parentheses
that would otherwise be required in the equivalent yield expression
statement. For example, the yield statements


are equivalent to the yield expression statements


Yield expressions and statements are only used when defining a generator
function, and are only used in the body of the generator function.  Using yield
in a function definition is sufficient to cause that definition to create a
generator function instead of a normal function.
For full details of  semantics, refer to the
Yield expressions section.
