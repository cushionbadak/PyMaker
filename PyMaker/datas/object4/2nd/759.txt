¶
Make , , ,  and case-insensitive matching
dependent on the current locale.  This flag can be used only with bytes
patterns.  The use of this flag is discouraged as the locale mechanism
is very unreliable, it only handles one “culture” at a time, and it only
works with 8-bit locales.  Unicode matching is already enabled by default
in Python 3 for Unicode (str) patterns, and it is able to handle different
locales/languages.
Corresponds to the inline flag .

Changed in version 3.6:  can be used only with bytes patterns and is
not compatible with .


Changed in version 3.7: Compiled regular expression objects with the  flag no
longer depend on the locale at compile time.  Only the locale at
matching time affects the result of matching.
