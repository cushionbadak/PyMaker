XPath support¶
This module provides limited support for
XPath expressions for locating elements in a
tree.  The goal is to support a small subset of the abbreviated syntax; a full
XPath engine is outside the scope of the module.

Example¶
Here’s an example that demonstrates some of the XPath capabilities of the
module.  We’ll be using the  XML document from the
Parsing XML section:




Supported XPath syntax¶






Syntax
Meaning




Selects all child elements with the given tag.
For example,  selects all child elements
named , and  selects all
grandchildren named  in all children named
.


Selects all child elements.  For example, 
selects all grandchildren named .


Selects the current node.  This is mostly useful
at the beginning of the path, to indicate that it’s
a relative path.


Selects all subelements, on all levels beneath the
current  element.  For example,  selects
all  elements in the entire tree.


Selects the parent element.  Returns  if the
path attempts to reach the ancestors of the start
element (the element  was called on).


Selects all elements that have the given attribute.


Selects all elements for which the given attribute
has the given value.  The value cannot contain
quotes.


Selects all elements that have a child named
.  Only immediate children are supported.


Selects all elements whose complete text content,
including descendants, equals the given .

New in version 3.7.




Selects all elements that have a child named
 whose complete text content, including
descendants, equals the given .


Selects all elements that are located at the given
position.  The position can be either an integer
(1 is the first position), the expression 
(for the last position), or a position relative to
the last position (e.g. ).



Predicates (expressions within square brackets) must be preceded by a tag
name, an asterisk, or another predicate.   predicates must be
preceded by a tag name.
