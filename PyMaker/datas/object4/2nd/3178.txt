(mode, file, args, env)¶
Execute the program path in a new process.
(Note that the  module provides more powerful facilities for
spawning new processes and retrieving their results; using that module is
preferable to using these functions.  Check especially the
Replacing Older Functions with the subprocess Module section.)
If mode is , this function returns the process id of the new
process; if mode is , returns the process’s exit code if it
exits normally, or , where signal is the signal that killed the
process.  On Windows, the process id will actually be the process handle, so can
be used with the  function.
The “l” and “v” variants of the  functions differ in how
command-line arguments are passed.  The “l” variants are perhaps the easiest
to work with if the number of parameters is fixed when the code is written; the
individual parameters simply become additional parameters to the
 functions.  The “v” variants are good when the number of
parameters is variable, with the arguments being passed in a list or tuple as
the args parameter.  In either case, the arguments to the child process must
start with the name of the command being run.
The variants which include a second “p” near the end (,
, , and ) will use the
 environment variable to locate the program file.  When the
environment is being replaced (using one of the  variants,
discussed in the next paragraph), the new environment is used as the source of
the  variable.  The other variants, ,
, , and , will not use the
 variable to locate the executable; path must contain an
appropriate absolute or relative path.
For , , , and 
(note that these all end in “e”), the env parameter must be a mapping
which is used to define the environment variables for the new process (they are
used instead of the current process’ environment); the functions
, , , and  all cause
the new process to inherit the environment of the current process.  Note that
keys and values in the env dictionary must be strings; invalid keys or
values will cause the function to fail, with a return value of .
As an example, the following calls to  and  are
equivalent:


Availability: Unix, Windows.  , , 
and  are not available on Windows.   and
 are not thread-safe on Windows; we advise you to use the
 module instead.

Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a path-like object.
