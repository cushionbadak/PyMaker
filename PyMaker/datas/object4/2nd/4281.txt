docs:


()¶
Prevent  from blocking.  In particular, this prevents
the background thread from being joined automatically when the process
exits – see .

.  It is likely to cause enqueued
data to lost, and you almost certainly will not need to use it.
It is really only there if you need the current process to exit
immediately without waiting to flush enqueued data to the
underlying pipe, and you don’t care about lost data.
