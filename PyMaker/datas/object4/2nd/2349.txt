docs:


class (dict, protocol=None, writeback=False, keyencoding='utf-8')Â¶
A subclass of  which stores pickled
values in the dict object.
By default, version 3 pickles are used to serialize values.  The version of the
pickle protocol can be specified with the protocol parameter. See the
 documentation for a discussion of the pickle protocols.
If the writeback parameter is , the object will hold a cache of all
entries accessed and write them back to the dict at sync and close times.
This allows natural operations on mutable entries, but can consume much more
memory and make sync and close take a long time.
The keyencoding parameter is the encoding used to encode keys before they
are used with the underlying dict.
A  object can also be used as a context manager, in which
case it will be automatically closed when the  block ends.

Changed in version 3.2: Added the keyencoding parameter; previously, keys were always encoded in
UTF-8.


Changed in version 3.4: Added context manager support.
