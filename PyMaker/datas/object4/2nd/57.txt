(self, name)Â¶
Called unconditionally to implement attribute accesses for instances of the
class. If the class also defines , the latter will not be
called unless  either calls it explicitly or raises an
. This method should return the (computed) attribute value
or raise an  exception. In order to avoid infinite
recursion in this method, its implementation should always call the base class
method with the same name to access any attributes it needs, for example,
.

Note
This method may still be bypassed when looking up special methods as the
result of implicit invocation via language syntax or built-in functions.
See Special method lookup.
