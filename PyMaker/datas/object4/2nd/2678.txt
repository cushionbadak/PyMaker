class (f, fieldnames, restval='', extrasaction='raise', dialect='excel', *args, **kwds)Â¶
Create an object which operates like a regular writer but maps dictionaries
onto output rows.  The fieldnames parameter is a  of keys that identify the order in which values in the
dictionary passed to the  method are written to file
f.  The optional restval parameter specifies the value to be
written if the dictionary is missing a key in fieldnames.  If the
dictionary passed to the  method contains a key not found in
fieldnames, the optional extrasaction parameter indicates what action to
take.
If it is set to , the default value, a 
is raised.
If it is set to , extra values in the dictionary are ignored.
Any other optional or keyword arguments are passed to the underlying
 instance.
Note that unlike the  class, the fieldnames parameter
of the  class is not optional.
