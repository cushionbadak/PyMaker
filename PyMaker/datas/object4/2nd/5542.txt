class (_class=None, *, policy=policy.compat32)¶
Create a  instance.  The _class and policy
arguments have the same meaning and semantics as the _factory
and policy arguments of .
Note: The policy keyword should always be specified; The default will
change to  in a future version of Python.

Changed in version 3.3: Removed the strict argument that was deprecated in 2.4.  Added the
policy keyword.


Changed in version 3.6: _class defaults to the policy .



(fp, headersonly=False)¶
Read all the data from the binary file-like object fp, parse the
resulting bytes, and return the message object.  fp must support
both the  and the 
methods.
The bytes contained in fp must be formatted as a block of RFC 5322
(or, if  is , RFC 6532)
style headers and header continuation lines, optionally preceded by an
envelope header.  The header block is terminated either by the end of the
data or by a blank line.  Following the header block is the body of the
message (which may contain MIME-encoded subparts, including subparts
with a Content-Transfer-Encoding of ).
Optional headersonly is a flag specifying whether to stop parsing after
reading the headers or not.  The default is , meaning it parses
the entire contents of the file.



(bytes, headersonly=False)¶
Similar to the  method, except it takes a bytes-like
object instead of a file-like object.  Calling this method on a
bytes-like object is equivalent to wrapping bytes in a
 instance first and calling .
Optional headersonly is as with the  method.


New in version 3.2.
