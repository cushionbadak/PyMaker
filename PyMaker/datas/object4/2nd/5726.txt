docs:


class (_text, _subtype='plain', _charset=None, *, policy=compat32)¶
Module: 
A subclass of , the
 class is used to create MIME objects of major type
text. _text is the string for the payload.  _subtype is the
minor type and defaults to plain.  _charset is the character
set of the text and is passed as an argument to the
 constructor; it defaults
to  if the string contains only  code points, and
 otherwise.  The _charset parameter accepts either a string or a
 instance.
Unless the _charset argument is explicitly set to , the
MIMEText object created will have both a Content-Type header
with a  parameter, and a Content-Transfer-Encoding
header.  This means that a subsequent  call will not result
in an encoded payload, even if a charset is passed in the 
command.  You can “reset” this behavior by deleting the
 header, after which a  call
will automatically encode the new payload (and add a new
Content-Transfer-Encoding header).
Optional policy argument defaults to .

Changed in version 3.5: _charset also accepts  instances.


Changed in version 3.6: Added policy keyword-only parameter.
