Completion¶
The following functions relate to implementing a custom word completion
function.  This is typically operated by the Tab key, and can suggest and
automatically complete a word being typed.  By default, Readline is set up
to be used by  to complete Python identifiers for
the interactive interpreter.  If the  module is to be used
with a custom completer, a different set of word delimiters should be set.


([function])¶
Set or remove the completer function.  If function is specified, it will be
used as the new completer function; if omitted or , any completer
function already installed is removed.  The completer function is called as
, for state in , , , …, until it
returns a non-string value.  It should return the next possible completion
starting with text.
The installed completer function is invoked by the entry_func callback
passed to  in the underlying library.
The text string comes from the first parameter to the
 callback of the
underlying library.



()¶
Get the completer function, or  if no completer function has been set.



()¶
Get the type of completion being attempted.  This returns the
 variable in the underlying library as
an integer.



()¶

()¶
Get the beginning or ending index of the completion scope.
These indexes are the start and end arguments passed to the
 callback of the
underlying library.



(string)¶

()¶
Set or get the word delimiters for completion.  These determine the
start of the word to be considered for completion (the completion scope).
These functions access the 
variable in the underlying library.



([function])¶
Set or remove the completion display function.  If function is
specified, it will be used as the new completion display function;
if omitted or , any completion display function already
installed is removed.  This sets or clears the
 callback in the
underlying library.  The completion display function is called as
 once
each time matches need to be displayed.
