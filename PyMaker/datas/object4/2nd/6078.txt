The  and  PackagesÂ¶
defusedxml is a pure Python package with modified subclasses of all stdlib
XML parsers that prevent any potentially malicious operation. Use of this
package is recommended for any server code that parses untrusted XML data. The
package also ships with example exploits and extended documentation on more
XML exploits such as XPath injection.
defusedexpat provides a modified libexpat and a patched
 module that have countermeasures against entity expansion
DoS attacks. The  module still allows a sane and configurable amount of entity
expansions. The modifications may be included in some future release of Python,
but will not be included in any bugfix releases of
Python because they break backward compatibility.
