(angle=None)¶




Parameters:angle – a number (optional)



Set or return the current tilt-angle. If angle is given, rotate the
turtleshape to point in the direction specified by angle,
regardless of its current tilt-angle. Do not change the turtle’s
heading (direction of movement).
If angle is not given: return the current tilt-angle, i. e. the angle
between the orientation of the turtleshape and the heading of the
turtle (its direction of movement).
