SSL Contexts¶

New in version 3.2.

An SSL context holds various data longer-lived than single SSL connections,
such as SSL configuration options, certificate(s) and private key(s).
It also manages a cache of SSL sessions for server-side sockets, in order
to speed up repeated connections from the same clients.


class (protocol=PROTOCOL_TLS)¶
Create a new SSL context.  You may pass protocol which must be one
of the  constants defined in this module.  The parameter
specifies which version of the SSL protocol to use.  Typically, the
server chooses a particular protocol version, and the client must adapt
to the server’s choice.  Most of the versions are not interoperable
with the other versions.  If not specified, the default is
; it provides the most compatibility with other
versions.
Here’s a table showing which versions in a client (down the side) can connect
to which versions in a server (along the top):

Changed in version 3.6: The context is created with secure default values. The options
, ,
, ,
 (except for ),
and  (except for ) are
set by default. The initial cipher suite list contains only 
ciphers, no  ciphers and no  ciphers (except for

 objects have the following methods and attributes:


()¶
Get statistics about quantities of loaded X.509 certificates, count of
X.509 certificates flagged as CA certificates and certificate revocation
lists as dictionary.
Example for a context with one CA cert and one other cert:



New in version 3.4.




(certfile, keyfile=None, password=None)¶
Load a private key and the corresponding certificate.  The certfile
string must be the path to a single file in PEM format containing the
certificate as well as any number of CA certificates needed to establish
the certificate’s authenticity.  The keyfile string, if present, must
point to a file containing the private key in.  Otherwise the private
key will be taken from certfile as well.  See the discussion of
Certificates for more information on how the certificate
is stored in the certfile.
The password argument may be a function to call to get the password for
decrypting the private key.  It will only be called if the private key is
encrypted and a password is necessary.  It will be called with no arguments,
and it should return a string, bytes, or bytearray.  If the return value is
a string it will be encoded as UTF-8 before using it to decrypt the key.
Alternatively a string, bytes, or bytearray value may be supplied directly
as the password argument.  It will be ignored if the private key is not
encrypted and no password is needed.
If the password argument is not specified and a password is required,
OpenSSL’s built-in password prompting mechanism will be used to
interactively prompt the user for a password.
An  is raised if the private key doesn’t
match with the certificate.

Changed in version 3.3: New optional argument password.




(purpose=Purpose.SERVER_AUTH)¶
Load a set of default “certification authority” (CA) certificates from
default locations. On Windows it loads CA certs from the  and
 system stores. On other systems it calls
. In the future the method may
load CA certificates from other locations, too.
The purpose flag specifies what kind of CA certificates are loaded. The
default settings  loads certificates, that are
flagged and trusted for TLS web server authentication (client side
sockets).  loads CA certificates for client
certificate verification on the server side.

New in version 3.4.




(cafile=None, capath=None, cadata=None)¶
Load a set of “certification authority” (CA) certificates used to validate
other peers’ certificates when  is other than
.  At least one of cafile or capath must be specified.
This method can also load certification revocation lists (CRLs) in PEM or
DER format. In order to make use of CRLs, 
must be configured properly.
The cafile string, if present, is the path to a file of concatenated
CA certificates in PEM format. See the discussion of
Certificates for more information about how to arrange the
certificates in this file.
The capath string, if present, is
the path to a directory containing several CA certificates in PEM format,
following an OpenSSL specific layout.
The cadata object, if present, is either an ASCII string of one or more
PEM-encoded certificates or a bytes-like object of DER-encoded
certificates. Like with capath extra lines around PEM-encoded
certificates are ignored but at least one certificate must be present.

Changed in version 3.4: New optional argument cadata




(binary_form=False)¶
Get a list of loaded “certification authority” (CA) certificates. If the
 parameter is  each list
entry is a dict like the output of . Otherwise
the method returns a list of DER-encoded certificates. The returned list
does not contain certificates from capath unless a certificate was
requested and loaded by a SSL connection.

Note
Certificates in a capath directory aren’t loaded unless they have
been used at least once.


New in version 3.4.




()¶
Get a list of enabled ciphers. The list is in order of cipher priority.
See .
Example:


On OpenSSL 1.1 and newer the cipher dict contains additional fields:


Availability: OpenSSL 1.0.2+.

New in version 3.6.




()¶
Load a set of default “certification authority” (CA) certificates from
a filesystem path defined when building the OpenSSL library.  Unfortunately,
there’s no easy way to know whether this method succeeds: no error is
returned if no certificates are to be found.  When the OpenSSL library is
provided as part of the operating system, though, it is likely to be
configured properly.



(ciphers)¶
Set the available ciphers for sockets created with this context.
It should be a string in the OpenSSL cipher list format.
If no cipher can be selected (because compile-time options or other
configuration forbids use of all the specified ciphers), an
 will be raised.

Note
when connected, the  method of SSL sockets will
give the currently selected cipher.
OpenSSL 1.1.1 has TLS 1.3 cipher suites enabled by default. The suites
cannot be disabled with .




(protocols)¶
Specify which protocols the socket should advertise during the SSL/TLS
handshake. It should be a list of ASCII strings, like , ordered by preference. The selection of a protocol will happen
during the handshake, and will play out according to RFC 7301. After a
successful handshake, the  method will
return the agreed-upon protocol.
This method will raise  if  is
False.
OpenSSL 1.1.0 to 1.1.0e will abort the handshake and raise 
when both sides support ALPN but cannot agree on a protocol. 1.1.0f+
behaves like 1.0.2,  returns None.

New in version 3.5.




(protocols)¶
Specify which protocols the socket should advertise during the SSL/TLS
handshake. It should be a list of strings, like ,
ordered by preference. The selection of a protocol will happen during the
handshake, and will play out according to the Application Layer Protocol Negotiation. After a
successful handshake, the  method will
return the agreed-upon protocol.
This method will raise  if  is
False.

New in version 3.3.




¶
Register a callback function that will be called after the TLS Client Hello
handshake message has been received by the SSL/TLS server when the TLS client
specifies a server name indication. The server name indication mechanism
is specified in RFC 6066 section 3 - Server Name Indication.
Only one callback can be set per .  If sni_callback
is set to  then the callback is disabled. Calling this function a
subsequent time will disable the previously registered callback.
The callback function will be called with three
arguments; the first being the , the second is a string
that represents the server name that the client is intending to communicate
(or  if the TLS Client Hello does not contain a server name)
and the third argument is the original . The server name
argument is text. For internationalized domain name, the server
name is an IDN A-label ().
A typical use of this callback is to change the ’s
 attribute to a new object of type
 representing a certificate chain that matches the server
name.
Due to the early negotiation phase of the TLS connection, only limited
methods and attributes are usable like
 and .
, ,
 and  methods require that
the TLS connection has progressed beyond the TLS Client Hello and therefore
will not contain return meaningful values nor can they be called safely.
The sni_callback function must return  to allow the
TLS negotiation to continue.  If a TLS failure is required, a constant
 can be
returned.  Other return values will result in a TLS fatal error with
.
If an exception is raised from the sni_callback function the TLS
connection will terminate with a fatal TLS alert message
.
This method will raise  if the OpenSSL library
had OPENSSL_NO_TLSEXT defined when it was built.

New in version 3.7.




(server_name_callback)¶
This is a legacy API retained for backwards compatibility. When possible,
you should use  instead. The given server_name_callback
is similar to sni_callback, except that when the server hostname is an
IDN-encoded internationalized domain name, the server_name_callback
receives a decoded U-label ().
If there is an decoding error on the server name, the TLS connection will
terminate with an  fatal TLS
alert message to the client.

New in version 3.4.




(dhfile)¶
Load the key generation parameters for Diffie-Hellman (DH) key exchange.
Using DH key exchange improves forward secrecy at the expense of
computational resources (both on the server and on the client).
The dhfile parameter should be the path to a file containing DH
parameters in PEM format.
This setting doesn’t apply to client sockets.  You can also use the
 option to further improve security.

New in version 3.3.




(curve_name)¶
Set the curve name for Elliptic Curve-based Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key
exchange.  ECDH is significantly faster than regular DH while arguably
as secure.  The curve_name parameter should be a string describing
a well-known elliptic curve, for example  for a widely
supported curve.
This setting doesn’t apply to client sockets.  You can also use the
 option to further improve security.
This method is not available if  is .

New in version 3.3.

(sock, server_side=False, do_handshake_on_connect=True, suppress_ragged_eofs=True, server_hostname=None, session=None)¶
Wrap an existing Python socket sock and return an instance of
 (default ). The
returned SSL socket is tied to the context, its settings and certificates.
sock must be a  socket; other
socket types are unsupported.
The parameter  is a boolean which identifies whether
server-side or client-side behavior is desired from this socket.
For client-side sockets, the context construction is lazy; if the
underlying socket isn’t connected yet, the context construction will be
performed after  is called on the socket.  For
server-side sockets, if the socket has no remote peer, it is assumed
to be a listening socket, and the server-side SSL wrapping is
automatically performed on client connections accepted via the
 method. The method may raise .
On client connections, the optional parameter server_hostname specifies
the hostname of the service which we are connecting to.  This allows a
single server to host multiple SSL-based services with distinct certificates,
quite similarly to HTTP virtual hosts. Specifying server_hostname will
raise a  if server_side is true.
The parameter  specifies whether to do the SSL
handshake automatically after doing a , or whether the
application program will call it explicitly, by invoking the
 method.  Calling
 explicitly gives the program control over the
blocking behavior of the socket I/O involved in the handshake.
The parameter  specifies how the
 method should signal unexpected EOF from the other end
of the connection.  If specified as  (the default), it returns a
normal EOF (an empty bytes object) in response to unexpected EOF errors
raised from the underlying socket; if , it will raise the
exceptions back to the caller.
session, see .

Changed in version 3.5: Always allow a server_hostname to be passed, even if OpenSSL does not
have SNI.


Changed in version 3.6: session argument was added.

Changed in version 3.7: The method returns on instance of 
instead of hard-coded .

in order to return a custom subclass of .

New in version 3.7.




(incoming, outgoing, server_side=False, server_hostname=None, session=None)¶
Wrap the BIO objects incoming and outgoing and return an instance of
attr:SSLContext.sslobject_class (default ). The SSL
routines will read input data from the incoming BIO and write data to the
outgoing BIO.
The server_side, server_hostname and session parameters have the
same meaning as in .

Changed in version 3.6: session argument was added.


Changed in version 3.7: The method returns on instance of 
instead of hard-coded .

New in version 3.7.




()¶
Get statistics about the SSL sessions created or managed by this context.
A dictionary is returned which maps the names of each piece of information to their
numeric values.  For example, here is the total number of hits and misses
in the session cache since the context was created:

Example:



New in version 3.4.


Changed in version 3.7:  is now automatically changed
to   when hostname checking is enabled and

the same operation would have failed with a .


Note
This features requires OpenSSL 0.9.8f or newer.




¶
A  enum member representing the highest supported
TLS version. The value defaults to .
The attribute is read-only for protocols other than ,
, and .
The attributes ,
 and
 all affect the supported SSL
and TLS versions of the context. The implementation does not prevent
invalid combination. For example a context with
 in  and
 set to

Note
This attribute is not available unless the ssl module is compiled
with OpenSSL 1.1.0g or newer.


New in version 3.7.

¶
An integer representing the set of SSL options enabled on this context.
The default value is , but you can specify other options
such as  by ORing them together.

Note
With versions of OpenSSL older than 0.9.8m, it is only possible
to set options, not to clear them.  Attempting to clear an option
(by resetting the corresponding bits) will raise a .


Changed in version 3.6:  returns  flags:






¶
Enable TLS 1.3 post-handshake client authentication. Post-handshake auth
is disabled by default and a server can only request a TLS client
certificate during the initial handshake. When enabled, a server may
request a TLS client certificate at any time after the handshake.
When enabled on client-side sockets, the client signals the server that
it supports post-handshake authentication.
When enabled on server-side sockets,  must
be set to  or , too. The
actual client cert exchange is delayed until
 is called and some I/O is
performed.

Note
Only available with OpenSSL 1.1.1 and TLS 1.3 enabled. Without TLS 1.3
support, the property value is None and can’t be modified


New in version 3.7.1.




¶
The protocol version chosen when constructing the context.  This attribute
is read-only.
