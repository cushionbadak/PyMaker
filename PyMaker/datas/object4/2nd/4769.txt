()Â¶
Run the event loop until  is called.
If  is called before  is called,
the loop will poll the I/O selector once with a timeout of zero,
run all callbacks scheduled in response to I/O events (and
those that were already scheduled), and then exit.
If  is called while  is running,
the loop will run the current batch of callbacks and then exit.
Note that new callbacks scheduled by callbacks will not run in this
case; instead, they will run the next time  or
 is called.
