docs:


(host='localhost', port=0)Â¶
Connect to a host on a given port.  The defaults are to connect to the local
host at the standard SMTP port (25). If the hostname ends with a colon ()
followed by a number, that suffix will be stripped off and the number
interpreted as the port number to use. This method is automatically invoked by
the constructor if a host is specified during instantiation.  Returns a
2-tuple of the response code and message sent by the server in its
connection response.
