(*, follow_symlinks=True)¶
Return  if this entry is a directory or a symbolic link pointing
to a directory; return  if the entry is or points to any other
kind of file, or if it doesn’t exist anymore.
If follow_symlinks is , return  only if this entry
is a directory (without following symlinks); return  if the
entry is any other kind of file or if it doesn’t exist anymore.
The result is cached on the  object, with a separate cache
for follow_symlinks  and . Call  along
with  to fetch up-to-date information.
On the first, uncached call, no system call is required in most cases.
Specifically, for non-symlinks, neither Windows or Unix require a system
call, except on certain Unix file systems, such as network file systems,
that return . If the entry is a symlink,
a system call will be required to follow the symlink unless
follow_symlinks is .
This method can raise , such as ,
but  is caught and not raised.
