parentsÂ¶
Sometimes, several parsers share a common set of arguments. Rather than
repeating the definitions of these arguments, a single parser with all the
shared arguments and passed to  argument to 
can be used.  The  argument takes a list of 
objects, collects all the positional and optional actions from them, and adds
these actions to the  object being constructed:


Note that most parent parsers will specify .  Otherwise, the
 will see two  options (one in the parent
and one in the child) and raise an error.

Note
You must fully initialize the parsers before passing them via .
If you change the parent parsers after the child parser, those changes will
not be reflected in the child.
