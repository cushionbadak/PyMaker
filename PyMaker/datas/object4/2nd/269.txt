7.9. The  statementÂ¶

 may only occur syntactically nested in a  or
 loop, but not nested in a function or class definition within
that loop.
It terminates the nearest enclosing loop, skipping the optional 
clause if the loop has one.
If a  loop is terminated by , the loop control
target keeps its current value.
When  passes control out of a  statement with a
 clause, that  clause is executed before
really leaving the loop.
