(data, xbar=None)¶
Return the sample variance of data, an iterable of at least two real-valued
numbers.  Variance, or second moment about the mean, is a measure of the
variability (spread or dispersion) of data.  A large variance indicates that
the data is spread out; a small variance indicates it is clustered closely
around the mean.
If the optional second argument xbar is given, it should be the mean of
data.  If it is missing or  (the default), the mean is
automatically calculated.
Use this function when your data is a sample from a population. To calculate
the variance from the entire population, see .
Raises  if data has fewer than two values.
Examples:


If you have already calculated the mean of your data, you can pass it as the
optional second argument xbar to avoid recalculation:


This function does not attempt to verify that you have passed the actual mean
as xbar.  Using arbitrary values for xbar can lead to invalid or
impossible results.
Decimal and Fraction values are supported:



Note
This is the sample variance s² with Bessel’s correction, also known as
variance with N-1 degrees of freedom.  Provided that the data points are
representative (e.g. independent and identically distributed), the result
should be an unbiased estimate of the true population variance.
If you somehow know the actual population mean μ you should pass it to the
 function as the mu parameter to get the variance of a
sample.
