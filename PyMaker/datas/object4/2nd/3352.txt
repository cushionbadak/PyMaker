Reentrancy¶
Binary buffered objects (instances of ,
,  and )
are not reentrant.  While reentrant calls will not happen in normal situations,
they can arise from doing I/O in a  handler.  If a thread tries to
re-enter a buffered object which it is already accessing, a 
is raised.  Note this doesn’t prohibit a different thread from entering the
buffered object.
The above implicitly extends to text files, since the  function
will wrap a buffered object inside a .  This includes
standard streams and therefore affects the built-in function  as
well.
