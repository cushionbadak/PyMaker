(filename)¶
When  detects a source request (see 
below) this method is given the following token as argument, and expected
to return a tuple consisting of a filename and an open file-like object.
Normally, this method first strips any quotes off the argument.  If the result
is an absolute pathname, or there was no previous source request in effect, or
the previous source was a stream (such as ), the result is left
alone.  Otherwise, if the result is a relative pathname, the directory part of
the name of the file immediately before it on the source inclusion stack is
prepended (this behavior is like the way the C preprocessor handles ).
The result of the manipulations is treated as a filename, and returned as the
first component of the tuple, with  called on it to yield the second
component. (Note: this is the reverse of the order of arguments in instance
initialization!)
This hook is exposed so that you can use it to implement directory search paths,
addition of file extensions, and other namespace hacks. There is no
corresponding ‘close’ hook, but a shlex instance will call the
 method of the sourced input stream when it returns
EOF.
For more explicit control of source stacking, use the  and
 methods.
