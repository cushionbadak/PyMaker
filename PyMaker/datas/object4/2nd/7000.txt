(data)¶
Post an article using the  command.  The data argument is either
a file object opened for binary reading, or any iterable of bytes
objects (representing raw lines of the article to be posted).  It should
represent a well-formed news article, including the required headers.  The
 method automatically escapes lines beginning with  and
appends the termination line.
If the method succeeds, the server’s response is returned.  If the server
refuses posting, a  is raised.
