(flags)¶
Set the  reporting flags to use.
Argument flags takes the bitwise OR of option flags.  See
section Option Flags.  Only “reporting flags” can be used.
This is a module-global setting, and affects all future doctests run by module
:  the  method of  looks at
the option flags specified for the test case when the 
instance was constructed.  If no reporting flags were specified (which is the
typical and expected case), ’s  reporting flags are
bitwise ORed into the option flags, and the option flags
so augmented are passed to the  instance created to
run the doctest.  If any reporting flags were specified when the
 instance was constructed, ’s
 reporting flags are ignored.
The value of the  reporting flags in effect before the function
was called is returned by the function.
