Grouping Options¶
When dealing with many options, it is convenient to group these options for
better help output.  An  can contain several option groups,
each of which can contain several options.
An option group is obtained using the class :


class (parser, title, description=None)¶
where

parser is the  instance the group will be inserted in
to
title is the group title
description, optional, is a long description of the group


 inherits from  (like
) and so the  method can be used to add
an option to the group.
Once all the options are declared, using the  method
 the group is added to the previously defined parser.
Continuing with the parser defined in the previous section, adding an
 to a parser is easy:


This would result in the following help output:


A bit more complete example might involve using more than one group: still
extending the previous example:


that results in the following output:


Another interesting method, in particular when working programmatically with
option groups is:


(opt_str)¶
Return the  to which the short or long option
string opt_str (e.g.  or ) belongs. If
there’s no such , return .
