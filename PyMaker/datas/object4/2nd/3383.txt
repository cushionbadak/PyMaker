()¶
Reset the time conversion rules used by the library routines. The environment
variable  specifies how this is done. It will also set the variables
 (from the  environment variable),  (non-DST
seconds West of UTC),  (DST seconds west of UTC) and 
(to 0 if this timezone does not have any daylight saving time rules, or to
nonzero if there is a time, past, present or future when daylight saving time
applies).
Availability: Unix.

Note
Although in many cases, changing the  environment variable may
affect the output of functions like  without calling
, this behavior should not be relied on.
The  environment variable should contain no whitespace.

The standard format of the  environment variable is (whitespace
added for clarity):


Where the components are:

 and 
Three or more alphanumerics giving the timezone abbreviations. These will be
propagated into time.tzname

The offset has the form: . This indicates the value
added the local time to arrive at UTC.  If preceded by a ‘-‘, the timezone
is east of the Prime Meridian; otherwise, it is west. If no offset follows
dst, summer time is assumed to be one hour ahead of standard time.

Indicates when to change to and back from DST. The format of the
start and end dates are one of the following:


The Julian day n (1 <= n <= 365). Leap days are not counted, so in
all years February 28 is day 59 and March 1 is day 60.

The zero-based Julian day (0 <= n <= 365). Leap days are counted, and
it is possible to refer to February 29.

The d’th day (0 <= d <= 6) of week n of month m of the year (1
<= n <= 5, 1 <= m <= 12, where week 5 means “the last d day in
month m” which may occur in either the fourth or the fifth
week). Week 1 is the first week in which the d’th day occurs. Day
zero is a Sunday.

 has the same format as  except that no leading sign
(‘-‘ or ‘+’) is allowed. The default, if time is not given, is 02:00:00.




On many Unix systems (including *BSD, Linux, Solaris, and Darwin), it is more
convenient to use the system’s zoneinfo (tzfile(5))  database to
specify the timezone rules. To do this, set the   environment
variable to the path of the required timezone  datafile, relative to the root of
the systems ‘zoneinfo’ timezone database, usually located at
. For example,  ,
,  or  .
