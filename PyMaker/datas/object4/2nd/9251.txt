()¶
Changes the default filesystem encoding and errors mode to ‘mbcs’ and
‘replace’ respectively, for consistency with versions of Python prior to 3.6.
This is equivalent to defining the 
environment variable before launching Python.
Availability: Windows.

New in version 3.6: See PEP 529 for more details.
