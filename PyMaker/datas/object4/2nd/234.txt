coroutine (type[, value[, traceback]])Â¶
Returns an awaitable that raises an exception of type  at the point
where the asynchronous generator was paused, and returns the next value
yielded by the generator function as the value of the raised
 exception.  If the asynchronous generator exits
without yielding another value, a  exception is
raised by the awaitable.
If the generator function does not catch the passed-in exception, or
raises a different exception, then when the awaitable is run that exception
propagates to the caller of the awaitable.
