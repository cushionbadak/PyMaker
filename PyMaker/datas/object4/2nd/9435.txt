docs:


(*objs)¶
Return a list of objects directly referred to by any of the arguments. The
referents returned are those objects visited by the arguments’ C-level
 methods (if any), and may not be all objects actually
directly reachable.   methods are supported only by objects
that support garbage collection, and are only required to visit objects that may
be involved in a cycle.  So, for example, if an integer is directly reachable
from an argument, that integer object may or may not appear in the result list.
