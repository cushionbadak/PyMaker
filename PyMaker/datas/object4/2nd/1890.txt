docs:


class (func, *args, **keywords)Â¶
Return a new  descriptor which behaves
like  except that it is designed to be used as a method
definition rather than being directly callable.
func must be a descriptor or a callable (objects which are both,
like normal functions, are handled as descriptors).
When func is a descriptor (such as a normal Python function,
, ,  or
another instance of ), calls to  are
delegated to the underlying descriptor, and an appropriate
partial object returned as the result.
When func is a non-descriptor callable, an appropriate bound method is
created dynamically. This behaves like a normal Python function when
used as a method: the self argument will be inserted as the first
positional argument, even before the args and keywords supplied to
the  constructor.
