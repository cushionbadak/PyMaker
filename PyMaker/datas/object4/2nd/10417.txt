New in version 3.3.

The  module defines the list of hashing methods (not all methods
are available on all platforms):


¶
A Modular Crypt Format method with 16 character salt and 86 character
hash based on the SHA-512 hash function.  This is the strongest method.



¶
Another Modular Crypt Format method with 16 character salt and 43
character hash based on the SHA-256 hash function.



¶
Another Modular Crypt Format method with 22 character salt and 31
character hash based on the Blowfish cipher.

New in version 3.7.




¶
Another Modular Crypt Format method with 8 character salt and 22
character hash based on the MD5 hash function.
