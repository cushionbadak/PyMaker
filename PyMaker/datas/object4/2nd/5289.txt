docs:


class ¶
A memory buffer that can be used to pass data between Python and an SSL
protocol instance.


¶
Return the number of bytes currently in the memory buffer.



¶
A boolean indicating whether the memory BIO is current at the end-of-file
position.



(n=-1)¶
Read up to n bytes from the memory buffer. If n is not specified or
negative, all bytes are returned.



(buf)¶
Write the bytes from buf to the memory BIO. The buf argument must be an
object supporting the buffer protocol.
The return value is the number of bytes written, which is always equal to
the length of buf.



()¶
Write an EOF marker to the memory BIO. After this method has been called, it
is illegal to call . The attribute  will
become true after all data currently in the buffer has been read.
