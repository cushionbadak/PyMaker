classmethod (tz=None)¶
Return the current local date and time.  If optional argument tz is 
or not specified, this is like , but, if possible, supplies more
precision than can be gotten from going through a  timestamp
(for example, this may be possible on platforms supplying the C
 function).
If tz is not , it must be an instance of a  subclass, and the
current date and time are converted to tz’s time zone.  In this case the
result is equivalent to .
