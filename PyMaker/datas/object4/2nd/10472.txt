docs:


(pid, resource[, limits])¶
Combines  and  in one function and
supports to get and set the resources limits of an arbitrary process. If
pid is 0, then the call applies to the current process. resource and
limits have the same meaning as in , except that
limits is optional.
When limits is not given the function returns the resource limit of the
process pid. When limits is given the resource limit of the process is
set and the former resource limit is returned.
Raises  when pid can’t be found and
 when the user doesn’t have  for
the process.
Availability: Linux 2.6.36 or later with glibc 2.13 or later.

New in version 3.4.
