Caring about security¶
There’s one important rule: if you invoke an external program (via the
 or  functions. or others with similar
functionality), make very sure you don’t pass arbitrary strings received from
the client to the shell.  This is a well-known security hole whereby clever
hackers anywhere on the Web can exploit a gullible CGI script to invoke
arbitrary shell commands.  Even parts of the URL or field names cannot be
trusted, since the request doesn’t have to come from your form!
To be on the safe side, if you must pass a string gotten from a form to a shell
command, you should make sure the string contains only alphanumeric characters,
dashes, underscores, and periods.
