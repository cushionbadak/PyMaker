Formatter Implementations¶
Two implementations of formatter objects are provided by this module. Most
applications may use one of these classes without modification or subclassing.


class (writer=None)¶
A formatter which does nothing.  If writer is omitted, a 
instance is created.  No methods of the writer are called by
 instances.  Implementations should inherit from this
class if implementing a writer interface but don’t need to inherit any
implementation.



class (writer)¶
The standard formatter.  This implementation has demonstrated wide applicability
to many writers, and may be used directly in most circumstances.  It has been
used to implement a full-featured World Wide Web browser.
