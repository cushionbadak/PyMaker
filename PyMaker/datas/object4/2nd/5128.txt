 — TLS/SSL wrapper for socket objects¶
Source code: Lib/ssl.py

This module provides access to Transport Layer Security (often known as “Secure
Sockets Layer”) encryption and peer authentication facilities for network
sockets, both client-side and server-side.  This module uses the OpenSSL
library. It is available on all modern Unix systems, Windows, Mac OS X, and
probably additional platforms, as long as OpenSSL is installed on that platform.

Note
Some behavior may be platform dependent, since calls are made to the
operating system socket APIs.  The installed version of OpenSSL may also
cause variations in behavior. For example, TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2 come with
openssl version 1.0.1.


Warning
Don’t use this module without reading the Security considerations.  Doing so
may lead to a false sense of security, as the default settings of the
ssl module are not necessarily appropriate for your application.

This section documents the objects and functions in the  module; for more
general information about TLS, SSL, and certificates, the reader is referred to
the documents in the “See Also” section at the bottom.
This module provides a class, , which is derived from the
 type, and provides a socket-like wrapper that also
encrypts and decrypts the data going over the socket with SSL.  It supports
additional methods such as , which retrieves the
certificate of the other side of the connection, and ,which
retrieves the cipher being used for the secure connection.
For more sophisticated applications, the  class
helps manage settings and certificates, which can then be inherited
by SSL sockets created through the  method.

Changed in version 3.5.3: Updated to support linking with OpenSSL 1.1.0


Changed in version 3.6: OpenSSL 0.9.8, 1.0.0 and 1.0.1 are deprecated and no longer supported.
In the future the ssl module will require at least OpenSSL 1.0.2 or
1.1.0.


Functions, Constants, and Exceptions¶

Socket creation¶
Since Python 3.2 and 2.7.9, it is recommended to use the
 of an  instance to wrap
sockets as  objects. The helper functions
 returns a new context with secure default
settings. The old  function is deprecated since it is
both inefficient and has no support for server name indication (SNI) and
hostname matching.
Client socket example with default context and IPv4/IPv6 dual stack:


Client socket example with custom context and IPv4:


Server socket example listening on localhost IPv4:




Context creation¶
A convenience function helps create  objects for common
purposes.


(purpose=Purpose.SERVER_AUTH, cafile=None, capath=None, cadata=None)¶
Return a new  object with default settings for
the given purpose.  The settings are chosen by the  module,
and usually represent a higher security level than when calling the
 constructor directly.
cafile, capath, cadata represent optional CA certificates to
trust for certificate verification, as in
.  If all three are
, this function can choose to trust the system’s default
CA certificates instead.
The settings are: , , and
 with high encryption cipher suites without RC4 and
without unauthenticated cipher suites. Passing 
as purpose sets  to 
and either loads CA certificates (when at least one of cafile, capath or
cadata is given) or uses  to load
default CA certificates.

Note
The protocol, options, cipher and other settings may change to more
restrictive values anytime without prior deprecation.  The values
represent a fair balance between compatibility and security.
If your application needs specific settings, you should create a
 and apply the settings yourself.


Note
If you find that when certain older clients or servers attempt to connect
with a  created by this function that they get an error
stating “Protocol or cipher suite mismatch”, it may be that they only
support SSL3.0 which this function excludes using the
. SSL3.0 is widely considered to be completely broken. If you still wish to continue to
use this function but still allow SSL 3.0 connections you can re-enable
them using:




New in version 3.4.


Changed in version 3.4.4: RC4 was dropped from the default cipher string.


Changed in version 3.6: ChaCha20/Poly1305 was added to the default cipher string.
3DES was dropped from the default cipher string.




Exceptions¶


exception ¶
Raised to signal an error from the underlying SSL implementation
(currently provided by the OpenSSL library).  This signifies some
problem in the higher-level encryption and authentication layer that’s
superimposed on the underlying network connection.  This error
is a subtype of .  The error code and message of
 instances are provided by the OpenSSL library.

Changed in version 3.3:  used to be a subtype of .



¶
A string mnemonic designating the OpenSSL submodule in which the error
occurred, such as ,  or .  The range of possible
values depends on the OpenSSL version.

New in version 3.3.




¶
A string mnemonic designating the reason this error occurred, for
example .  The range of possible
values depends on the OpenSSL version.

New in version 3.3.





exception ¶
A subclass of  raised when trying to read or write and
the SSL connection has been closed cleanly.  Note that this doesn’t
mean that the underlying transport (read TCP) has been closed.

New in version 3.3.




exception ¶
A subclass of  raised by a non-blocking SSL socket when trying to read or write data, but more data needs
to be received on the underlying TCP transport before the request can be
fulfilled.

New in version 3.3.




exception ¶
A subclass of  raised by a non-blocking SSL socket when trying to read or write data, but more data needs
to be sent on the underlying TCP transport before the request can be
fulfilled.

New in version 3.3.




exception ¶
A subclass of  raised when a system error was encountered
while trying to fulfill an operation on a SSL socket.  Unfortunately,
there is no easy way to inspect the original errno number.

New in version 3.3.




exception ¶
A subclass of  raised when the SSL connection has been
terminated abruptly.  Generally, you shouldn’t try to reuse the underlying
transport when this error is encountered.

New in version 3.3.




exception ¶
A subclass of  raised when certificate validation has
failed.

New in version 3.7.



¶
A numeric error number that denotes the verification error.



¶
A human readable string of the verification error.




exception ¶
An alias for .

Changed in version 3.7: The exception is now an alias for .




Random generation¶


(num)¶
Return num cryptographically strong pseudo-random bytes. Raises an
 if the PRNG has not been seeded with enough data or if the
operation is not supported by the current RAND method. 
can be used to check the status of the PRNG and  can be used
to seed the PRNG.
For almost all applications  is preferable.
Read the Wikipedia article, Cryptographically secure pseudorandom number
generator (CSPRNG),
to get the requirements of a cryptographically generator.

New in version 3.3.




(num)¶
Return (bytes, is_cryptographic): bytes are num pseudo-random bytes,
is_cryptographic is  if the bytes generated are cryptographically
strong. Raises an  if the operation is not supported by the
current RAND method.
Generated pseudo-random byte sequences will be unique if they are of
sufficient length, but are not necessarily unpredictable. They can be used
for non-cryptographic purposes and for certain purposes in cryptographic
protocols, but usually not for key generation etc.
For almost all applications  is preferable.

New in version 3.3.


Deprecated since version 3.6: OpenSSL has deprecated , use
 instead.




()¶
Return  if the SSL pseudo-random number generator has been seeded
with ‘enough’ randomness, and  otherwise.  You can use
 and  to increase the randomness of
the pseudo-random number generator.



(path)¶
If you are running an entropy-gathering daemon (EGD) somewhere, and path
is the pathname of a socket connection open to it, this will read 256 bytes
of randomness from the socket, and add it to the SSL pseudo-random number
generator to increase the security of generated secret keys.  This is
typically only necessary on systems without better sources of randomness.
See http://egd.sourceforge.net/ or http://prngd.sourceforge.net/ for sources
of entropy-gathering daemons.
Availability: not available with LibreSSL and OpenSSL > 1.1.0.



(bytes, entropy)¶
Mix the given bytes into the SSL pseudo-random number generator.  The
parameter entropy (a float) is a lower bound on the entropy contained in
string (so you can always use ).  See RFC 1750 for more
information on sources of entropy.

Changed in version 3.5: Writable bytes-like object is now accepted.




Certificate handling¶


(cert, hostname)¶
Verify that cert (in decoded format as returned by
) matches the given hostname.  The rules
applied are those for checking the identity of HTTPS servers as outlined
in RFC 2818, RFC 5280 and RFC 6125.  In addition to HTTPS, this
function should be suitable for checking the identity of servers in
various SSL-based protocols such as FTPS, IMAPS, POPS and others.
 is raised on failure. On success, the function
returns nothing:



New in version 3.2.


Changed in version 3.3.3: The function now follows RFC 6125, section 6.4.3 and does neither
match multiple wildcards (e.g.  or ) nor
a wildcard inside an internationalized domain names (IDN) fragment.
IDN A-labels such as  are still supported,
but  no longer matches .


Changed in version 3.5: Matching of IP addresses, when present in the subjectAltName field
of the certificate, is now supported.


Changed in version 3.7: The function is no longer used to TLS connections. Hostname matching
is now performed by OpenSSL.
Allow wildcard when it is the leftmost and the only character
in that segment. Partial wildcards like  are no
longer supported.


Deprecated since version 3.7.




(cert_time)¶
Return the time in seconds since the Epoch, given the 
string representing the “notBefore” or “notAfter” date from a
certificate in  strptime format (C
locale).
Here’s an example:


“notBefore” or “notAfter” dates must use GMT (RFC 5280).

Changed in version 3.5: Interpret the input time as a time in UTC as specified by ‘GMT’
timezone in the input string. Local timezone was used
previously. Return an integer (no fractions of a second in the
input format)




(addr, ssl_version=PROTOCOL_TLS, ca_certs=None)¶
Given the address  of an SSL-protected server, as a (hostname,
port-number) pair, fetches the server’s certificate, and returns it as a
PEM-encoded string.  If  is specified, uses that version of
the SSL protocol to attempt to connect to the server.  If  is
specified, it should be a file containing a list of root certificates, the
same format as used for the same parameter in
.  The call will attempt to validate the
server certificate against that set of root certificates, and will fail
if the validation attempt fails.

Changed in version 3.3: This function is now IPv6-compatible.


Changed in version 3.5: The default ssl_version is changed from  to
 for maximum compatibility with modern servers.




(DER_cert_bytes)¶
Given a certificate as a DER-encoded blob of bytes, returns a PEM-encoded
string version of the same certificate.



(PEM_cert_string)¶
Given a certificate as an ASCII PEM string, returns a DER-encoded sequence of
bytes for that same certificate.



()¶
Returns a named tuple with paths to OpenSSL’s default cafile and capath.
The paths are the same as used by
. The return value is a
named tuple :

 - resolved path to cafile or  if the file doesn’t exist,
 - resolved path to capath or  if the directory doesn’t exist,
 - OpenSSL’s environment key that points to a cafile,
 - hard coded path to a cafile,
 - OpenSSL’s environment key that points to a capath,
 - hard coded path to a capath directory

Availability: LibreSSL ignores the environment vars
 and .

New in version 3.4.




(store_name)¶
Retrieve certificates from Windows’ system cert store. store_name may be
one of ,  or . Windows may provide additional cert
stores, too.
The function returns a list of (cert_bytes, encoding_type, trust) tuples.
The encoding_type specifies the encoding of cert_bytes. It is either
 for X.509 ASN.1 data or  for
PKCS#7 ASN.1 data. Trust specifies the purpose of the certificate as a set
of OIDS or exactly  if the certificate is trustworthy for all
purposes.
Example:


Availability: Windows.

New in version 3.4.




(store_name)¶
Retrieve CRLs from Windows’ system cert store. store_name may be
one of ,  or . Windows may provide additional cert
stores, too.
The function returns a list of (cert_bytes, encoding_type, trust) tuples.
The encoding_type specifies the encoding of cert_bytes. It is either
 for X.509 ASN.1 data or  for
PKCS#7 ASN.1 data.
Availability: Windows.

New in version 3.4.




(sock, keyfile=None, certfile=None, server_side=False, cert_reqs=CERT_NONE, ssl_version=PROTOCOL_TLS, ca_certs=None, do_handshake_on_connect=True, suppress_ragged_eofs=True, ciphers=None)¶
Takes an instance  of , and returns an instance
of , a subtype of , which wraps
the underlying socket in an SSL context.   must be a
 socket; other socket types are unsupported.
Internally, function creates a  with protocol
ssl_version and  set to cert_reqs. If
parameters keyfile, certfile, ca_certs or ciphers are set, then
the values are passed to ,
, and
.
The arguments server_side, do_handshake_on_connect, and
suppress_ragged_eofs have the same meaning as
.

Deprecated since version 3.7: Since Python 3.2 and 2.7.9, it is recommended to use the
 instead of . The
top-level function is limited and creates an insecure client socket
without server name indication or hostname matching.




Constants¶

All constants are now  or  collections.

New in version 3.6.




¶
Possible value for , or the 
parameter to .  Except for ,
it is the default mode.  With client-side sockets, just about any
cert is accepted.  Validation errors, such as untrusted or expired cert,
are ignored and do not abort the TLS/SSL handshake.
In server mode, no certificate is requested from the client, so the client
does not send any for client cert authentication.
See the discussion of Security considerations below.



¶
Possible value for , or the 
parameter to .  In client mode, 
has the same meaning as . It is recommended to
use  for client-side sockets instead.
In server mode, a client certificate request is sent to the client.  The
client may either ignore the request or send a certificate in order
perform TLS client cert authentication.  If the client chooses to send
a certificate, it is verified.  Any verification error immediately aborts
the TLS handshake.
Use of this setting requires a valid set of CA certificates to
be passed, either to  or as a
value of the  parameter to .



¶
Possible value for , or the 
parameter to .  In this mode, certificates are
required from the other side of the socket connection; an 
will be raised if no certificate is provided, or if its validation fails.
This mode is not sufficient to verify a certificate in client mode as
it does not match hostnames.   must be
enabled as well to verify the authenticity of a cert.

SSL Sockets¶


class (socket.socket)¶
SSL sockets provide the following methods of Socket Objects:







, 
, 
, ,



, 
(but passing a non-zero  argument is not allowed)
,  (with
the same limitation)
 (but  will be used
for plain-text sockets only, else  will be used)


However, since the SSL (and TLS) protocol has its own framing atop
of TCP, the SSL sockets abstraction can, in certain respects, diverge from
the specification of normal, OS-level sockets.  See especially the
notes on non-blocking sockets.
Instances of  must be created using the
 method.

Changed in version 3.5: The  method was added.


Changed in version 3.5: The  does not reset the socket timeout each time bytes
are received or sent. The socket timeout is now to maximum total duration
of the shutdown.


Deprecated since version 3.6: It is deprecated to create a  instance directly, use
 to wrap a socket.


Changed in version 3.7:  instances must to created with
. In earlier versions, it was possible
to create instances directly. This was never documented or officially
supported.


SSL sockets also have the following additional methods and attributes:


(len=1024, buffer=None)¶
Read up to len bytes of data from the SSL socket and return the result as
a  instance. If buffer is specified, then read into the buffer
instead, and return the number of bytes read.
Raise  or  if the socket is
non-blocking and the read would block.
As at any time a re-negotiation is possible, a call to  can also
cause write operations.

Changed in version 3.5: The socket timeout is no more reset each time bytes are received or sent.
The socket timeout is now to maximum total duration to read up to len
bytes.


Deprecated since version 3.6: Use  instead of .




(buf)¶
Write buf to the SSL socket and return the number of bytes written. The
buf argument must be an object supporting the buffer interface.
Raise  or  if the socket is
non-blocking and the write would block.
As at any time a re-negotiation is possible, a call to  can
also cause read operations.

Changed in version 3.5: The socket timeout is no more reset each time bytes are received or sent.
The socket timeout is now to maximum total duration to write buf.


Deprecated since version 3.6: Use  instead of .



Note
The  and  methods are the
low-level methods that read and write unencrypted, application-level data
and decrypt/encrypt it to encrypted, wire-level data. These methods
require an active SSL connection, i.e. the handshake was completed and
 was not called.
Normally you should use the socket API methods like
 and  instead of these
methods.



()¶
Perform the SSL setup handshake.

Changed in version 3.4: The handshake method also performs  when the
 attribute of the socket’s
 is true.


Changed in version 3.5: The socket timeout is no more reset each time bytes are received or sent.
The socket timeout is now to maximum total duration of the handshake.


Changed in version 3.7: Hostname or IP address is matched by OpenSSL during handshake. The
function  is no longer used. In case OpenSSL
refuses a hostname or IP address, the handshake is aborted early and
a TLS alert message is send to the peer.




(binary_form=False)¶
If there is no certificate for the peer on the other end of the connection,
return .  If the SSL handshake hasn’t been done yet, raise
.
If the  parameter is , and a certificate was
received from the peer, this method returns a  instance.  If the
certificate was not validated, the dict is empty.  If the certificate was
validated, it returns a dict with several keys, amongst them 
(the principal for which the certificate was issued) and 
(the principal issuing the certificate).  If a certificate contains an
instance of the Subject Alternative Name extension (see RFC 3280),
there will also be a  key in the dictionary.
The  and  fields are tuples containing the sequence
of relative distinguished names (RDNs) given in the certificate’s data
structure for the respective fields, and each RDN is a sequence of
name-value pairs.  Here is a real-world example:



Note
To validate a certificate for a particular service, you can use the
 function.

If the  parameter is , and a certificate was
provided, this method returns the DER-encoded form of the entire certificate
as a sequence of bytes, or  if the peer did not provide a
certificate.  Whether the peer provides a certificate depends on the SSL
socket’s role:

for a client SSL socket, the server will always provide a certificate,
regardless of whether validation was required;
for a server SSL socket, the client will only provide a certificate
when requested by the server; therefore  will return
 if you used  (rather than
 or ).


Changed in version 3.2: The returned dictionary includes additional items such as 
and .


Changed in version 3.4:  is raised when the handshake isn’t done.
The returned dictionary includes additional X509v3 extension items
  such as ,  and  URIs.




()¶
Returns a three-value tuple containing the name of the cipher being used, the
version of the SSL protocol that defines its use, and the number of secret
bits being used.  If no connection has been established, returns .



()¶
Return the list of ciphers shared by the client during the handshake.  Each
entry of the returned list is a three-value tuple containing the name of the
cipher, the version of the SSL protocol that defines its use, and the number
of secret bits the cipher uses.   returns
 if no connection has been established or the socket is a client
socket.

New in version 3.5.




()¶
Return the compression algorithm being used as a string, or 
if the connection isn’t compressed.
If the higher-level protocol supports its own compression mechanism,
you can use  to disable SSL-level compression.

New in version 3.3.




(cb_type="tls-unique")¶
Get channel binding data for current connection, as a bytes object.  Returns
 if not connected or the handshake has not been completed.
The cb_type parameter allow selection of the desired channel binding
type. Valid channel binding types are listed in the
 list.  Currently only the ‘tls-unique’ channel
binding, defined by RFC 5929, is supported.   will be
raised if an unsupported channel binding type is requested.

New in version 3.3.




()¶
Return the protocol that was selected during the TLS handshake.  If
 was not called, if the other party does
not support ALPN, if this socket does not support any of the client’s
proposed protocols, or if the handshake has not happened yet,  is
returned.

New in version 3.5.




()¶
Return the higher-level protocol that was selected during the TLS/SSL
handshake. If  was not called, or
if the other party does not support NPN, or if the handshake has not yet
happened, this will return .

New in version 3.3.




()¶
Performs the SSL shutdown handshake, which removes the TLS layer from the
underlying socket, and returns the underlying socket object.  This can be
used to go from encrypted operation over a connection to unencrypted.  The
returned socket should always be used for further communication with the
other side of the connection, rather than the original socket.



()¶
Requests post-handshake authentication (PHA) from a TLS 1.3 client. PHA
can only be initiated for a TLS 1.3 connection from a server-side socket,
after the initial TLS handshake and with PHA enabled on both sides, see
.
The method does not perform a cert exchange immediately. The server-side
sends a CertificateRequest during the next write event and expects the
client to respond with a certificate on the next read event.
If any precondition isn’t met (e.g. not TLS 1.3, PHA not enabled), an
 is raised.

Note
Only available with OpenSSL 1.1.1 and TLS 1.3 enabled. Without TLS 1.3
support, the method raises .


New in version 3.7.1.




()¶
Return the actual SSL protocol version negotiated by the connection
as a string, or  is no secure connection is established.
As of this writing, possible return values include ,
, ,  and .
Recent OpenSSL versions may define more return values.

New in version 3.5.




()¶
Returns the number of already decrypted bytes available for read, pending on
the connection.

SSL Contexts¶

New in version 3.2.

An SSL context holds various data longer-lived than single SSL connections,
such as SSL configuration options, certificate(s) and private key(s).
It also manages a cache of SSL sessions for server-side sockets, in order
to speed up repeated connections from the same clients.


class (protocol=PROTOCOL_TLS)¶
Create a new SSL context.  You may pass protocol which must be one
of the  constants defined in this module.  The parameter
specifies which version of the SSL protocol to use.  Typically, the
server chooses a particular protocol version, and the client must adapt
to the server’s choice.  Most of the versions are not interoperable
with the other versions.  If not specified, the default is
; it provides the most compatibility with other
versions.
Here’s a table showing which versions in a client (down the side) can connect
to which versions in a server (along the top):

 objects have the following methods and attributes:


()¶
Get statistics about quantities of loaded X.509 certificates, count of
X.509 certificates flagged as CA certificates and certificate revocation
lists as dictionary.
Example for a context with one CA cert and one other cert:



New in version 3.4.




(certfile, keyfile=None, password=None)¶
Load a private key and the corresponding certificate.  The certfile
string must be the path to a single file in PEM format containing the
certificate as well as any number of CA certificates needed to establish
the certificate’s authenticity.  The keyfile string, if present, must
point to a file containing the private key in.  Otherwise the private
key will be taken from certfile as well.  See the discussion of
Certificates for more information on how the certificate
is stored in the certfile.
The password argument may be a function to call to get the password for
decrypting the private key.  It will only be called if the private key is
encrypted and a password is necessary.  It will be called with no arguments,
and it should return a string, bytes, or bytearray.  If the return value is
a string it will be encoded as UTF-8 before using it to decrypt the key.
Alternatively a string, bytes, or bytearray value may be supplied directly
as the password argument.  It will be ignored if the private key is not
encrypted and no password is needed.
If the password argument is not specified and a password is required,
OpenSSL’s built-in password prompting mechanism will be used to
interactively prompt the user for a password.
An  is raised if the private key doesn’t
match with the certificate.

Changed in version 3.3: New optional argument password.




(purpose=Purpose.SERVER_AUTH)¶
Load a set of default “certification authority” (CA) certificates from
default locations. On Windows it loads CA certs from the  and
 system stores. On other systems it calls
. In the future the method may
load CA certificates from other locations, too.
The purpose flag specifies what kind of CA certificates are loaded. The
default settings  loads certificates, that are
flagged and trusted for TLS web server authentication (client side
sockets).  loads CA certificates for client
certificate verification on the server side.

New in version 3.4.




(cafile=None, capath=None, cadata=None)¶
Load a set of “certification authority” (CA) certificates used to validate
other peers’ certificates when  is other than
.  At least one of cafile or capath must be specified.
This method can also load certification revocation lists (CRLs) in PEM or
DER format. In order to make use of CRLs, 
must be configured properly.
The cafile string, if present, is the path to a file of concatenated
CA certificates in PEM format. See the discussion of
Certificates for more information about how to arrange the
certificates in this file.
The capath string, if present, is
the path to a directory containing several CA certificates in PEM format,
following an OpenSSL specific layout.
The cadata object, if present, is either an ASCII string of one or more
PEM-encoded certificates or a bytes-like object of DER-encoded
certificates. Like with capath extra lines around PEM-encoded
certificates are ignored but at least one certificate must be present.

Changed in version 3.4: New optional argument cadata




(binary_form=False)¶
Get a list of loaded “certification authority” (CA) certificates. If the
 parameter is  each list
entry is a dict like the output of . Otherwise
the method returns a list of DER-encoded certificates. The returned list
does not contain certificates from capath unless a certificate was
requested and loaded by a SSL connection.

Note
Certificates in a capath directory aren’t loaded unless they have
been used at least once.


New in version 3.4.




()¶
Get a list of enabled ciphers. The list is in order of cipher priority.
See .
Example:


On OpenSSL 1.1 and newer the cipher dict contains additional fields:


Availability: OpenSSL 1.0.2+.

New in version 3.6.




()¶
Load a set of default “certification authority” (CA) certificates from
a filesystem path defined when building the OpenSSL library.  Unfortunately,
there’s no easy way to know whether this method succeeds: no error is
returned if no certificates are to be found.  When the OpenSSL library is
provided as part of the operating system, though, it is likely to be
configured properly.



(ciphers)¶
Set the available ciphers for sockets created with this context.
It should be a string in the OpenSSL cipher list format.
If no cipher can be selected (because compile-time options or other
configuration forbids use of all the specified ciphers), an
 will be raised.

Note
when connected, the  method of SSL sockets will
give the currently selected cipher.
OpenSSL 1.1.1 has TLS 1.3 cipher suites enabled by default. The suites
cannot be disabled with .




(protocols)¶
Specify which protocols the socket should advertise during the SSL/TLS
handshake. It should be a list of ASCII strings, like , ordered by preference. The selection of a protocol will happen
during the handshake, and will play out according to RFC 7301. After a
successful handshake, the  method will
return the agreed-upon protocol.
This method will raise  if  is
False.
OpenSSL 1.1.0 to 1.1.0e will abort the handshake and raise 
when both sides support ALPN but cannot agree on a protocol. 1.1.0f+
behaves like 1.0.2,  returns None.

New in version 3.5.




(protocols)¶
Specify which protocols the socket should advertise during the SSL/TLS
handshake. It should be a list of strings, like ,
ordered by preference. The selection of a protocol will happen during the
handshake, and will play out according to the Application Layer Protocol Negotiation. After a
successful handshake, the  method will
return the agreed-upon protocol.
This method will raise  if  is
False.

New in version 3.3.




¶
Register a callback function that will be called after the TLS Client Hello
handshake message has been received by the SSL/TLS server when the TLS client
specifies a server name indication. The server name indication mechanism
is specified in RFC 6066 section 3 - Server Name Indication.
Only one callback can be set per .  If sni_callback
is set to  then the callback is disabled. Calling this function a
subsequent time will disable the previously registered callback.
The callback function will be called with three
arguments; the first being the , the second is a string
that represents the server name that the client is intending to communicate
(or  if the TLS Client Hello does not contain a server name)
and the third argument is the original . The server name
argument is text. For internationalized domain name, the server
name is an IDN A-label ().
A typical use of this callback is to change the ’s
 attribute to a new object of type
 representing a certificate chain that matches the server
name.
Due to the early negotiation phase of the TLS connection, only limited
methods and attributes are usable like
 and .
, ,
 and  methods require that
the TLS connection has progressed beyond the TLS Client Hello and therefore
will not contain return meaningful values nor can they be called safely.
The sni_callback function must return  to allow the
TLS negotiation to continue.  If a TLS failure is required, a constant
 can be
returned.  Other return values will result in a TLS fatal error with
.
If an exception is raised from the sni_callback function the TLS
connection will terminate with a fatal TLS alert message
.
This method will raise  if the OpenSSL library
had OPENSSL_NO_TLSEXT defined when it was built.

New in version 3.7.




(server_name_callback)¶
This is a legacy API retained for backwards compatibility. When possible,
you should use  instead. The given server_name_callback
is similar to sni_callback, except that when the server hostname is an
IDN-encoded internationalized domain name, the server_name_callback
receives a decoded U-label ().
If there is an decoding error on the server name, the TLS connection will
terminate with an  fatal TLS
alert message to the client.

New in version 3.4.




(dhfile)¶
Load the key generation parameters for Diffie-Hellman (DH) key exchange.
Using DH key exchange improves forward secrecy at the expense of
computational resources (both on the server and on the client).
The dhfile parameter should be the path to a file containing DH
parameters in PEM format.
This setting doesn’t apply to client sockets.  You can also use the
 option to further improve security.

New in version 3.3.




(curve_name)¶
Set the curve name for Elliptic Curve-based Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key
exchange.  ECDH is significantly faster than regular DH while arguably
as secure.  The curve_name parameter should be a string describing
a well-known elliptic curve, for example  for a widely
supported curve.
This setting doesn’t apply to client sockets.  You can also use the
 option to further improve security.
This method is not available if  is .

New in version 3.3.

(sock, server_side=False, do_handshake_on_connect=True, suppress_ragged_eofs=True, server_hostname=None, session=None)¶
Wrap an existing Python socket sock and return an instance of
 (default ). The
returned SSL socket is tied to the context, its settings and certificates.
sock must be a  socket; other
socket types are unsupported.
The parameter  is a boolean which identifies whether
server-side or client-side behavior is desired from this socket.
For client-side sockets, the context construction is lazy; if the
underlying socket isn’t connected yet, the context construction will be
performed after  is called on the socket.  For
server-side sockets, if the socket has no remote peer, it is assumed
to be a listening socket, and the server-side SSL wrapping is
automatically performed on client connections accepted via the
 method. The method may raise .
On client connections, the optional parameter server_hostname specifies
the hostname of the service which we are connecting to.  This allows a
single server to host multiple SSL-based services with distinct certificates,
quite similarly to HTTP virtual hosts. Specifying server_hostname will
raise a  if server_side is true.
The parameter  specifies whether to do the SSL
handshake automatically after doing a , or whether the
application program will call it explicitly, by invoking the
 method.  Calling
 explicitly gives the program control over the
blocking behavior of the socket I/O involved in the handshake.
The parameter  specifies how the
 method should signal unexpected EOF from the other end
of the connection.  If specified as  (the default), it returns a
normal EOF (an empty bytes object) in response to unexpected EOF errors
raised from the underlying socket; if , it will raise the
exceptions back to the caller.

(incoming, outgoing, server_side=False, server_hostname=None, session=None)¶
Wrap the BIO objects incoming and outgoing and return an instance of
attr:SSLContext.sslobject_class (default ). The SSL
routines will read input data from the incoming BIO and write data to the
outgoing BIO.
The server_side, server_hostname and session parameters have the
same meaning as in .

(by resetting the corresponding bits) will raise a .


Changed in version 3.6:  returns  flags:






¶
Enable TLS 1.3 post-handshake client authentication. Post-handshake auth
is disabled by default and a server can only request a TLS client
certificate during the initial handshake. When enabled, a server may
request a TLS client certificate at any time after the handshake.
When enabled on client-side sockets, the client signals the server that
it supports post-handshake authentication.
When enabled on server-side sockets,  must

Certificates¶
Certificates in general are part of a public-key / private-key system.  In this
system, each principal, (which may be a machine, or a person, or an
organization) is assigned a unique two-part encryption key.  One part of the key
is public, and is called the public key; the other part is kept secret, and is
called the private key.  The two parts are related, in that if you encrypt a
message with one of the parts, you can decrypt it with the other part, and
only with the other part.
A certificate contains information about two principals.  It contains the name
of a subject, and the subject’s public key.  It also contains a statement by a
second principal, the issuer, that the subject is who they claim to be, and
that this is indeed the subject’s public key.  The issuer’s statement is signed
with the issuer’s private key, which only the issuer knows.  However, anyone can
verify the issuer’s statement by finding the issuer’s public key, decrypting the
statement with it, and comparing it to the other information in the certificate.
The certificate also contains information about the time period over which it is
valid.  This is expressed as two fields, called “notBefore” and “notAfter”.
In the Python use of certificates, a client or server can use a certificate to
prove who they are.  The other side of a network connection can also be required
to produce a certificate, and that certificate can be validated to the
satisfaction of the client or server that requires such validation.  The
connection attempt can be set to raise an exception if the validation fails.
Validation is done automatically, by the underlying OpenSSL framework; the
application need not concern itself with its mechanics.  But the application
does usually need to provide sets of certificates to allow this process to take
place.
Python uses files to contain certificates.  They should be formatted as “PEM”
(see RFC 1422), which is a base-64 encoded form wrapped with a header line
and a footer line:



Certificate chains¶
The Python files which contain certificates can contain a sequence of
certificates, sometimes called a certificate chain.  This chain should start
with the specific certificate for the principal who “is” the client or server,
and then the certificate for the issuer of that certificate, and then the
certificate for the issuer of that certificate, and so on up the chain till
you get to a certificate which is self-signed, that is, a certificate which
has the same subject and issuer, sometimes called a root certificate.  The
certificates should just be concatenated together in the certificate file.  For
example, suppose we had a three certificate chain, from our server certificate
to the certificate of the certification authority that signed our server
certificate, to the root certificate of the agency which issued the
certification authority’s certificate:




CA certificates¶
If you are going to require validation of the other side of the connection’s
certificate, you need to provide a “CA certs” file, filled with the certificate
chains for each issuer you are willing to trust.  Again, this file just contains
these chains concatenated together.  For validation, Python will use the first
chain it finds in the file which matches.  The platform’s certificates file can
be used by calling , this is done
automatically with .


Combined key and certificate¶
Often the private key is stored in the same file as the certificate; in this
case, only the  parameter to 
and  needs to be passed.  If the private key is stored
with the certificate, it should come before the first certificate in
the certificate chain:




Self-signed certificates¶
If you are going to create a server that provides SSL-encrypted connection
services, you will need to acquire a certificate for that service.  There are
many ways of acquiring appropriate certificates, such as buying one from a
certification authority.  Another common practice is to generate a self-signed
certificate.  The simplest way to do this is with the OpenSSL package, using
something like the following:


The disadvantage of a self-signed certificate is that it is its own root
certificate, and no one else will have it in their cache of known (and trusted)
root certificates.



Examples¶

Testing for SSL support¶
To test for the presence of SSL support in a Python installation, user code
should use the following idiom:




Client-side operation¶
This example creates a SSL context with the recommended security settings
for client sockets, including automatic certificate verification:


If you prefer to tune security settings yourself, you might create
a context from scratch (but beware that you might not get the settings
right):


(this snippet assumes your operating system places a bundle of all CA
certificates in ; if not, you’ll get an
error and have to adjust the location)
When you use the context to connect to a server, 
validates the server certificate: it ensures that the server certificate
was signed with one of the CA certificates, and checks the signature for
correctness:


You may then fetch the certificate:


Visual inspection shows that the certificate does identify the desired service
(that is, the HTTPS host ):


Now the SSL channel is established and the certificate verified, you can
proceed to talk with the server:


See the discussion of Security considerations below.


Server-side operation¶
For server operation, typically you’ll need to have a server certificate, and
private key, each in a file.  You’ll first create a context holding the key
and the certificate, so that clients can check your authenticity.  Then
you’ll open a socket, bind it to a port, call  on it, and start
waiting for clients to connect:


When a client connects, you’ll call  on the socket to get the
new socket from the other end, and use the context’s 
method to create a server-side SSL socket for the connection:


Then you’ll read data from the  and do something with it till you
are finished with the client (or the client is finished with you):


And go back to listening for new client connections (of course, a real server
would probably handle each client connection in a separate thread, or put
the sockets in non-blocking mode and use an event loop).



Notes on non-blocking sockets¶
SSL sockets behave slightly different than regular sockets in
non-blocking mode. When working with non-blocking sockets, there are
thus several things you need to be aware of:

Most  methods will raise either
 or  instead of
 if an I/O operation would
block.  will be raised if a read operation on
the underlying socket is necessary, and  for
a write operation on the underlying socket. Note that attempts to
write to an SSL socket may require reading from the underlying
socket first, and attempts to read from the SSL socket may require
a prior write to the underlying socket.

Changed in version 3.5: In earlier Python versions, the  method
returned zero instead of raising  or
.


Calling  tells you that the OS-level socket can be
read from (or written to), but it does not imply that there is sufficient
data at the upper SSL layer.  For example, only part of an SSL frame might
have arrived.  Therefore, you must be ready to handle 
and  failures, and retry after another call to
.

Conversely, since the SSL layer has its own framing, a SSL socket may
still have data available for reading without 
being aware of it.  Therefore, you should first call
 to drain any potentially available data, and then
only block on a  call if still necessary.
(of course, similar provisions apply when using other primitives such as
, or those in the  module)

The SSL handshake itself will be non-blocking: the
 method has to be retried until it returns
successfully.  Here is a synopsis using  to wait for
the socket’s readiness:





See also
The  module supports non-blocking SSL sockets and provides a
higher level API. It polls for events using the  module and
handles ,  and
 exceptions. It runs the SSL handshake asynchronously
as well.



Memory BIO Support¶

New in version 3.5.

Ever since the SSL module was introduced in Python 2.6, the 
class has provided two related but distinct areas of functionality:

SSL protocol handling
Network IO

The network IO API is identical to that provided by ,
from which  also inherits. This allows an SSL socket to be
used as a drop-in replacement for a regular socket, making it very easy to add
SSL support to an existing application.
Combining SSL protocol handling and network IO usually works well, but there
are some cases where it doesn’t. An example is async IO frameworks that want to
use a different IO multiplexing model than the “select/poll on a file
descriptor” (readiness based) model that is assumed by 
and by the internal OpenSSL socket IO routines. This is mostly relevant for
platforms like Windows where this model is not efficient. For this purpose, a
reduced scope variant of  called  is
provided.


class ¶
A reduced-scope variant of  representing an SSL protocol
instance that does not contain any network IO methods. This class is
typically used by framework authors that want to implement asynchronous IO
for SSL through memory buffers.
This class implements an interface on top of a low-level SSL object as
implemented by OpenSSL. This object captures the state of an SSL connection
but does not provide any network IO itself. IO needs to be performed through
separate “BIO” objects which are OpenSSL’s IO abstraction layer.
This class has no public constructor.  An  instance
must be created using the  method. This
method will create the  instance and bind it to a
pair of BIOs. The incoming BIO is used to pass data from Python to the
SSL protocol instance, while the outgoing BIO is used to pass data the
other way around.
The following methods are available:


















When compared to , this object lacks the following
features:

Any form of network IO;  and  read and write only to
the underlying  buffers.
There is no do_handshake_on_connect machinery. You must always manually
call  to start the handshake.
There is no handling of suppress_ragged_eofs. All end-of-file conditions
that are in violation of the protocol are reported via the
 exception.
The method  call does not return anything,
unlike for an SSL socket where it returns the underlying socket.
The server_name_callback callback passed to
 will get an 
instance instead of a  instance as its first parameter.

Some notes related to the use of :

All IO on an  is non-blocking.
This means that for example  will raise an
 if it needs more data than the incoming BIO has
available.
There is no module-level  call like there is for
. An  is always created
via an .


Changed in version 3.7:  instances must to created with
. In earlier versions, it was possible to
create instances directly. This was never documented or officially
supported.


An SSLObject communicates with the outside world using memory buffers. The
class  provides a memory buffer that can be used for this
purpose.  It wraps an OpenSSL memory BIO (Basic IO) object:


class ¶
A memory buffer that can be used to pass data between Python and an SSL
protocol instance.


¶
Return the number of bytes currently in the memory buffer.



¶
A boolean indicating whether the memory BIO is current at the end-of-file
position.



(n=-1)¶
Read up to n bytes from the memory buffer. If n is not specified or
negative, all bytes are returned.



(buf)¶
Write the bytes from buf to the memory BIO. The buf argument must be an
object supporting the buffer protocol.
The return value is the number of bytes written, which is always equal to
the length of buf.



()¶
Write an EOF marker to the memory BIO. After this method has been called, it
is illegal to call . The attribute  will
become true after all data currently in the buffer has been read.




SSL session¶

Security considerations¶

Best defaults¶
For client use, if you don’t have any special requirements for your
security policy, it is highly recommended that you use the
 function to create your SSL context.
It will load the system’s trusted CA certificates, enable certificate
validation and hostname checking, and try to choose reasonably secure
protocol and cipher settings.
For example, here is how you would use the  class to
create a trusted, secure connection to a SMTP server:


If a client certificate is needed for the connection, it can be added with
.
By contrast, if you create the SSL context by calling the 
constructor yourself, it will not have certificate validation nor hostname
checking enabled by default.  If you do so, please read the paragraphs below
to achieve a good security level.


Manual settings¶

Verifying certificates¶
When calling the  constructor directly,
 is the default.  Since it does not authenticate the other
peer, it can be insecure, especially in client mode where most of time you
would like to ensure the authenticity of the server you’re talking to.
Therefore, when in client mode, it is highly recommended to use
.  However, it is in itself not sufficient; you also
have to check that the server certificate, which can be obtained by calling
, matches the desired service.  For many
protocols and applications, the service can be identified by the hostname;
in this case, the  function can be used.  This common
check is automatically performed when  is
enabled.

Changed in version 3.7: Hostname matchings is now performed by OpenSSL. Python no longer uses
.

In server mode, if you want to authenticate your clients using the SSL layer
(rather than using a higher-level authentication mechanism), you’ll also have
to specify  and similarly check the client certificate.


Protocol versions¶
SSL versions 2 and 3 are considered insecure and are therefore dangerous to
use.  If you want maximum compatibility between clients and servers, it is
recommended to use  or
 as the protocol version. SSLv2 and SSLv3 are
disabled by default.


The SSL context created above will only allow TLSv1.2 and later (if
supported by your system) connections to a server. 
implies certificate validation and hostname checks by default. You have to
load certificates into the context.


Cipher selection¶
If you have advanced security requirements, fine-tuning of the ciphers
enabled when negotiating a SSL session is possible through the
 method.  Starting from Python 3.2.3, the
ssl module disables certain weak ciphers by default, but you may want
to further restrict the cipher choice. Be sure to read OpenSSL’s documentation
about the cipher list format.
If you want to check which ciphers are enabled by a given cipher list, use
 or the  command on your
system.



Multi-processing¶
If using this module as part of a multi-processed application (using,
for example the  or  modules),
be aware that OpenSSL’s internal random number generator does not properly
handle forked processes.  Applications must change the PRNG state of the
parent process if they use any SSL feature with .  Any
successful call of ,  or
 is sufficient.



TLS 1.3¶

New in version 3.7.

Python has provisional and experimental support for TLS 1.3 with OpenSSL
1.1.1.  The new protocol behaves slightly differently than previous version
of TLS/SSL.  Some new TLS 1.3 features are not yet available.

TLS 1.3 uses a disjunct set of cipher suites. All AES-GCM and
ChaCha20 cipher suites are enabled by default.  The method
 cannot enable or disable any TLS 1.3
ciphers yet, but  returns them.
Session tickets are no longer sent as part of the initial handshake and
are handled differently.   and 
are not compatible with TLS 1.3.
Client-side certificates are also no longer verified during the initial
handshake.  A server can request a certificate at any time.  Clients
process certificate requests while they send or receive application data
from the server.
TLS 1.3 features like early data, deferred TLS client cert request,
signature algorithm configuration, and rekeying are not supported yet.



LibreSSL support¶
LibreSSL is a fork of OpenSSL 1.0.1. The ssl module has limited support for
LibreSSL. Some features are not available when the ssl module is compiled
with LibreSSL.

LibreSSL >= 2.6.1 no longer supports NPN. The methods
 and
 are not available.
 ignores the env vars
 and  although
 still reports them.
