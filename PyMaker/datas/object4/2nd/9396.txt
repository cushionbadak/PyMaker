 Objects¶

New in version 3.5.

 objects are created from actual exceptions to
capture data for later printing in a lightweight fashion.


class (exc_type, exc_value, exc_traceback, *, limit=None, lookup_lines=True, capture_locals=False)¶
Capture an exception for later rendering. limit, lookup_lines and
capture_locals are as for the  class.
Note that when locals are captured, they are also shown in the traceback.


¶
A  of the original .



¶
A  of the original .



¶
The  value from the original exception.



¶
A  representing the traceback.



¶
The class of the original traceback.



¶
For syntax errors - the file name where the error occurred.



¶
For syntax errors - the line number where the error occurred.



¶
For syntax errors - the text where the error occurred.



¶
For syntax errors - the offset into the text where the error occurred.



¶
For syntax errors - the compiler error message.



classmethod (exc, *, limit=None, lookup_lines=True, capture_locals=False)¶
Capture an exception for later rendering. limit, lookup_lines and
capture_locals are as for the  class.
Note that when locals are captured, they are also shown in the traceback.



(*, chain=True)¶
Format the exception.
If chain is not ,  and  will not
be formatted.
The return value is a generator of strings, each ending in a newline and
some containing internal newlines. 
is a wrapper around this method which just prints the lines to a file.
The message indicating which exception occurred is always the last
string in the output.



()¶
Format the exception part of the traceback.
The return value is a generator of strings, each ending in a newline.
Normally, the generator emits a single string; however, for
 exceptions, it emits several lines that (when
printed) display detailed information about where the syntax
error occurred.
The message indicating which exception occurred is always the last
string in the output.
