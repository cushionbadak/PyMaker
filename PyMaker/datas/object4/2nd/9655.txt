abstractmethod ()Â¶
Returns an iterable of strings over the contents of
the package. Do note that it is not required that all names
returned by the iterator be actual resources, e.g. it is
acceptable to return names for which  would
be false.
Allowing non-resource names to be returned is to allow for
situations where how a package and its resources are stored
are known a priori and the non-resource names would be useful.
For instance, returning subdirectory names is allowed so that
when it is known that the package and resources are stored on
the file system then those subdirectory names can be used
directly.
The abstract method returns an iterable of no items.
