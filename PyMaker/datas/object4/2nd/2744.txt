docs:


(fileobject, space_around_delimiters=True)Â¶
Write a representation of the configuration to the specified file
object, which must be opened in text mode (accepting strings).  This
representation can be parsed by a future  call.  If
space_around_delimiters is true, delimiters between
keys and values are surrounded by spaces.
