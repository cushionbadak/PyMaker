(record)¶
The record is formatted, and then sent to the syslog server. If exception
information is present, it is not sent to the server.

Changed in version 3.2.1: (See: bpo-12168.) In earlier versions, the message sent to the
syslog daemons was always terminated with a NUL byte, because early
versions of these daemons expected a NUL terminated message - even
though it’s not in the relevant specification (RFC 5424). More recent
versions of these daemons don’t expect the NUL byte but strip it off
if it’s there, and even more recent daemons (which adhere more closely
to RFC 5424) pass the NUL byte on as part of the message.
To enable easier handling of syslog messages in the face of all these
differing daemon behaviours, the appending of the NUL byte has been
made configurable, through the use of a class-level attribute,
. This defaults to  (preserving the existing
behaviour) but can be set to  on a  instance
in order for that instance to not append the NUL terminator.


Changed in version 3.3: (See: bpo-12419.) In earlier versions, there was no facility for
an “ident” or “tag” prefix to identify the source of the message. This
can now be specified using a class-level attribute, defaulting to
 to preserve existing behaviour, but which can be overridden on
a  instance in order for that instance to prepend
the ident to every message handled. Note that the provided ident must
be text, not bytes, and is prepended to the message exactly as is.
