(module, path=None)Â¶
Return a dictionary mapping module-level class names to class
descriptors.  If possible, descriptors for imported base classes are
included.  Parameter module is a string with the name of the module
to read; it may be the name of a module within a package.  If given,
path is a sequence of directory paths prepended to ,
which is used to locate the module source code.
