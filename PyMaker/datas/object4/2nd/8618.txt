call¶


(*args, **kwargs)¶
 is a helper object for making simpler assertions, for comparing with
, ,
 and .  can also be
used with .





()¶
For a call object that represents multiple calls, 
returns a list of all the intermediate calls as well as the
final call.

 is particularly useful for making assertions on “chained calls”. A
chained call is multiple calls on a single line of code. This results in
multiple entries in  on a mock. Manually constructing
the sequence of calls can be tedious.
 can construct the sequence of calls from the same
chained call:


A  object is either a tuple of (positional args, keyword args) or
(name, positional args, keyword args) depending on how it was constructed. When
you construct them yourself this isn’t particularly interesting, but the 
objects that are in the ,  and
 attributes can be introspected to get at the individual
arguments they contain.
The  objects in  and 
are two-tuples of (positional args, keyword args) whereas the  objects
in , along with ones you construct yourself, are
three-tuples of (name, positional args, keyword args).
You can use their “tupleness” to pull out the individual arguments for more
complex introspection and assertions. The positional arguments are a tuple
(an empty tuple if there are no positional arguments) and the keyword
arguments are a dictionary:
