docs:


class ([dict])¶
Mapping class that references values weakly.  Entries in the dictionary will be
discarded when no strong reference to the value exists any more.

Note
Caution:  Because a  is built on top of a Python
dictionary, it must not change size when iterating over it.  This can be
difficult to ensure for a  because actions performed
by the program during iteration may cause items in the dictionary to vanish “by
magic” (as a side effect of garbage collection).
