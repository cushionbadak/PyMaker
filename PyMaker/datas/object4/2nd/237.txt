6.3.1. Attribute referencesÂ¶
An attribute reference is a primary followed by a period and a name:

The primary must evaluate to an object of a type that supports attribute
references, which most objects do.  This object is then asked to produce the
attribute whose name is the identifier.  This production can be customized by
overriding the  method.  If this attribute is not available,
the exception  is raised.  Otherwise, the type and value of
the object produced is determined by the object.  Multiple evaluations of the
same attribute reference may yield different objects.
