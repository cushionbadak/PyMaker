(lambd)¶
Exponential distribution.  lambd is 1.0 divided by the desired
mean.  It should be nonzero.  (The parameter would be called
“lambda”, but that is a reserved word in Python.)  Returned values
range from 0 to positive infinity if lambd is positive, and from
negative infinity to 0 if lambd is negative.
