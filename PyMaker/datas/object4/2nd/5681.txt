docs:


(i=None, decode=False)¶
Return the current payload, which will be a list of
 objects when  is , or a
string when  is .  If the payload is a list
and you mutate the list object, you modify the message’s payload in place.
With optional argument i,  will return the i-th
element of the payload, counting from zero, if  is
.  An  will be raised if i is less than 0 or
greater than or equal to the number of items in the payload.  If the
payload is a string (i.e.   is ) and i is
given, a  is raised.
Optional decode is a flag indicating whether the payload should be
decoded or not, according to the Content-Transfer-Encoding
header. When  and the message is not a multipart, the payload will
be decoded if this header’s value is  or .
If some other encoding is used, or Content-Transfer-Encoding
header is missing, the payload is
returned as-is (undecoded).  In all cases the returned value is binary
data.  If the message is a multipart and the decode flag is ,
then  is returned.  If the payload is base64 and it was not
perfectly formed (missing padding, characters outside the base64
alphabet), then an appropriate defect will be added to the message’s
defect property ( or
, respectively).
When decode is  (the default) the body is returned as a string
without decoding the Content-Transfer-Encoding.  However,
for a Content-Transfer-Encoding of 8bit, an attempt is made
to decode the original bytes using the  specified by the
Content-Type header, using the  error handler.
If no  is specified, or if the  given is not
recognized by the email package, the body is decoded using the default
ASCII charset.
This is a legacy method.  On the
 class its functionality is
replaced by  and
.
