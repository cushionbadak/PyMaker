(obj, attr, new_val)¶
Context manager to swap out an item with a new object.
Usage:


This will set  to 5 for the duration of the  block,
restoring the old value at the end of the block. If  doesn’t
exist on , it will be created and then deleted at the end of the
block.
The old value (or  if it doesn’t exist) will be assigned to the
target of the “as” clause, if there is one.
