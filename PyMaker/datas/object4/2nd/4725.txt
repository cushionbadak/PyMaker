Subprocess and ThreadsÂ¶
Standard asyncio event loop supports running subprocesses from
different threads, but there are limitations:

An event loop must run in the main thread.
The child watcher must be instantiated in the main thread
before executing subprocesses from other threads. Call the
 function in the main thread to instantiate
the child watcher.

Note that alternative event loop implementations might not share
the above limitations; please refer to their documentation.
