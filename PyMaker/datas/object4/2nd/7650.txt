docs:


(pos, whence=0)¶
Set the chunk’s current position.  The whence argument is optional and
defaults to  (absolute file positioning); other values are 
(seek relative to the current position) and  (seek relative to the
file’s end).  There is no return value. If the underlying file does not
allow seek, only forward seeks are allowed.
