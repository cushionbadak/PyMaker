 — Demo scripts¶
The  package includes a set of demo scripts.  These
scripts can be run and viewed using the supplied demo viewer as follows:


Alternatively, you can run the demo scripts individually.  For example,


The  package directory contains:

A demo viewer  which can be used to view the sourcecode
of the scripts and run them at the same time.
Multiple scripts demonstrating different features of the 
module.  Examples can be accessed via the Examples menu.  They can also
be run standalone.
A  file which serves as an example of how to write
and use such files.

The demo scripts are:
