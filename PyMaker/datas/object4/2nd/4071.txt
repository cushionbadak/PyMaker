docs:


class (name, mode=DEFAULT_MODE, handle=None)Â¶
Instances of this class behave like  instances, except that the
Python GIL is not released during the function call, and after the function
execution the Python error flag is checked. If the error flag is set, a Python
exception is raised.
Thus, this is only useful to call Python C api functions directly.
