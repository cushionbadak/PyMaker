Â¶
If true, load cookies lazily from disk.  This attribute should not be assigned
to.  This is only a hint, since this only affects performance, not behaviour
(unless the cookies on disk are changing). A  object may
ignore it.  None of the  classes included in the standard
library lazily loads cookies.
