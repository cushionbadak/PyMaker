Event¶


class (*, loop=None)¶
An event object.  Not thread-safe.
An asyncio event can be used to notify multiple asyncio tasks
that some event has happened.
An Event object manages an internal flag that can be set to true
with the  method and reset to false with the
 method.  The  method blocks until the
flag is set to true.  The flag is set to false initially.
Example:




coroutine ()¶
Wait until the event is set.
If the event is set, return  immediately.
Otherwise block until another task calls .



()¶
Set the event.
All tasks waiting for event to be set will be immediately
awakened.



()¶
Clear (unset) the event.
Tasks awaiting on  will now block until the
 method is called again.



()¶
Return  if the event is set.
