(size)Â¶
Return a string of size random bytes suitable for cryptographic use.
This function returns random bytes from an OS-specific randomness source.  The
returned data should be unpredictable enough for cryptographic applications,
though its exact quality depends on the OS implementation.
On Linux, if the  syscall is available, it is used in
blocking mode: block until the system urandom entropy pool is initialized
(128 bits of entropy are collected by the kernel). See the PEP 524 for
the rationale. On Linux, the  function can be used to get
random bytes in non-blocking mode (using the  flag) or
to poll until the system urandom entropy pool is initialized.
On a Unix-like system, random bytes are read from the 
device. If the  device is not available or not readable, the
 exception is raised.
On Windows, it will use .

Changed in version 3.6.0: On Linux,  is now used in blocking mode to increase the
security.


Changed in version 3.5.2: On Linux, if the  syscall blocks (the urandom entropy pool
is not initialized yet), fall back on reading .


Changed in version 3.5: On Linux 3.17 and newer, the  syscall is now used
when available.  On OpenBSD 5.6 and newer, the C 
function is now used. These functions avoid the usage of an internal file
descriptor.
