()Â¶
Return POSIX timestamp corresponding to the 
instance.  The return value is a  similar to that
returned by .
Naive  instances are assumed to represent local
time and this method relies on the platform C 
function to perform the conversion.  Since 
supports wider range of values than  on many
platforms, this method may raise  for times far
in the past or far in the future.
For aware  instances, the return value is computed
as:



New in version 3.3.


Changed in version 3.6: The  method uses the  attribute to
disambiguate the times during a repeated interval.


Note
There is no method to obtain the POSIX timestamp directly from a
naive  instance representing UTC time.  If your
application uses this convention and your system timezone is not
set to UTC, you can obtain the POSIX timestamp by supplying
:


or by calculating the timestamp directly:
