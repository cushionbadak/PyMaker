(tabsize=8)¶

(tabsize=8)¶
Return a copy of the sequence where all ASCII tab characters are replaced
by one or more ASCII spaces, depending on the current column and the given
tab size.  Tab positions occur every tabsize bytes (default is 8,
giving tab positions at columns 0, 8, 16 and so on).  To expand the
sequence, the current column is set to zero and the sequence is examined
byte by byte.  If the byte is an ASCII tab character (), one or
more space characters are inserted in the result until the current column
is equal to the next tab position. (The tab character itself is not
copied.)  If the current byte is an ASCII newline () or
carriage return (), it is copied and the current column is reset
to zero.  Any other byte value is copied unchanged and the current column
is incremented by one regardless of how the byte value is represented when
printed:



Note
The bytearray version of this method does not operate in place - it
always produces a new object, even if no changes were made.
