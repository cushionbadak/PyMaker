()¶
Return a measure of the sequences’ similarity as a float in the range [0,
1].
Where T is the total number of elements in both sequences, and M is the
number of matches, this is 2.0*M / T. Note that this is  if the
sequences are identical, and  if they have nothing in common.
This is expensive to compute if  or
 hasn’t already been called, in which case you may want
to try  or  first to get an
upper bound.
