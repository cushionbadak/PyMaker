(user, password, *, initial_response_ok=True)¶
Log in on an SMTP server that requires authentication. The arguments are the
username and the password to authenticate with. If there has been no previous
 or  command this session, this method tries ESMTP 
first. This method will return normally if the authentication was successful, or
may raise the following exceptions:


The server didn’t reply properly to the  greeting.

The server didn’t accept the username/password combination.

The  command is not supported by the server.

No suitable authentication method was found.

Each of the authentication methods supported by  are tried in
turn if they are advertised as supported by the server.  See 
for a list of supported authentication methods.  initial_response_ok is
passed through to .
Optional keyword argument initial_response_ok specifies whether, for
authentication methods that support it, an “initial response” as specified
in RFC 4954 can be sent along with the  command, rather than
requiring a challenge/response.

Changed in version 3.5:  may be raised, and the
initial_response_ok parameter was added.
