(fun, key=None)¶




Parameters:
fun – a function with no arguments or 
key – a string: key (e.g. “a”) or key-symbol (e.g. “space”)





Bind fun to key-press event of key if key is given,
or to any key-press-event if no key is given.
Remark: in order to be able to register key-events, TurtleScreen
must have focus. (See method .)
