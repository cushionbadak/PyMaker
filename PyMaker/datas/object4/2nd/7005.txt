docs:


(hdr, str, *, file=None)Â¶
Send an  command.  The hdr argument is a header keyword, e.g.
.  The str argument should have the form 
where first and last are the first and last article numbers to search.
Return a pair , where list is a list of pairs , where id is an article number (as a string) and text is the text of
the requested header for that article. If the file parameter is supplied, then
the output of the   command is stored in a file.  If file is a string,
then the method will open a file with that name, write to it  then close it.
If file is a file object, then it will start calling  on
it to store the lines of the command output. If file is supplied, then the
returned list is an empty list.
