docs:


(wait=True)Â¶
Signal the executor that it should free any resources that it is using
when the currently pending futures are done executing.  Calls to
 and  made after shutdown will
raise .
If wait is  then this method will not return until all the
pending futures are done executing and the resources associated with the
executor have been freed.  If wait is  then this method will
return immediately and the resources associated with the executor will be
freed when all pending futures are done executing.  Regardless of the
value of wait, the entire Python program will not exit until all
pending futures are done executing.
You can avoid having to call this method explicitly if you use the
 statement, which will shutdown the 
(waiting as if  were called with wait set to
):
