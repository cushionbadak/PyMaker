docs:


class ¶
Class implementing event objects.  An event manages a flag that can be set to
true with the  method and reset to false with the
 method.  The  method blocks until the flag is true.
The flag is initially false.

Changed in version 3.3: changed from a factory function to a class.



()¶
Return true if and only if the internal flag is true.



()¶
Set the internal flag to true. All threads waiting for it to become true
are awakened. Threads that call  once the flag is true will
not block at all.



()¶
Reset the internal flag to false. Subsequently, threads calling
 will block until  is called to set the internal
flag to true again.



(timeout=None)¶
Block until the internal flag is true.  If the internal flag is true on
entry, return immediately.  Otherwise, block until another thread calls
 to set the flag to true, or until the optional timeout occurs.
When the timeout argument is present and not , it should be a
floating point number specifying a timeout for the operation in seconds
(or fractions thereof).
This method returns true if and only if the internal flag has been set to
true, either before the wait call or after the wait starts, so it will
always return  except if a timeout is given and the operation
times out.

Changed in version 3.1: Previously, the method always returned .
