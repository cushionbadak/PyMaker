docs:


(object)Â¶
Return a list of source lines and starting line number for an object. The
argument may be a module, class, method, function, traceback, frame, or code
object.  The source code is returned as a list of the lines corresponding to the
object and the line number indicates where in the original source file the first
line of code was found.  An  is raised if the source code cannot
be retrieved.

Changed in version 3.3:  is raised instead of , now an alias of the
former.
