docs:


class (host, port=563, user=None, password=None, ssl_context=None, readermode=None, usenetrc=False[, timeout])Â¶
Return a new  object, representing an encrypted
connection to the NNTP server running on host host, listening at
port port.   objects have the same methods as
 objects.  If port is omitted, port 563 (NNTPS) is used.
ssl_context is also optional, and is a  object.
Please read Security considerations for best practices.
All other parameters behave the same as for .
Note that SSL-on-563 is discouraged per RFC 4642, in favor of
STARTTLS as described below.  However, some servers only support the
former.

New in version 3.2.


Changed in version 3.4: The class now supports hostname check with
 and Server Name Indication (see
).
