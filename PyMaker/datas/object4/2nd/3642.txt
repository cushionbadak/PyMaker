class (mailhost, fromaddr, toaddrs, subject, credentials=None, secure=None, timeout=1.0)¶
Returns a new instance of the  class. The instance is
initialized with the from and to addresses and subject line of the email. The
toaddrs should be a list of strings. To specify a non-standard SMTP port, use
the (host, port) tuple format for the mailhost argument. If you use a string,
the standard SMTP port is used. If your SMTP server requires authentication, you
can specify a (username, password) tuple for the credentials argument.
To specify the use of a secure protocol (TLS), pass in a tuple to the
secure argument. This will only be used when authentication credentials are
supplied. The tuple should be either an empty tuple, or a single-value tuple
with the name of a keyfile, or a 2-value tuple with the names of the keyfile
and certificate file. (This tuple is passed to the
 method.)
A timeout can be specified for communication with the SMTP server using the
timeout argument.

New in version 3.3: The timeout argument was added.



(record)¶
Formats the record and sends it to the specified addressees.



(record)¶
If you want to specify a subject line which is record-dependent, override
this method.
