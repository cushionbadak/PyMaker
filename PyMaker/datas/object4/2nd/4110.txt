docs:


(code=None, descr=None)Â¶
Windows only: this function is probably the worst-named thing in ctypes. It
creates an instance of OSError.  If code is not specified,
 is called to determine the error code. If descr is not
specified,  is called to get a textual description of the
error.

Changed in version 3.3: An instance of  used to be created.
