docs:


(list)Â¶
Return the longest path prefix (taken character-by-character) that is a
prefix of all paths in  list.  If list is empty, return the empty string
().

Note
This function may return invalid paths because it works a
character at a time.  To obtain a valid path, see
.




Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a path-like object.
