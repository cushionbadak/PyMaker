Â¶
This is a list of all the calls made to the mock object in sequence
(so the length of the list is the number of times it has been
called). Before any calls have been made it is an empty list. The
 object can be used for conveniently constructing lists of
calls to compare with .


Members of  are  objects. These can be
unpacked as tuples to get at the individual arguments. See
calls as tuples.
