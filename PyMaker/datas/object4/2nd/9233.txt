¶
A list of meta path finder objects that have their
 methods called to see if one
of the objects can find the module to be imported. The
 method is called with at

attribute is passed in as a second argument. The method returns a
module spec, or  if the module cannot be found.

This is still called as a fallback if a  entry doesn’t
have a  method.
