docs:


Â¶
The HTTP request method to use.  By default its value is ,
which means that  will do its normal computation
of the method to be used.  Its value can be set (thus overriding the default
computation in ) either by providing a default
value by setting it at the class level in a  subclass, or by
passing a value in to the  constructor via the method
argument.

New in version 3.3.


Changed in version 3.4: A default value can now be set in subclasses; previously it could only
be set via the constructor argument.
