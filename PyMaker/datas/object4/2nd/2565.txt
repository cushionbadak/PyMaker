ZipInfo Objects¶
Instances of the  class are returned by the  and
 methods of  objects.  Each object stores
information about a single member of the ZIP archive.
There is one classmethod to make a  instance for a filesystem
file:


classmethod (filename, arcname=None)¶
Construct a  instance for a file on the filesystem, in
preparation for adding it to a zip file.
filename should be the path to a file or directory on the filesystem.
If arcname is specified, it is used as the name within the archive.
If arcname is not specified, the name will be the same as filename, but
with any drive letter and leading path separators removed.
