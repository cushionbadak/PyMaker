docs:


(etype, value, tb, limit=None, chain=True)Â¶
Format a stack trace and the exception information.  The arguments  have the
same meaning as the corresponding arguments to .  The
return value is a list of strings, each ending in a newline and some
containing internal newlines.  When these lines are concatenated and printed,
exactly the same text is printed as does .

Changed in version 3.5: The etype argument is ignored and inferred from the type of value.
