docs:


(blocking=True, timeout=-1)Â¶
Acquire a lock, blocking or non-blocking.
When invoked with the blocking argument set to  (the default),
block until the lock is unlocked, then set it to locked and return .
When invoked with the blocking argument set to , do not block.
If a call with blocking set to  would block, return 
immediately; otherwise, set the lock to locked and return .
When invoked with the floating-point timeout argument set to a positive
value, block for at most the number of seconds specified by timeout
and as long as the lock cannot be acquired.  A timeout argument of 
specifies an unbounded wait.  It is forbidden to specify a timeout
when blocking is false.
The return value is  if the lock is acquired successfully,
 if not (for example if the timeout expired).

Changed in version 3.2: The timeout parameter is new.


Changed in version 3.2: Lock acquisition can now be interrupted by signals on POSIX if the
underlying threading implementation supports it.
