docs:


(item, block=True, timeout=None)Â¶
Put item into the queue. If optional args block is true and timeout is
 (the default), block if necessary until a free slot is available. If
timeout is a positive number, it blocks at most timeout seconds and raises
the  exception if no free slot was available within that time.
Otherwise (block is false), put an item on the queue if a free slot is
immediately available, else raise the  exception (timeout is
ignored in that case).
