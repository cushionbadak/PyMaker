Command-line options¶
unittest supports these command-line options:


¶
The standard output and standard error streams are buffered during the test
run. Output during a passing test is discarded. Output is echoed normally
on test fail or error and is added to the failure messages.



¶
Control-C during the test run waits for the current test to end and then
reports all the results so far. A second Control-C raises the normal
 exception.
See Signal Handling for the functions that provide this functionality.



¶
Stop the test run on the first error or failure.



¶
Only run test methods and classes that match the pattern or substring.
This option may be used multiple times, in which case all test cases that
match of the given patterns are included.
Patterns that contain a wildcard character () are matched against the
test name using ; otherwise simple case-sensitive
substring matching is used.
Patterns are matched against the fully qualified test method name as
imported by the test loader.
For example,  matches ,
, but not .



¶
Show local variables in tracebacks.


New in version 3.2: The command-line options ,  and  were added.


New in version 3.5: The command-line option .

The command line can also be used for test discovery, for running all of the
tests in a project or just a subset.
