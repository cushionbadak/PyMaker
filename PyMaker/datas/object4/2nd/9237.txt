docs:


Â¶
A dictionary acting as a cache for finder objects. The keys are
paths that have been passed to  and the values are
the finders that are found. If a path is a valid file system path but no
finder is found on  then  is
stored.
Originally specified in PEP 302.

Changed in version 3.3:  is stored instead of  when no finder
is found.
