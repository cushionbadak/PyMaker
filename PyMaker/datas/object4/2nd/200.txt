5.4.5. module.__path__¶
By definition, if a module has a  attribute, it is a package.
A package’s  attribute is used during imports of its subpackages.
Within the import machinery, it functions much the same as ,
i.e. providing a list of locations to search for modules during import.
However,  is typically much more constrained than
.
 must be an iterable of strings, but it may be empty.
The same rules used for  also apply to a package’s
, and  (described below) are
consulted when traversing a package’s .
A package’s  file may set or alter the package’s 
attribute, and this was typically the way namespace packages were implemented
prior to PEP 420.  With the adoption of PEP 420, namespace packages no
longer need to supply  files containing only 
manipulation code; the import machinery automatically sets 
correctly for the namespace package.
