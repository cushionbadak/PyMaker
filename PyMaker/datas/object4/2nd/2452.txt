Converting SQLite values to custom Python types¶
Writing an adapter lets you send custom Python types to SQLite. But to make it
really useful we need to make the Python to SQLite to Python roundtrip work.
Enter converters.
Let’s go back to the  class. We stored the x and y coordinates
separated via semicolons as strings in SQLite.
First, we’ll define a converter function that accepts the string as a parameter
and constructs a  object from it.

Note
Converter functions always get called with a  object, no
matter under which data type you sent the value to SQLite.



Now you need to make the  module know that what you select from
the database is actually a point. There are two ways of doing this:

Implicitly via the declared type
Explicitly via the column name

Both ways are described in section Module functions and constants, in the entries
for the constants  and .
The following example illustrates both approaches.
