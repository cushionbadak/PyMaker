(exception, callable, *args, **kwds)Â¶

(exception, *, msg=None)
Test that an exception is raised when callable is called with any
positional or keyword arguments that are also passed to
.  The test passes if exception is raised, is an
error if another exception is raised, or fails if no exception is raised.
To catch any of a group of exceptions, a tuple containing the exception
classes may be passed as exception.
If only the exception and possibly the msg arguments are given,
return a context manager so that the code under test can be written
inline rather than as a function:


When used as a context manager,  accepts the
additional keyword argument msg.
The context manager will store the caught exception object in its
 attribute.  This can be useful if the intention
is to perform additional checks on the exception raised:



Changed in version 3.1: Added the ability to use  as a context manager.


Changed in version 3.2: Added the  attribute.


Changed in version 3.3: Added the msg keyword argument when used as a context manager.
