(failobj=None, header='content-type', unquote=True)¶
Return the message’s Content-Type parameters, as a list.
The elements of the returned list are 2-tuples of key/value pairs, as
split on the  sign.  The left hand side of the  is the key,
while the right hand side is the value.  If there is no  sign in
the parameter the value is the empty string, otherwise the value is as
described in  and is unquoted if optional unquote is
 (the default).
Optional failobj is the object to return if there is no
Content-Type header.  Optional header is the header to
search instead of Content-Type.
This is a legacy method.  On the
 class its functionality is
replaced by the params property of the individual header objects
returned by the header access methods.
