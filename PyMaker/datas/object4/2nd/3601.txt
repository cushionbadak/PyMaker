class (filename, mode, encoding=None, delay=False)¶
The parameters are as for . The attributes are:


¶
If this attribute is set to a callable, the 
method delegates to this callable. The parameters passed to the callable
are those passed to .

Note
The namer function is called quite a few times during rollover,
so it should be as simple and as fast as possible. It should also
return the same output every time for a given input, otherwise the
rollover behaviour may not work as expected.

(default_name)¶
Modify the filename of a log file when rotating.
This is provided so that a custom filename can be provided.
The default implementation calls the ‘namer’ attribute of the handler,
if it’s callable, passing the default name to it. If the attribute isn’t
callable (the default is ), the name is returned unchanged.




Parameters:default_name – The default name for the log file.

(source, dest)¶
When rotating, rotate the current log.
The default implementation calls the ‘rotator’ attribute of the handler,
if it’s callable, passing the source and dest arguments to it. If the
attribute isn’t callable (the default is ), the source is simply
renamed to the destination.




Parameters:
source – The source filename. This is normally the base
filename, e.g. ‘test.log’.
dest – The destination filename. This is normally
what the source is rotated to, e.g. ‘test.log.1’.
