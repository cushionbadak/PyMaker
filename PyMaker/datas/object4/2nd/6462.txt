docs:


()¶
Called if the XML document hasn’t been declared as being a standalone document.
This happens when there is an external subset or a reference to a parameter
entity, but the XML declaration does not set standalone to  in an XML
declaration.  If this handler returns , then the parser will raise an
 error.  If this handler is not set, no
exception is raised by the parser for this condition.
