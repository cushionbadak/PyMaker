docs:


class ¶
A Finder for  and package  attributes.
This class implements the  ABC.
Only class methods are defined by this class to alleviate the need for
instantiation.


classmethod (fullname, path=None, target=None)¶
Class method that attempts to find a spec
for the module specified by fullname on  or, if
defined, on path. For each path entry that is searched,
 is checked. If a non-false object
is found then it is used as the path entry finder to look
for the module being searched for. If no entry is found in
, then  is
searched for a finder for the path entry and, if found, is stored
in  along with being queried about
the module. If no finder is ever found then  is both
stored in the cache and returned.

New in version 3.4.


Changed in version 3.5: If the current working directory – represented by an empty string –
is no longer valid then  is returned but no value is cached
in .




classmethod (fullname, path=None)¶
A legacy wrapper around .

Deprecated since version 3.4: Use  instead.




classmethod ()¶
Calls  on all
finders stored in  that define the method.
Otherwise entries in  set to  are
deleted.

Changed in version 3.7: Entries of  in  are deleted.



Changed in version 3.4: Calls objects in  with the current working
directory for  (i.e. the empty string).
