()¶
The request is mapped to a local file by interpreting the request as a
path relative to the current working directory.
If the request was mapped to a directory, the directory is checked for a
file named  or  (in that order). If found, the
file’s contents are returned; otherwise a directory listing is generated
by calling the  method. This method uses
 to scan the directory, and returns a  error
response if the  fails.
If the request was mapped to a file, it is opened. Any 
exception in opening the requested file is mapped to a ,
 error. If there was a 
header in the request, and the file was not modified after this time,
a ,  response is sent. Otherwise, the content
type is guessed by calling the  method, which in turn
uses the extensions_map variable, and the file contents are returned.
A  header with the guessed content type is output,
followed by a  header with the file’s size and a
 header with the file’s modification time.
Then follows a blank line signifying the end of the headers, and then the
contents of the file are output. If the file’s MIME type starts with
 the file is opened in text mode; otherwise binary mode is used.
For example usage, see the implementation of the  function
invocation in the  module.

Changed in version 3.7: Support of the  header.
