can be used to group digits for enhanced readability.  One underscore can occur
between digits, and after base specifiers like .
Note that leading zeros in a non-zero decimal number are not allowed. This is
for disambiguation with C-style octal literals, which Python used before version
3.0.
Some examples of integer literals:



Changed in version 3.6: Underscores are now allowed for grouping purposes in literals.
