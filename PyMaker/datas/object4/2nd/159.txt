(value)Â¶
Starts or resumes execution of the coroutine.  If value is ,
this is equivalent to advancing the iterator returned by
.  If value is not , this method delegates
to the  method of the iterator that caused
the coroutine to suspend.  The result (return value,
, or other exception) is the same as when
iterating over the  return value, described above.
