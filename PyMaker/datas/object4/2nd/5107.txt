docs:


(buffer[, nbytes[, flags]])Â¶
Receive up to nbytes bytes from the socket, storing the data into a buffer
rather than creating a new bytestring.  If nbytes is not specified (or 0),
receive up to the size available in the given buffer.  Returns the number of
bytes received.  See the Unix manual page recv(2) for the meaning
of the optional argument flags; it defaults to zero.
