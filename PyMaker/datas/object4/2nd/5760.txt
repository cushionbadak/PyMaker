(msg)¶
Encodes the payload into base64 form and sets the
Content-Transfer-Encoding header to .  This is a good
encoding to use when most of your payload is unprintable data since it is a more
compact form than quoted-printable.  The drawback of base64 encoding is that it
renders the text non-human readable.
