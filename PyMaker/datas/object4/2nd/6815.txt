(method, url, skip_host=False, skip_accept_encoding=False)Â¶
This should be the first call after the connection to the server has been
made. It sends a line to the server consisting of the method string,
the url string, and the HTTP version ().  To disable automatic
sending of  or  headers (for example to accept
additional content encodings), specify skip_host or skip_accept_encoding
with non-False values.
