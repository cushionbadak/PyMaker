(width)¶

(width)¶
Return a copy of the sequence left filled with ASCII  digits to
make a sequence of length width. A leading sign prefix (/
) is handled by inserting the padding after the sign character
rather than before. For  objects, the original sequence is
returned if width is less than or equal to .
For example:



Note
The bytearray version of this method does not operate in place - it
always produces a new object, even if no changes were made.
