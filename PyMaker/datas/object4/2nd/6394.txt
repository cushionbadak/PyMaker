InputSource Objects¶


(id)¶
Sets the public identifier of this .



()¶
Returns the public identifier of this .



(id)¶
Sets the system identifier of this .



()¶
Returns the system identifier of this .



(encoding)¶
Sets the character encoding of this .
The encoding must be a string acceptable for an XML encoding declaration (see
section 4.3.3 of the XML recommendation).
The encoding attribute of the  is ignored if the
 also contains a character stream.



()¶
Get the character encoding of this InputSource.



(bytefile)¶
Set the byte stream (a binary file) for this input source.
The SAX parser will ignore this if there is also a character stream specified,
but it will use a byte stream in preference to opening a URI connection itself.
If the application knows the character encoding of the byte stream, it should
set it with the setEncoding method.



()¶
Get the byte stream for this input source.
The getEncoding method will return the character encoding for this byte stream,
or  if unknown.



(charfile)¶
Set the character stream (a text file) for this input source.
If there is a character stream specified, the SAX parser will ignore any byte
stream and will not attempt to open a URI connection to the system identifier.



()¶
Get the character stream for this input source.
