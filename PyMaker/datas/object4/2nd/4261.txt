¶
A numeric handle of a system object which will become “ready” when
the process ends.
You can use this value if you want to wait on several events at
once using .  Otherwise
calling  is simpler.
On Windows, this is an OS handle usable with the 
and  family of API calls.  On Unix, this is
a file descriptor usable with primitives from the  module.

New in version 3.3.
