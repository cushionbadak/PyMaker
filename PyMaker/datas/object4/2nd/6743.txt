docs:


(url)Â¶
If url contains a fragment identifier, return a modified version of url
with no fragment identifier, and the fragment identifier as a separate
string.  If there is no fragment identifier in url, return url unmodified
and an empty string.
The return value is a named tuple, its items can be accessed by index
or as named attributes:








Attribute
Index
Value
Value if not present




0
URL with no fragment
empty string


1
Fragment identifier
empty string



See section Structured Parse Results for more information on the result
object.

Changed in version 3.2: Result is a structured object rather than a simple 2-tuple.
