(callback, *args, context=None)Â¶
Schedule a callback to be called with args arguments at
the next iteration of the event loop.
Callbacks are called in the order in which they are registered.
Each callback will be called exactly once.
An optional keyword-only context argument allows specifying a
custom  for the callback to run in.
The current context is used when no context is provided.
An instance of  is returned, which can be
used later to cancel the callback.
This method is not thread-safe.
