netrc Objects¶
A  instance has the following methods:


(host)¶
Return a 3-tuple  of authenticators for host.
If the netrc file did not contain an entry for the given host, return the tuple
associated with the ‘default’ entry.  If neither matching host nor default entry
is available, return .



()¶
Dump the class data as a string in the format of a netrc file. (This discards
comments and may reorder the entries.)

Instances of  have public instance variables:


¶
Dictionary mapping host names to  tuples.  The
‘default’ entry, if any, is represented as a pseudo-host by that name.



¶
Dictionary mapping macro names to string lists.


Note
Passwords are limited to a subset of the ASCII character set.  All ASCII
punctuation is allowed in passwords, however, note that whitespace and
non-printable characters are not allowed in passwords.  This is a limitation
of the way the .netrc file is parsed and may be removed in the future.
