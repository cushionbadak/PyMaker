Â¶
If the header value can be recognized as a valid date of one form or
another, this attribute will contain a 
instance representing that date.  If the timezone of the input date is
specified as  (indicating it is in UTC but contains no
information about the source timezone), then  will be a
naive .  If a specific timezone offset is
found (including +0000), then  will contain an aware
 that uses  to record the timezone
offset.
