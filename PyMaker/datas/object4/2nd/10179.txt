(format, counter)¶
Insert a label which should be placed to the left of the current left margin.
This should be used for constructing bulleted or numbered lists.  If the
format value is a string, it is interpreted as a format specification for
counter, which should be an integer. The result of this formatting becomes the
value of the label; if format is not a string it is used as the label value
directly. The label value is passed as the only argument to the writer’s
 method.  Interpretation of non-string label values is
dependent on the associated writer.
Format specifications are strings which, in combination with a counter value,
are used to compute label values.  Each character in the format string is copied
to the label value, with some characters recognized to indicate a transform on
the counter value.  Specifically, the character  represents the counter
value formatter as an Arabic number, the characters  and 
represent alphabetic representations of the counter value in upper and lower
case, respectively, and  and  represent the counter value in Roman
numerals, in upper and lower case.  Note that the alphabetic and roman
transforms require that the counter value be greater than zero.
