class ¶
RFC 5322 specifies a very specific format for dates within email headers.
The  parser recognizes that date format, as well as
recognizing a number of variant forms that are sometimes found “in the
wild”.
This header type provides the following additional attributes:


¶
If the header value can be recognized as a valid date of one form or
another, this attribute will contain a 
instance representing that date.  If the timezone of the input date is
specified as  (indicating it is in UTC but contains no
information about the source timezone), then  will be a
naive .  If a specific timezone offset is
found (including +0000), then  will contain an aware
 that uses  to record the timezone
offset.

The  value of the header is determined by formatting the
 according to the RFC 5322 rules; that is, it is set to:


When creating a , value may be
 instance.  This means, for example, that
the following code is valid and does what one would expect:


Because this is a naive  it will be interpreted as a UTC
timestamp, and the resulting value will have a timezone of .  Much
more useful is to use the  function from the
 module:


This example sets the date header to the current time and date using
the current timezone offset.
