(fd, cmd, len=0, start=0, whence=0)¶
This is essentially a wrapper around the  locking calls.
fd is the file descriptor of the file to lock or unlock, and cmd
is one of the following values:

 – unlock
 – acquire a shared lock
 – acquire an exclusive lock

When cmd is  or , it can also be
bitwise ORed with  to avoid blocking on lock acquisition.
If  is used and the lock cannot be acquired, an
 will be raised and the exception will have an errno
attribute set to  or  (depending on the
operating system; for portability, check for both values).  On at least some
systems,  can only be used if the file descriptor refers to a
file opened for writing.
len is the number of bytes to lock, start is the byte offset at
which the lock starts, relative to whence, and whence is as with
, specifically:

 – relative to the start of the file ()
 – relative to the current buffer position ()
 – relative to the end of the file ()

The default for start is 0, which means to start at the beginning of the file.
The default for len is 0 which means to lock to the end of the file.  The
default for whence is also 0.
