(packed_ip)¶
Convert a 32-bit packed IPv4 address (a bytes-like object four
bytes in length) to its standard dotted-quad string representation (for example,
‘123.45.67.89’).  This is useful when conversing with a program that uses the
standard C library and needs objects of type , which
is the C type for the 32-bit packed binary data this function takes as an
argument.
If the byte sequence passed to this function is not exactly 4 bytes in
length,  will be raised.  does not
support IPv6, and  should be used instead for IPv4/v6 dual
stack support.

Changed in version 3.5: Writable bytes-like object is now accepted.
