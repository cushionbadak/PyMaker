(dt)¶
Return the daylight saving time (DST) adjustment, as a 
object or
 if DST information isn’t known.  Return  if DST is not
in effect. If DST is in effect, return the offset as a  object
(see  for details). Note that DST offset, if applicable, has
already been added to the UTC offset returned by , so there’s
no need to consult  unless you’re interested in obtaining DST info
separately.  For example,  calls its 
attribute’s  method to determine how the  flag
should be set, and  calls  to account for
DST changes when crossing time zones.
An instance tz of a  subclass that models both standard and
daylight times must be consistent in this sense:

must return the same result for every  dt with   For sane  subclasses, this expression yields the time
zone’s “standard offset”, which should not depend on the date or the time, but
only on geographic location.  The implementation of 
relies on this, but cannot detect violations; it’s the programmer’s
responsibility to ensure it.  If a  subclass cannot guarantee
this, it may be able to override the default implementation of
 to work correctly with  regardless.
Most implementations of  will probably look like one of these two:


or


The default implementation of  raises .

Changed in version 3.7: The DST offset is not restricted to a whole number of minutes.
