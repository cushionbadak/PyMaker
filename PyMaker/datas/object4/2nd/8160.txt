Layouts¶
A layout can be just , if it takes no options, or a dict of
options specifying how to arrange the element. The layout mechanism
uses a simplified version of the pack geometry manager: given an
initial cavity, each element is allocated a parcel. Valid
options/values are:



side: whichside
Specifies which side of the cavity to place the element; one of
top, right, bottom or left. If omitted, the element occupies the
entire cavity.



sticky: nswe
Specifies where the element is placed inside its allocated parcel.



unit: 0 or 1
If set to 1, causes the element and all of its descendants to be treated as
a single element for the purposes of  et al. It’s
used for things like scrollbar thumbs with grips.



children: [sublayout… ]
Specifies a list of elements to place inside the element. Each
element is a tuple (or other sequence type) where the first item is
the layout name, and the other is a Layout.
