Special value which should be returned by the binary special methods
(e.g. , , , ,
etc.) to indicate that the operation is not implemented with respect to
the other type; may be returned by the in-place binary special methods
(e.g. , , etc.) for the same purpose.
Its truth value is true.

Note
When a binary (or in-place) method returns  the
interpreter will try the reflected operation on the other type (or some
other fallback, depending on the operator).  If all attempts return
, the interpreter will raise an appropriate exception.
Incorrectly returning  will result in a misleading
error message or the  value being returned to Python code.
See Implementing the arithmetic operations for examples.


Note
 and  are not interchangeable,
even though they have similar names and purposes.
See  for details on when to use it.
