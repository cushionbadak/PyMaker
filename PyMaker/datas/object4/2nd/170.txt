4.1. Structure of a program¶
A Python program is constructed from code blocks.
A block is a piece of Python program text that is executed as a unit.
The following are blocks: a module, a function body, and a class definition.
Each command typed interactively is a block.  A script file (a file given as
standard input to the interpreter or specified as a command line argument to the
interpreter) is a code block.  A script command (a command specified on the
interpreter command line with the  option) is a code block.  The string
argument passed to the built-in functions  and  is a
code block.
A code block is executed in an execution frame.  A frame contains some
administrative information (used for debugging) and determines where and how
execution continues after the code block’s execution has completed.
