class (raw, buffer_size=DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE)¶
A buffer providing higher-level access to a readable, sequential
 object.  It inherits .
When reading data from this object, a larger amount of data may be
requested from the underlying raw stream, and kept in an internal buffer.
The buffered data can then be returned directly on subsequent reads.
The constructor creates a  for the given readable
raw stream and buffer_size.  If buffer_size is omitted,
 is used.
 provides or overrides these methods in addition to
those from  and :


([size])¶
Return bytes from the stream without advancing the position.  At most one
single read on the raw stream is done to satisfy the call. The number of
bytes returned may be less or more than requested.



([size])¶
Read and return size bytes, or if size is not given or negative, until
EOF or if the read call would block in non-blocking mode.



([size])¶
Read and return up to size bytes with only one call on the raw stream.
If at least one byte is buffered, only buffered bytes are returned.
Otherwise, one raw stream read call is made.

Changed in version 3.7: The size argument is now optional.
