(record)¶
The record’s attribute dictionary is used as the operand to a string
formatting operation. Returns the resulting string. Before formatting the
dictionary, a couple of preparatory steps are carried out. The message
attribute of the record is computed using msg % args. If the
formatting string contains ,  is called
to format the event time. If there is exception information, it is
formatted using  and appended to the message. Note
that the formatted exception information is cached in attribute
exc_text. This is useful because the exception information can be
pickled and sent across the wire, but you should be careful if you have
more than one  subclass which customizes the formatting
of exception information. In this case, you will have to clear the cached
value after a formatter has done its formatting, so that the next
formatter to handle the event doesn’t use the cached value but
recalculates it afresh.
If stack information is available, it’s appended after the exception
information, using  to transform it if necessary.
