(message_set, command, flag_list)¶
Alters flag dispositions for messages in mailbox.  command is specified by
section 6.4.6 of RFC 2060 as being one of “FLAGS”, “+FLAGS”, or “-FLAGS”,
optionally with a suffix of “.SILENT”.
For example, to set the delete flag on all messages:



Note
Creating flags containing ‘]’ (for example: “[test]”) violates
RFC 3501 (the IMAP protocol).  However, imaplib has historically
allowed creation of such tags, and popular IMAP servers, such as Gmail,
accept and produce such flags.  There are non-Python programs which also
create such tags.  Although it is an RFC violation and IMAP clients and
servers are supposed to be strict, imaplib nonetheless continues to allow
such tags to be created for backward compatibility reasons, and as of
Python 3.6, handles them if they are sent from the server, since this
improves real-world compatibility.
