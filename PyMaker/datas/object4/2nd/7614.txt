(file, mode=None)¶
If file is a string, open the file by that name, otherwise treat it as a
file-like object.  mode can be:


Read only mode.

Write only mode.

Note that it does not allow read/write WAV files.
A mode of  returns a  object, while a mode of
 returns a  object.  If mode is omitted and a
file-like object is passed as file,  is used as the default
value for mode.
If you pass in a file-like object, the wave object will not close it when its
 method is called; it is the caller’s responsibility to close
the file object.
The  function may be used in a  statement.  When
the  block completes, the  or  method is called.

Changed in version 3.4: Added support for unseekable files.
