PersonalizationÂ¶
Sometimes it is useful to force hash function to produce different digests for
the same input for different purposes. Quoting the authors of the Skein hash
function:

We recommend that all application designers seriously consider doing this;
we have seen many protocols where a hash that is computed in one part of
the protocol can be used in an entirely different part because two hash
computations were done on similar or related data, and the attacker can
force the application to make the hash inputs the same. Personalizing each
hash function used in the protocol summarily stops this type of attack.
(The Skein Hash Function Family,
p. 21)

BLAKE2 can be personalized by passing bytes to the person argument:


Personalization together with the keyed mode can also be used to derive different
keys from a single one.
