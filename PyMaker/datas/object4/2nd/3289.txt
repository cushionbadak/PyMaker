docs:


(hint=-1)¶
Read and return a list of lines from the stream.  hint can be specified
to control the number of lines read: no more lines will be read if the
total size (in bytes/characters) of all lines so far exceeds hint.
Note that it’s already possible to iterate on file objects using  without calling .
