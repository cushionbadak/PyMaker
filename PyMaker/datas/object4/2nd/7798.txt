Access to message catalogs¶


(msg)¶



(domain, msg)¶



(domain, msg, category)¶



(domain)¶



(domain, dir)¶

The locale module exposes the C library’s gettext interface on systems that
provide this interface.  It consists of the functions ,
, , , ,
and .  These are similar to the same functions in
the  module, but use the C library’s binary format for message
catalogs, and the C library’s search algorithms for locating message catalogs.
Python applications should normally find no need to invoke these functions, and
should use  instead.  A known exception to this rule are
applications that link with additional C libraries which internally invoke
 or .  For these applications, it may be
necessary to bind the text domain, so that the libraries can properly locate
their message catalogs.
