(domain, singular, plural, n)¶
Equivalent to the corresponding functions without the  prefix
(, ,  and ),
but the translation is returned as a byte string encoded in the preferred
system encoding if no other encoding was explicitly set with
.

Warning
These functions should be avoided in Python 3, because they return
encoded bytes.  It’s much better to use alternatives which return
Unicode strings instead, since most Python applications will want to
manipulate human readable text as strings instead of bytes.  Further,
it’s possible that you may get unexpected Unicode-related exceptions
if there are encoding problems with the translated strings.  It is
possible that the  functions will be deprecated in future Python
versions due to their inherent problems and limitations.
