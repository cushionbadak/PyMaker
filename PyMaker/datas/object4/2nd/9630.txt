(name, package=None)Â¶
Import a module. The name argument specifies what module to
import in absolute or relative terms
(e.g. either  or ). If the name is
specified in relative terms, then the package argument must be set to
the name of the package which is to act as the anchor for resolving the
package name (e.g.  will import
).
The  function acts as a simplifying wrapper around
. This means all semantics of the function are
derived from . The most important difference
between these two functions is that  returns the
specified package or module (e.g. ), while 
returns the top-level package or module (e.g. ).
If you are dynamically importing a module that was created since the
interpreter began execution (e.g., created a Python source file), you may
need to call  in order for the new module to be
noticed by the import system.

Changed in version 3.3: Parent packages are automatically imported.
