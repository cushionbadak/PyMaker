(preferencelist=('related', 'html', 'plain'))¶
Return the MIME part that is the best candidate to be the “body” of the
message.
preferencelist must be a sequence of strings from the set ,
, and , and indicates the order of preference for the
content type of the part returned.
Start looking for candidate matches with the object on which the
 method is called.
If  is not included in preferencelist, consider the root
part (or subpart of the root part) of any related encountered as a
candidate if the (sub-)part matches a preference.
When encountering a , check the  parameter
and if a part with a matching Content-ID is found, consider
only it when looking for candidate matches.  Otherwise consider only the
first (default root) part of the .
If a part has a Content-Disposition header, only consider
the part a candidate match if the value of the header is .
If none of the candidates matches any of the preferences in
preferencelist, return .
Notes: (1) For most applications the only preferencelist combinations
that really make sense are , , and the
default .  (2) Because matching starts
with the object on which  is called, calling  on
a  will return the object itself unless
preferencelist has a non-default value. (3) Messages (or message parts)
that do not specify a Content-Type or whose
Content-Type header is invalid will be treated as if they
are of type , which may occasionally cause  to
return unexpected results.
