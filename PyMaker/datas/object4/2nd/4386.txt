class ([address[, family[, backlog[, authkey]]]])¶
A wrapper for a bound socket or Windows named pipe which is ‘listening’ for
connections.
address is the address to be used by the bound socket or named pipe of the
listener object.

Note
If an address of ‘0.0.0.0’ is used, the address will not be a connectable
end point on Windows. If you require a connectable end-point,
you should use ‘127.0.0.1’.

family is the type of socket (or named pipe) to use.  This can be one of
the strings  (for a TCP socket),  (for a Unix
domain socket) or  (for a Windows named pipe).  Of these only
the first is guaranteed to be available.  If family is  then the
family is inferred from the format of address.  If address is also
 then a default is chosen.  This default is the family which is
assumed to be the fastest available.  See
Address Formats.  Note that if family is
 and address is  then the socket will be created in a
private temporary directory created using .
If the listener object uses a socket then backlog (1 by default) is passed
to the  method of the socket once it has been
bound.
If authkey is given and not None, it should be a byte string and will be
used as the secret key for an HMAC-based authentication challenge. No
authentication is done if authkey is None.
 is raised if authentication fails.
See Authentication keys.


()¶
Accept a connection on the bound socket or named pipe of the listener
object and return a  object.
If authentication is attempted and fails, then
 is raised.



()¶
Close the bound socket or named pipe of the listener object.  This is
called automatically when the listener is garbage collected.  However it
is advisable to call it explicitly.

Listener objects have the following read-only properties:


¶
The address which is being used by the Listener object.



¶
The address from which the last accepted connection came.  If this is
unavailable then it is .


New in version 3.3: Listener objects now support the context management protocol – see
Context Manager Types.   returns the
listener object, and  calls .
