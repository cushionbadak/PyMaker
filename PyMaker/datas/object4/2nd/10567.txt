Cleanup¶
OptionParser instances have several cyclic references.  This should not be a
problem for Python’s garbage collector, but you may wish to break the cyclic
references explicitly by calling  on your
OptionParser once you are done with it.  This is particularly useful in
long-running applications where large object graphs are reachable from your
OptionParser.
