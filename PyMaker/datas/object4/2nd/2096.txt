docs:


(path)Â¶
Normalize the case of a pathname.  On Windows, convert all characters in the
pathname to lowercase, and also convert forward slashes to backward slashes.
On other operating systems, return the path unchanged.
Raise a  if the type of path is not  or  (directly
or indirectly through the  interface).

Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a path-like object.
