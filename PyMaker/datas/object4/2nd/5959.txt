(url, strict=True)¶
Guess the type of a file based on its filename or URL, given by url.  The
return value is a tuple  where type is  if the
type can’t be guessed (missing or unknown suffix) or a string of the form
, usable for a MIME content-type header.
encoding is  for no encoding or the name of the program used to encode
(e.g. compress or gzip). The encoding is suitable for use
as a Content-Encoding header, not as a
Content-Transfer-Encoding header. The mappings are table driven.
Encoding suffixes are case sensitive; type suffixes are first tried case
sensitively, then case insensitively.
The optional strict argument is a flag specifying whether the list of known MIME types
is limited to only the official types registered with IANA.
When strict is  (the default), only the IANA types are supported; when
strict is , some additional non-standard but commonly used MIME types
are also recognized.
