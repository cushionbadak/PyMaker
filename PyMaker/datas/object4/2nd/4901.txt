(high=None, low=None)¶
Set the high and low watermarks for write flow control.
These two values (measured in number of
bytes) control when the protocol’s

and 
methods are called. If specified, the low watermark must be less
than or equal to the high watermark.  Neither high nor low
can be negative.
 is called when the buffer size
becomes greater than or equal to the high value. If writing has
been paused,  is called when
the buffer size becomes less than or equal to the low value.
The defaults are implementation-specific.  If only the
high watermark is given, the low watermark defaults to an
implementation-specific value less than or equal to the
high watermark.  Setting high to zero forces low to zero as
well, and causes  to be called
whenever the buffer becomes non-empty.  Setting low to zero causes
 to be called only once the
buffer is empty. Use of zero for either limit is generally
sub-optimal as it reduces opportunities for doing I/O and
computation concurrently.
Use 
to get the limits.
