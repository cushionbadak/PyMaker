docs:


(pattern, string, maxsplit=0, flags=0)¶
Split string by the occurrences of pattern.  If capturing parentheses are
used in pattern, then the text of all groups in the pattern are also returned
as part of the resulting list. If maxsplit is nonzero, at most maxsplit
splits occur, and the remainder of the string is returned as the final element
of the list.


If there are capturing groups in the separator and it matches at the start of
the string, the result will start with an empty string.  The same holds for
the end of the string:


That way, separator components are always found at the same relative
indices within the result list.
Empty matches for the pattern split the string only when not adjacent
to a previous empty match.



Changed in version 3.1: Added the optional flags argument.


Changed in version 3.7: Added support of splitting on a pattern that could match an empty string.
