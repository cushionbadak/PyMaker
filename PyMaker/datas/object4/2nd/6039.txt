docs:


(in_file, out_file, name=None, mode=None, *, backtick=False)Â¶
Uuencode file in_file into file out_file.  The uuencoded file will have
the header specifying name and mode as the defaults for the results of
decoding the file. The default defaults are taken from in_file, or 
and  respectively.  If backtick is true, zeros are represented by
 instead of spaces.

Changed in version 3.7: Added the backtick parameter.
