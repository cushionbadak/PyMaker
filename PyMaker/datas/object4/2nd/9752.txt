docs:


Â¶
A decorator for 
to handle selecting the proper
module object to load with. The decorated method is expected to have a call
signature taking two positional arguments
(e.g. ) for which the second argument
will be the module object to be used by the loader.
Note that the decorator will not work on static methods because of the
assumption of two arguments.
The decorated method will take in the name of the module to be loaded
as expected for a loader. If the module is not found in
 then a new one is constructed. Regardless of where the
module came from,  set to self and 
is set based on what  returns
(if available). These attributes are set unconditionally to support
reloading.
If an exception is raised by the decorated method and a module was added to
, then the module will be removed to prevent a partially
initialized module from being in left in . If the module
was already in  then it is left alone.

Changed in version 3.3:  and  are automatically set
(when possible).


Changed in version 3.4: Set ,  
unconditionally to support reloading.


Deprecated since version 3.4: The import machinery now directly performs all the functionality
provided by this function.
