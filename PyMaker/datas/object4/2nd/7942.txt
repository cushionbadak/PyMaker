()¶
Bind bye() method to mouse clicks on the Screen.
If the value “using_IDLE” in the configuration dictionary is 
(default value), also enter mainloop.  Remark: If IDLE with the  switch
(no subprocess) is used, this value should be set to  in
.  In this case IDLE’s own mainloop is active also for the
client script.
