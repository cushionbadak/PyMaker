(self)Â¶
Called to implement , and whenever Python needs to
losslessly convert the numeric object to an integer object (such as in
slicing, or in the built-in ,  and 
functions). Presence of this method indicates that the numeric object is
an integer type.  Must return an integer.

defined  should also be defined, and both should return
the same value.
