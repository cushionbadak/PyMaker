(charset)Â¶
Set the character set of the payload to charset, which can either be a
 instance (see ), a
string naming a character set, or .  If it is a string, it will
be converted to a  instance.  If charset
is , the  parameter will be removed from the
Content-Type header (the message will not be otherwise
modified).  Anything else will generate a .
If there is no existing MIME-Version header one will be
added.  If there is no existing Content-Type header, one
will be added with a value of text/plain.  Whether the
Content-Type header already exists or not, its 
parameter will be set to charset.output_charset.   If
charset.input_charset and charset.output_charset differ, the payload
will be re-encoded to the output_charset.  If there is no existing
Content-Transfer-Encoding header, then the payload will be
transfer-encoded, if needed, using the specified
, and a header with the appropriate value
will be added.  If a Content-Transfer-Encoding header
already exists, the payload is assumed to already be correctly encoded
using that Content-Transfer-Encoding and is not modified.
This is a legacy method.  On the
 class its functionality is
replaced by the charset parameter of the
 method.
