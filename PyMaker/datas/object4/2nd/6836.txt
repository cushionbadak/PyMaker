class (host='', user='', passwd='', acct='', keyfile=None, certfile=None, context=None, timeout=None, source_address=None)¶
A  subclass which adds TLS support to FTP as described in
RFC 4217.
Connect as usual to port 21 implicitly securing the FTP control connection
before authenticating. Securing the data connection requires the user to
explicitly ask for it by calling the  method.  context
is a  object which allows bundling SSL configuration
options, certificates and private keys into a single (potentially
long-lived) structure.  Please read Security considerations for best practices.
keyfile and certfile are a legacy alternative to context – they
can point to PEM-formatted private key and certificate chain files
(respectively) for the SSL connection.

New in version 3.2.


Changed in version 3.3: source_address parameter was added.


Changed in version 3.4: The class now supports hostname check with
 and Server Name Indication (see
).


Deprecated since version 3.6: keyfile and certfile are deprecated in favor of context.
Please use  instead, or let
 select the system’s trusted CA
certificates for you.
