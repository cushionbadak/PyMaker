Return or set the pen’s attributes x/y-stretchfactors and/or outline.  Set
resizemode to “user”.  If and only if resizemode is set to “user”, the turtle
will be displayed stretched according to its stretchfactors: stretch_wid is
stretchfactor perpendicular to its orientation, stretch_len is
stretchfactor in direction of its orientation, outline determines the width
of the shapes’s outline.
