(skip_curdir=True, maxlevels=0, force=False, quiet=0, legacy=False, optimize=-1, invalidation_mode=py_compile.PycInvalidationMode.TIMESTAMP)Â¶
Byte-compile all the  files found along . Return a
true value if all the files compiled successfully, and a false value otherwise.
If skip_curdir is true (the default), the current directory is not included
in the search.  All other parameters are passed to the 
function.  Note that unlike the other compile functions, 
defaults to .

Changed in version 3.2: Added the legacy and optimize parameter.


Changed in version 3.5: quiet parameter was changed to a multilevel value.


Changed in version 3.5: The legacy parameter only writes out  files, not  files
no matter what the value of optimize is.


Changed in version 3.7: The invalidation_mode parameter was added.
