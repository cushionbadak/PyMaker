Request Handler Objects¶


class ¶
This is the superclass of all request handler objects.  It defines
the interface, given below.  A concrete request handler subclass must
define a new  method, and can override any of
the other methods.  A new instance of the subclass is created for each
request.


()¶
Called before the  method to perform any initialization actions
required.  The default implementation does nothing.



()¶
This function must do all the work required to service a request.  The
default implementation does nothing.  Several instance attributes are
available to it; the request is available as ; the client
address as ; and the server instance as
, in case it needs access to per-server information.
The type of  is different for datagram or stream
services.  For stream services,  is a socket object; for
datagram services,  is a pair of string and socket.



()¶
Called after the  method to perform any clean-up actions
required.  The default implementation does nothing.  If 
raises an exception, this function will not be called.




class ¶

class ¶
These  subclasses override the
 and 
methods, and provide  and  attributes.
The  and  attributes can be
read or written, respectively, to get the request data or return data
to the client.
The  attributes of both classes support the
 readable interface, and
 supports the
 writable interface.

Changed in version 3.6:  also supports the
 writable interface.
