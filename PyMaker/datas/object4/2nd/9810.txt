docs:


class ¶
A node visitor base class that walks the abstract syntax tree and calls a
visitor function for every node found.  This function may return a value
which is forwarded by the  method.
This class is meant to be subclassed, with the subclass adding visitor
methods.


(node)¶
Visit a node.  The default implementation calls the method called
 where classname is the name of the node
class, or  if that method doesn’t exist.



(node)¶
This visitor calls  on all children of the node.
Note that child nodes of nodes that have a custom visitor method won’t be
visited unless the visitor calls  or visits them
itself.

Don’t use the  if you want to apply changes to nodes
during traversal.  For this a special visitor exists
() that allows modifications.
