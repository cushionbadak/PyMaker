(a, b, *, rel_tol=1e-09, abs_tol=0.0)¶
Return  if the values a and b are close to each other and
 otherwise.
Whether or not two values are considered close is determined according to
given absolute and relative tolerances.
rel_tol is the relative tolerance – it is the maximum allowed difference
between a and b, relative to the larger absolute value of a or b.
For example, to set a tolerance of 5%, pass .  The default
tolerance is , which assures that the two values are the same
within about 9 decimal digits.  rel_tol must be greater than zero.
abs_tol is the minimum absolute tolerance – useful for comparisons near
zero. abs_tol must be at least zero.
If no errors occur, the result will be:
.
The IEEE 754 special values of , , and  will be
handled according to IEEE rules.  Specifically,  is not considered
close to any other value, including .   and  are only
considered close to themselves.

New in version 3.5.
