classmethod (frame_gen, *, limit=None, lookup_lines=True, capture_locals=False)Â¶
Construct a  object from a frame generator (such as
is returned by  or
).
If limit is supplied, only this many frames are taken from frame_gen.
If lookup_lines is , the returned 
objects will not have read their lines in yet, making the cost of
creating the  cheaper (which may be valuable if it
may not actually get formatted). If capture_locals is  the
local variables in each  are captured as object
representations.
