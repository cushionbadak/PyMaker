()¶
This hook function is called by built-in .  By default,
it drops you into the  debugger, but it can be set to any other
function so that you can choose which debugger gets used.
The signature of this function is dependent on what it calls.  For example,
the default binding (e.g. ) expects no arguments, but
you might bind it to a function that expects additional arguments
(positional and/or keyword).  The built-in  function passes
its  and  straight through.  Whatever
 returns is returned from .
The default implementation first consults the environment variable
.  If that is set to  then this function
returns immediately; i.e. it is a no-op.  If the environment variable is
not set, or is set to the empty string,  is called.
Otherwise this variable should name a function to run, using Python’s
dotted-import nomenclature, e.g. .
In this case,  would be imported and the
resulting module must have a callable named .  This is run,
passing in  and , and whatever  returns,
 returns to the built-in 
function.
Note that if anything goes wrong while importing the callable named by
, a  is reported and the
breakpoint is ignored.
Also note that if  is overridden programmatically,
 is not consulted.

New in version 3.7.
