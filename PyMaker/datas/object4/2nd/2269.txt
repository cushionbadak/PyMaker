(src, dst, *, follow_symlinks=True)¶
Copy the permission bits, last access time, last modification time, and
flags from src to dst.  On Linux,  also copies the
“extended attributes” where possible.  The file contents, owner, and
group are unaffected.  src and dst are path names given as strings.
If follow_symlinks is false, and src and dst both
refer to symbolic links,  will operate on
the symbolic links themselves rather than the files the
symbolic links refer to—reading the information from the
src symbolic link, and writing the information to the
dst symbolic link.

Note
Not all platforms provide the ability to examine and
modify symbolic links.  Python itself can tell you what
functionality is locally available.
