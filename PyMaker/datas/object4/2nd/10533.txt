Similar to the brief usage string,  can also print a version
string for your program.  You have to supply the string as the 
argument to OptionParser:


 is expanded just like it is in .  Apart from that,
 can contain anything you like.  When you supply it, 
automatically adds a  option to your parser. If it encounters
this option on the command line, it expands your  string (by
replacing ), prints it to stdout, and exits.
For example, if your script is called :


The following two methods can be used to print and get the  string:


(file=None)¶
Print the version message for the current program () to
file (default stdout).  As with , any occurrence
of  in  is replaced with the name of the current
program.  Does nothing if  is empty or undefined.



()¶
Same as  but returns the version string instead of
printing it.
