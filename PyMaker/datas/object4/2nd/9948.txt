(module, path=None)Â¶
Return a dictionary-based tree containing a function or class
descriptors for each function and class defined in the module with a
 or  statement.  The returned dictionary maps
module-level function and class names to their descriptors.  Nested
objects are entered into the children dictionary of their parent.  As
with readmodule, module names the module to be read and path is
prepended to sys.path.  If the module being read is a package, the
returned dictionary has a key  whose value is a list
containing the package search path.
