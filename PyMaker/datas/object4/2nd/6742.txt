(base, url, allow_fragments=True)¶
Construct a full (“absolute”) URL by combining a “base URL” (base) with
another URL (url).  Informally, this uses components of the base URL, in
particular the addressing scheme, the network location and (part of) the
path, to provide missing components in the relative URL.  For example:


The allow_fragments argument has the same meaning and default as for
.

Note
If url is an absolute URL (that is, starting with  or ),
the url’s host name and/or scheme will be present in the result.  For example:



If you do not want that behavior, preprocess the url with  and
, removing possible scheme and netloc parts.

Changed in version 3.5: Behaviour updated to match the semantics defined in RFC 3986.
