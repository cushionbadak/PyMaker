(environ)¶
Shift a single name from  to  and return the name.
The environ dictionary is modified in-place; use a copy if you need to keep
the original  or  intact.
If there are no remaining path segments in ,  is returned.
Typically, this routine is used to process each portion of a request URI path,
for example to treat the path as a series of dictionary keys. This routine
modifies the passed-in environment to make it suitable for invoking another WSGI
application that is located at the target URI. For example, if there is a WSGI
application at , and the request URI path is , and the
WSGI application at  calls , it will receive the
string “bar”, and the environment will be updated to be suitable for passing to
a WSGI application at .  That is,  will change from
 to , and  will change from  to
.
When  is just a “/”, this routine returns an empty string and
appends a trailing slash to , even though empty path segments are
normally ignored, and  doesn’t normally end in a slash.  This is
intentional behavior, to ensure that an application can tell the difference
between URIs ending in  from ones ending in  when using this
routine to do object traversal.
