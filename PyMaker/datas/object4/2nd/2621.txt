(name, arcname=None, recursive=True, *, filter=None)Â¶
Add the file name to the archive. name may be any type of file
(directory, fifo, symbolic link, etc.). If given, arcname specifies an
alternative name for the file in the archive. Directories are added
recursively by default. This can be avoided by setting recursive to
. Recursion adds entries in sorted order.
If filter is given, it
should be a function that takes a  object argument and
returns the changed  object. If it instead returns
 the  object will be excluded from the
archive. See Examples for an example.

Changed in version 3.2: Added the filter parameter.


Changed in version 3.7: Recursion adds entries in sorted order.
