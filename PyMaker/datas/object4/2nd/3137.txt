docs:


(path, attribute, value, flags=0, *, follow_symlinks=True)Â¶
Set the extended filesystem attribute attribute on path to value.
attribute must be a bytes or str with no embedded NULs (directly or
indirectly through the  interface). If it is a str,
it is encoded with the filesystem encoding.  flags may be
 or . If  is
given and the attribute does not exist,  will be raised.
If  is given and the attribute already exists, the
attribute will not be created and  will be raised.
This function can support specifying a file descriptor and
not following symlinks.

Note
A bug in Linux kernel versions less than 2.6.39 caused the flags argument
to be ignored on some filesystems.


Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a path-like object for path and attribute.
