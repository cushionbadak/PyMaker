(control)Â¶
Returns the volume of a given mixer control.  The returned volume is a 2-tuple
.  Volumes are specified as numbers from 0
(silent) to 100 (full volume).  If the control is monophonic, a 2-tuple is still
returned, but both volumes are the same.
Raises  if an invalid control is specified, or
 if an unsupported control is specified.
