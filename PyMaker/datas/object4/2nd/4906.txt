docs:


(data, addr=None)Â¶
Send the data bytes to the remote peer given by addr (a
transport-dependent target address).  If addr is ,
the data is sent to the target address given on transport
creation.
This method does not block; it buffers the data and arranges
for it to be sent out asynchronously.
