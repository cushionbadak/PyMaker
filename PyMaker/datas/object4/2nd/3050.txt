(path, mode, *, dir_fd=None, effective_ids=False, follow_symlinks=True)¶
Use the real uid/gid to test for access to path.  Note that most operations
will use the effective uid/gid, therefore this routine can be used in a
suid/sgid environment to test if the invoking user has the specified access to
path.  mode should be  to test the existence of path, or it
can be the inclusive OR of one or more of , , and
 to test permissions.  Return  if access is allowed,
 if not. See the Unix man page access(2) for more
information.
This function can support specifying paths relative to directory
descriptors and not following symlinks.
If effective_ids is ,  will perform its access
checks using the effective uid/gid instead of the real uid/gid.
effective_ids may not be supported on your platform; you can check whether
or not it is available using .  If it is
unavailable, using it will raise a .

Note
Using  to check if a user is authorized to e.g. open a file
before actually doing so using  creates a security hole,
because the user might exploit the short time interval between checking
and opening the file to manipulate it. It’s preferable to use EAFP
techniques. For example:


is better written as:




Note
I/O operations may fail even when  indicates that they would
succeed, particularly for operations on network filesystems which may have
permissions semantics beyond the usual POSIX permission-bit model.


Changed in version 3.3: Added the dir_fd, effective_ids, and follow_symlinks parameters.


Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a path-like object.
