6.2.6. Set displaysÂ¶
A set display is denoted by curly braces and distinguishable from dictionary
displays by the lack of colons separating keys and values:

A set display yields a new mutable set object, the contents being specified by
either a sequence of expressions or a comprehension.  When a comma-separated
list of expressions is supplied, its elements are evaluated from left to right
and added to the set object.  When a comprehension is supplied, the set is
constructed from the elements resulting from the comprehension.
An empty set cannot be constructed with ; this literal constructs an empty
dictionary.
