(package, resource)Â¶
Return the path to the resource as an actual file system path.  This
function returns a context manager for use in a  statement.
The context manager provides a  object.
Exiting the context manager cleans up any temporary file created when the
resource needs to be extracted from e.g. a zip file.
package is either a name or a module object which conforms to the
 requirements.  resource is the name of the resource to open
within package; it may not contain path separators and it may not have
sub-resources (i.e. it cannot be a directory).
