(address, strict=True)Â¶
Return an  or  object depending on
the IP address passed as argument.  address is a string or integer
representing the IP network.  Either IPv4 or IPv6 networks may be supplied;
integers less than 2**32 will be considered to be IPv4 by default.  strict
is passed to  or  constructor.  A
 is raised if address does not represent a valid IPv4 or
IPv6 address, or if the network has host bits set.
