docs:


(first, second, msg=None)Â¶
Test that first and second are equal.  If the values do not
compare equal, the test will fail.
In addition, if first and second are the exact same type and one of
list, tuple, dict, set, frozenset or str or any type that a subclass
registers with  the type-specific equality
function will be called in order to generate a more useful default
error message (see also the list of type-specific methods).

Changed in version 3.1: Added the automatic calling of type-specific equality function.


Changed in version 3.2:  added as the default type equality
function for comparing strings.
