Setting Return Values and Attributes¶
Setting the return values on a mock object is trivially easy:


Of course you can do the same for methods on the mock:


The return value can also be set in the constructor:


If you need an attribute setting on your mock, just do it:


Sometimes you want to mock up a more complex situation, like for example
. If we wanted this call to
return a list, then we have to configure the result of the nested call.
We can use  to construct the set of calls in a “chained call” like
this for easy assertion afterwards:


It is the call to  that turns our call object into a list of
calls representing the chained calls.
