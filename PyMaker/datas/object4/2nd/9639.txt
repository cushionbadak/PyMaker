(fullname, path)Â¶
A legacy method for finding a loader for the specified
module.  If this is a top-level import, path will be .
Otherwise, this is a search for a subpackage or module and path
will be the value of  from the parent
package. If a loader cannot be found,  is returned.
If  is defined, backwards-compatible functionality is
provided.

Changed in version 3.4: Returns  when called instead of raising
. Can use  to provide
functionality.


Deprecated since version 3.4: Use  instead.
