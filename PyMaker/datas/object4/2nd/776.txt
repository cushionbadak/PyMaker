docs:


exception (msg, pattern=None, pos=None)¶
Exception raised when a string passed to one of the functions here is not a
valid regular expression (for example, it might contain unmatched parentheses)
or when some other error occurs during compilation or matching.  It is never an
error if a string contains no match for a pattern.  The error instance has
the following additional attributes:


¶
The unformatted error message.



¶
The regular expression pattern.



¶
The index in pattern where compilation failed (may be ).



¶
The line corresponding to pos (may be ).



¶
The column corresponding to pos (may be ).


Changed in version 3.5: Added additional attributes.
