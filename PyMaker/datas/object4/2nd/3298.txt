(size=-1)Â¶
Read up to size bytes from the object and return them.  As a convenience,
if size is unspecified or -1, all bytes until EOF are returned.
Otherwise, only one system call is ever made.  Fewer than size bytes may
be returned if the operating system call returns fewer than size bytes.
If 0 bytes are returned, and size was not 0, this indicates end of file.
If the object is in non-blocking mode and no bytes are available,
 is returned.
The default implementation defers to  and
.
