(self, name)Â¶
Called when the default attribute access fails with an 
(either  raises an  because
name is not an instance attribute or an attribute in the class tree
for ; or  of a name property raises
).  This method should either return the (computed)
attribute value or raise an  exception.
Note that if the attribute is found through the normal mechanism,
 is not called.  (This is an intentional asymmetry between
 and .) This is done both for efficiency
reasons and because otherwise  would have no way to access
other attributes of the instance.  Note that at least for instance variables,
you can fake total control by not inserting any values in the instance attribute
dictionary (but instead inserting them in another object).  See the
 method below for a way to actually get total control
over attribute access.
