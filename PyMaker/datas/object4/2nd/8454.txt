(expr, msg=None)¶

(expr, msg=None)¶
Test that expr is true (or false).
Note that this is equivalent to  and not to  (use  for the latter).  This method
should also be avoided when more specific methods are available (e.g.
 instead of ), because they
provide a better error message in case of failure.
