Introduction¶
A CGI script is invoked by an HTTP server, usually to process user input
submitted through an HTML  or  element.
Most often, CGI scripts live in the server’s special  directory.
The HTTP server places all sorts of information about the request (such as the
client’s hostname, the requested URL, the query string, and lots of other
goodies) in the script’s shell environment, executes the script, and sends the
script’s output back to the client.
The script’s input is connected to the client too, and sometimes the form data
is read this way; at other times the form data is passed via the “query string”
part of the URL.  This module is intended to take care of the different cases
and provide a simpler interface to the Python script.  It also provides a number
of utilities that help in debugging scripts, and the latest addition is support
for file uploads from a form (if your browser supports it).
The output of a CGI script should consist of two sections, separated by a blank
line.  The first section contains a number of headers, telling the client what
kind of data is following.  Python code to generate a minimal header section
looks like this:


The second section is usually HTML, which allows the client software to display
nicely formatted text with header, in-line images, etc. Here’s Python code that
prints a simple piece of HTML:
