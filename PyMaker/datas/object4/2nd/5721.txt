also be added.
Optional boundary is the multipart boundary string.  When  (the
default), the boundary is calculated when needed (for example, when the
message is serialized).
_subparts is a sequence of initial subparts for the payload.  It must be
possible to convert this sequence to a list.  You can always attach new subparts
to the message by using the  method.
Optional policy argument defaults to .
Additional parameters for the Content-Type header are taken from
the keyword arguments, or passed into the _params argument, which is a keyword
dictionary.

Changed in version 3.6: Added policy keyword-only parameter.
