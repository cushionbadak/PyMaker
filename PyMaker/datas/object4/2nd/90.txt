(self, key)Â¶
Called to implement evaluation of . For sequence types, the
accepted keys should be integers and slice objects.  Note that the special
interpretation of negative indexes (if the class wishes to emulate a sequence
type) is up to the  method. If key is of an inappropriate
type,  may be raised; if of a value outside the set of indexes
for the sequence (after any special interpretation of negative values),
 should be raised. For mapping types, if key is missing (not
in the container),  should be raised.

Note
 loops expect that an  will be raised for illegal
indexes to allow proper detection of the end of the sequence.
