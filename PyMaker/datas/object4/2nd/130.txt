These methods are called to implement the augmented arithmetic assignments
(, , , , , , , , ,
, , , ).  These methods should attempt to do the
operation in-place (modifying self) and return the result (which could be,
but does not have to be, self).  If a specific method is not defined, the
augmented assignment falls back to the normal methods.  For instance, if x
is an instance of a class with an  method,  is
equivalent to  . Otherwise,  and
 are considered, as with the evaluation of . In
certain situations, augmented assignment can result in unexpected errors (see
Why does a_tuple[i] += [‘item’] raise an exception when the addition works?), but this behavior is in fact
part of the data model.
