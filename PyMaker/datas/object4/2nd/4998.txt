Concurrency and Multithreading¶
An event loop runs in a thread (typically the main thread) and executes
all callbacks and Tasks in its thread.  While a Task is running in the
event loop, no other Tasks can run in the same thread.  When a Task
executes an  expression, the running Task gets suspended, and
the event loop executes the next Task.
To schedule a callback from a different OS thread, the
 method should be used. Example:


Almost all asyncio objects are not thread safe, which is typically
not a problem unless there is code that works with them from outside
of a Task or a callback.  If there’s a need for such code to call a
low-level asyncio API, the  method
should be used, e.g.:


To schedule a coroutine object from a different OS thread, the
 function should be used. It returns a
 to access the result:


To handle signals and to execute subprocesses, the event loop must be
run in the main thread.
The  method can be used with a
 to execute
blocking code in a different OS thread without blocking the OS thread
that the event loop runs in.
