docs:


(name, value)Â¶
The email package calls this method with the name and value provided by
the application program when the application program is modifying a
 programmatically (as opposed to a  created by a
parser).  The method should return the  tuple that is to
be stored in the  to represent the header.
If an implementation wishes to retain compatibility with the existing
email package policies, the name and value should be strings or
string subclasses that do not change the content of the passed in
arguments.
There is no default implementation
