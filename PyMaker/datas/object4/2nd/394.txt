()Â¶
Return an iterator object.  The object is required to support the iterator
protocol described below.  If a container supports different types of
iteration, additional methods can be provided to specifically request
iterators for those iteration types.  (An example of an object supporting
multiple forms of iteration would be a tree structure which supports both
breadth-first and depth-first traversal.)  This method corresponds to the
 slot of the type structure for Python objects in the Python/C
API.
