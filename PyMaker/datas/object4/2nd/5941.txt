()¶
When a  instance’s original headers are modified, the
visible headers are not automatically modified to correspond. This method
updates the visible headers as follows: each visible header with a
corresponding original header is set to the value of the original header,
each visible header without a corresponding original header is removed,
and any of Date, From, Reply-To,
To, CC, and Subject that are
present in the original headers but not the visible headers are added to
the visible headers.
