Â¶
Possible value for , or the 
parameter to .  In client mode, 
has the same meaning as . It is recommended to
use  for client-side sockets instead.
In server mode, a client certificate request is sent to the client.  The
client may either ignore the request or send a certificate in order
perform TLS client cert authentication.  If the client chooses to send
a certificate, it is verified.  Any verification error immediately aborts
the TLS handshake.
Use of this setting requires a valid set of CA certificates to
be passed, either to  or as a
value of the  parameter to .
