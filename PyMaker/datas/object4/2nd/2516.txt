(size=-1)Â¶
Return buffered data without advancing the file position. At least one
byte of data will be returned, unless EOF has been reached. The exact
number of bytes returned is unspecified (the size argument is ignored).

Note
While calling  does not change the file position of
the , it may change the position of the underlying
file object (e.g. if the  was constructed by passing a
file object for filename).
