(nframe: int=1)Â¶
Start tracing Python memory allocations: install hooks on Python memory
allocators. Collected tracebacks of traces will be limited to nframe
frames. By default, a trace of a memory block only stores the most recent
frame: the limit is . nframe must be greater or equal to .
Storing more than  frame is only useful to compute statistics grouped
by  or to compute cumulative statistics: see the
 and  methods.
Storing more frames increases the memory and CPU overhead of the
 module. Use the  function
to measure how much memory is used by the  module.
The  environment variable
() and the  
command line option can be used to start tracing at startup.

functions.
