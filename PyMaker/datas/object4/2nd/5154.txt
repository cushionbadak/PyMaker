docs:


(cert_time)¶
Return the time in seconds since the Epoch, given the 
string representing the “notBefore” or “notAfter” date from a
certificate in  strptime format (C
locale).
Here’s an example:


“notBefore” or “notAfter” dates must use GMT (RFC 5280).

Changed in version 3.5: Interpret the input time as a time in UTC as specified by ‘GMT’
timezone in the input string. Local timezone was used
previously. Return an integer (no fractions of a second in the
input format)
