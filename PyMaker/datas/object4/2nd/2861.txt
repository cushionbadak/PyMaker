Keyed hashing¶
Keyed hashing can be used for authentication as a faster and simpler
replacement for Hash-based message authentication code (HMAC).
BLAKE2 can be securely used in prefix-MAC mode thanks to the
indifferentiability property inherited from BLAKE.
This example shows how to get a (hex-encoded) 128-bit authentication code for
message  with key :


As a practical example, a web application can symmetrically sign cookies sent
to users and later verify them to make sure they weren’t tampered with:


Even though there’s a native keyed hashing mode, BLAKE2 can, of course, be used
in HMAC construction with  module:
