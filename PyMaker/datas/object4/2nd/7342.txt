Convenience Functions¶


(params, methodname=None, methodresponse=None, encoding=None, allow_none=False)¶
Convert params into an XML-RPC request. or into a response if methodresponse
is true. params can be either a tuple of arguments or an instance of the
 exception class.  If methodresponse is true, only a single value
can be returned, meaning that params must be of length 1. encoding, if
supplied, is the encoding to use in the generated XML; the default is UTF-8.
Python’s  value cannot be used in standard XML-RPC; to allow using
it via an extension,  provide a true value for allow_none.



(data, use_datetime=False, use_builtin_types=False)¶
Convert an XML-RPC request or response into Python objects, a .  params is a tuple of argument; methodname is a string, or
 if no method name is present in the packet. If the XML-RPC packet
represents a fault condition, this function will raise a  exception.
The use_builtin_types flag can be used to cause date/time values to be
presented as  objects and binary data to be
presented as  objects; this flag is false by default.
The obsolete use_datetime flag is similar to use_builtin_types but it
applies only to date/time values.

Changed in version 3.3: The use_builtin_types flag was added.
