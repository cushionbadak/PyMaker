docs:


(offset[, whence])¶
Change the stream position to the given offset.  Behaviour depends on
the whence parameter.  The default value for whence is
.

 or : seek from the start of the stream
(the default); offset must either be a number returned by
, or zero.  Any other offset value
produces undefined behaviour.
 or : “seek” to the current position;
offset must be zero, which is a no-operation (all other values
are unsupported).
 or : seek to the end of the stream;
offset must be zero (all other values are unsupported).

Return the new absolute position as an opaque number.

New in version 3.1: The  constants.
