Cipher selection¶
If you have advanced security requirements, fine-tuning of the ciphers
enabled when negotiating a SSL session is possible through the
 method.  Starting from Python 3.2.3, the
ssl module disables certain weak ciphers by default, but you may want
to further restrict the cipher choice. Be sure to read OpenSSL’s documentation
about the cipher list format.
If you want to check which ciphers are enabled by a given cipher list, use
 or the  command on your
system.
