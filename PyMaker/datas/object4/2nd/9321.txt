Class variablesÂ¶
One of two places where  actually inspects the type
of a field is to determine if a field is a class variable as defined
in PEP 526.  It does this by checking if the type of the field is
.  If a field is a , it is excluded
from consideration as a field and is ignored by the dataclass
mechanisms.  Such  pseudo-fields are not returned by the
module-level  function.
