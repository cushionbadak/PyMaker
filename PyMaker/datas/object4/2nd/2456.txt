Using shortcut methods¶
Using the nonstandard ,  and
 methods of the  object, your code can
be written more concisely because you don’t have to create the (often
superfluous)  objects explicitly. Instead, the 
objects are created implicitly and these shortcut methods return the cursor
objects. This way, you can execute a  statement and iterate over it
directly using only a single call on the  object.
