(sockaddr, flags)Â¶
Translate a socket address sockaddr into a 2-tuple . Depending
on the settings of flags, the result can contain a fully-qualified domain name
or numeric address representation in host.  Similarly, port can contain a
string port name or a numeric port number.
For IPv6 addresses,  is appended to the host part if sockaddr
contains meaningful scopeid. Usually this happens for multicast addresses.
