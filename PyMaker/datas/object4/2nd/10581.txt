Callback example 5: fixed arguments¶
Things get slightly more interesting when you define callback options that take
a fixed number of arguments.  Specifying that a callback option takes arguments
is similar to defining a  or  option: if you define
, then the option takes one argument that must be
convertible to that type; if you further define , then the
option takes  arguments.
Here’s an example that just emulates the standard  action:


Note that  takes care of consuming 3 arguments and converting
them to integers for you; all you have to do is store them.  (Or whatever;
obviously you don’t need a callback for this example.)
