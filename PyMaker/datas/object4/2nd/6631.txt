class (password_mgr=None)Â¶
This is a mixin class that helps with HTTP authentication, both to the remote
host and to a proxy. password_mgr, if given, should be something that is
compatible with ; refer to section
HTTPPasswordMgr Objects for information on the interface that must be
supported.  If passwd_mgr also provides  and
 methods (see
HTTPPasswordMgrWithPriorAuth Objects), then the handler will use the
 result for a given URI to determine whether or not to
send authentication credentials with the request.  If 
returns  for the URI, credentials are sent.  If 
is , credentials are not sent, and then if a  response is
received the request is re-sent with the authentication credentials.  If
authentication succeeds,  is called to set
  for the URI, so that subsequent requests to
the URI or any of its super-URIs will automatically include the
authentication credentials.

New in version 3.5: Added  support.
