class ¶
This is a class for comparing sequences of lines of text, and producing
human-readable differences or deltas.  Differ uses 
both to compare sequences of lines, and to compare sequences of characters
within similar (near-matching) lines.
Each line of a  delta begins with a two-letter code:






Code
Meaning




line unique to sequence 1


line unique to sequence 2


line common to both sequences


line not present in either input sequence



Lines beginning with ‘’ attempt to guide the eye to intraline differences,
and were not present in either input sequence. These lines can be confusing if
the sequences contain tab characters.
