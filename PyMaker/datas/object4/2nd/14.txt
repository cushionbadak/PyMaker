2.1.6. Implicit line joiningÂ¶
Expressions in parentheses, square brackets or curly braces can be split over
more than one physical line without using backslashes. For example:


Implicitly continued lines can carry comments.  The indentation of the
continuation lines is not important.  Blank continuation lines are allowed.
There is no NEWLINE token between implicit continuation lines.  Implicitly
continued lines can also occur within triple-quoted strings (see below); in that
case they cannot carry comments.
