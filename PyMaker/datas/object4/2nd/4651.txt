StreamReader¶


class ¶
Represents a reader object that provides APIs to read data
from the IO stream.
It is not recommended to instantiate StreamReader objects
directly; use  and 
instead.


coroutine (n=-1)¶
Read up to n bytes.  If n is not provided, or set to ,
read until EOF and return all read bytes.
If EOF was received and the internal buffer is empty,
return an empty  object.



coroutine ()¶
Read one line, where “line” is a sequence of bytes
ending with .
If EOF is received and  was not found, the method
returns partially read data.
If EOF is received and the internal buffer is empty,
return an empty  object.



coroutine (n)¶
Read exactly n bytes.
Raise an  if EOF is reached before n
can be read.  Use the 
attribute to get the partially read data.



coroutine (separator=b'\n')¶
Read data from the stream until separator is found.
On success, the data and separator will be removed from the
internal buffer (consumed). Returned data will include the
separator at the end.
If the amount of data read exceeds the configured stream limit, a
 exception is raised, and the data
is left in the internal buffer and can be read again.
If EOF is reached before the complete separator is found,
an  exception is raised, and the internal
buffer is reset.  The  attribute
may contain a portion of the separator.

New in version 3.5.2.




()¶
Return  if the buffer is empty and 
was called.
