Other Examples¶
The  function can be useful for numeric table lookups. This
example uses  to look up a letter grade for an exam score (say)
based on a set of ordered numeric breakpoints: 90 and up is an ‘A’, 80 to 89 is
a ‘B’, and so on:


Unlike the  function, it does not make sense for the 
functions to have key or reversed arguments because that would lead to an
inefficient design (successive calls to bisect functions would not “remember”
all of the previous key lookups).
Instead, it is better to search a list of precomputed keys to find the index
of the record in question:
