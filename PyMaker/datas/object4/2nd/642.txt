docs:


exception ¶
Raised when the  statement has troubles trying to
load a module.  Also raised when the “from list” in 
has a name that cannot be found.
The  and  attributes can be set using keyword-only
arguments to the constructor. When set they represent the name of the module
that was attempted to be imported and the path to any file which triggered
the exception, respectively.

Changed in version 3.3: Added the  and  attributes.
