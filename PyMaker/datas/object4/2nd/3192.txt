()Â¶
Returns the current global process times.
The return value is an object with five attributes:

 - user time
 - system time
 - user time of all child processes
 - system time of all child processes
 - elapsed real time since a fixed point in the past

For backwards compatibility, this object also behaves like a five-tuple
containing , , ,
, and  in that order.
See the Unix manual page
times(2) or the corresponding Windows Platform API documentation.
On Windows, only  and  are known; the other
attributes are zero.
Availability: Unix, Windows.

Changed in version 3.3: Return type changed from a tuple to a tuple-like object
with named attributes.
