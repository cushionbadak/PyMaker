Deferred translations¶
In most coding situations, strings are translated where they are coded.
Occasionally however, you need to mark strings for translation, but defer actual
translation until later.  A classic example is:


Here, you want to mark the strings in the  list as being
translatable, but you don’t actually want to translate them until they are
printed.
Here is one way you can handle this situation:


This works because the dummy definition of  simply returns the string
unchanged.  And this dummy definition will temporarily override any definition
of  in the built-in namespace (until the  command). Take
care, though if you have a previous definition of  in the local
namespace.
Note that the second use of  will not identify “a” as being
translatable to the gettext program, because the parameter
is not a string literal.
Another way to handle this is with the following example:


In this case, you are marking translatable strings with the function
, which won’t conflict with any definition of .
However, you will need to teach your message extraction program to
look for translatable strings marked with . xgettext,
pygettext, , and xpot all
support this through the use of the  command-line switch.
The choice of  here is totally arbitrary; it could have just
as easily been .
