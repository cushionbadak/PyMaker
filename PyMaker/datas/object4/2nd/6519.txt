docs:


(name, constructor, instance=None, *, preferred=False)Â¶
Register the browser type name.  Once a browser type is registered, the
 function can return a controller for that browser type.  If
instance is not provided, or is , constructor will be called without
parameters to create an instance when needed.  If instance is provided,
constructor will never be called, and may be .
Setting preferred to  makes this browser a preferred result for
a  call with no argument.  Otherwise, this entry point is only
useful if you plan to either set the  variable or call
 with a nonempty argument matching the name of a handler you
declare.

Changed in version 3.7: preferred keyword-only parameter was added.
