(sep=None, maxsplit=-1)¶

(sep=None, maxsplit=-1)¶
Split the binary sequence into subsequences of the same type, using sep
as the delimiter string. If maxsplit is given and non-negative, at most
maxsplit splits are done (thus, the list will have at most 
elements).  If maxsplit is not specified or is , then there is no
limit on the number of splits (all possible splits are made).
If sep is given, consecutive delimiters are not grouped together and are
deemed to delimit empty subsequences (for example, 
returns ).  The sep argument may consist of a
multibyte sequence (for example,  returns
). Splitting an empty sequence with a specified
separator returns  or  depending on the type
of object being split.  The sep argument may be any
bytes-like object.
For example:


If sep is not specified or is , a different splitting algorithm
is applied: runs of consecutive ASCII whitespace are regarded as a single
separator, and the result will contain no empty strings at the start or
end if the sequence has leading or trailing whitespace.  Consequently,
splitting an empty sequence or a sequence consisting solely of ASCII
whitespace without a specified separator returns .
For example:
