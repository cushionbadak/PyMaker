docs:


(s, casefold=False, map01=None)Â¶
Decode the Base32 encoded bytes-like object or ASCII string s and
return the decoded .
Optional casefold is a flag specifying
whether a lowercase alphabet is acceptable as input.  For security purposes,
the default is .
RFC 3548 allows for optional mapping of the digit 0 (zero) to the letter O
(oh), and for optional mapping of the digit 1 (one) to either the letter I (eye)
or letter L (el).  The optional argument map01 when not , specifies
which letter the digit 1 should be mapped to (when map01 is not , the
digit 0 is always mapped to the letter O).  For security purposes the default is
, so that 0 and 1 are not allowed in the input.
A  is raised if s is
incorrectly padded or if there are non-alphabet characters present in the
input.
