(name, shape=None)¶

(name, shape=None)¶
There are three different ways to call this function:

name is the name of a gif-file and shape is : Install the
corresponding image shape.



Note
Image shapes do not rotate when turning the turtle, so they do not
display the heading of the turtle!


name is an arbitrary string and shape is a tuple of pairs of
coordinates: Install the corresponding polygon shape.



name is an arbitrary string and shape is a (compound) 
object: Install the corresponding compound shape.


Add a turtle shape to TurtleScreen’s shapelist.  Only thusly registered
shapes can be used by issuing the command .
