docs:


(arg)Â¶
Parameter arg should be a key-to-message mapping or an iterable of
(key, message) pairs. Updates the mailbox so that, for each given
key and message, the message corresponding to key is set to
message as if by using . As with ,
each key must already correspond to a message in the mailbox or else a
 exception will be raised, so in general it is incorrect
for arg to be a  instance.

Note
Unlike with dictionaries, keyword arguments are not supported.
