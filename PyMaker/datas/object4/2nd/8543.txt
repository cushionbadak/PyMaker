docs:


(test, subtest, outcome)Â¶
Called when a subtest finishes.  test is the test case
corresponding to the test method.  subtest is a custom
 instance describing the subtest.
If outcome is , the subtest succeeded.  Otherwise,
it failed with an exception where outcome is a tuple of the form
returned by : .
The default implementation does nothing when the outcome is a
success, and records subtest failures as normal failures.

New in version 3.4.
