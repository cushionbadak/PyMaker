docs:


(typecode_or_type, size_or_initializer)¶
Return a ctypes array allocated from shared memory.
typecode_or_type determines the type of the elements of the returned array:
it is either a ctypes type or a one character typecode of the kind used by
the  module.  If size_or_initializer is an integer then it
determines the length of the array, and the array will be initially zeroed.
Otherwise size_or_initializer is a sequence which is used to initialize the
array and whose length determines the length of the array.
Note that setting and getting an element is potentially non-atomic – use
 instead to make sure that access is automatically synchronized
using a lock.
