(cafile=None, capath=None, cadata=None)¶
Load a set of “certification authority” (CA) certificates used to validate
other peers’ certificates when  is other than
.  At least one of cafile or capath must be specified.
This method can also load certification revocation lists (CRLs) in PEM or
DER format. In order to make use of CRLs, 
must be configured properly.
The cafile string, if present, is the path to a file of concatenated
CA certificates in PEM format. See the discussion of
Certificates for more information about how to arrange the
certificates in this file.
The capath string, if present, is
the path to a directory containing several CA certificates in PEM format,
following an OpenSSL specific layout.
The cadata object, if present, is either an ASCII string of one or more
PEM-encoded certificates or a bytes-like object of DER-encoded
certificates. Like with capath extra lines around PEM-encoded
certificates are ignored but at least one certificate must be present.

Changed in version 3.4: New optional argument cadata
