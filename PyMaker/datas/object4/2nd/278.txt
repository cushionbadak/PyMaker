8.2. The  statement¶
The  statement is used for repeated execution as long as an
expression is true:

This repeatedly tests the expression and, if it is true, executes the first
suite; if the expression is false (which may be the first time it is tested) the
suite of the  clause, if present, is executed and the loop
terminates.
A  statement executed in the first suite terminates the loop
without executing the  clause’s suite.  A 
statement executed in the first suite skips the rest of the suite and goes back
to testing the expression.
