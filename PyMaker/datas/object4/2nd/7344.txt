(data, use_datetime=False, use_builtin_types=False)Â¶
Convert an XML-RPC request or response into Python objects, a .  params is a tuple of argument; methodname is a string, or
 if no method name is present in the packet. If the XML-RPC packet
represents a fault condition, this function will raise a  exception.
The use_builtin_types flag can be used to cause date/time values to be
presented as  objects and binary data to be
presented as  objects; this flag is false by default.
The obsolete use_datetime flag is similar to use_builtin_types but it
applies only to date/time values.

Changed in version 3.3: The use_builtin_types flag was added.
