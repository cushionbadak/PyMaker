(number[, ndigits])¶
Return number rounded to ndigits precision after the decimal
point.  If ndigits is omitted or is , it returns the
nearest integer to its input.
For the built-in types supporting , values are rounded to the
closest multiple of 10 to the power minus ndigits; if two multiples are
equally close, rounding is done toward the even choice (so, for example,
both  and  are , and  is
).  Any integer value is valid for ndigits (positive, zero, or
negative).  The return value is an integer if ndigits is omitted or
.
Otherwise the return value has the same type as number.
For a general Python object ,  delegates to
.

Note
The behavior of  for floats can be surprising: for example,
 gives  instead of the expected .
This is not a bug: it’s a result of the fact that most decimal fractions
can’t be represented exactly as a float.  See Floating Point Arithmetic:  Issues and Limitations for
more information.
