Default values¶
All of the above examples involve setting some variable (the “destination”) when
certain command-line options are seen.  What happens if those options are never
seen?  Since we didn’t supply any defaults, they are all set to .  This
is usually fine, but sometimes you want more control.   lets you
supply a default value for each destination, which is assigned before the
command line is parsed.
First, consider the verbose/quiet example.  If we want  to set
 to  unless  is seen, then we can do this:


Since default values apply to the destination rather than to any particular
option, and these two options happen to have the same destination, this is
exactly equivalent:


Consider this:


Again, the default value for  will be : the last default
value supplied for any particular destination is the one that counts.
A clearer way to specify default values is the  method of
OptionParser, which you can call at any time before calling :


As before, the last value specified for a given option destination is the one
that counts.  For clarity, try to use one method or the other of setting default
values, not both.
