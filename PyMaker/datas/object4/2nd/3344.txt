(*[, encoding][, errors][, newline][,                      line_buffering][, write_through])Â¶
Reconfigure this text stream using new settings for encoding,
errors, newline, line_buffering and write_through.
Parameters not specified keep current settings, except
 is used when encoding is specified but
errors is not specified.
It is not possible to change the encoding or newline if some data
has already been read from the stream. On the other hand, changing
encoding after write is possible.
This method does an implicit stream flush before setting the
new parameters.

New in version 3.7.
