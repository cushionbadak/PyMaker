(fd, cmd, arg=0)Â¶
Perform the operation cmd on file descriptor fd (file objects providing
a  method are accepted as well).  The values used
for cmd are operating system dependent, and are available as constants
in the  module, using the same names as used in the relevant C
header files. The argument arg can either be an integer value, or a
 object. With an integer value, the return value of this
function is the integer return value of the C  call.  When
the argument is bytes it represents a binary structure, e.g. created by
. The binary data is copied to a buffer whose address is
passed to the C  call.  The return value after a successful
call is the contents of the buffer, converted to a  object.
The length of the returned object will be the same as the length of the
arg argument. This is limited to 1024 bytes. If the information returned
in the buffer by the operating system is larger than 1024 bytes, this is
most likely to result in a segmentation violation or a more subtle data
corruption.
If the  fails, an  is raised.
