docs:


(buffer[, offset])Â¶
Read into buffer a complete message of byte data sent from the other end
of the connection and return the number of bytes in the message.  Blocks
until there is something to receive.  Raises
 if there is nothing left to receive and the other end was
closed.
buffer must be a writable bytes-like object.  If
offset is given then the message will be written into the buffer from
that position.  Offset must be a non-negative integer less than the
length of buffer (in bytes).
If the buffer is too short then a  exception is
raised and the complete message is available as  where 
is the exception instance.
