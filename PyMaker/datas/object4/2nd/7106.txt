()¶
Get the hardware address as a 48-bit positive integer.  The first time this
runs, it may launch a separate program, which could be quite slow.  If all
attempts to obtain the hardware address fail, we choose a random 48-bit
number with the multicast bit (least significant bit of the first octet)
set to 1 as recommended in RFC 4122.  “Hardware address” means the MAC
address of a network interface.  On a machine with multiple network
interfaces, universally administered MAC addresses (i.e. where the second
least significant bit of the first octet is unset) will be preferred over
locally administered MAC addresses, but with no other ordering guarantees.

Changed in version 3.7: Universally administered MAC addresses are preferred over locally
administered MAC addresses, since the former are guaranteed to be
globally unique, while the latter are not.
