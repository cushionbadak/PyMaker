(restype, *argtypes, use_errno=False, use_last_error=False)Â¶
The returned function prototype creates functions that use the standard C
calling convention.  The function will release the GIL during the call.  If
use_errno is set to true, the ctypes private copy of the system
 variable is exchanged with the real  value before
and after the call; use_last_error does the same for the Windows error
code.
