(key, sub_key, type, value)Â¶
Associates a value with a specified key.
key is an already open key, or one of the predefined
HKEY_* constants.
sub_key is a string that names the subkey with which the value is associated.
type is an integer that specifies the type of the data. Currently this must be
, meaning only strings are supported.  Use the 
function for support for other data types.
value is a string that specifies the new value.
If the key specified by the sub_key parameter does not exist, the SetValue
function creates it.
Value lengths are limited by available memory. Long values (more than 2048
bytes) should be stored as files with the filenames stored in the configuration
registry.  This helps the registry perform efficiently.
The key identified by the key parameter must have been opened with
 access.
