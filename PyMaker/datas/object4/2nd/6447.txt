docs:


(elname, attname, type, default, required)¶
Called for each declared attribute for an element type.  If an attribute list
declaration declares three attributes, this handler is called three times, once
for each attribute.  elname is the name of the element to which the
declaration applies and attname is the name of the attribute declared.  The
attribute type is a string passed as type; the possible values are
, , , … default gives the default value for
the attribute used when the attribute is not specified by the document instance,
or  if there is no default value ( values).  If the
attribute is required to be given in the document instance, required will be
true. This requires Expat version 1.95.0 or newer.
