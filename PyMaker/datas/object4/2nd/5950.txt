Exceptions¶
The following exception classes are defined in the  module:


exception ¶
The based class for all other module-specific exceptions.



exception ¶
Raised when a mailbox is expected but is not found, such as when instantiating a
 subclass with a path that does not exist (and with the create
parameter set to ), or when opening a folder that does not exist.



exception ¶
Raised when a mailbox is not empty but is expected to be, such as when deleting
a folder that contains messages.



exception ¶
Raised when some mailbox-related condition beyond the control of the program
causes it to be unable to proceed, such as when failing to acquire a lock that
another program already holds a lock, or when a uniquely-generated file name
already exists.



exception ¶
Raised when the data in a file cannot be parsed, such as when an 
instance attempts to read a corrupted  file.
