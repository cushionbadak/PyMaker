()¶
This method returns a bitmask specifying the available mixer controls (“Control”
being a specific mixable “channel”, such as  or
).  This bitmask indicates a subset of all available
mixer controls—the  constants defined at module level.
To determine if, for example, the current mixer object supports a PCM mixer, use
the following Python code:


For most purposes, the  (master volume) and
 controls should suffice—but code that uses the mixer
should be flexible when it comes to choosing mixer controls.  On the Gravis
Ultrasound, for example,  does not exist.
