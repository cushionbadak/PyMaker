docs:


(path)Â¶
Split the pathname path into a pair  where drive is either
a mount point or the empty string.  On systems which do not use drive
specifications, drive will always be the empty string.  In all cases,  will be the same as path.
On Windows, splits a pathname into drive/UNC sharepoint and relative path.
If the path contains a drive letter, drive will contain everything
up to and including the colon.
e.g.  returns 
If the path contains a UNC path, drive will contain the host name
and share, up to but not including the fourth separator.
e.g.  returns 

Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a path-like object.
