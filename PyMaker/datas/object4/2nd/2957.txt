docs:


(fd, fd2, inheritable=True)Â¶
Duplicate file descriptor fd to fd2, closing the latter first if
necessary. Return fd2. The new file descriptor is inheritable by default or non-inheritable if inheritable
is .

Changed in version 3.4: Add the optional inheritable parameter.


Changed in version 3.7: Return fd2 on success. Previously,  was always returned.
