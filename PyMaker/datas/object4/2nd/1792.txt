Mitigating round-off error with increased precisionÂ¶
The use of decimal floating point eliminates decimal representation error
(making it possible to represent  exactly); however, some operations
can still incur round-off error when non-zero digits exceed the fixed precision.
The effects of round-off error can be amplified by the addition or subtraction
of nearly offsetting quantities resulting in loss of significance.  Knuth
provides two instructive examples where rounded floating point arithmetic with
insufficient precision causes the breakdown of the associative and distributive
properties of addition:


The  module makes it possible to restore the identities by
expanding the precision sufficiently to avoid loss of significance:
