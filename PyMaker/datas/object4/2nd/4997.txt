Debug Mode¶
By default asyncio runs in production mode.  In order to ease
the development asyncio has a debug mode.
There are several ways to enable asyncio debug mode:

Setting the  environment variable to .
Using the   Python command line option.
Passing  to .
Calling .

In addition to enabling the debug mode, consider also:

setting the log level of the asyncio logger to
, for example the following snippet of code
can be run at startup of the application:



configuring the  module to display
 warnings.  One way of doing that is by
using the   command line option.


When the debug mode is enabled:

asyncio checks for coroutines that were not awaited and logs them; this mitigates
the “forgotten await” pitfall.
Many non-threadsafe asyncio APIs (such as  and
 methods) raise an exception if they are called
from a wrong thread.
The execution time of the I/O selector is logged if it takes too long to
perform an I/O operation.
Callbacks taking longer than 100ms are logged.  The
 attribute can be used to set the
minimum execution duration in seconds that is considered “slow”.
