Socket creationÂ¶
Since Python 3.2 and 2.7.9, it is recommended to use the
 of an  instance to wrap
sockets as  objects. The helper functions
 returns a new context with secure default
settings. The old  function is deprecated since it is
both inefficient and has no support for server name indication (SNI) and
hostname matching.
