(peer, mailfrom, rcpttos, data, **kwargs)¶
Raise a  exception. Override this in subclasses to
do something useful with this message. Whatever was passed in the
constructor as remoteaddr will be available as the 
attribute. peer is the remote host’s address, mailfrom is the envelope
originator, rcpttos are the envelope recipients and data is a string
containing the contents of the e-mail (which should be in RFC 5321
format).
If the decode_data constructor keyword is set to , the data
argument will be a unicode string.  If it is set to , it
will be a bytes object.
kwargs is a dictionary containing additional information. It is empty
if  was given as an init argument, otherwise
it contains the following keys:


mail_options:
a list of all received parameters to the 
command (the elements are uppercase strings; example:
).
rcpt_options:
same as mail_options but for the  command.
Currently no  options are supported, so for now
this will always be an empty list.


Implementations of  should use the 
signature to accept arbitrary keyword arguments, since future feature
enhancements may add keys to the kwargs dictionary.
Return  to request a normal  response; otherwise
return the desired response string in RFC 5321 format.
