coroutine (input=None)¶
Interact with process:

send data to stdin (if input is not );
read data from stdout and stderr, until EOF is reached;
wait for process to terminate.

The optional input argument is the data ( object)
that will be sent to the child process.
Return a tuple .
If either  or 
exception is raised when writing input into stdin, the
exception is ignored.  This condition occurs when the process
exits before all data are written into stdin.
If it is desired to send data to the process’ stdin,
the process needs to be created with .  Similarly,
to get anything other than  in the result tuple, the
process has to be created with  and/or
 arguments.
Note, that the data read is buffered in memory, so do not use
this method if the data size is large or unlimited.
