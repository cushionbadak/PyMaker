docs:


()Â¶
In protocols 2 and newer, classes that implements the
 method can dictate the values passed to the
 method upon unpickling.  The method must return a pair
 where args is a tuple of positional arguments
and kwargs a dictionary of named arguments for constructing the
object.  Those will be passed to the  method upon
unpickling.
You should implement this method if the  method of your
class requires keyword-only arguments.  Otherwise, it is recommended for
compatibility to implement .

Changed in version 3.6:  is now used in protocols 2 and 3.
