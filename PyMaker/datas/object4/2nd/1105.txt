classmethod (timestamp, tz=None)¶
Return the local date and time corresponding to the POSIX timestamp, such as is
returned by . If optional argument tz is  or not
specified, the timestamp is converted to the platform’s local date and time, and
the returned  object is naive.
If tz is not , it must be an instance of a  subclass, and the
timestamp is converted to tz’s time zone.  In this case the result is
equivalent to
.
 may raise , if the timestamp is out of
the range of values supported by the platform C  or
 functions, and  on  or
 failure.
It’s common for this to be restricted to years in
1970 through 2038. Note that on non-POSIX systems that include leap seconds in
their notion of a timestamp, leap seconds are ignored by ,
and then it’s possible to have two timestamps differing by a second that yield
identical  objects. See also .

Changed in version 3.3: Raise  instead of  if the timestamp
is out of the range of values supported by the platform C
 or  functions. Raise 
instead of  on  or 
failure.


Changed in version 3.6:  may return instances with  set to 1.
