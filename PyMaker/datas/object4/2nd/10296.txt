()Â¶
Read a keypress and return the resulting character as a byte string.
Nothing is echoed to the console.  This call will block if a keypress
is not already available, but will not wait for Enter to be
pressed. If the pressed key was a special function key, this will
return  or ; the next call will return the keycode.
The Control-C keypress cannot be read with this function.
