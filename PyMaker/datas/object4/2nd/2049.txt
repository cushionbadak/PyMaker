docs:


()¶
Return  if the path is a mount point: a point in a
file system where a different file system has been mounted.  On POSIX, the
function checks whether path’s parent, , is on a different
device than path, or whether  and path point to the same
i-node on the same device — this should detect mount points for all Unix
and POSIX variants.  Not implemented on Windows.

New in version 3.7.
