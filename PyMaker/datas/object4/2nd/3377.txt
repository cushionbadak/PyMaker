(string[, format])Â¶
Parse a string representing a time according to a format.  The return value
is a  as returned by  or
.
The format parameter uses the same directives as those used by
; it defaults to  which matches the
formatting returned by . If string cannot be parsed according
to format, or if it has excess data after parsing,  is
raised. The default values used to fill in any missing data when more
accurate values cannot be inferred are .
Both string and format must be strings.
For example:


Support for the  directive is based on the values contained in 
and whether  is true.  Because of this, it is platform-specific
except for recognizing UTC and GMT which are always known (and are considered to
be non-daylight savings timezones).
Only the directives specified in the documentation are supported.  Because
 is implemented per platform it can sometimes offer more
directives than those listed.  But  is independent of any platform
and thus does not necessarily support all directives available that are not
documented as supported.
