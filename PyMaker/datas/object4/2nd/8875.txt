class (self, file, line, temporary=0, cond=None, funcname=None)¶
This class implements temporary breakpoints, ignore counts, disabling and
(re-)enabling, and conditionals.
Breakpoints are indexed by number through a list called 
and by  pairs through .  The former points to a
single instance of class .  The latter points to a list of
such instances since there may be more than one breakpoint per line.
When creating a breakpoint, its associated filename should be in canonical
form.  If a funcname is defined, a breakpoint hit will be counted when the
first line of that function is executed.  A conditional breakpoint always
counts a hit.
 instances have the following methods:


()¶
Delete the breakpoint from the list associated to a file/line.  If it is
the last breakpoint in that position, it also deletes the entry for the
file/line.



()¶
Mark the breakpoint as enabled.



()¶
Mark the breakpoint as disabled.



()¶
Return a string with all the information about the breakpoint, nicely
formatted:

The breakpoint number.
If it is temporary or not.
Its file,line position.
The condition that causes a break.
If it must be ignored the next N times.
The breakpoint hit count.


New in version 3.2.




(out=None)¶
Print the output of  to the file out, or if it is
, to standard output.
