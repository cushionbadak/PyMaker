The  typeÂ¶
A special kind of type is . A static type checker will treat
every type as being compatible with  and  as being
compatible with every type.
This means that it is possible to perform any operation or method call on a
value of type on  and assign it to any variable:


Notice that no typechecking is performed when assigning a value of type
 to a more precise type. For example, the static type checker did
not report an error when assigning  to  even though  was
declared to be of type  and receives an  value at
runtime!
Furthermore, all functions without a return type or parameter types will
implicitly default to using :


This behavior allows  to be used as an escape hatch when you
need to mix dynamically and statically typed code.
Contrast the behavior of  with the behavior of .
Similar to , every type is a subtype of . However,
unlike , the reverse is not true:  is not a
subtype of every other type.
That means when the type of a value is , a type checker will
reject almost all operations on it, and assigning it to a variable (or using
it as a return value) of a more specialized type is a type error. For example:


Use  to indicate that a value could be any type in a typesafe
manner. Use  to indicate that a value is dynamically typed.
