The index Parameter¶
A number of widgets require “index” parameters to be passed.  These are used to
point at a specific place in a Text widget, or to particular characters in an
Entry widget, or to particular menu items in a Menu widget.

Entry widget indexes (index, view index, etc.)
Entry widgets have options that refer to character positions in the text being
displayed.  You can use these  functions to access these special
points in text widgets:
Text widget indexes
The index notation for Text widgets is very rich and is best described in the Tk
man pages.
Menu indexes (menu.invoke(), menu.entryconfig(), etc.)
Some options and methods for menus manipulate specific menu entries. Anytime a
menu index is needed for an option or a parameter, you may pass in:

an integer which refers to the numeric position of the entry in the widget,
counted from the top, starting with 0;
the string , which refers to the menu position that is currently
under the cursor;
the string  which refers to the last menu item;
An integer preceded by , as in , where the integer is interpreted
as a y pixel coordinate in the menu’s coordinate system;
the string , which indicates no menu entry at all, most often used
with menu.activate() to deactivate all entries, and finally,
a text string that is pattern matched against the label of the menu entry, as
scanned from the top of the menu to the bottom.  Note that this index type is
considered after all the others, which means that matches for menu items
labelled , , or  may be interpreted as the above
literals, instead.
