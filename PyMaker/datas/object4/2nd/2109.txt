Create an instance of the  class.  The instance will be used
as global state for the functions of this module, and is also returned to use
during iteration.  The parameters to this function will be passed along to the
constructor of the  class.

 statement.  In this example, input is closed after the
 statement is exited, even if an exception occurs:



Changed in version 3.2: Can be used as a context manager.


Deprecated since version 3.6, will be removed in version 3.8: The bufsize parameter.
