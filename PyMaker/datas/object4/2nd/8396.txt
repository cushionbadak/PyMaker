(test, compileflags=None, out=None, clear_globs=True)¶
Run the examples in test (a  object), and display the
results using the writer function out.
The examples are run in the namespace .  If clear_globs is
true (the default), then this namespace will be cleared after the test runs,
to help with garbage collection. If you would like to examine the namespace
after the test completes, then use clear_globs=False.
compileflags gives the set of flags that should be used by the Python
compiler when running the examples.  If not specified, then it will default to
the set of future-import flags that apply to globs.
The output of each example is checked using the ’s
output checker, and the results are formatted by the
 methods.
