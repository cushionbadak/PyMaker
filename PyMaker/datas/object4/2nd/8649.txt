Applying the same patch to every test method¶
If you want several patches in place for multiple test methods the obvious way
is to apply the patch decorators to every method. This can feel like unnecessary
repetition. For Python 2.6 or more recent you can use  (in all its
various forms) as a class decorator. This applies the patches to all test
methods on the class. A test method is identified by methods whose names start
with :

These allow you to move the patching into your  and  methods.


If you use this technique you must ensure that the patching is “undone” by
calling . This can be fiddlier than you might think, because if an
exception is raised in the setUp then tearDown is not called.
