(path, name)¶
Extend the search path for the modules which comprise a package.  Intended
use is to place the following code in a package’s :


This will add to the package’s  all subdirectories of directories
on  named after the package.  This is useful if one wants to
distribute different parts of a single logical package as multiple
directories.
It also looks for  files beginning where  matches the
name argument.  This feature is similar to  files (see the
 module for more information), except that it doesn’t special-case
lines starting with .  A  file is trusted at face
value: apart from checking for duplicates, all entries found in a
 file are added to the path, regardless of whether they exist
on the filesystem.  (This is a feature.)
If the input path is not a list (as is the case for frozen packages) it is
returned unchanged.  The input path is not modified; an extended copy is
returned.  Items are only appended to the copy at the end.
It is assumed that  is a sequence.  Items of 
that are not strings referring to existing directories are ignored. Unicode
items on  that cause errors when used as filenames may cause
this function to raise an exception (in line with 
behavior).
