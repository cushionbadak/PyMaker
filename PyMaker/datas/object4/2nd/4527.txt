docs:


class (timefunc=time.monotonic, delayfunc=time.sleep)¶
The  class defines a generic interface to scheduling events.
It needs two functions to actually deal with the “outside world” — timefunc
should be callable without arguments, and return  a number (the “time”, in any
units whatsoever). If time.monotonic is not available, the timefunc default
is time.time instead. The delayfunc function should be callable with one
argument, compatible with the output of timefunc, and should delay that many
time units. delayfunc will also be called with the argument  after each
event is run to allow other threads an opportunity to run in multi-threaded
applications.

Changed in version 3.3: timefunc and delayfunc parameters are optional.


Changed in version 3.3:  class can be safely used in multi-threaded
environments.
