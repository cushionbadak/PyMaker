docs:


(node, annotate_fields=True, include_attributes=False)Â¶
Return a formatted dump of the tree in node.  This is mainly useful for
debugging purposes.  The returned string will show the names and the values
for fields.  This makes the code impossible to evaluate, so if evaluation is
wanted annotate_fields must be set to .  Attributes such as line
numbers and column offsets are not dumped by default.  If this is wanted,
include_attributes can be set to .
