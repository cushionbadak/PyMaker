Re-using old test codeÂ¶
Some users will find that they have existing test code that they would like to
run from , without converting every old test function to a
 subclass.
For this reason,  provides a  class.
This subclass of  can be used to wrap an existing test
function.  Set-up and tear-down functions can also be provided.
Given the following test function:


one can create an equivalent test case instance as follows, with optional
set-up and tear-down methods:



Note
Even though  can be used to quickly convert an
existing test base over to a -based system, this approach is
not recommended.  Taking the time to set up proper 
subclasses will make future test refactorings infinitely easier.

In some cases, the existing tests may have been written using the 
module.  If so,  provides a  class that can
automatically build  instances from the existing
-based tests.
