¶
The list of command line arguments passed to a Python script.  is the
script name (it is operating system dependent whether this is a full pathname or
not).  If the command was executed using the  command line option to
the interpreter,  is set to the string .  If no script name
was passed to the Python interpreter,  is the empty string.
To loop over the standard input, or the list of files given on the
command line, see the  module.

On Unix, command line arguments are passed by bytes from OS.  Python decodes
them with filesystem encoding and “surrogateescape” error handler.
When you need original bytes, you can get it by
