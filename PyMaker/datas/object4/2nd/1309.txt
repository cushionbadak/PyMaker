docs:


class Â¶
ABC for awaitable objects, which can be used in 
expressions.  Custom implementations must provide the 
method.
Coroutine objects and instances of the
 ABC are all instances of this ABC.

Note
In CPython, generator-based coroutines (generators decorated with
 or ) are
awaitables, even though they do not have an  method.
Using  for them will return .
Use  to detect them.


New in version 3.5.
