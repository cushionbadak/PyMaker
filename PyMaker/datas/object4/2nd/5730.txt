(s, charset=None, errors='strict')Â¶
Append the string s to the MIME header.
Optional charset, if given, should be a 
instance (see ) or the name of a character set, which
will be converted to a  instance.  A value
of  (the default) means that the charset given in the constructor
is used.
s may be an instance of  or .  If it is an
instance of , then charset is the encoding of that byte
string, and a  will be raised if the string cannot be
decoded with that character set.
If s is an instance of , then charset is a hint specifying
the character set of the characters in the string.
In either case, when producing an RFC 2822-compliant header using
RFC 2047 rules, the string will be encoded using the output codec of
the charset.  If the string cannot be encoded using the output codec, a
UnicodeError will be raised.
Optional errors is passed as the errors argument to the decode call
if s is a byte string.
