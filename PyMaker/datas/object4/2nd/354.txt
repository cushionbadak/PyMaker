(iterable, *, key=None, reverse=False)¶
Return a new sorted list from the items in iterable.
Has two optional arguments which must be specified as keyword arguments.
key specifies a function of one argument that is used to extract a comparison
key from each element in iterable (for example, ).  The
default value is  (compare the elements directly).
reverse is a boolean value.  If set to , then the list elements are
sorted as if each comparison were reversed.
Use  to convert an old-style cmp function to a
key function.
The built-in  function is guaranteed to be stable. A sort is
stable if it guarantees not to change the relative order of elements that
compare equal — this is helpful for sorting in multiple passes (for
example, sort by department, then by salary grade).
For sorting examples and a brief sorting tutorial, see Sorting HOW TO.
