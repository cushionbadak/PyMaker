Command Line Interface¶
The  module also provides a basic introspection capability
from the command line.
By default, accepts the name of a module and prints the source of that
module. A class or function within the module can be printed instead by
appended a colon and the qualified name of the target object.


¶
Print information about the specified object rather than the source code
