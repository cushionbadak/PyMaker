(purpose=Purpose.SERVER_AUTH, cafile=None, capath=None, cadata=None)¶
Return a new  object with default settings for
the given purpose.  The settings are chosen by the  module,
and usually represent a higher security level than when calling the
 constructor directly.
cafile, capath, cadata represent optional CA certificates to
trust for certificate verification, as in
.  If all three are
, this function can choose to trust the system’s default
CA certificates instead.
The settings are: , , and
 with high encryption cipher suites without RC4 and
without unauthenticated cipher suites. Passing 
as purpose sets  to 
and either loads CA certificates (when at least one of cafile, capath or
cadata is given) or uses  to load
default CA certificates.

Note
The protocol, options, cipher and other settings may change to more
restrictive values anytime without prior deprecation.  The values
represent a fair balance between compatibility and security.
If your application needs specific settings, you should create a
 and apply the settings yourself.


Note
If you find that when certain older clients or servers attempt to connect
with a  created by this function that they get an error
stating “Protocol or cipher suite mismatch”, it may be that they only
support SSL3.0 which this function excludes using the
. SSL3.0 is widely considered to be completely broken. If you still wish to continue to
use this function but still allow SSL 3.0 connections you can re-enable
them using:




New in version 3.4.


Changed in version 3.4.4: RC4 was dropped from the default cipher string.


Changed in version 3.6: ChaCha20/Poly1305 was added to the default cipher string.
3DES was dropped from the default cipher string.
