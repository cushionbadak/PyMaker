(control, (left, right))¶
Sets the volume for a given mixer control to .  and
 must be ints and between 0 (silent) and 100 (full volume).  On
success, the new volume is returned as a 2-tuple. Note that this may not be
exactly the same as the volume specified, because of the limited resolution of
some soundcard’s mixers.
Raises  if an invalid mixer control was specified, or if the
specified volumes were out-of-range.
