()¶
Override to implement platform-specific file transmission.  This method is
called only if the application’s return value is an instance of the class
specified by the  attribute.  It should return a true
value if it was able to successfully transmit the file, so that the default
transmission code will not be executed. The default implementation of this
method just returns a false value.
