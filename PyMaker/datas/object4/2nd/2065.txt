docs:


(strict=False)¶
Make the path absolute, resolving any symlinks.  A new path object is
returned:


“” components are also eliminated (this is the only method to do so):


If the path doesn’t exist and strict is , 
is raised.  If strict is , the path is resolved as far as possible
and any remainder is appended without checking whether it exists.  If an
infinite loop is encountered along the resolution path, 
is raised.

New in version 3.6: The strict argument (pre-3.6 behavior is strict).
