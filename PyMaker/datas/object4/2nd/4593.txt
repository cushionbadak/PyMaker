docs:


(callable, *args, **kwargs)Â¶
Execute  code in the context object
the run method is called on.  Return the result of the execution
or propagate an exception if one occurred.
Any changes to any context variables that callable makes will
be contained in the context object:


The method raises a  when called on the same
context object from more than one OS thread, or when called
recursively.
