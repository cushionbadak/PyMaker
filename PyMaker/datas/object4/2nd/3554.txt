(lvl)¶
Returns the textual representation of logging level lvl. If the level is one
of the predefined levels , , ,
 or  then you get the corresponding string. If you
have associated levels with names using  then the name you
have associated with lvl is returned. If a numeric value corresponding to one
of the defined levels is passed in, the corresponding string representation is
returned. Otherwise, the string ‘Level %s’ % lvl is returned.

Note
Levels are internally integers (as they need to be compared in the
logging logic). This function is used to convert between an integer level
and the level name displayed in the formatted log output by means of the
 format specifier (see LogRecord attributes).


Changed in version 3.4: In Python versions earlier than 3.4, this function could also be passed a
text level, and would return the corresponding numeric value of the level.
This undocumented behaviour was considered a mistake, and was removed in
Python 3.4, but reinstated in 3.4.2 due to retain backward compatibility.
