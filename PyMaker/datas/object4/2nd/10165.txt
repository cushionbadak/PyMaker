(pickle)¶
Provides an iterator over all of the opcodes in a pickle, returning a
sequence of  triples.  opcode is an instance of an
 class; arg is the decoded value, as a Python object, of
the opcode’s argument; pos is the position at which this opcode is located.
pickle can be a string or a file-like object.
