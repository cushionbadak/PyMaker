docs:


(other, context=None)Â¶
Compare two operands using their abstract representation rather than their
numerical value.  Similar to the  method, but the result
gives a total ordering on  instances.  Two
 instances with the same numeric value but different
representations compare unequal in this ordering:


Quiet and signaling NaNs are also included in the total ordering.  The
result of this function is  if both operands have the same
representation,  if the first operand is lower in the
total order than the second, and  if the first operand is
higher in the total order than the second operand.  See the specification
for details of the total order.
This operation is unaffected by context and is quiet: no flags are changed
and no rounding is performed.  As an exception, the C version may raise
InvalidOperation if the second operand cannot be converted exactly.
