docs:


(b)¶
Write the given bytes-like object, b, and return the number
of bytes written (always equal to the length of b in bytes, since if
the write fails an  will be raised).  Depending on the
actual implementation, these bytes may be readily written to the
underlying stream, or held in a buffer for performance and latency
reasons.
When in non-blocking mode, a  is raised if the
data needed to be written to the raw stream but it couldn’t accept
all the data without blocking.
The caller may release or mutate b after this method returns,
so the implementation should only access b during the method call.
