Python Specific Encodings¶
A number of predefined codecs are specific to Python, so their codec names have
no meaning outside Python.  These are listed in the tables below based on the
expected input and output types (note that while text encodings are the most
common use case for codecs, the underlying codec infrastructure supports
arbitrary data transforms rather than just text encodings).  For asymmetric
codecs, the stated purpose describes the encoding direction.

Text Encodings¶
The following codecs provide  to  encoding and
bytes-like object to  decoding, similar to the Unicode text
encodings.







Codec
Aliases
Purpose



idna
 
Implements RFC 3490,
see also
.
Only 
is supported.

mbcs
ansi,
dbcs
Windows only: Encode
operand according to the
ANSI codepage (CP_ACP)

oem
 
Windows only: Encode
operand according to the
OEM codepage (CP_OEMCP)

New in version 3.6.



palmos
 
Encoding of PalmOS 3.5

punycode
 
Implements RFC 3492.
Stateful codecs are not
supported.

raw_unicode_escape
 
Latin-1 encoding with
 and
 for other
code points. Existing
backslashes are not
escaped in any way.
It is used in the Python
pickle protocol.

undefined
 
Raise an exception for
all conversions, even
empty strings. The error
handler is ignored.

unicode_escape
 
Encoding suitable as the
contents of a Unicode
literal in ASCII-encoded
Python source code,
except that quotes are
not escaped. Decodes from
Latin-1 source code.
Beware that Python source
code actually uses UTF-8
by default.

unicode_internal
 
Return the internal
representation of the
operand. Stateful codecs
are not supported.

Deprecated since version 3.3: This representation is
obsoleted by
PEP 393.







Binary Transforms¶
The following codecs provide binary transforms: bytes-like object
to  mappings.  They are not supported by 
(which only produces  output).








Codec
Aliases
Purpose
Encoder / decoder



base64_codec [1]
base64, base_64
Convert operand to multiline
MIME base64 (the result
always includes a trailing
)

Changed in version 3.4: accepts any
bytes-like object
as input for encoding and
decoding


 /


bz2_codec
bz2
Compress the operand
using bz2
 /


hex_codec
hex
Convert operand to
hexadecimal
representation, with two
digits per byte
 /


quopri_codec
quopri,
quotedprintable,
quoted_printable
Convert operand to MIME
quoted printable
 with
 /


uu_codec
uu
Convert the operand using
uuencode
 /


zlib_codec
zip, zlib
Compress the operand
using gzip
 /







[1]In addition to bytes-like objects,
 also accepts ASCII-only instances of  for
decoding



New in version 3.2: Restoration of the binary transforms.


Changed in version 3.4: Restoration of the aliases for the binary transforms.



Text Transforms¶
The following codec provides a text transform: a  to 
mapping.  It is not supported by  (which only produces
 output).







Codec
Aliases
Purpose



rot_13
rot13
Returns the Caesar-cypher
encryption of the operand




New in version 3.2: Restoration of the  text transform.


Changed in version 3.4: Restoration of the  alias.
