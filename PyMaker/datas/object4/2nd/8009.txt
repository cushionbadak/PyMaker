¶
This attribute is  by default.  If you assign a string to it, that
string will be recognized as a lexical-level inclusion request similar to the
 keyword in various shells.  That is, the immediately following token
will be opened as a filename and input will be taken from that stream until
EOF, at which point the  method of that stream will be
called and the input source will again become the original input stream.  Source
requests may be stacked any number of levels deep.
