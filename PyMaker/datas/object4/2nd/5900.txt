class (path, factory=None, create=True)¶
A subclass of  for mailboxes in MMDF format. Parameter factory
is a callable object that accepts a file-like message representation (which
behaves as if opened in binary mode) and returns a custom representation. If
factory is ,  is used as the default message
representation. If create is , the mailbox is created if it does not
exist.
MMDF is a single-file mailbox format invented for the Multichannel Memorandum
Distribution Facility, a mail transfer agent. Each message is in the same
form as an mbox message but is bracketed before and after by lines containing
four Control-A () characters. As with the mbox format, the
beginning of each message is indicated by a line whose first five characters
are “From “, but additional occurrences of “From ” are not transformed to
“>From ” when storing messages because the extra message separator lines
prevent mistaking such occurrences for the starts of subsequent messages.
Some  methods implemented by  deserve special
remarks:


(key)¶
Using the file after calling  or  on the
 instance may yield unpredictable results or raise an
exception.
