(changelist, max_events[, timeout=None]) → eventlist¶
Low level interface to kevent

changelist must be an iterable of kevent object or 
max_events must be 0 or a positive integer
timeout in seconds (floats possible)


Changed in version 3.5: The function is now retried with a recomputed timeout when interrupted by
a signal, except if the signal handler raises an exception (see
PEP 475 for the rationale), instead of raising
.
