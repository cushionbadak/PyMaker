Datagram Transports¶


(data, addr=None)¶
Send the data bytes to the remote peer given by addr (a
transport-dependent target address).  If addr is ,
the data is sent to the target address given on transport
creation.
This method does not block; it buffers the data and arranges
for it to be sent out asynchronously.



()¶
Close the transport immediately, without waiting for pending
operations to complete.  Buffered data will be lost.
No more data will be received.  The protocol’s

method will eventually be called with  as its argument.
