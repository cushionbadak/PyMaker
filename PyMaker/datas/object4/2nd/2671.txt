(csvfile, dialect='excel', **fmtparams)¶
Return a writer object responsible for converting the user’s data into delimited
strings on the given file-like object.  csvfile can be any object with a
 method.  If csvfile is a file object, it should be opened with
 [1].  An optional dialect
parameter can be given which is used to define a set of parameters specific to a
particular CSV dialect.  It may be an instance of a subclass of the
 class or one of the strings returned by the
 function.  The other optional fmtparams keyword arguments
can be given to override individual formatting parameters in the current
dialect.  For full details about the dialect and formatting parameters, see
section Dialects and Formatting Parameters. To make it
as easy as possible to interface with modules which implement the DB API, the
value  is written as the empty string.  While this isn’t a
reversible transformation, it makes it easier to dump SQL NULL data values to
CSV files without preprocessing the data returned from a  call.
All other non-string data are stringified with  before being written.
