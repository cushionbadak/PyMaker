(level, msg, *args, **kwargs)Â¶
Logs a message with level level on the root logger. The other arguments are
interpreted as for .

Note
The above module-level convenience functions, which delegate to the
root logger, call  to ensure that at least one handler
is available. Because of this, they should not be used in threads,
in versions of Python earlier than 2.7.1 and 3.2, unless at least one
handler has been added to the root logger before the threads are
started. In earlier versions of Python, due to a thread safety shortcoming
in , this can (under rare circumstances) lead to
handlers being added multiple times to the root logger, which can in turn
lead to multiple messages for the same event.
