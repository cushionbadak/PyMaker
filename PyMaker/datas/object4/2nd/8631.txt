docs:


(mock)¶
Seal will disable the automatic creation of mocks when accessing an attribute of
the mock being sealed or any of its attributes that are already mocks recursively.
If a mock instance with a name or a spec is assigned to an attribute
it won’t be considered in the sealing chain. This allows one to prevent seal from
fixing part of the mock object.



New in version 3.7.
