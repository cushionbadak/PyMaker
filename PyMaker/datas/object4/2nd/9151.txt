(context, path)¶
path is the path to a directory that should contain subdirectories
“common”, “posix”, “nt”, each containing scripts destined for the bin
directory in the environment.  The contents of “common” and the
directory corresponding to  are copied after some text
replacement of placeholders:

 is replaced with the absolute path of the environment
directory.
 is replaced with the environment name (final path
segment of environment directory).
 is replaced with the prompt (the environment
name surrounded by parentheses and with a following space)
 is replaced with the name of the bin directory
(either  or ).
 is replaced with the absolute path of the
environment’s executable.

The directories are allowed to exist (for when an existing environment
is being upgraded).
