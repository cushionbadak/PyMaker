docs:


(fd, n)¶
Read at most n bytes from file descriptor fd.
Return a bytestring containing the bytes read. If the end of the file
referred to by fd has been reached, an empty bytes object is returned.

Note
This function is intended for low-level I/O and must be applied to a file
descriptor as returned by  or .  To read a
“file object” returned by the built-in function  or by
 or , or , use its
 or  methods.


Changed in version 3.5: If the system call is interrupted and the signal handler does not raise an
exception, the function now retries the system call instead of raising an
 exception (see PEP 475 for the rationale).
