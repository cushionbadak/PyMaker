6.10.2. Membership test operationsÂ¶
The operators  and  test for membership.   evaluates to  if x is a member of s, and  otherwise.
 returns the negation of .  All built-in sequences and
set types support this as well as dictionary, for which  tests
whether the dictionary has a given key. For container types such as list, tuple,
set, frozenset, dict, or collections.deque, the expression  is equivalent
to .
For the string and bytes types,  is  if and only if x is a
substring of y.  An equivalent test is .  Empty strings are
always considered to be a substring of any other string, so  will
return .
For user-defined classes which define the  method,  returns  if  returns a true value, and
 otherwise.
For user-defined classes which do not define  but do define
,  is  if some value  with  is
produced while iterating over .  If an exception is raised during the
iteration, it is as if  raised that exception.
Lastly, the old-style iteration protocol is tried: if a class defines
,  is  if and only if there is a non-negative
integer index i such that , and all lower integer indices do not
raise  exception.  (If any other exception is raised, it is as
if  raised that exception).
The operator  is defined to have the inverse truth value of
.
