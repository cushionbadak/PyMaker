(iterable, *[, key, default])Â¶

(arg1, arg2, *args[, key])
Return the smallest item in an iterable or the smallest of two or more
arguments.
If one positional argument is provided, it should be an iterable.
The smallest item in the iterable is returned.  If two or more positional
arguments are provided, the smallest of the positional arguments is
returned.
There are two optional keyword-only arguments. The key argument specifies
a one-argument ordering function like that used for . The
default argument specifies an object to return if the provided iterable is
empty. If the iterable is empty and default is not provided, a
 is raised.
If multiple items are minimal, the function returns the first one
encountered.  This is consistent with other sort-stability preserving tools
such as  and .

New in version 3.4: The default keyword-only argument.
