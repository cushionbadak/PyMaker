Timeouts and the  methodÂ¶
If  is not , sockets returned by
the  method inherit that timeout.  Otherwise, the
behaviour depends on settings of the listening socket:

if the listening socket is in blocking mode or in timeout mode,
the socket returned by  is in blocking mode;
if the listening socket is in non-blocking mode, whether the socket
returned by  is in blocking or non-blocking mode
is operating system-dependent.  If you want to ensure cross-platform
behaviour, it is recommended you manually override this setting.
