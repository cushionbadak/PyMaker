Coupling Widget Variables¶
The current-value setting of some widgets (like text entry widgets) can be
connected directly to application variables by using special options.  These
options are , , , , and
.  This connection works both ways: if the variable changes for any
reason, the widget it’s connected to will be updated to reflect the new value.
Unfortunately, in the current implementation of  it is not
possible to hand over an arbitrary Python variable to a widget through a
 or  option.  The only kinds of variables for which
this works are variables that are subclassed from a class called Variable,
defined in .
There are many useful subclasses of Variable already defined:
, , , and
.  To read the current value of such a variable, call the
 method on it, and to change its value you call the 
method.  If you follow this protocol, the widget will always track the value of
the variable, with no further intervention on your part.
For example:
