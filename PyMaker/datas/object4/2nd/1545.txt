(iterable)¶
Return an accurate floating point sum of values in the iterable.  Avoids
loss of precision by tracking multiple intermediate partial sums:


The algorithm’s accuracy depends on IEEE-754 arithmetic guarantees and the
typical case where the rounding mode is half-even.  On some non-Windows
builds, the underlying C library uses extended precision addition and may
occasionally double-round an intermediate sum causing it to be off in its
least significant bit.
For further discussion and two alternative approaches, see the ASPN cookbook
recipes for accurate floating point summation.
