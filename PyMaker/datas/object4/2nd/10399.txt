Notable Module Contents¶
In addition to many functions described in the  module documentation,
 defines the following data item:


¶
A dictionary representing the string environment at the time the interpreter
was started. Keys and values are bytes on Unix and str on Windows. For
example,  ( on Windows) is the
pathname of your home directory, equivalent to  in C.
Modifying this dictionary does not affect the string environment passed on by
,  or ; if you need to
change the environment, pass  to  or add
variable assignments and export statements to the command string for
 or .

Changed in version 3.2: On Unix, keys and values are bytes.


Note
The  module provides an alternate implementation of 
which updates the environment on modification. Note also that updating
 will render this dictionary obsolete. Use of the
 module version of this is recommended over direct access to the
 module.
