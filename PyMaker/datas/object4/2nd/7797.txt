docs:

For extension writers and programs that embed Python¶
Extension modules should never call , except to find out what
the current locale is.  But since the return value can only be used portably to
restore it, that is not very useful (except perhaps to find out whether or not
the locale is ).
When Python code uses the  module to change the locale, this also
affects the embedding application.  If the embedding application doesn’t want
this to happen, it should remove the  extension module (which does
all the work) from the table of built-in modules in the  file,
and make sure that the  module is not accessible as a shared
library.
