([object])Â¶
Invoke the built-in help system.  (This function is intended for interactive
use.)  If no argument is given, the interactive help system starts on the
interpreter console.  If the argument is a string, then the string is looked up
as the name of a module, function, class, method, keyword, or documentation
topic, and a help page is printed on the console.  If the argument is any other
kind of object, a help page on the object is generated.
Note that if a slash(/) appears in the parameter list of a function, when
invoking , it means that the parameters prior to the slash are
positional-only. For more info, see
the FAQ entry on positional-only parameters.
This function is added to the built-in namespace by the  module.

Changed in version 3.4: Changes to  and  mean that the reported
signatures for callables are now more comprehensive and consistent.
