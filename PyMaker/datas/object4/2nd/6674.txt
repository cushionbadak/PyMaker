HTTPRedirectHandler Objects¶

Note
Some HTTP redirections require action from this module’s client code.  If this
is the case,  is raised.  See RFC 2616 for
details of the precise meanings of the various redirection codes.
An  exception raised as a security consideration if the
HTTPRedirectHandler is presented with a redirected URL which is not an HTTP,
HTTPS or FTP URL.



(req, fp, code, msg, hdrs, newurl)¶
Return a  or  in response to a redirect. This is called
by the default implementations of the  methods when a
redirection is received from the server.  If a redirection should take place,
return a new  to allow  to perform the
redirect to newurl.  Otherwise, raise  if
no other handler should try to handle this URL, or return  if you
can’t but another handler might.

Note
The default implementation of this method does not strictly follow RFC 2616,
which says that 301 and 302 responses to  requests must not be
automatically redirected without confirmation by the user.  In reality, browsers
do allow automatic redirection of these responses, changing the POST to a
, and the default implementation reproduces this behavior.




(req, fp, code, msg, hdrs)¶
Redirect to the  or  URL.  This method is called by the
parent  when getting an HTTP ‘moved permanently’ response.



(req, fp, code, msg, hdrs)¶
The same as , but called for the ‘found’ response.



(req, fp, code, msg, hdrs)¶
The same as , but called for the ‘see other’ response.



(req, fp, code, msg, hdrs)¶
The same as , but called for the ‘temporary redirect’
response.
