class ¶
An “unstructured” header is the default type of header in RFC 5322.
Any header that does not have a specified syntax is treated as
unstructured.  The classic example of an unstructured header is the
Subject header.
In RFC 5322, an unstructured header is a run of arbitrary text in the
ASCII character set.  RFC 2047, however, has an RFC 5322 compatible
mechanism for encoding non-ASCII text as ASCII characters within a header
value.  When a value containing encoded words is passed to the
constructor, the  parser converts such encoded words
into unicode, following the RFC 2047 rules for unstructured text.  The
parser uses heuristics to attempt to decode certain non-compliant encoded
words.  Defects are registered in such cases, as well as defects for issues
such as invalid characters within the encoded words or the non-encoded text.
This header type provides no additional attributes.
