docs:


(blocking=True)Â¶
Run all scheduled events. This method will wait  (using the 
function passed to the constructor) for the next event, then execute it and so
on until there are no more scheduled events.
If blocking is false executes the scheduled events due to expire soonest
(if any) and then return the deadline of the next scheduled call in the
scheduler (if any).
Either action or delayfunc can raise an exception.  In either case, the
scheduler will maintain a consistent state and propagate the exception.  If an
exception is raised by action, the event will not be attempted in future calls
to .
If a sequence of events takes longer to run than the time available before the
next event, the scheduler will simply fall behind.  No events will be dropped;
the calling code is responsible for canceling  events which are no longer
pertinent.

New in version 3.3: blocking parameter was added.
