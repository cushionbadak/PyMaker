()Â¶
If  instance d is naive, this is the same as
 except that  is forced to 0 regardless of what
 returns.  DST is never in effect for a UTC time.
If d is aware, d is normalized to UTC time, by subtracting

normalized time is returned.   is forced to 0. Note
that an  may be raised if d.year was
 or  and UTC adjustment spills over a year
boundary.
