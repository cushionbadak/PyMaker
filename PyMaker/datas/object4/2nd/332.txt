class ([x])¶

class (x, base=10)
Return an integer object constructed from a number or string x, or return
 if no arguments are given.  If x defines ,
 returns .  If x defines ,
it returns .
For floating point numbers, this truncates towards zero.
If x is not a number or if base is given, then x must be a string,
, or  instance representing an integer
literal in radix base.  Optionally, the literal can be
preceded by  or  (with no space in between) and surrounded by
whitespace.  A base-n literal consists of the digits 0 to n-1, with 
to  (or  to ) having
values 10 to 35.  The default base is 10. The allowed values are 0 and 2–36.
Base-2, -8, and -16 literals can be optionally prefixed with /,
/, or /, as with integer literals in code.  Base 0
means to interpret exactly as a code literal, so that the actual base is 2,
8, 10, or 16, and so that  is not legal, while
 is, as well as .
The integer type is described in Numeric Types — int, float, complex.

Changed in version 3.4: If base is not an instance of  and the base object has a
 method, that method is called
to obtain an integer for the base.  Previous versions used
 instead of .


Changed in version 3.6: Grouping digits with underscores as in code literals is allowed.


Changed in version 3.7: x is now a positional-only parameter.
