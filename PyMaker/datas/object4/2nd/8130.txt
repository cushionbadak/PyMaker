docs:


(item, parent, index)¶
Moves item to position index in parent’s list of children.
It is illegal to move an item under one of its descendants. If index is
less than or equal to zero, item is moved to the beginning; if greater
than or equal to the number of children, it is moved to the end. If item
was detached it is reattached.
