docs:


(other, context=None)Â¶
Return a copy of the first operand with the sign set to be the same as the
sign of the second operand.  For example:


This operation is unaffected by context and is quiet: no flags are changed
and no rounding is performed.  As an exception, the C version may raise
InvalidOperation if the second operand cannot be converted exactly.
