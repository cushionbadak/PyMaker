docs:


(name, callable)¶
Creates a collation with the specified name and callable. The callable will
be passed two string arguments. It should return -1 if the first is ordered
lower than the second, 0 if they are ordered equal and 1 if the first is ordered
higher than the second.  Note that this controls sorting (ORDER BY in SQL) so
your comparisons don’t affect other SQL operations.
Note that the callable will get its parameters as Python bytestrings, which will
normally be encoded in UTF-8.
The following example shows a custom collation that sorts “the wrong way”:


To remove a collation, call  with  as callable:
