class (addr, requestHandler=SimpleXMLRPCRequestHandler, logRequests=True, allow_none=False, encoding=None, bind_and_activate=True, use_builtin_types=False)Â¶
Create a new server instance.  This class provides methods for registration of
functions that can be called by the XML-RPC protocol.  The requestHandler
parameter should be a factory for request handler instances; it defaults to
.  The addr and requestHandler parameters
are passed to the  constructor.  If logRequests
is true (the default), requests will be logged; setting this parameter to false
will turn off logging.   The allow_none and encoding parameters are passed
on to  and control the XML-RPC responses that will be returned
from the server. The bind_and_activate parameter controls whether
 and  are called immediately by the
constructor; it defaults to true. Setting it to false allows code to manipulate
the allow_reuse_address class variable before the address is bound.
The use_builtin_types parameter is passed to the
 function and controls which types are processed
when date/times values or binary data are received; it defaults to false.

Changed in version 3.3: The use_builtin_types flag was added.
