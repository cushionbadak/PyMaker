(path)Â¶
If you are running an entropy-gathering daemon (EGD) somewhere, and path
is the pathname of a socket connection open to it, this will read 256 bytes
of randomness from the socket, and add it to the SSL pseudo-random number
generator to increase the security of generated secret keys.  This is
typically only necessary on systems without better sources of randomness.
See http://egd.sourceforge.net/ or http://prngd.sourceforge.net/ for sources
of entropy-gathering daemons.
