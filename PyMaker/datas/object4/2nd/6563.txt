docs:


class (filelike, blksize=8192)¶
A wrapper to convert a file-like object to an iterator.  The resulting objects
support both  and  iteration styles, for
compatibility with Python 2.1 and Jython. As the object is iterated over, the
optional blksize parameter will be repeatedly passed to the filelike
object’s  method to obtain bytestrings to yield.  When 
returns an empty bytestring, iteration is ended and is not resumable.
If filelike has a  method, the returned object will also have a
 method, and it will invoke the filelike object’s 
method when called.
Example usage:
