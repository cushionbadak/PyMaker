docs:


(init_or_size, size=None)Â¶
This function creates a mutable character buffer. The returned object is a
ctypes array of .
init_or_size must be an integer which specifies the size of the array, or a
bytes object which will be used to initialize the array items.
If a bytes object is specified as first argument, the buffer is made one item
larger than its length so that the last element in the array is a NUL
termination character. An integer can be passed as second argument which allows
specifying the size of the array if the length of the bytes should not be used.
