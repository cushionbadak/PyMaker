6.11. Boolean operationsÂ¶

In the context of Boolean operations, and also when expressions are used by
control flow statements, the following values are interpreted as false:
, , numeric zero of all types, and empty strings and containers
(including strings, tuples, lists, dictionaries, sets and frozensets).  All
other values are interpreted as true.  User-defined objects can customize their
truth value by providing a  method.
The operator  yields  if its argument is false, 
otherwise.
The expression  first evaluates x; if x is false, its value is
returned; otherwise, y is evaluated and the resulting value is returned.
The expression  first evaluates x; if x is true, its value is
returned; otherwise, y is evaluated and the resulting value is returned.
Note that neither  nor  restrict the value and type
they return to  and , but rather return the last evaluated
argument.  This is sometimes useful, e.g., if  is a string that should be
replaced by a default value if it is empty, the expression  yields
the desired value.  Because  has to create a new value, it
returns a boolean value regardless of the type of its argument
(for example,  produces  rather than .)
