docs:


(iterable[, func])Â¶
Make an iterator that returns accumulated sums, or accumulated
results of other binary functions (specified via the optional
func argument).  If func is supplied, it should be a function
of two arguments. Elements of the input iterable may be any type
that can be accepted as arguments to func. (For example, with
the default operation of addition, elements may be any addable
type including  or
.) If the input iterable is empty, the
output iterable will also be empty.
Roughly equivalent to:


There are a number of uses for the func argument.  It can be set to
 for a running minimum,  for a running maximum, or
 for a running product.  Amortization tables can be
built by accumulating interest and applying payments.  First-order
recurrence relations
can be modeled by supplying the initial value in the iterable and using only
the accumulated total in func argument:


See  for a similar function that returns only the
final accumulated value.

New in version 3.2.


Changed in version 3.3: Added the optional func parameter.
