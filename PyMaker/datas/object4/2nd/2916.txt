Availability: Unix.

Note
On Mac OS X,  behavior differs somewhat from
other Unix platforms. If the Python interpreter was built with a
deployment target of  or earlier,  returns
the list of effective group ids associated with the current user process;
this list is limited to a system-defined number of entries, typically 16,
and may be modified by calls to  if suitably privileged.
If built with a deployment target greater than ,
 returns the current group access list for the user
associated with the effective user id of the process; the group access
list may change over the lifetime of the process, it is not affected by
calls to , and its length is not limited to 16.  The
deployment target value, , can be
obtained with .
