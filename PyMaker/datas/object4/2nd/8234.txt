Code ContextÂ¶
Within an editor window containing Python code, code context can be toggled
in order to show or hide a pane at the top of the window.  When shown, this
pane freezes the opening lines for block code, such as those beginning with
, , or  keywords, that would have otherwise scrolled
out of view.  The size of the pane will be expanded and contracted as needed
to show the all current levels of context, up to the maximum number of
lines defined in the Configure IDLE dialog (which defaults to 15).  If there
are no current context lines and the feature is toggled on, a single blank
line will display.  Clicking on a line in the context pane will move that
line to the top of the editor.
The text and background colors for the context pane can be configured under
the Highlights tab in the Configure IDLE dialog.
