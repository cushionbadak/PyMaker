(doc)Â¶
Clean up indentation from docstrings that are indented to line up with blocks
of code.
All leading whitespace is removed from the first line.  Any leading whitespace
that can be uniformly removed from the second line onwards is removed.  Empty
lines at the beginning and end are subsequently removed.  Also, all tabs are
expanded to spaces.
