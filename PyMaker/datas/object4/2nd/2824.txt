Cryptographic Services¶
The modules described in this chapter implement various algorithms of a
cryptographic nature.  They are available at the discretion of the installation.
On Unix systems, the  module may also be available.
Here’s an overview:


 — Secure hashes and message digests
Hash algorithms
SHAKE variable length digests
Key derivation
BLAKE2
Creating hash objects
Constants
Examples
Simple hashing
Using different digest sizes
Keyed hashing
Randomized hashing
Personalization
Tree mode
