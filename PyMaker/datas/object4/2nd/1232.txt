docs:


(m=None)Â¶
Returns a new  containing a new map followed by
all of the maps in the current instance.  If  is specified,
it becomes the new map at the front of the list of mappings; if not
specified, an empty dict is used, so that a call to 
is equivalent to: .  This method is used for
creating subcontexts that can be updated without altering values in any
of the parent mappings.

Changed in version 3.4: The optional  parameter was added.
