The Catalog constructor¶
GNOME uses a version of the  module by James Henstridge, but this
version has a slightly different API.  Its documented usage was:


For compatibility with this older module, the function  is an
alias for the  function described above.
One difference between this module and Henstridge’s: his catalog objects
supported access through a mapping API, but this appears to be unused and so is
not currently supported.
