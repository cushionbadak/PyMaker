docs:


(format[, shape])¶
Cast a memoryview to a new format or shape. shape defaults to
, which means that the result view
will be one-dimensional. The return value is a new memoryview, but
the buffer itself is not copied. Supported casts are 1D -> C-contiguous
and C-contiguous -> 1D.
The destination format is restricted to a single element native format in
 syntax. One of the formats must be a byte format
(‘B’, ‘b’ or ‘c’). The byte length of the result must be the same
as the original length.
Cast 1D/long to 1D/unsigned bytes:


Cast 1D/unsigned bytes to 1D/char:


Cast 1D/bytes to 3D/ints to 1D/signed char:


Cast 1D/unsigned char to 2D/unsigned long:



New in version 3.3.


Changed in version 3.5: The source format is no longer restricted when casting to a byte view.
