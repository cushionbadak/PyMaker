(self, length)Â¶
This method takes a single integer argument length and computes
information about the slice that the slice object would describe if
applied to a sequence of length items.  It returns a tuple of three
integers; respectively these are the start and stop indices and the
step or stride length of the slice. Missing or out-of-bounds indices
are handled in a manner consistent with regular slices.
