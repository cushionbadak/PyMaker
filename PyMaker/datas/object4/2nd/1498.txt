Omitting values¶
In many use-cases one doesn’t care what the actual value of an enumeration
is. There are several ways to define this type of simple enumeration:

use instances of  for the value
use instances of  as the value
use a descriptive string as the value
use a tuple as the value and a custom  to replace the
tuple with an  value

Using any of these methods signifies to the user that these values are not
important, and also enables one to add, remove, or reorder members without
having to renumber the remaining members.
Whichever method you choose, you should provide a  that also hides
the (unimportant) value:

Note
The  method, if defined, is used during creation of the Enum
members; it is then replaced by Enum’s  which is used after
class creation for lookup of existing members.
