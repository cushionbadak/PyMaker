(data)Â¶
Provide data which should be formatted with collapsed whitespace. Whitespace
from preceding and successive calls to  is considered as
well when the whitespace collapse is performed.  The data which is passed to
this method is expected to be word-wrapped by the output device.  Note that any
word-wrapping still must be performed by the writer object due to the need to
rely on device and font information.
