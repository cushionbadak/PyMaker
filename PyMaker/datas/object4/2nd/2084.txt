(path)¶
On Unix and Windows, return the argument with an initial component of  or
 replaced by that user’s home directory.
On Unix, an initial  is replaced by the environment variable 
if it is set; otherwise the current user’s home directory is looked up in the
password directory through the built-in module . An initial 
is looked up directly in the password directory.
On Windows,  and  will be used if set,
otherwise a combination of  and  will be
used.  An initial  is handled by stripping the last directory component
from the created user path derived above.
If the expansion fails or if the path does not begin with a tilde, the path is
returned unchanged.

Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a path-like object.
