7.6. The  statementÂ¶

 may only occur syntactically nested in a function definition,
not within a nested class definition.
If an expression list is present, it is evaluated, else  is substituted.
 leaves the current function call with the expression list (or
) as return value.
When  passes control out of a  statement with a
 clause, that  clause is executed before
really leaving the function.
In a generator function, the  statement indicates that the
generator is done and will cause  to be raised. The returned
value (if any) is used as an argument to construct  and
becomes the  attribute.
In an asynchronous generator function, an empty  statement
indicates that the asynchronous generator is done and will cause
 to be raised.  A non-empty 
statement is a syntax error in an asynchronous generator function.
