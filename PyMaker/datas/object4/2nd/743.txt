docs:


(mapping, **kwds)Â¶
Performs the template substitution, returning a new string.  mapping is
any dictionary-like object with keys that match the placeholders in the
template.  Alternatively, you can provide keyword arguments, where the
keywords are the placeholders.  When both mapping and kwds are given
and there are duplicates, the placeholders from kwds take precedence.
