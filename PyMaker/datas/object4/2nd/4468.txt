Security Considerations¶
Unlike some other popen functions, this implementation will never
implicitly call a system shell.  This means that all characters,
including shell metacharacters, can safely be passed to child processes.
If the shell is invoked explicitly, via , it is the application’s
responsibility to ensure that all whitespace and metacharacters are
quoted appropriately to avoid
shell injection
vulnerabilities.
When using , the  function can be
used to properly escape whitespace and shell metacharacters in strings
that are going to be used to construct shell commands.
