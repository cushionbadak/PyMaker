nargs¶
ArgumentParser objects usually associate a single command-line argument with a
single action to be taken.  The  keyword argument associates a
different number of command-line arguments with a single action.  The supported
values are:

 (an integer).   arguments from the command line will be gathered
together into a list.  For example:


Note that  produces a list of one item.  This is different from
the default, in which the item is produced by itself.



. One argument will be consumed from the command line if possible, and
produced as a single item.  If no command-line argument is present, the value from
default will be produced.  Note that for optional arguments, there is an
additional case - the option string is present but not followed by a
command-line argument.  In this case the value from const will be produced.  Some
examples to illustrate this:


One of the more common uses of  is to allow optional input and
output files:





.  All command-line arguments present are gathered into a list.  Note that
it generally doesn’t make much sense to have more than one positional argument
with , but multiple optional arguments with  is
possible.  For example:





. Just like , all command-line args present are gathered into a
list.  Additionally, an error message will be generated if there wasn’t at
least one command-line argument present.  For example:





.  All the remaining command-line arguments are gathered
into a list.  This is commonly useful for command line utilities that dispatch
to other command line utilities:




If the  keyword argument is not provided, the number of arguments consumed
is determined by the action.  Generally this means a single command-line argument
will be consumed and a single item (not a list) will be produced.
