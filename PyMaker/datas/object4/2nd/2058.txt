docs:


(mode=0o777, parents=False, exist_ok=False)¶
Create a new directory at this given path.  If mode is given, it is
combined with the process’  value to determine the file mode
and access flags.  If the path already exists, 
is raised.
If parents is true, any missing parents of this path are created
as needed; they are created with the default permissions without taking
mode into account (mimicking the POSIX  command).
If parents is false (the default), a missing parent raises
.
If exist_ok is false (the default),  is
raised if the target directory already exists.
If exist_ok is true,  exceptions will be
ignored (same behavior as the POSIX  command), but only if the
last path component is not an existing non-directory file.

Changed in version 3.5: The exist_ok parameter was added.
