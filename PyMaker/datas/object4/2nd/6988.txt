docs:


(group_pattern=None, *, file=None)Â¶
Send a  or  command.  Return a pair
 where list is a list of tuples representing all
the groups available from this NNTP server, optionally matching the
pattern string group_pattern.  Each tuple has the form
, where group is a group name, last
and first are the last and first article numbers, and flag usually
takes one of these values:

: Local postings and articles from peers are allowed.
: The group is moderated and all postings must be approved.
: No local postings are allowed, only articles from peers.
: Articles from peers are filed in the junk group instead.
: No local postings, and articles from peers are ignored.
: Articles are filed in the  group instead.

If flag has another value, then the status of the newsgroup should be
considered unknown.
This command can return very large results, especially if group_pattern
is not specified.  It is best to cache the results offline unless you
really need to refresh them.

Changed in version 3.2: group_pattern was added.
