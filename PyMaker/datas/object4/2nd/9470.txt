(object)Â¶
Return true if the object is a data descriptor.
Data descriptors have both a  and a  method.
Examples are properties (defined in Python), getsets, and members.  The
latter two are defined in C and there are more specific tests available for
those types, which is robust across Python implementations.  Typically, data
descriptors will also have  and  attributes
(properties, getsets, and members have both of these attributes), but this is
not guaranteed.
