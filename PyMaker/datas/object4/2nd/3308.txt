docs:


(b)¶
Read bytes into a pre-allocated, writable
bytes-like object b, using at most one call to
the underlying raw stream’s  (or
) method. Return the number of bytes read.
A  is raised if the underlying raw stream is in non
blocking-mode, and has no data available at the moment.

New in version 3.5.
