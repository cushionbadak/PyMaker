(func)¶
Get the mapping of external name references in a Python function or
method func to their current values. A
named tuple 
is returned. nonlocals maps referenced names to lexical closure
variables, globals to the function’s module globals and builtins to
the builtins visible from the function body. unbound is the set of names
referenced in the function that could not be resolved at all given the
current module globals and builtins.
 is raised if func is not a Python function or method.

New in version 3.3.
