XML tree and elementsÂ¶
XML is an inherently hierarchical data format, and the most natural way to
represent it is with a tree.   has two classes for this purpose -
 represents the whole XML document as a tree, and
 represents a single node in this tree.  Interactions with
the whole document (reading and writing to/from files) are usually done
on the  level.  Interactions with a single XML element
and its sub-elements are done on the  level.
