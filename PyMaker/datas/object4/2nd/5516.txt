()¶
The  method is an all-purpose generator which can be used to
iterate over all the parts and subparts of a message object tree, in
depth-first traversal order.  You will typically use  as the
iterator in a  loop; each iteration returns the next subpart.
Here’s an example that prints the MIME type of every part of a multipart
message structure:


 iterates over the subparts of any part where
 returns , even though
 may return .  We
can see this in our example by making use of the  debug
helper function:


Here the  parts are not , but they do contain
subparts.  returns  and  descends
into the subparts.
