(expression, globals=None, locals=None)¶
The arguments are a string and optional globals and locals.  If provided,
globals must be a dictionary.  If provided, locals can be any mapping
object.
The expression argument is parsed and evaluated as a Python expression
(technically speaking, a condition list) using the globals and locals
dictionaries as global and local namespace.  If the globals dictionary is
present and does not contain a value for the key , a
reference to the dictionary of the built-in module  is
inserted under that key before expression is parsed.
This means that expression normally has full
access to the standard  module and restricted environments are
propagated.  If the locals dictionary is omitted it defaults to the globals
dictionary.  If both dictionaries are omitted, the expression is executed in the
environment where  is called.  The return value is the result of
the evaluated expression. Syntax errors are reported as exceptions.  Example:


This function can also be used to execute arbitrary code objects (such as
those created by ).  In this case pass a code object instead
of a string.  If the code object has been compiled with  as the
mode argument, ’s return value will be .
Hints: dynamic execution of statements is supported by the 
function.  The  and  functions
returns the current global and local dictionary, respectively, which may be
useful to pass around for use by  or .
See  for a function that can safely evaluate strings
with expressions containing only literals.
