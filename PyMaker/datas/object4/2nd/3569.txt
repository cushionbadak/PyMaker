(port=DEFAULT_LOGGING_CONFIG_PORT, verify=None)¶
Starts up a socket server on the specified port, and listens for new
configurations. If no port is specified, the module’s default
 is used. Logging configurations will be
sent as a file suitable for processing by  or
. Returns a  instance on which
you can call  to start the server, and which
you can  when appropriate. To stop the server,
call .
The  argument, if specified, should be a callable which should
verify whether bytes received across the socket are valid and should be
processed. This could be done by encrypting and/or signing what is sent
across the socket, such that the  callable can perform
signature verification and/or decryption. The  callable is called
with a single argument - the bytes received across the socket - and should
return the bytes to be processed, or  to indicate that the bytes should
be discarded. The returned bytes could be the same as the passed in bytes
(e.g. when only verification is done), or they could be completely different
(perhaps if decryption were performed).
To send a configuration to the socket, read in the configuration file and
send it to the socket as a sequence of bytes preceded by a four-byte length
string packed in binary using .

Note
Because portions of the configuration are passed through
, use of this function may open its users to a security risk.
While the function only binds to a socket on , and so does
not accept connections from remote machines, there are scenarios where
untrusted code could be run under the account of the process which calls
. Specifically, if the process calling  runs
on a multi-user machine where users cannot trust each other, then a
malicious user could arrange to run essentially arbitrary code in a
victim user’s process, simply by connecting to the victim’s
 socket and sending a configuration which runs whatever
code the attacker wants to have executed in the victim’s process. This is
especially easy to do if the default port is used, but not hard even if a
different port is used). To avoid the risk of this happening, use the
 argument to  to prevent unrecognised
configurations from being applied.


Changed in version 3.4: The  argument was added.


Note
If you want to send configurations to the listener which don’t
disable existing loggers, you will need to use a JSON format for
the configuration, which will use  for configuration.
This method allows you to specify  as
 in the configuration you send.
