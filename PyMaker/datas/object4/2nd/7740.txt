class ¶
The following methods are overridden from the base class implementation:


(message)¶
Look up the message id in the catalog and return the corresponding message
string, as a Unicode string.  If there is no entry in the catalog for the
message id, and a fallback has been set, the look up is forwarded to the
fallback’s  method.  Otherwise, the
message id is returned.



(singular, plural, n)¶
Do a plural-forms lookup of a message id.  singular is used as the message id
for purposes of lookup in the catalog, while n is used to determine which
plural form to use.  The returned message string is a Unicode string.
If the message id is not found in the catalog, and a fallback is specified,
the request is forwarded to the fallback’s 
method.  Otherwise, when n is 1 singular is returned, and plural is
returned in all other cases.
Here is an example:





(message)¶



(singular, plural, n)¶
Equivalent to  and , but the translation
is returned as a byte string encoded in the preferred system encoding
if no encoding  was explicitly set with
.

Warning
These methods should be avoided in Python 3.  See the warning for the
 function.
