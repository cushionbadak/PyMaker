docs:


(path)Â¶
Return the base name of pathname path.  This is the second element of the
pair returned by passing path to the function .  Note that
the result of this function is different
from the Unix basename program; where basename for
 returns , the  function returns an
empty string ().

Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a path-like object.
