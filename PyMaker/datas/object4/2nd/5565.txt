class (outfp, mangle_from_=None, maxheaderlen=None, fmt=None, *, policy=None)¶
Act like , except that for any subpart of the message
passed to , if the subpart is of main type
text, print the decoded payload of the subpart, and if the main
type is not text, instead of printing it fill in the string
fmt using information from the part and print the resulting
filled-in string.
To fill in fmt, execute , where 
is a dictionary composed of the following keys and values:

 – Full MIME type of the non-text part
 – Main MIME type of the non-text part
 – Sub-MIME type of the non-text part
 – Filename of the non-text part
 – Description associated with the non-text part
 – Content transfer encoding of the non-text part

If fmt is , use the following default fmt:

“[Non-text (%(type)s) part of message omitted, filename %(filename)s]”
Optional _mangle_from_ and maxheaderlen are as with the
 base class.
