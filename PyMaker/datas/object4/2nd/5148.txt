docs:


(num)Â¶
Return (bytes, is_cryptographic): bytes are num pseudo-random bytes,
is_cryptographic is  if the bytes generated are cryptographically
strong. Raises an  if the operation is not supported by the
current RAND method.
Generated pseudo-random byte sequences will be unique if they are of
sufficient length, but are not necessarily unpredictable. They can be used
for non-cryptographic purposes and for certain purposes in cryptographic
protocols, but usually not for key generation etc.
For almost all applications  is preferable.

New in version 3.3.


Deprecated since version 3.6: OpenSSL has deprecated , use
