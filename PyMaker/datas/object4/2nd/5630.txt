class ¶
There is really only one valid value for the MIME-Version
header, and that is .  For future proofing, this header class
supports other valid version numbers.  If a version number has a valid value
per RFC 2045, then the header object will have non- values for
the following attributes:


¶
The version number as a string, with any whitespace and/or comments
removed.



¶
The major version number as an integer



¶
The minor version number as an integer
