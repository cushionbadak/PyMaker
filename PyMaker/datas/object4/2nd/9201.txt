¶
A struct sequence holding information about the float type. It
contains low level information about the precision and internal
representation.  The values correspond to the various floating-point
constants defined in the standard header file  for the ‘C’
programming language; see section 5.2.4.2.2 of the 1999 ISO/IEC C standard
[C99], ‘Characteristics of floating types’, for details.







attribute
float.h macro
explanation




DBL_EPSILON
difference between 1 and the least value greater
than 1 that is representable as a float


DBL_DIG
maximum number of decimal digits that can be
faithfully represented in a float;  see below


DBL_MANT_DIG
float precision: the number of base-
digits in the significand of a float


DBL_MAX
maximum representable finite float


DBL_MAX_EXP
maximum integer e such that  is
a representable finite float


DBL_MAX_10_EXP
maximum integer e such that  is in the
range of representable finite floats


DBL_MIN
minimum positive normalized float


DBL_MIN_EXP
minimum integer e such that  is
a normalized float


DBL_MIN_10_EXP
minimum integer e such that  is a
normalized float


FLT_RADIX
radix of exponent representation


FLT_ROUNDS
integer constant representing the rounding mode
used for arithmetic operations.  This reflects
the value of the system FLT_ROUNDS macro at
interpreter startup time.  See section 5.2.4.2.2
of the C99 standard for an explanation of the
possible values and their meanings.



The attribute  needs further explanation.  If
 is any string representing a decimal number with at most
 significant digits, then converting  to a
float and back again will recover a string representing the same decimal
value:


But for strings with more than  significant digits,
this isn’t always true:
