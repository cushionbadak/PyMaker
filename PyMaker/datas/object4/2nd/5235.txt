 if not connected or the handshake has not been completed.
The cb_type parameter allow selection of the desired channel binding
type. Valid channel binding types are listed in the
 list.  Currently only the ‘tls-unique’ channel
binding, defined by RFC 5929, is supported.   will be
raised if an unsupported channel binding type is requested.

New in version 3.3.
