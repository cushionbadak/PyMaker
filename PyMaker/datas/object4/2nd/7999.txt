(infile=None, lineno=None)Â¶
This method generates an error message leader in the format of a Unix C compiler
error label; the format is , where the  is replaced
with the name of the current source file and the  with the current input
line number (the optional arguments can be used to override these).
This convenience is provided to encourage  users to generate error
messages in the standard, parseable format understood by Emacs and other Unix
tools.
