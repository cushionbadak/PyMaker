docs:

7.10. The  statementÂ¶

 may only occur syntactically nested in a  or
 loop, but not nested in a function or class definition or
 clause within that loop.  It continues with the next
cycle of the nearest enclosing loop.
When  passes control out of a  statement with a
 clause, that  clause is executed before
really starting the next loop cycle.
