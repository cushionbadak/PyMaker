Quick Start¶
Let’s take a very basic configuration file that looks like this:


The structure of INI files is described in the following section.  Essentially, the file
consists of sections, each of which contains keys with values.
 classes can read and write such files.  Let’s start by
creating the above configuration file programmatically.


As you can see, we can treat a config parser much like a dictionary.
There are differences, outlined later, but
the behavior is very close to what you would expect from a dictionary.
Now that we have created and saved a configuration file, let’s read it
back and explore the data it holds.


As we can see above, the API is pretty straightforward.  The only bit of magic
involves the  section which provides default values for all other
sections [1].  Note also that keys in sections are
case-insensitive and stored in lowercase [1].
