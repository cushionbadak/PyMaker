docs:


coroutine (sock, file, offset=0, count=None, *, fallback=True)Â¶
Send a file using high-performance  if possible.
Return the total number of bytes sent.
Asynchronous version of .
sock must be a non-blocking 
.
file must be a regular file object open in binary mode.
offset tells from where to start reading the file. If specified,
count is the total number of bytes to transmit as opposed to
sending the file until EOF is reached. File position is always updated,
even when this method raises an error, and
 can be used to obtain the actual
number of bytes sent.
fallback, when set to , makes asyncio manually read and send
the file when the platform does not support the sendfile syscall
(e.g. Windows or SSL socket on Unix).
Raise  if the system does not support
sendfile syscall and fallback is .
sock must be a non-blocking socket.

New in version 3.7.
