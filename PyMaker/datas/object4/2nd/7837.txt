(speed=None)¶




Parameters:speed – an integer in the range 0..10 or a speedstring (see below)



Set the turtle’s speed to an integer value in the range 0..10.  If no
argument is given, return current speed.
If input is a number greater than 10 or smaller than 0.5, speed is set
to 0.  Speedstrings are mapped to speedvalues as follows:

“fastest”:  0
“fast”:  10
“normal”:  6
“slow”:  3
“slowest”:  1

Speeds from 1 to 10 enforce increasingly faster animation of line drawing
and turtle turning.
Attention: speed = 0 means that no animation takes
place. forward/back makes turtle jump and likewise left/right make the
turtle turn instantly.
