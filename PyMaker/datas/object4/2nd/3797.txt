(str[, attr])¶

(y, x, str[, attr])
Insert a character string (as many characters as will fit on the line) before
the character under the cursor.  All characters to the right of the cursor are
shifted right, with the rightmost characters on the line being lost.  The cursor
position does not change (after moving to y, x, if specified).
