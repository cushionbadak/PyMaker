docs:


(data)Â¶
Feed the parser some more data.  data should be a bytes-like
object containing one or more lines.  The lines can be partial and the
parser will stitch such partial lines together properly.  The lines can
have any of the three common line endings: carriage return, newline, or
carriage return and newline (they can even be mixed).
