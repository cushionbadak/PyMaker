4.2.3. Builtins and restricted execution¶

CPython implementation detail: Users should not touch ; it is strictly an implementation
detail.  Users wanting to override values in the builtins namespace should
 the  module and modify its
attributes appropriately.

The builtins namespace associated with the execution of a code block
is actually found by looking up the name  in its
global namespace; this should be a dictionary or a module (in the
latter case the module’s dictionary is used).  By default, when in the
 module,  is the built-in module
; when in any other module,  is an
alias for the dictionary of the  module itself.
