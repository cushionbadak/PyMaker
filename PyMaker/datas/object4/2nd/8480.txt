docs:


(typeobj, function)¶
Registers a type-specific method called by  to check
if two objects of exactly the same typeobj (not subclasses) compare
equal.  function must take two positional arguments and a third msg=None
keyword argument just as  does.  It must raise
 when inequality
between the first two parameters is detected – possibly providing useful
information and explaining the inequalities in details in the error
message.

New in version 3.1.
