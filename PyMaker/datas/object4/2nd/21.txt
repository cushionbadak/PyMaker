2.3.2. Reserved classes of identifiers¶
Certain classes of identifiers (besides keywords) have special meanings.  These
classes are identified by the patterns of leading and trailing underscore
characters:


Not imported by .  The special identifier  is used
in the interactive interpreter to store the result of the last evaluation; it is
stored in the  module.  When not in interactive mode, 
has no special meaning and is not defined. See section The import statement.

Note
The name  is often used in conjunction with internationalization;
refer to the documentation for the  module for more
information on this convention.



System-defined names. These names are defined by the interpreter and its
implementation (including the standard library).  Current system names are
discussed in the Special method names section and elsewhere.  More will likely
be defined in future versions of Python.  Any use of  names, in
any context, that does not follow explicitly documented use, is subject to
breakage without warning.

Class-private names.  Names in this category, when used within the context of a
class definition, are re-written to use a mangled form to help avoid name
clashes between “private” attributes of base and derived classes. See section
Identifiers (Names).
