class (_imagedata, _subtype=None, _encoder=email.encoders.encode_base64, *, policy=compat32, **_params)Â¶
Module: 
A subclass of , the
 class is used to create MIME message objects of major type
image. _imagedata is a string containing the raw image data.  If
this data can be decoded by the standard Python module , then the
subtype will be automatically included in the Content-Type header.
Otherwise you can explicitly specify the image subtype via the _subtype
argument.  If the minor type could not be guessed and _subtype was not given,
then  is raised.
Optional _encoder is a callable (i.e. function) which will perform the actual
encoding of the image data for transport.  This callable takes one argument,
which is the  instance. It should use
 and
 to change the payload to encoded
form.  It should also add
any Content-Transfer-Encoding or other headers to the message
object as necessary.  The default encoding is base64.  See the
 module for a list of the built-in encoders.
Optional policy argument defaults to .
_params are passed straight through to the 
constructor.

Changed in version 3.6: Added policy keyword-only parameter.
