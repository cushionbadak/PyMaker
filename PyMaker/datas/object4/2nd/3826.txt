docs:


(delay)Â¶
Set blocking or non-blocking read behavior for the window.  If delay is
negative, blocking read is used (which will wait indefinitely for input).  If
delay is zero, then non-blocking read is used, and  will
return  if no input is waiting.  If delay is positive, then
 will block for delay milliseconds, and return  if there is
still no input at the end of that time.
