docs:


(length)Â¶
Return the total length, without trailing padding, of an ancillary
data item with associated data of the given length.  This value
can often be used as the buffer size for  to
receive a single item of ancillary data, but RFC 3542 requires
portable applications to use  and thus include
space for padding, even when the item will be the last in the
buffer.  Raises  if length is outside the
permissible range of values.
Availability: most Unix platforms, possibly others.

New in version 3.3.
