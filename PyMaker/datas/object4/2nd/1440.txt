docs:


(object, stream=None, indent=1, width=80, depth=None, *, compact=False)Â¶
Prints the formatted representation of object on stream, followed by a
newline.  If stream is ,  is used.  This may be used
in the interactive interpreter instead of the  function for
inspecting values (you can even reassign  for use
within a scope).  indent, width, depth and compact will be passed
to the  constructor as formatting parameters.

Changed in version 3.4: Added the compact parameter.
