(callable, *, follow_wrapped=True)Â¶
Return a  object for the given :


Accepts a wide range of Python callables, from plain functions and classes to
 objects.
Raises  if no signature can be provided, and
 if that type of object is not supported.
A slash(/) in the signature of a function denotes that the parameters prior
to it are positional-only. For more info, see
the FAQ entry on positional-only parameters.

New in version 3.5:  parameter. Pass  to get a signature of
 specifically ( will not be used to
unwrap decorated callables.)


Note
Some callables may not be introspectable in certain implementations of
Python.  For example, in CPython, some built-in functions defined in
C provide no metadata about their arguments.
