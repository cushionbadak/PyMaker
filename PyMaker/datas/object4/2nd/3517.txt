docs:


(record)¶
Applies this handler’s filters to the record and returns a true value if the
record is to be processed. The filters are consulted in turn, until one of
them returns a false value. If none of them return a false value, the record
will be emitted. If one returns a false value, the handler will not emit the
record.
