docs:


(prefixlen_diff=1, new_prefix=None)Â¶
The subnets that join to make the current network definition, depending
on the argument values.  prefixlen_diff is the amount our prefix
length should be increased by.  new_prefix is the desired new
prefix of the subnets; it must be larger than our prefix.  One and
only one of prefixlen_diff and new_prefix must be set.  Returns an
iterator of network objects.
