¶
The module’s  attribute must be set.  Its value must
be a string, but it can be the same value as its .  When
the module is a package, its  value should be set to
its .  When the module is not a package, 
should be set to the empty string for top-level modules, or for
submodules, to the parent package’s name.  See PEP 366 for further

relative imports for main modules, as defined in PEP 366. It is
expected to have the same value as .
