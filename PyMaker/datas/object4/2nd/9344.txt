(exit)¶
Adds a context manager’s  method to the callback stack.
As  is not invoked, this method can be used to cover
part of an  implementation with a context manager’s own
 method.
If passed an object that is not a context manager, this method assumes
it is a callback with the same signature as a context manager’s
 method and adds it directly to the callback stack.
By returning true values, these callbacks can suppress exceptions the
same way context manager  methods can.
The passed in object is returned from the function, allowing this
method to be used as a function decorator.
