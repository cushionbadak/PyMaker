SHAKE variable length digests¶
The  and  algorithms provide variable
length digests with length_in_bits//2 up to 128 or 256 bits of security.
As such, their digest methods require a length. Maximum length is not limited
by the SHAKE algorithm.


(length)¶
Return the digest of the data passed to the  method so far.
This is a bytes object of size length which may contain bytes in
the whole range from 0 to 255.



(length)¶
Like  except the digest is returned as a string object of
double length, containing only hexadecimal digits.  This may be used to
exchange the value safely in email or other non-binary environments.
