(iterable, stop)Â¶

(iterable, start, stop[, step])
Make an iterator that returns selected elements from the iterable. If start is
non-zero, then elements from the iterable are skipped until start is reached.
Afterward, elements are returned consecutively unless step is set higher than
one which results in items being skipped.  If stop is , then iteration
continues until the iterator is exhausted, if at all; otherwise, it stops at the
specified position.  Unlike regular slicing,  does not support
negative values for start, stop, or step.  Can be used to extract related
fields from data where the internal structure has been flattened (for example, a
multi-line report may list a name field on every third line).  Roughly equivalent to:


If start is , then iteration starts at zero. If step is ,
then the step defaults to one.
