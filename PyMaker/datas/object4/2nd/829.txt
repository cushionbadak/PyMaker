docs:


(word, possibilities, n=3, cutoff=0.6)¶
Return a list of the best “good enough” matches.  word is a sequence for which
close matches are desired (typically a string), and possibilities is a list of
sequences against which to match word (typically a list of strings).
Optional argument n (default ) is the maximum number of close matches to
return; n must be greater than .
Optional argument cutoff (default ) is a float in the range [0, 1].
Possibilities that don’t score at least that similar to word are ignored.
The best (no more than n) matches among the possibilities are returned in a
list, sorted by similarity score, most similar first.
