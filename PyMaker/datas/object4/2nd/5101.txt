(mode='r', buffering=None, *, encoding=None, errors=None, newline=None)¶
Return a file object associated with the socket.  The exact returned
type depends on the arguments given to .  These arguments are
interpreted the same way as by the built-in  function, except
the only supported mode values are  (default),  and .
The socket must be in blocking mode; it can have a timeout, but the file
object’s internal buffer may end up in an inconsistent state if a timeout
occurs.
Closing the file object returned by  won’t close the
original socket unless all other file objects have been closed and
 has been called on the socket object.

Note
On Windows, the file-like object created by  cannot be
used where a file object with a file descriptor is expected, such as the
stream arguments of .
