docs:


(generator)¶
Get the mapping of live local variables in generator to their current
values.  A dictionary is returned that maps from variable names to values.
This is the equivalent of calling  in the body of the
generator, and all the same caveats apply.
If generator is a generator with no currently associated frame,
then an empty dictionary is returned.   is raised if
generator is not a Python generator object.

CPython implementation detail: This function relies on the generator exposing a Python stack frame
for introspection, which isn’t guaranteed to be the case in all
implementations of Python. In such cases, this function will always
return an empty dictionary.


New in version 3.3.
