Others¶
While  is part of the  module, it would be very
simple to implement independently:


This demonstrates how similar derived enumerations can be defined; for example
a  that mixes in  instead of .
Some rules:

When subclassing , mix-in types must appear before
 itself in the sequence of bases, as in the 
example above.
While  can have members of any type, once you mix in an
additional type, all the members must have values of that type, e.g.
 above.  This restriction does not apply to mix-ins which only
add methods and don’t specify another data type such as  or
.
When another data type is mixed in, the  attribute is not the
same as the enum member itself, although it is equivalent and will compare
equal.
%-style formatting:  %s and %r call the  class’s
 and  respectively; other codes (such as
%i or %h for IntEnum) treat the enum member as its mixed-in type.
Formatted string literals, ,
and  will use the mixed-in
type’s .  If the  class’s  or
 is desired, use the !s or !r format codes.
