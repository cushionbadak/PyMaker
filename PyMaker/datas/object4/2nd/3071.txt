docs:


(path, mode=0o666, *, dir_fd=None)¶
Create a FIFO (a named pipe) named path with numeric mode mode.
The current umask value is first masked out from the mode.
This function can also support paths relative to directory descriptors.
FIFOs are pipes that can be accessed like regular files.  FIFOs exist until they
are deleted (for example with ). Generally, FIFOs are used as
rendezvous between “client” and “server” type processes: the server opens the
FIFO for reading, and the client opens it for writing.  Note that 
doesn’t open the FIFO — it just creates the rendezvous point.
Availability: Unix.

New in version 3.3: The dir_fd argument.


Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a path-like object.
