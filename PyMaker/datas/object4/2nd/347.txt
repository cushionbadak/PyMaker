(*objects, sep=' ', end='\n', file=sys.stdout, flush=False)Â¶
Print objects to the text stream file, separated by sep and followed
by end.  sep, end, file and flush, if present, must be given as keyword
arguments.
All non-keyword arguments are converted to strings like  does and
written to the stream, separated by sep and followed by end.  Both sep
and end must be strings; they can also be , which means to use the
default values.  If no objects are given,  will just write
end.
The file argument must be an object with a  method; if it
is not present or ,  will be used.  Since printed
arguments are converted to text strings,  cannot be used with
binary mode file objects.  For these, use  instead.
Whether output is buffered is usually determined by file, but if the
flush keyword argument is true, the stream is forcibly flushed.

Changed in version 3.3: Added the flush keyword argument.
