docs:


()Â¶
Return a list of the names of all user-defined labels used in the mailbox.

Note
The actual messages are inspected to determine which labels exist in
the mailbox rather than consulting the list of labels in the Babyl
options section, but the Babyl section is updated whenever the mailbox
is modified.
