6.3.2. Subscriptions¶
A subscription selects an item of a sequence (string, tuple or list) or mapping
(dictionary) object:

The primary must evaluate to an object that supports subscription (lists or
dictionaries for example).  User-defined objects can support subscription by
defining a  method.
For built-in objects, there are two types of objects that support subscription:
If the primary is a mapping, the expression list must evaluate to an object
whose value is one of the keys of the mapping, and the subscription selects the
value in the mapping that corresponds to that key.  (The expression list is a
tuple except if it has exactly one item.)
If the primary is a sequence, the expression list must evaluate to an integer
or a slice (as discussed in the following section).
The formal syntax makes no special provision for negative indices in
sequences; however, built-in sequences all provide a 
method that interprets negative indices by adding the length of the sequence
to the index (so that  selects the last item of ).  The
resulting value must be a nonnegative integer less than the number of items in
the sequence, and the subscription selects the item whose index is that value
(counting from zero). Since the support for negative indices and slicing
occurs in the object’s  method, subclasses overriding
this method will need to explicitly add that support.
A string’s items are characters.  A character is not a separate data type but a
string of exactly one character.
