(encoding)¶
Looks up the codec info in the Python codec registry and returns a
 object as defined below.
Encodings are first looked up in the registry’s cache. If not found, the list of
registered search functions is scanned. If no  object is
found, a  is raised. Otherwise, the  object
is stored in the cache and returned to the caller.
