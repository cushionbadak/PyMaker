(n)Â¶
Read n uncompressed bytes without advancing the file position.
At most one single read on the compressed stream is done to satisfy
the call.  The number of bytes returned may be more or less than
requested.

Note
While calling  does not change the file position of
the , it may change the position of the underlying
file object (e.g. if the  was constructed with the
fileobj parameter).


New in version 3.2.
