Using  efficiently¶

Using shortcut methods¶
Using the nonstandard ,  and
 methods of the  object, your code can
be written more concisely because you don’t have to create the (often
superfluous)  objects explicitly. Instead, the 
objects are created implicitly and these shortcut methods return the cursor
objects. This way, you can execute a  statement and iterate over it
directly using only a single call on the  object.




Accessing columns by name instead of by index¶
One useful feature of the  module is the built-in
 class designed to be used as a row factory.
Rows wrapped with this class can be accessed both by index (like tuples) and
case-insensitively by name:

Connection objects can be used as context managers
that automatically commit or rollback transactions.  In the event of an
exception, the transaction is rolled back; otherwise, the transaction is
committed:
