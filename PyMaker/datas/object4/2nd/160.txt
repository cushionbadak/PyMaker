(type[, value[, traceback]])Â¶
Raises the specified exception in the coroutine.  This method delegates
to the  method of the iterator that caused
the coroutine to suspend, if it has such a method.  Otherwise,
the exception is raised at the suspension point.  The result
(return value, , or other exception) is the same as
when iterating over the  return value, described
above.  If the exception is not caught in the coroutine, it propagates
back to the caller.
