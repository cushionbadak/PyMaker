(message)Â¶

(priority, message)
Send the string message to the system logger.  A trailing newline is added
if necessary.  Each message is tagged with a priority composed of a
facility and a level.  The optional priority argument, which defaults
to , determines the message priority.  If the facility is
not encoded in priority using logical-or (), the
value given in the  call is used.
If  has not been called prior to the call to ,
 will be called with no arguments.
