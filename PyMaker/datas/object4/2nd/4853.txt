Examples¶
Note that all examples in this section purposefully show how
to use the low-level event loop APIs, such as 
and .  Modern asyncio applications rarely
need to be written this way; consider using the high-level functions
like .

Hello World with call_soon()¶
An example using the  method to schedule a
callback. The callback displays  and then stops the
event loop:

A similar Hello World
example created with a coroutine and the  function.



Display the current date with call_later()¶
An example of a callback displaying the current date every second. The
callback uses the  method to reschedule itself
after 5 seconds, and then stops the event loop:

created with a coroutine and the  function.



Watch a file descriptor for read events¶
Wait until a file descriptor received some data using the
 method and then close the event loop:

using transports, protocols, and the
 method.
Another similar example
using the high-level  function
and streams.




Set signal handlers for SIGINT and SIGTERM¶
(This  example only works on Unix.)
Register handlers for signals  and 
using the  method:
