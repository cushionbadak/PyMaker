Types and members¶
The  function retrieves the members of an object such as a
class or module. The functions whose names begin with “is” are mainly
provided as convenient choices for the second argument to .
They also help you determine when you can expect to find the following special
attributes:

Changed in version 3.5: Add  and  attributes to generators.
The  attribute of generators is now set from the function
name, instead of the code name, and it can now be modified.


Changed in version 3.7: Add  attribute to coroutines.



(object[, predicate])¶
Return all the members of an object in a list of (name, value) pairs sorted by
name.  If the optional predicate argument is supplied, only members for which
the predicate returns a true value are included.

Note
 will only return class attributes defined in the
metaclass when the argument is a class and those attributes have been
listed in the metaclass’ custom .




(path)¶
Return the name of the module named by the file path, without including the
names of enclosing packages. The file extension is checked against all of
the entries in . If it matches,
the final path component is returned with the extension removed.
Otherwise,  is returned.
Note that this function only returns a meaningful name for actual
Python modules - paths that potentially refer to Python packages will
still return .

Changed in version 3.3: The function is based directly on .




(object)¶
Return true if the object is a module.



(object)¶
Return true if the object is a class, whether built-in or created in Python
code.



(object)¶
Return true if the object is a bound method written in Python.



(object)¶
Return true if the object is a Python function, which includes functions
created by a lambda expression.



(object)¶
Return true if the object is a Python generator function.



(object)¶
Return true if the object is a generator.



(object)¶
Return true if the object is a coroutine function
(a function defined with an  syntax).

New in version 3.5.




(object)¶
Return true if the object is a coroutine created by an
 function.

New in version 3.5.




(object)¶
Return true if the object can be used in  expression.
Can also be used to distinguish generator-based coroutines from regular
generators:



New in version 3.5.




(object)¶
Return true if the object is an asynchronous generator function,
for example:



New in version 3.6.




(object)¶
Return true if the object is an asynchronous generator iterator
created by an asynchronous generator function.

New in version 3.6.




(object)¶
Return true if the object is a traceback.



(object)¶
Return true if the object is a frame.



(object)¶
Return true if the object is a code.



(object)¶
Return true if the object is a built-in function or a bound built-in method.



(object)¶
Return true if the object is a user-defined or built-in function or method.



(object)¶
Return true if the object is an abstract base class.



(object)¶
Return true if the object is a method descriptor, but not if
, ,  or 
are true.
This, for example, is true of .  An object passing this test
has a  method but not a 
method, but beyond that the set of attributes varies.  A
 attribute is usually
sensible, and  often is.
Methods implemented via descriptors that also pass one of the other tests
return false from the  test, simply because the
other tests promise more – you can, e.g., count on having the
 attribute (etc) when an object passes .



(object)¶
Return true if the object is a data descriptor.
Data descriptors have both a  and a  method.
Examples are properties (defined in Python), getsets, and members.  The
latter two are defined in C and there are more specific tests available for
those types, which is robust across Python implementations.  Typically, data
descriptors will also have  and  attributes
(properties, getsets, and members have both of these attributes), but this is
not guaranteed.



(object)¶
Return true if the object is a getset descriptor.

CPython implementation detail: getsets are attributes defined in extension modules via
 structures.  For Python implementations without such
types, this method will always return .




(object)¶
Return true if the object is a member descriptor.

CPython implementation detail: Member descriptors are attributes defined in extension modules via
 structures.  For Python implementations without such
types, this method will always return .
