class (message=None)¶
A message with Maildir-specific behaviors. Parameter message has the same
meaning as with the  constructor.
Typically, a mail user agent application moves all of the messages in the
 subdirectory to the  subdirectory after the first time
the user opens and closes the mailbox, recording that the messages are old
whether or not they’ve actually been read. Each message in  has an
“info” section added to its file name to store information about its state.
(Some mail readers may also add an “info” section to messages in
.)  The “info” section may take one of two forms: it may contain
“2,” followed by a list of standardized flags (e.g., “2,FR”) or it may
contain “1,” followed by so-called experimental information. Standard flags
for Maildir messages are as follows:







Flag
Meaning
Explanation



D
Draft
Under composition

F
Flagged
Marked as important

P
Passed
Forwarded, resent, or bounced

R
Replied
Replied to

S
Seen
Read

T
Trashed
Marked for subsequent deletion



 instances offer the following methods:


()¶
Return either “new” (if the message should be stored in the 
subdirectory) or “cur” (if the message should be stored in the 
subdirectory).

Note
A message is typically moved from  to  after its
mailbox has been accessed, whether or not the message is has been
read. A message  has been read if  is
.




(subdir)¶
Set the subdirectory the message should be stored in. Parameter subdir
must be either “new” or “cur”.



()¶
Return a string specifying the flags that are currently set. If the
message complies with the standard Maildir format, the result is the
concatenation in alphabetical order of zero or one occurrence of each of
, , , , , and . The empty string
is returned if no flags are set or if “info” contains experimental
semantics.



(flags)¶
Set the flags specified by flags and unset all others.



(flag)¶
Set the flag(s) specified by flag without changing other flags. To add
more than one flag at a time, flag may be a string of more than one
character. The current “info” is overwritten whether or not it contains
experimental information rather than flags.



(flag)¶
Unset the flag(s) specified by flag without changing other flags. To
remove more than one flag at a time, flag maybe a string of more than
one character.  If “info” contains experimental information rather than
flags, the current “info” is not modified.



()¶
Return the delivery date of the message as a floating-point number
representing seconds since the epoch.



(date)¶
Set the delivery date of the message to date, a floating-point number
representing seconds since the epoch.



()¶
Return a string containing the “info” for a message. This is useful for
accessing and modifying “info” that is experimental (i.e., not a list of
flags).



(info)¶
Set “info” to info, which should be a string.


When a  instance is created based upon an
 or  instance, the Status
and X-Status headers are omitted and the following conversions
take place:






Resulting state
 or 
state



“cur” subdirectory
O flag

F flag
F flag

R flag
A flag

S flag
R flag

T flag
D flag



When a  instance is created based upon an
 instance, the following conversions take place:






Resulting state
 state



“cur” subdirectory
“unseen” sequence

“cur” subdirectory and S flag
no “unseen” sequence

F flag
“flagged” sequence

R flag
“replied” sequence



When a  instance is created based upon a
 instance, the following conversions take place:






Resulting state
 state



“cur” subdirectory
“unseen” label

“cur” subdirectory and S flag
no “unseen” label

P flag
“forwarded” or “resent” label

R flag
“answered” label

T flag
“deleted” label
