docs:


(readline)Â¶
The  function is used to detect the encoding that
should be used to decode a Python source file. It requires one argument,
readline, in the same way as the  generator.
It will call readline a maximum of twice, and return the encoding used
(as a string) and a list of any lines (not decoded from bytes) it has read
in.
It detects the encoding from the presence of a UTF-8 BOM or an encoding
cookie as specified in PEP 263. If both a BOM and a cookie are present,
but disagree, a  will be raised. Note that if the BOM is found,
 will be returned as an encoding.
If no encoding is specified, then the default of  will be
returned.
Use  to open Python source files: it uses
 to detect the file encoding.
