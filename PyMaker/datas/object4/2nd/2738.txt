(section, option, *, raw=False, vars=None[, fallback])Â¶
Get an option value for the named section.  If vars is provided, it
must be a dictionary.  The option is looked up in vars (if provided),
section, and in DEFAULTSECT in that order.  If the key is not found
and fallback is provided, it is used as a fallback value.   can
be provided as a fallback value.
All the  interpolations are expanded in the return values, unless
the raw argument is true.  Values for interpolation keys are looked up
in the same manner as the option.

Changed in version 3.2: Arguments raw, vars and fallback are keyword only to protect
users from trying to use the third argument as the fallback fallback
(especially when using the mapping protocol).
