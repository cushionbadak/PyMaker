ExamplesÂ¶

Note
All examples assume a native byte order, size, and alignment with a
big-endian machine.

A basic example of packing/unpacking three integers:


Unpacked fields can be named by assigning them to variables or by wrapping
the result in a named tuple:


The ordering of format characters may have an impact on size since the padding
needed to satisfy alignment requirements is different:


The following format  specifies two pad bytes at the end, assuming
longs are aligned on 4-byte boundaries:


This only works when native size and alignment are in effect; standard size and
alignment does not enforce any alignment.
