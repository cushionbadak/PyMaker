HTTPResponse Objects¶
An  instance wraps the HTTP response from the
server.  It provides access to the request headers and the entity
body.  The response is an iterable object and can be used in a with
statement.

Changed in version 3.5: The  interface is now implemented and
all of its reader operations are supported.



([amt])¶
Reads and returns the response body, or up to the next amt bytes.



(b)¶
Reads up to the next len(b) bytes of the response body into the buffer b.
Returns the number of bytes read.

New in version 3.3.




(name, default=None)¶
Return the value of the header name, or default if there is no header
matching name.  If there is more than one  header with the name name,
return all of the values joined by ‘, ‘.  If ‘default’ is any iterable other
than a single string, its elements are similarly returned joined by commas.

Return a list of (header, value) tuples.
