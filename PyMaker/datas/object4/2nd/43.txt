(self)¶
Called by the  built-in function to compute the “official” string
representation of an object.  If at all possible, this should look like a
valid Python expression that could be used to recreate an object with the
same value (given an appropriate environment).  If this is not possible, a
string of the form  should be returned.
The return value must be a string object. If a class defines 
but not , then  is also used when an
“informal” string representation of instances of that class is required.
This is typically used for debugging, so it is important that the representation
is information-rich and unambiguous.
