docs:


(limit)Â¶
Set the maximum depth of the Python interpreter stack to limit.  This limit
prevents infinite recursion from causing an overflow of the C stack and crashing
Python.
The highest possible limit is platform-dependent.  A user may need to set the
limit higher when they have a program that requires deep recursion and a platform
that supports a higher limit.  This should be done with care, because a too-high
limit can lead to a crash.
If the new limit is too low at the current recursion depth, a
 exception is raised.

Changed in version 3.5.1: A  exception is now raised if the new limit is too
low at the current recursion depth.
