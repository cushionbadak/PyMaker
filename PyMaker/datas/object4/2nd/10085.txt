¶
Cleans up the stack when a  statement block exits.  TOS is the
context manager’s  bound method. Below TOS are 1–3 values
indicating how/why the finally clause was entered:

SECOND = 
(SECOND, THIRD) = (), retval
SECOND = ; no retval below it
(SECOND, THIRD, FOURTH) = exc_info()

In the last case,  is called, otherwise
.  Pushes SECOND and result of the call
to the stack.
