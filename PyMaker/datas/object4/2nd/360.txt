(*iterables)¶
Make an iterator that aggregates elements from each of the iterables.
Returns an iterator of tuples, where the i-th tuple contains
the i-th element from each of the argument sequences or iterables.  The
iterator stops when the shortest input iterable is exhausted. With a single
iterable argument, it returns an iterator of 1-tuples.  With no arguments,
it returns an empty iterator.  Equivalent to:


The left-to-right evaluation order of the iterables is guaranteed. This
makes possible an idiom for clustering a data series into n-length groups
using .  This repeats the same iterator  times
so that each output tuple has the result of  calls to the iterator.
This has the effect of dividing the input into n-length chunks.
 should only be used with unequal length inputs when you don’t
care about trailing, unmatched values from the longer iterables.  If those
values are important, use  instead.
 in conjunction with the  operator can be used to unzip a
list:
