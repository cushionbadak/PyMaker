(fd, mode, nbytes)Â¶
Lock part of a file based on file descriptor fd from the C runtime.  Raises
 on failure.  The locked region of the file extends from the
current file position for nbytes bytes, and may continue beyond the end of the
file.  mode must be one of the  constants listed below. Multiple
regions in a file may be locked at the same time, but may not overlap.  Adjacent
regions are not merged; they must be unlocked individually.
