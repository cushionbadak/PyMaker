6.3.3. SlicingsÂ¶
A slicing selects a range of items in a sequence object (e.g., a string, tuple
or list).  Slicings may be used as expressions or as targets in assignment or
 statements.  The syntax for a slicing:

There is ambiguity in the formal syntax here: anything that looks like an
expression list also looks like a slice list, so any subscription can be
interpreted as a slicing.  Rather than further complicating the syntax, this is
disambiguated by defining that in this case the interpretation as a subscription
takes priority over the interpretation as a slicing (this is the case if the
slice list contains no proper slice).
The semantics for a slicing are as follows.  The primary is indexed (using the
same  method as
normal subscription) with a key that is constructed from the slice list, as
follows.  If the slice list contains at least one comma, the key is a tuple
containing the conversion of the slice items; otherwise, the conversion of the
lone slice item is the key.  The conversion of a slice item that is an
expression is that expression.  The conversion of a proper slice is a slice
object (see section The standard type hierarchy) whose ,
 and  attributes are the values of the
expressions given as lower bound, upper bound and stride, respectively,
substituting  for missing expressions.
