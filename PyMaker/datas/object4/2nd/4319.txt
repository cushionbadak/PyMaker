()Â¶
Release a lock, decrementing the recursion level.  If after the
decrement the recursion level is zero, reset the lock to unlocked (not
owned by any process or thread) and if any other processes or threads
are blocked waiting for the lock to become unlocked, allow exactly one
of them to proceed.  If after the decrement the recursion level is still
nonzero, the lock remains locked and owned by the calling process or
thread.
Only call this method when the calling process or thread owns the lock.
An  is raised if this method is called by a process
or thread other than the owner or if the lock is in an unlocked (unowned)
state.  Note that the type of exception raised in this situation
differs from the implemented behavior in .
