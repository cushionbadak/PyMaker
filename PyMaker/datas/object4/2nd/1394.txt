docs:


(name, bases=(), kwds=None, exec_body=None)Â¶
Creates a class object dynamically using the appropriate metaclass.
The first three arguments are the components that make up a class
definition header: the class name, the base classes (in order), the
keyword arguments (such as ).
The exec_body argument is a callback that is used to populate the
freshly created class namespace. It should accept the class namespace
as its sole argument and update the namespace directly with the class
contents. If no callback is provided, it has the same effect as passing
in .

New in version 3.3.
