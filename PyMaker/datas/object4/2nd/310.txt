docs:


(object)Â¶
Return  if the object argument appears callable,
 if not.  If this returns true, it is still possible that a
call fails, but if it is false, calling object will never succeed.
Note that classes are callable (calling a class returns a new instance);
instances are callable if their class has a  method.

New in version 3.2: This function was first removed in Python 3.0 and then brought back
in Python 3.2.
