Additional notesÂ¶
Here are some notes on the parsing semantics:

Most non-multipart type messages are parsed as a single message
object with a string payload.  These objects will return  for
, and
 will yield an empty list.
All multipart type messages will be parsed as a container message
object with a list of sub-message objects for their payload.  The outer
container message will return  for
, and
 will yield a list of subparts.
Most messages with a content type of message/* (such as
message/delivery-status and message/rfc822) will also
be parsed as container object containing a list payload of length 1.  Their
 method will return .
The single element yielded by 
will be a sub-message object.
Some non-standards-compliant messages may not be internally consistent about
their multipart-edness.  Such messages may have a
Content-Type header of type multipart, but their
 method may return .
If such messages were parsed with the ,
they will have an instance of the
 class in their
defects attribute list.  See  for details.
