docs:


(thread_id, signalnum)Â¶
Send the signal signalnum to the thread thread_id, another thread in the
same process as the caller.  The target thread can be executing any code
(Python or not).  However, if the target thread is executing the Python
interpreter, the Python signal handlers will be executed by the main
thread.  Therefore, the only point of sending a
signal to a particular Python thread would be to force a running system call
to fail with .
Use  or the 
attribute of  objects to get a suitable value
for thread_id.
If signalnum is 0, then no signal is sent, but error checking is still
performed; this can be used to check if the target thread is still running.
Availability: Unix (see the man page pthread_kill(3) for further
information).

New in version 3.3.
