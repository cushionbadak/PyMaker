(fd, str)¶
Write the bytestring in str to file descriptor fd.
Return the number of bytes actually written.

Note

descriptor as returned by  or .  To write a “file
object” returned by the built-in function  or by  or
, or  or , use its
 method.


Changed in version 3.5: If the system call is interrupted and the signal handler does not raise an
exception, the function now retries the system call instead of raising an
 exception (see PEP 475 for the rationale).
