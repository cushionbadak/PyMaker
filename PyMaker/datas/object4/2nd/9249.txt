docs:


(depth)Â¶
Allows enabling or disabling coroutine origin tracking. When
enabled, the  attribute on coroutine objects will
contain a tuple of (filename, line number, function name) tuples
describing the traceback where the coroutine object was created,
with the most recent call first. When disabled,  will
be None.
To enable, pass a depth value greater than zero; this sets the
number of frames whose information will be captured. To disable,
pass set depth to zero.
This setting is thread-specific.

New in version 3.7.


Note
This function has been added on a provisional basis (see PEP 411
for details.)  Use it only for debugging purposes.
