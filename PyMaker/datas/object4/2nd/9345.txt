docs:


(callback, *args, **kwds)Â¶
Accepts an arbitrary callback function and arguments and adds it to
the callback stack.
Unlike the other methods, callbacks added this way cannot suppress
exceptions (as they are never passed the exception details).
The passed in callback is returned from the function, allowing this
method to be used as a function decorator.
