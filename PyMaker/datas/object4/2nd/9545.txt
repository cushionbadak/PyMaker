Readline configurationÂ¶
On systems that support , this module will also import and
configure the  module, if Python is started in
interactive mode and without the  option.
The default behavior is enable tab-completion and to use
 as the history save file.  To disable it, delete (or
override) the  attribute in your
 or  module or your
 file.

Changed in version 3.4: Activation of rlcompleter and history was made automatic.
