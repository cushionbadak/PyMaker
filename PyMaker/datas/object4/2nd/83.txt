3.3.5. Emulating generic types¶
One can implement the generic class syntax as specified by PEP 484
(for example ) by defining a special method:


classmethod (cls, key)¶
Return an object representing the specialization of a generic class
by type arguments found in key.

This method is looked up on the class object itself, and when defined in
the class body, this method is implicitly a class method.  Note, this
mechanism is primarily reserved for use with static type hints, other usage
is discouraged.
