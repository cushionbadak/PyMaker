docs:


(data)¶
Write a bytes-like object data to the audio device and return the
number of bytes written.  If the audio device is in blocking mode (the
default), the entire data is always written (again, this is different from
usual Unix device semantics).  If the device is in non-blocking mode, some
data may not be written—see .

Changed in version 3.5: Writable bytes-like object is now accepted.
