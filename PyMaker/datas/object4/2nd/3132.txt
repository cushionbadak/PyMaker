, and it supports .
dirpath, dirnames and filenames are identical to  output,
and dirfd is a file descriptor referring to the directory dirpath.
This function always supports paths relative to directory descriptors and not following symlinks.  Note however
that, unlike other functions, the  default value for
follow_symlinks is .

Note
Since  yields file descriptors, those are only valid until
the next iteration step, so you should duplicate them (e.g. with
) if you want to keep them longer.

This example displays the number of bytes taken by non-directory files in each
directory under the starting directory, except that it doesn’t look under any
CVS subdirectory:


In the next example, walking the tree bottom-up is essential:
 doesn’t allow deleting a directory before the directory is
empty:
