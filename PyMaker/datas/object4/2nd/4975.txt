but some platforms have subtle differences and limitations

All Platforms¶

All event loops on Windows do not support the following methods:

 and

 has the following limitations:

 is used to wait on socket events:
it supports sockets and is limited to 512 sockets.

 has the following limitations:

The  method
is not supported.
The  and 
methods are not supported.

The resolution of the monotonic clock on Windows is usually around 15.6
msec.  The best resolution is 0.5 msec. The resolution depends on the
hardware (availability of HPET) and on the
Windows configuration.

Subprocess Support on Windows¶
 on Windows does not support subproceses.
On Windows,  should be used instead:


The  function is also
not supported, as  has a different mechanism
to watch child processes.



macOS¶
Modern macOS versions are fully supported.
macOS <= 10.8
On macOS 10.6, 10.7 and 10.8, the default event loop
uses , which does not support
character devices on these versions.  The
