6.2.5. List displaysÂ¶
A list display is a possibly empty series of expressions enclosed in square
brackets:

A list display yields a new list object, the contents being specified by either
a list of expressions or a comprehension.  When a comma-separated list of
expressions is supplied, its elements are evaluated from left to right and
placed into the list object in that order.  When a comprehension is supplied,
the list is constructed from the elements resulting from the comprehension.
