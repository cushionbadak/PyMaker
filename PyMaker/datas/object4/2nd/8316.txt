Â¶
The  decorator allows describing functions and methods
that support multiple different combinations of argument types. A series
of -decorated definitions must be followed by exactly one
non--decorated definition (for the same function/method).
The -decorated definitions are for the benefit of the
type checker only, since they will be overwritten by the
non--decorated definition, while the latter is used at
runtime but should be ignored by a type checker.  At runtime, calling
a -decorated function directly will raise
. An example of overload that gives a more
precise type than can be expressed using a union or a type variable:


See PEP 484 for details and comparison with other typing semantics.
