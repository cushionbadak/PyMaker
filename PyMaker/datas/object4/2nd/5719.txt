class (_maintype, _subtype, *, policy=compat32, **_params)¶
Module: 
This is the base class for all the MIME-specific subclasses of
.  Ordinarily you won’t create instances
specifically of , although you could.  
is provided primarily as a convenient base class for more specific
MIME-aware subclasses.
_maintype is the Content-Type major type (e.g. text
or image), and _subtype is the Content-Type minor
type  (e.g. plain or gif).  _params is a parameter
key/value dictionary and is passed directly to .
If policy is specified, (defaults to the
 policy) it will be passed to
.
The  class always adds a Content-Type header
(based on _maintype, _subtype, and _params), and a
MIME-Version header (always set to ).

Changed in version 3.6: Added policy keyword-only parameter.
