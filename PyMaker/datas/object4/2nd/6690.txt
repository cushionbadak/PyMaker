AbstractBasicAuthHandler Objects¶


(authreq, host, req, headers)¶
Handle an authentication request by getting a user/password pair, and re-trying
the request.  authreq should be the name of the header where the information
about the realm is included in the request, host specifies the URL and path to
authenticate for, req should be the (failed)  object, and
headers should be the error headers.
host is either an authority (e.g. ) or a URL containing an
authority component (e.g. ). In either case, the
authority must not contain a userinfo component (so,  and
 are fine,  is not).
