(content)Â¶
Receive notification of character data.
The Parser will call this method to report each chunk of character data. SAX
parsers may return all contiguous character data in a single chunk, or they may
split it into several chunks; however, all of the characters in any single event
must come from the same external entity so that the Locator provides useful
information.
content may be a string or bytes instance; the  reader module
always produces strings.

Note
The earlier SAX 1 interface provided by the Python XML Special Interest Group
used a more Java-like interface for this method.  Since most parsers used from
Python did not take advantage of the older interface, the simpler signature was
chosen to replace it.  To convert old code to the new interface, use content
instead of slicing content with the old offset and length parameters.
