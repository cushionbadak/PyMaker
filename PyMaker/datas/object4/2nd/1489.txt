Restricted Enum subclassingÂ¶
A new  class must have one base Enum class, up to one concrete
data type, and as many -based mixin classes as needed.  The
order of these base classes is:


Also, subclassing an enumeration is allowed only if the enumeration does not define
any members.  So this is forbidden:


But this is allowed:


Allowing subclassing of enums that define members would lead to a violation of
some important invariants of types and instances.  On the other hand, it makes
sense to allow sharing some common behavior between a group of enumerations.
(See OrderedEnum for an example.)
