docs:


(path)Â¶
Return  if path refers to an existing path or an open
file descriptor.  Returns  for broken symbolic links.  On
some platforms, this function may return  if permission is
not granted to execute  on the requested file, even
if the path physically exists.

Changed in version 3.3: path can now be an integer:  is returned if it is an
 open file descriptor,  otherwise.


Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a path-like object.
