docs:


(locale)Â¶
Allow an application to set the locale for errors and warnings.
SAX parsers are not required to provide localization for errors and warnings; if
they cannot support the requested locale, however, they must raise a SAX
exception.  Applications may request a locale change in the middle of a parse.
