(object[, sentinel])Â¶
Return an iterator object.  The first argument is interpreted very
differently depending on the presence of the second argument. Without a
second argument, object must be a collection object which supports the
iteration protocol (the  method), or it must support the
sequence protocol (the  method with integer arguments
starting at ).  If it does not support either of those protocols,
 is raised. If the second argument, sentinel, is given,
then object must be a callable object.  The iterator created in this case
will call object with no arguments for each call to its
 method; if the value returned is equal to
sentinel,  will be raised, otherwise the value will
be returned.
See also Iterator Types.
One useful application of the second form of  is to build a
block-reader. For example, reading fixed-width blocks from a binary
database file until the end of file is reached:
