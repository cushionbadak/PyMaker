(newScheme, newFontSet[, newScmPrio])Â¶
Resets the scheme and fontset of the Tix application to newScheme and
newFontSet, respectively.  This affects only those widgets created after this
call.  Therefore, it is best to call the resetoptions method before the creation
of any widgets in a Tix application.
The optional parameter newScmPrio can be given to reset the priority level of
the Tk options set by the Tix schemes.
Because of the way Tk handles the X option database, after Tix has been has
imported and inited, it is not possible to reset the color schemes and font sets
using the  method. Instead, the 
method must be used.
