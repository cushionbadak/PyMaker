(host='', port=0, timeout=None, source_address=None)Â¶
Connect to the given host and port.  The default port number is , as
specified by the FTP protocol specification.  It is rarely needed to specify a
different port number.  This function should be called only once for each
instance; it should not be called at all if a host was given when the instance
was created.  All other methods can only be used after a connection has been
made.
The optional timeout parameter specifies a timeout in seconds for the
connection attempt. If no timeout is passed, the global default timeout
setting will be used.
source_address is a 2-tuple  for the socket to bind to as
its source address before connecting.

Changed in version 3.3: source_address parameter was added.
