(*, return_value=False, side_effect=False)¶
The reset_mock method resets all the call attributes on a mock object:



Changed in version 3.6: Added two keyword only argument to the reset_mock function.

This can be useful where you want to make a series of assertions that
reuse the same object. Note that  doesn’t clear the
return value,  or any child attributes you have
set using normal assignment by default. In case you want to reset
return_value or , then pass the corresponding
parameter as . Child mocks and the return value mock
(if any) are reset as well.

Note
return_value, and  are keyword only
argument.
