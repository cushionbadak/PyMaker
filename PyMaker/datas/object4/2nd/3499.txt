docs:


(record)¶
Applies this logger’s filters to the record and returns a true value if the
record is to be processed. The filters are consulted in turn, until one of
them returns a false value. If none of them return a false value, the record
will be processed (passed to handlers). If one returns a false value, no
further processing of the record occurs.
