 — Sound-playing interface for Windows¶

The  module provides access to the basic sound-playing machinery
provided by Windows platforms.  It includes functions and several constants.


(frequency, duration)¶
Beep the PC’s speaker. The frequency parameter specifies frequency, in hertz,
of the sound, and must be in the range 37 through 32,767. The duration
parameter specifies the number of milliseconds the sound should last.  If the
system is not able to beep the speaker,  is raised.



(sound, flags)¶
Call the underlying  function from the Platform API.  The
sound parameter may be a filename, a system sound alias, audio data as a
bytes-like object, or .  Its
interpretation depends on the value of flags, which can be a bitwise ORed
combination of the constants described below. If the sound parameter is
, any currently playing waveform sound is stopped. If the system
indicates an error,  is raised.



(type=MB_OK)¶
Call the underlying  function from the Platform API.  This
plays a sound as specified in the registry.  The type argument specifies which
sound to play; possible values are , ,
, , , and , all
described below.  The value  produces a “simple beep”; this is the final
fallback if a sound cannot be played otherwise.  If the system indicates an
error,  is raised.



¶
The sound parameter is the name of a WAV file. Do not use with
.



¶
The sound parameter is a sound association name from the registry.  If the
registry contains no such name, play the system default sound unless
 is also specified. If no default sound is registered,
raise . Do not use with .
All Win32 systems support at least the following; most systems support many
more:






 name
Corresponding Control Panel Sound name




Asterisk


Exclamation


Exit Windows


Critical Stop


Question



For example:





¶
Play the sound repeatedly.  The  flag must also be used to
avoid blocking.  Cannot be used with .



¶
The sound parameter to  is a memory image of a WAV file, as a
bytes-like object.

Note
This module does not support playing from a memory image asynchronously, so a
combination of this flag and  will raise .




¶
Stop playing all instances of the specified sound.

Note
This flag is not supported on modern Windows platforms.




¶
Return immediately, allowing sounds to play asynchronously.



¶
If the specified sound cannot be found, do not play the system default sound.



¶
Do not interrupt sounds currently playing.



¶
Return immediately if the sound driver is busy.

Note
This flag is not supported on modern Windows platforms.
