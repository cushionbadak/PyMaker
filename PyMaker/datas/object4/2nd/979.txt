docs:


(obj, encoding='utf-8', errors='strict')Â¶
Decodes obj using the codec registered for encoding.
Errors may be given to set the desired error handling scheme. The
default error handler is  meaning that decoding errors raise
 (or a more codec specific subclass, such as
). Refer to Codec Base Classes for more
information on codec error handling.
