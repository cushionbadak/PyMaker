Queries on ST Objects¶
Two functions are provided which allow an application to determine if an ST was
created as an expression or a suite.  Neither of these functions can be used to
determine if an ST was created from source code via  or
 or from a parse tree via .


(st)¶
When st represents an  form, this function returns true, otherwise
it returns false.  This is useful, since code objects normally cannot be queried
for this information using existing built-in functions.  Note that the code
objects created by  cannot be queried like this either, and
are identical to those created by the built-in  function.



(st)¶
This function mirrors  in that it reports whether an ST object
represents an  form, commonly known as a “suite.”  It is not safe to
assume that this function is equivalent to , as additional
syntactic fragments may be supported in the future.
