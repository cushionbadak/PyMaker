Certificates¶
Certificates in general are part of a public-key / private-key system.  In this
system, each principal, (which may be a machine, or a person, or an
organization) is assigned a unique two-part encryption key.  One part of the key
is public, and is called the public key; the other part is kept secret, and is
called the private key.  The two parts are related, in that if you encrypt a
message with one of the parts, you can decrypt it with the other part, and
only with the other part.
A certificate contains information about two principals.  It contains the name
of a subject, and the subject’s public key.  It also contains a statement by a
second principal, the issuer, that the subject is who they claim to be, and
that this is indeed the subject’s public key.  The issuer’s statement is signed
with the issuer’s private key, which only the issuer knows.  However, anyone can
verify the issuer’s statement by finding the issuer’s public key, decrypting the
statement with it, and comparing it to the other information in the certificate.
The certificate also contains information about the time period over which it is
valid.  This is expressed as two fields, called “notBefore” and “notAfter”.
In the Python use of certificates, a client or server can use a certificate to
prove who they are.  The other side of a network connection can also be required
to produce a certificate, and that certificate can be validated to the
satisfaction of the client or server that requires such validation.  The
connection attempt can be set to raise an exception if the validation fails.
Validation is done automatically, by the underlying OpenSSL framework; the
application need not concern itself with its mechanics.  But the application
does usually need to provide sets of certificates to allow this process to take
place.
Python uses files to contain certificates.  They should be formatted as “PEM”
(see RFC 1422), which is a base-64 encoded form wrapped with a header line
and a footer line:



Certificate chains¶
The Python files which contain certificates can contain a sequence of
certificates, sometimes called a certificate chain.  This chain should start
with the specific certificate for the principal who “is” the client or server,
and then the certificate for the issuer of that certificate, and then the
certificate for the issuer of that certificate, and so on up the chain till
you get to a certificate which is self-signed, that is, a certificate which
has the same subject and issuer, sometimes called a root certificate.  The
certificates should just be concatenated together in the certificate file.  For
example, suppose we had a three certificate chain, from our server certificate
to the certificate of the certification authority that signed our server
certificate, to the root certificate of the agency which issued the
certification authority’s certificate:




CA certificates¶
If you are going to require validation of the other side of the connection’s
certificate, you need to provide a “CA certs” file, filled with the certificate
chains for each issuer you are willing to trust.  Again, this file just contains
these chains concatenated together.  For validation, Python will use the first
chain it finds in the file which matches.  The platform’s certificates file can
be used by calling , this is done
automatically with .


Combined key and certificate¶
Often the private key is stored in the same file as the certificate; in this
case, only the  parameter to 
and  needs to be passed.  If the private key is stored
with the certificate, it should come before the first certificate in
the certificate chain:




Self-signed certificates¶
If you are going to create a server that provides SSL-encrypted connection
services, you will need to acquire a certificate for that service.  There are
many ways of acquiring appropriate certificates, such as buying one from a
certification authority.  Another common practice is to generate a self-signed
certificate.  The simplest way to do this is with the OpenSSL package, using
something like the following:


The disadvantage of a self-signed certificate is that it is its own root
certificate, and no one else will have it in their cache of known (and trusted)
root certificates.
