docs:


(value, fp, *, fmt=FMT_XML, sort_keys=True, skipkeys=False)Â¶
Write value to a plist file. Fp should be a writable, binary
file object.
The fmt argument specifies the format of the plist file and can be
one of the following values:

: XML formatted plist file
: Binary formatted plist file

When sort_keys is true (the default) the keys for dictionaries will be
written to the plist in sorted order, otherwise they will be written in
the iteration order of the dictionary.
When skipkeys is false (the default) the function raises 
when a key of a dictionary is not a string, otherwise such keys are skipped.
A  will be raised if the object is of an unsupported type or
a container that contains objects of unsupported types.
An  will be raised for integer values that cannot
be represented in (binary) plist files.

New in version 3.4.
