docs:


(type, strict=True)Â¶
Guess the extensions for a file based on its MIME type, given by type. The
return value is a list of strings giving all possible filename extensions,
including the leading dot ().  The extensions are not guaranteed to have
been associated with any particular data stream, but would be mapped to the MIME
type type by .
The optional strict argument has the same meaning as with the  function.
