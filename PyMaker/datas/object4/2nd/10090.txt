(counts)Â¶
Implements assignment with a starred target: Unpacks an iterable in TOS into
individual values, where the total number of values can be smaller than the
number of items in the iterable: one of the new values will be a list of all
leftover items.
The low byte of counts is the number of values before the list value, the
high byte of counts the number of values after it.  The resulting values
are put onto the stack right-to-left.
