(st, filename='<syntax-tree>')Â¶
The Python byte compiler can be invoked on an ST object to produce code objects
which can be used as part of a call to the built-in  or 
functions. This function provides the interface to the compiler, passing the
internal parse tree from st to the parser, using the source file name
specified by the filename parameter. The default value supplied for filename
indicates that the source was an ST object.
Compiling an ST object may result in exceptions related to compilation; an
example would be a  caused by the parse tree for :
this statement is considered legal within the formal grammar for Python but is
not a legal language construct.  The  raised for this
condition is actually generated by the Python byte-compiler normally, which is
why it can be raised at this point by the  module.  Most causes of
compilation failure can be diagnosed programmatically by inspection of the parse
tree.
