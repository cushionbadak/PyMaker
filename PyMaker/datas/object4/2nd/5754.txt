(charset, header_enc=None, body_enc=None, output_charset=None)¶
Add character properties to the global registry.
charset is the input character set, and must be the canonical name of a
character set.
Optional header_enc and body_enc is either  for
quoted-printable,  for base64 encoding,
 for the shortest of quoted-printable or base64 encoding,
or  for no encoding.   is only valid for
header_enc. The default is  for no encoding.
Optional output_charset is the character set that the output should be in.
Conversions will proceed from input charset, to Unicode, to the output charset
when the method  is called.  The default is to output in
the same character set as the input.
Both input_charset and output_charset must have Unicode codec entries in the
module’s character set-to-codec mapping; use  to add codecs the
module does not know about.  See the  module’s documentation for
more information.
The global character set registry is kept in the module global dictionary
.
