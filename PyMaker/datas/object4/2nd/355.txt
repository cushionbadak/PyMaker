¶
Transform a method into a static method.
A static method does not receive an implicit first argument. To declare a static
method, use this idiom:


The  form is a function decorator – see
Function definitions for details.
A static method can be called either on the class (such as ) or on an instance (such
as ).
Static methods in Python are similar to those found in Java or C++. Also see
 for a variant that is useful for creating alternate class
constructors.
Like all decorators, it is also possible to call  as
a regular function and do something with its result.  This is needed
in some cases where you need a reference to a function from a class
body and you want to avoid the automatic transformation to instance
method.  For these cases, use this idiom:


For more information on static methods, see The standard type hierarchy.
