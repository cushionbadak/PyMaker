docs:


(buffers[, ancbufsize[, flags]])Â¶
Receive normal data and ancillary data from the socket, behaving as
 would, but scatter the non-ancillary data into a
series of buffers instead of returning a new bytes object.  The
buffers argument must be an iterable of objects that export
writable buffers (e.g.  objects); these will be
filled with successive chunks of the non-ancillary data until it
has all been written or there are no more buffers.  The operating
system may set a limit ( value )
on the number of buffers that can be used.  The ancbufsize and
flags arguments have the same meaning as for .
The return value is a 4-tuple: , where nbytes is the total number of bytes of
non-ancillary data written into the buffers, and ancdata,
msg_flags and address are the same as for .
