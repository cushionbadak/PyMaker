class (protocol=PROTOCOL_TLS)¶
Create a new SSL context.  You may pass protocol which must be one
of the  constants defined in this module.  The parameter
specifies which version of the SSL protocol to use.  Typically, the
server chooses a particular protocol version, and the client must adapt
to the server’s choice.  Most of the versions are not interoperable
with the other versions.  If not specified, the default is
; it provides the most compatibility with other
versions.
Here’s a table showing which versions in a client (down the side) can connect
to which versions in a server (along the top):

[2](1, 2)  disables SSLv3 with  by default.





[3](1, 2) TLS 1.3 protocol will be available with  in
OpenSSL >= 1.1.1. There is no dedicated PROTOCOL constant for just
TLS 1.3.

Changed in version 3.6: The context is created with secure default values. The options
, ,

and  (except for ) are
set by default. The initial cipher suite list contains only 
ciphers, no  ciphers and no  ciphers (except for
