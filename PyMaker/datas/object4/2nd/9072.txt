Compute differencesÂ¶
Take two snapshots and display the differences:


Example of output before/after running some tests of the Python test suite:


We can see that Python has loaded  of module data (bytecode and
constants), and that this is  more than had been loaded before the
tests, when the previous snapshot was taken. Similarly, the 
module has cached  of Python source code to format tracebacks, all
of it since the previous snapshot.
If the system has little free memory, snapshots can be written on disk using
the  method to analyze the snapshot offline. Then use the
 method reload the snapshot.
