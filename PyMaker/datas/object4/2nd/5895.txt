class (path, factory=None, create=True)¶
A subclass of  for mailboxes in Babyl format. Parameter
factory is a callable object that accepts a file-like message representation
(which behaves as if opened in binary mode) and returns a custom representation.
If factory is ,  is used as the default message
representation. If create is , the mailbox is created if it does not
exist.
Babyl is a single-file mailbox format used by the Rmail mail user agent
included with Emacs. The beginning of a message is indicated by a line
containing the two characters Control-Underscore () and Control-L
(). The end of a message is indicated by the start of the next
message or, in the case of the last message, a line containing a
Control-Underscore () character.
Messages in a Babyl mailbox have two sets of headers, original headers and
so-called visible headers. Visible headers are typically a subset of the
original headers that have been reformatted or abridged to be more
attractive. Each message in a Babyl mailbox also has an accompanying list of
labels, or short strings that record extra information about the
message, and a list of all user-defined labels found in the mailbox is kept
in the Babyl options section.
 instances have all of the methods of  in
addition to the following:


()¶
Return a list of the names of all user-defined labels used in the mailbox.

Note
The actual messages are inspected to determine which labels exist in
the mailbox rather than consulting the list of labels in the Babyl
options section, but the Babyl section is updated whenever the mailbox
is modified.


Some  methods implemented by  deserve special
remarks:


(key)¶
In Babyl mailboxes, the headers of a message are not stored contiguously
with the body of the message. To generate a file-like representation, the
headers and body are copied together into an  instance,
which has an API identical to that of a
file. As a result, the file-like object is truly independent of the
underlying mailbox but does not save memory compared to a string
representation.

Three locking mechanisms are used—dot locking and, if available, the
 and  system calls.
