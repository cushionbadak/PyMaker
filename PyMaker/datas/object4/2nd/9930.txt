(iterable)Â¶
Converts tokens back into Python source code.  The iterable must return
sequences with at least two elements, the token type and the token string.
Any additional sequence elements are ignored.
The reconstructed script is returned as a single string.  The result is
guaranteed to tokenize back to match the input so that the conversion is
lossless and round-trips are assured.  The guarantee applies only to the
token type and token string as the spacing between tokens (column
positions) may change.
It returns bytes, encoded using the  token, which
is the first token sequence output by .
