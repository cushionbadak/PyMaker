class (*args)¶
Abstract base class for arrays.
The recommended way to create concrete array types is by multiplying any
 data type with a positive integer.  Alternatively, you can subclass
this type and define  and  class variables.
Array elements can be read and written using standard
subscript and slice accesses; for slice reads, the resulting object is
not itself an .

A positive integer specifying the number of elements in the array.
Out-of-range subscripts result in an . Will be
returned by .
