docs:


class ([real[, imag]])¶
Return a complex number with the value real + imag*1j or convert a string
or number to a complex number.  If the first parameter is a string, it will
be interpreted as a complex number and the function must be called without a
second parameter.  The second parameter can never be a string. Each argument
may be any numeric type (including complex).  If imag is omitted, it
defaults to zero and the constructor serves as a numeric conversion like
 and .  If both arguments are omitted, returns
.

Note
When converting from a string, the string must not contain whitespace
around the central  or  operator.  For example,
 is fine, but  raises
.

The complex type is described in Numeric Types — int, float, complex.

Changed in version 3.6: Grouping digits with underscores as in code literals is allowed.
