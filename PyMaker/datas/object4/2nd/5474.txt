docs:


(bytes)Â¶
Write the bytes in bytes into memory at the current position of the
file pointer and return the number of bytes written (never less than
, since if the write fails, a  will be
raised).  The file position is updated to point after the bytes that
were written.  If the mmap was created with , then
writing to it will raise a  exception.

Changed in version 3.5: Writable bytes-like object is now accepted.


Changed in version 3.6: The number of bytes written is now returned.
