Other functions¶


()¶
Return the  Python version number as a string.  Similar to
.



()¶
Return a string that identifies the current platform.
This is used mainly to distinguish platform-specific build directories and
platform-specific built distributions.  Typically includes the OS name and
version and the architecture (as supplied by ‘os.uname()’), although the
exact information included depends on the OS; e.g., on Linux, the kernel
version isn’t particularly important.
Examples of returned values:

linux-i586
linux-alpha (?)
solaris-2.6-sun4u

Windows will return one of:

win-amd64 (64bit Windows on AMD64, aka x86_64, Intel64, and EM64T)
win32 (all others - specifically, sys.platform is returned)

Mac OS X can return:

macosx-10.6-ppc
macosx-10.4-ppc64
macosx-10.3-i386
macosx-10.4-fat

For other non-POSIX platforms, currently just returns .



()¶
Return  if the running Python interpreter was built from source and
is being run from its built location, and not from a location resulting from
e.g. running  or installing via a binary installer.



(fp[, vars])¶
Parse a -style file.
fp is a file-like object pointing to the -like file.
A dictionary containing name/value pairs is returned.  If an optional
dictionary is passed in as the second argument, it is used instead of a new
dictionary, and updated with the values read in the file.
