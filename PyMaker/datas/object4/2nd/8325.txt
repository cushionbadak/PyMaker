Â¶
Callable type;  is a function of (int) -> str.
The subscription syntax must always be used with exactly two
values: the argument list and the return type.  The argument list
must be a list of types or an ellipsis; the return type must be
a single type.
There is no syntax to indicate optional or keyword arguments;
such function types are rarely used as callback types.
 (literal ellipsis) can be used to
type hint a callable taking any number of arguments and returning
.  A plain  is equivalent to
, and in turn to
.
