Constants¶

All constants are now  or  collections.

New in version 3.6.




¶
Possible value for , or the 
parameter to .  Except for ,
it is the default mode.  With client-side sockets, just about any
cert is accepted.  Validation errors, such as untrusted or expired cert,
are ignored and do not abort the TLS/SSL handshake.
In server mode, no certificate is requested from the client, so the client
does not send any for client cert authentication.
See the discussion of Security considerations below.



¶
Possible value for , or the 
parameter to .  In client mode, 
has the same meaning as . It is recommended to
use  for client-side sockets instead.
In server mode, a client certificate request is sent to the client.  The
client may either ignore the request or send a certificate in order
perform TLS client cert authentication.  If the client chooses to send
a certificate, it is verified.  Any verification error immediately aborts
the TLS handshake.
Use of this setting requires a valid set of CA certificates to
be passed, either to  or as a
value of the  parameter to .



¶
Possible value for , or the 
parameter to .  In this mode, certificates are
required from the other side of the socket connection; an 
will be raised if no certificate is provided, or if its validation fails.
This mode is not sufficient to verify a certificate in client mode as
it does not match hostnames.   must be
enabled as well to verify the authenticity of a cert.
 uses  and
enables  by default.
With server socket, this mode provides mandatory TLS client cert
authentication.  A client certificate request is sent to the client and
the client must provide a valid and trusted certificate.
Use of this setting requires a valid set of CA certificates to
be passed, either to  or as a
value of the  parameter to .



class ¶
 collection of CERT_* constants.

New in version 3.6.




¶
Possible value for . In this mode, certificate
revocation lists (CRLs) are not checked. By default OpenSSL does neither
require nor verify CRLs.

New in version 3.4.




¶
Possible value for . In this mode, only the
peer cert is check but non of the intermediate CA certificates. The mode
requires a valid CRL that is signed by the peer cert’s issuer (its direct
ancestor CA). If no proper has been loaded
, validation will fail.

New in version 3.4.




¶
Possible value for . In this mode, CRLs of
all certificates in the peer cert chain are checked.

New in version 3.4.




¶
Possible value for  to disable workarounds
for broken X.509 certificates.

New in version 3.4.

prefer trusted certificates when building the trust chain to validate a
certificate. This flag is enabled by default.

New in version 3.4.4.

default.

This protocol is not be available if OpenSSL is compiled with the
 flag.

Warning
SSL version 3 is insecure.  Its use is highly discouraged.

protocol  with flags like  instead.




¶

protocol  with flags like  instead.




¶

New in version 3.4.


Deprecated since version 3.6: OpenSSL has deprecated all version specific protocols. Use the default
protocol  with flags like  instead.




¶
Selects TLS version 1.2 as the channel encryption protocol. This is the
most modern version, and probably the best choice for maximum protection,
if both sides can speak it.  Available only with openssl version 1.0.1+.

New in version 3.4.


Deprecated since version 3.6: OpenSSL has deprecated all version specific protocols. Use the default
protocol  with flags like  instead.

conjunction with .  It prevents the peers from
choosing SSLv2 as the protocol version.

New in version 3.2.

Prevents an SSLv3 connection.  This option is only applicable in
conjunction with .  It prevents the peers from
choosing SSLv3 as the protocol version.

New in version 3.2.

¶
Prevents a TLSv1 connection.  This option is only applicable in
conjunction with .  It prevents the peers from
choosing TLSv1 as the protocol version.

New in version 3.2.


Deprecated since version 3.7: The option is deprecated since OpenSSL 1.1.0, use the new
 and
 instead.




¶
Prevents a TLSv1.1 connection. This option is only applicable in conjunction
with . It prevents the peers from choosing TLSv1.1 as
the protocol version. Available only with openssl version 1.0.1+.

New in version 3.4.


Deprecated since version 3.7: The option is deprecated since OpenSSL 1.1.0.




¶
Prevents a TLSv1.3 connection. This option is only applicable in conjunction
with . It prevents the peers from choosing TLSv1.3 as
the protocol version. TLS 1.3 is available with OpenSSL 1.1.1 or later.
When Python has been compiled against an older version of OpenSSL, the
flag defaults to 0.

New in version 3.7.


Deprecated since version 3.7: The option is deprecated since OpenSSL 1.1.0. It was added to 2.7.15,
3.6.3 and 3.7.0 for backwards compatibility with OpenSSL 1.0.2.




¶

HelloRequest messages, and ignore renegotiation requests via ClientHello.
This option is only available with OpenSSL 1.1.0h and later.

New in version 3.7.

Use the server’s cipher ordering preference, rather than the client’s.
This option has no effect on client sockets and SSLv2 server sockets.

New in version 3.3.

improves forward secrecy but requires more computational resources.
