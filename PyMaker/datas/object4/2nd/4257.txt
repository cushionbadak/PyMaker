¶
The process’s daemon flag, a Boolean value.  This must be set before
 is called.
The initial value is inherited from the creating process.
When a process exits, it attempts to terminate all of its daemonic child
processes.
Note that a daemonic process is not allowed to create child processes.
Otherwise a daemonic process would leave its children orphaned if it gets
terminated when its parent process exits. Additionally, these are not
Unix daemons or services, they are normal processes that will be
terminated (and not joined) if non-daemonic processes have exited.
