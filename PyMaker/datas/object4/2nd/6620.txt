()¶
This helper function returns a dictionary of scheme to proxy server URL
mappings. It scans the environment for variables named ,
in a case insensitive approach, for all operating systems first, and when it
cannot find it, looks for proxy information from Mac OSX System
Configuration for Mac OS X and Windows Systems Registry for Windows.
If both lowercase and uppercase environment variables exist (and disagree),
lowercase is preferred.

Note
If the environment variable  is set, which usually
indicates your script is running in a CGI environment, the environment
variable  (uppercase ) will be ignored. This is
because that variable can be injected by a client using the “Proxy:” HTTP
header. If you need to use an HTTP proxy in a CGI environment, either use
 explicitly, or make sure the variable name is in
lowercase (or at least the  suffix).
