class (host='', port=IMAP4_SSL_PORT, keyfile=None, certfile=None, ssl_context=None)¶
This is a subclass derived from  that connects over an SSL
encrypted socket (to use this class you need a socket module that was compiled
with SSL support).  If host is not specified,  (the local host) is used.
If port is omitted, the standard IMAP4-over-SSL port (993) is used.
ssl_context is a  object which allows bundling
SSL configuration options, certificates and private keys into a single
(potentially long-lived) structure.  Please read Security considerations for
best practices.
keyfile and certfile are a legacy alternative to ssl_context - they
can point to PEM-formatted private key and certificate chain files for
the SSL connection.  Note that the keyfile/certfile parameters are
mutually exclusive with ssl_context, a  is raised
if keyfile/certfile is provided along with ssl_context.

Changed in version 3.3: ssl_context parameter added.


Changed in version 3.4: The class now supports hostname check with
 and Server Name Indication (see
).


Deprecated since version 3.6: keyfile and certfile are deprecated in favor of ssl_context.
Please use  instead, or let
 select the system’s trusted CA
certificates for you.
