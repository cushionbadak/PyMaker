Command line interface¶
The command line interface is invoked using the interpreter’s  switch.
The simplest possible invocation is:


This invocation will install  if it is not already installed,
but otherwise does nothing. To ensure the installed version of 
is at least as recent as the one bundled with , pass the
 option:


By default,  is installed into the current virtual environment
(if one is active) or into the system site packages (if there is no
active virtual environment). The installation location can be controlled
through two additional command line options:

: Installs  relative to the given root directory
rather than the root of the currently active virtual environment (if any)
or the default root for the current Python installation.
: Installs  into the user site packages directory rather
than globally for the current Python installation (this option is not
permitted inside an active virtual environment).

By default, the scripts  and  will be installed (where
X.Y stands for the version of Python used to invoke ). The
scripts installed can be controlled through two additional command line
options:

: if an alternate installation is requested, the 
script will not be installed.

: if a “default pip” installation is requested, the
 script will be installed in addition to the two regular scripts.



Providing both of the script selection options will trigger an exception.
