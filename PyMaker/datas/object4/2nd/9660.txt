docs:


abstractmethod (fullname)Â¶
An abstract method to return the source of a module. It is returned as
a text string using universal newlines, translating all
recognized line separators into  characters.  Returns 
if no source is available (e.g. a built-in module). Raises
 if the loader cannot find the module specified.

Changed in version 3.4: Raises  instead of .
