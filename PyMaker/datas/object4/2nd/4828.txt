Enabling debug mode¶


()¶
Get the debug mode () of the event loop.
The default value is  if the environment variable
 is set to a non-empty string, 
otherwise.



(enabled: bool)¶
Set the debug mode of the event loop.

Changed in version 3.7: The new  command line option can now also be used
to enable the debug mode.
