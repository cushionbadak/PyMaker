 — Unix filename pattern matching¶
Source code: Lib/fnmatch.py

This module provides support for Unix shell-style wildcards, which are not the
same as regular expressions (which are documented in the  module).  The
special characters used in shell-style wildcards are:






Pattern
Meaning




matches everything


matches any single character


matches any character in seq


matches any character not in seq



For a literal match, wrap the meta-characters in brackets.
For example,  matches the character .
Note that the filename separator ( on Unix) is not special to this
module.  See module  for pathname expansion ( uses
 to match pathname segments).  Similarly, filenames starting with
a period are not special for this module, and are matched by the  and 
patterns.


(filename, pattern)¶
Test whether the filename string matches the pattern string, returning
 or .  Both parameters are case-normalized
using .  can be used to perform a
case-sensitive comparison, regardless of whether that’s standard for the
operating system.
This example will print all file names in the current directory with the
extension :





(filename, pattern)¶
Test whether filename matches pattern, returning  or
; the comparison is case-sensitive and does not apply
.



(names, pattern)¶
Return the subset of the list of names that match pattern. It is the same as
, but implemented more efficiently.



(pattern)¶
Return the shell-style pattern converted to a regular expression for
using with .
