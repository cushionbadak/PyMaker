RotatingFileHandler¶
The  class, located in the 
module, supports rotation of disk log files.


class (filename, mode='a', maxBytes=0, backupCount=0, encoding=None, delay=False)¶
Returns a new instance of the  class. The specified
file is opened and used as the stream for logging. If mode is not specified,
 is used.  If encoding is not , it is used to open the file
with that encoding.  If delay is true, then file opening is deferred until the
first call to .  By default, the file grows indefinitely.
You can use the maxBytes and backupCount values to allow the file to
rollover at a predetermined size. When the size is about to be exceeded,
the file is closed and a new file is silently opened for output. Rollover occurs
whenever the current log file is nearly maxBytes in length; but if either of
maxBytes or backupCount is zero, rollover never occurs, so you generally want
to set backupCount to at least 1, and have a non-zero maxBytes.
When backupCount is non-zero, the system will save old log files by appending
the extensions ‘.1’, ‘.2’ etc., to the filename. For example, with a backupCount
of 5 and a base file name of , you would get ,
, , up to . The file being
written to is always .  When this file is filled, it is closed
and renamed to , and if files ,
, etc. exist, then they are renamed to ,
 etc. respectively.

Changed in version 3.6: As well as string values,  objects are also accepted
for the filename argument.



()¶
Does a rollover, as described above.



(record)¶
Outputs the record to the file, catering for rollover as described
previously.
