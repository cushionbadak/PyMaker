(*restrictions)Â¶
This method for the  class prints out a report as described
in the  definition.
The order of the printing is based on the last
 operation done on the object (subject to
caveats in  and
).
The arguments provided (if any) can be used to limit the list down to the
significant entries.  Initially, the list is taken to be the complete set
of profiled functions.  Each restriction is either an integer (to select a
count of lines), or a decimal fraction between 0.0 and 1.0 inclusive (to
select a percentage of lines), or a string that will interpreted as a
regular expression (to pattern match the standard name that is printed).
If several restrictions are provided, then they are applied sequentially.
For example:


would first limit the printing to first 10% of list, and then only print
functions that were part of filename .  In contrast, the
command:


would limit the list to all functions having file names ,
and then proceed to only print the first 10% of them.
