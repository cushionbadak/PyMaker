(out, in, offset, count)Â¶

(out, in, offset, count, [headers, ][trailers, ]flags=0)
Copy count bytes from file descriptor in to file descriptor out
starting at offset.
Return the number of bytes sent. When EOF is reached return 0.
The first function notation is supported by all platforms that define
.
On Linux, if offset is given as , the bytes are read from the
current position of in and the position of in is updated.
The second case may be used on Mac OS X and FreeBSD where headers and
trailers are arbitrary sequences of buffers that are written before and
after the data from in is written. It returns the same as the first case.
On Mac OS X and FreeBSD, a value of 0 for count specifies to send until
the end of in is reached.
All platforms support sockets as out file descriptor, and some platforms
allow other types (e.g. regular file, pipe) as well.
Cross-platform applications should not use headers, trailers and flags
arguments.
Availability: Unix.
