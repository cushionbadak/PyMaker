(data)¶

(data)¶
Return the hexadecimal representation of the binary data.  Every byte of
data is converted into the corresponding 2-digit hex representation.  The
returned bytes object is therefore twice as long as the length of data.
Similar functionality (but returning a text string) is also conveniently
accessible using the  method.
