([object])Â¶
Return the  attribute for a module, class, instance,
or any other object with a  attribute.
Objects such as modules and instances have an updateable 
attribute; however, other objects may have write restrictions on their
 attributes (for example, classes use a
 to prevent direct dictionary updates).
Without an argument,  acts like .  Note, the
locals dictionary is only useful for reads since updates to the locals
dictionary are ignored.
