docs:


¶
The entry’s full path name: equivalent to  where scandir_path is the  path
argument.  The path is only absolute if the  path
argument was absolute.  If the  path
argument was a file descriptor, the 
attribute is the same as the  attribute.
The  attribute will be  if the 
path argument is of type  and  otherwise.  Use
 to decode byte filenames.
