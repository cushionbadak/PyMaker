docs:


(type[, value[, traceback]])Â¶
Raises an exception of type  at the point where the generator was paused,
and returns the next value yielded by the generator function.  If the generator
exits without yielding another value, a  exception is
raised.  If the generator function does not catch the passed-in exception, or
raises a different exception, then that exception propagates to the caller.
