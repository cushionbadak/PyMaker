docs:


([size[, chars[, firstline]]])Â¶
Decodes data from the stream and returns the resulting object.
The chars argument indicates the number of decoded
code points or bytes to return. The  method will
never return more data than requested, but it might return less,
if there is not enough available.
The size argument indicates the approximate maximum
number of encoded bytes or code points to read
for decoding. The decoder can modify this setting as
appropriate. The default value -1 indicates to read and decode as much as
possible.  This parameter is intended to
prevent having to decode huge files in one step.
The firstline flag indicates that
it would be sufficient to only return the first
line, if there are decoding errors on later lines.
The method should use a greedy read strategy meaning that it should read
as much data as is allowed within the definition of the encoding and the
given size, e.g.  if optional encoding endings or state markers are
available on the stream, these should be read too.
