LogRecord attributes¶
The LogRecord has a number of attributes, most of which are derived from the
parameters to the constructor. (Note that the names do not always correspond
exactly between the LogRecord constructor parameters and the LogRecord
attributes.) These attributes can be used to merge data from the record into
the format string. The following table lists (in alphabetical order) the
attribute names, their meanings and the corresponding placeholder in a %-style
format string.
If you are using {}-formatting (), you can use
 as the placeholder in the format string. If you are using
$-formatting (), use the form . In
both cases, of course, replace  with the actual attribute name
you want to use.
In the case of {}-formatting, you can specify formatting flags by placing them
after the attribute name, separated from it with a colon. For example: a
placeholder of  would format a millisecond value of  as
. Refer to the  documentation for full details on
the options available to you.
