docs:


Â¶
(default: ) If true, wrapping will occur preferably on whitespaces
and right after hyphens in compound words, as it is customary in English.
If false, only whitespaces will be considered as potentially good places
for line breaks, but you need to set  to false if
you want truly insecable words.  Default behaviour in previous versions
was to always allow breaking hyphenated words.
