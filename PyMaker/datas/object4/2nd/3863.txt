(c)¶
Return a string representation of the ASCII character c.  If c is printable,
this string is the character itself.  If the character is a control character
(0x00–0x1f) the string consists of a caret () followed by the
corresponding uppercase letter. If the character is an ASCII delete (0x7f) the
string is .  If the character has its meta bit (0x80) set, the meta bit
is stripped, the preceding rules applied, and  prepended to the result.
