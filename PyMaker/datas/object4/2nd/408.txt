class (stop)¶

class (start, stop[, step])
The arguments to the range constructor must be integers (either built-in
 or any object that implements the  special
method).  If the step argument is omitted, it defaults to .
If the start argument is omitted, it defaults to .
If step is zero,  is raised.
For a positive step, the contents of a range  are determined by the
formula  where  and
.
For a negative step, the contents of the range are still determined by
the formula , but the constraints are 
and .
A range object will be empty if  does not meet the value
constraint. Ranges do support negative indices, but these are interpreted
as indexing from the end of the sequence determined by the positive
indices.
Ranges containing absolute values larger than  are
permitted but some features (such as ) may raise
.
Range examples:


Ranges implement all of the common sequence operations
except concatenation and repetition (due to the fact that range objects can
only represent sequences that follow a strict pattern and repetition and
concatenation will usually violate that pattern).
