docs:


(style, query_opt=None, **kw)Â¶
Query or sets dynamic values of the specified option(s) in style.
Each key in kw is an option and each value should be a list or a
tuple (usually) containing statespecs grouped in tuples, lists, or
some other preference. A statespec is a compound of one
or more states and then a value.
An example may make it more understandable:


Note that the order of the (states, value) sequences for an option does
matter, if the order is changed to  in the foreground option, for example, the result would be a
blue foreground when the widget were in active or pressed states.
