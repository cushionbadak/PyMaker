¶
An ordered mapping of parameters’ names to the corresponding
 objects.  Parameters appear in strict definition
order, including keyword-only parameters.

Changed in version 3.7: Python only explicitly guaranteed that it preserved the declaration
order of keyword-only parameters as of version 3.7, although in practice
this order had always been preserved in Python 3.
