File Names, Command Line Arguments, and Environment VariablesÂ¶
In Python, file names, command line arguments, and environment variables are
represented using the string type. On some systems, decoding these strings to
and from bytes is necessary before passing them to the operating system. Python
uses the file system encoding to perform this conversion (see
).

Changed in version 3.1: On some systems, conversion using the file system encoding may fail. In this
case, Python uses the surrogateescape encoding error handler, which means that undecodable bytes are replaced by a
Unicode character U+DCxx on decoding, and these are again translated to the
original byte on encoding.

The file system encoding must guarantee to successfully decode all bytes
below 128. If the file system encoding fails to provide this guarantee, API
functions may raise UnicodeErrors.
