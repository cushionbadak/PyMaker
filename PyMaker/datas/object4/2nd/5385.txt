([timeout[, use_poll[, map[, count]]]])Â¶
Enter a polling loop that terminates after count passes or all open
channels have been closed.  All arguments are optional.  The count
parameter defaults to , resulting in the loop terminating only when all
channels have been closed.  The timeout argument sets the timeout
parameter for the appropriate  or 
call, measured in seconds; the default is 30 seconds.  The use_poll
parameter, if true, indicates that  should be used in
preference to  (the default is ).
The map parameter is a dictionary whose items are the channels to watch.
As channels are closed they are deleted from their map.  If map is
omitted, a global map is used. Channels (instances of
,  and subclasses
thereof) can freely be mixed in the map.
