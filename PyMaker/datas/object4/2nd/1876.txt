(iterable, r=None)Â¶
Return successive r length permutations of elements in the iterable.
If r is not specified or is , then r defaults to the length
of the iterable and all possible full-length permutations
are generated.
Permutations are emitted in lexicographic sort order.  So, if the
input iterable is sorted, the permutation tuples will be produced
in sorted order.
Elements are treated as unique based on their position, not on their
value.  So if the input elements are unique, there will be no repeat
values in each permutation.
Roughly equivalent to:


The code for  can be also expressed as a subsequence of
, filtered to exclude entries with repeated elements (those
from the same position in the input pool):


The number of items returned is  when 
or zero when .
