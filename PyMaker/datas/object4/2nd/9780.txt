(st)Â¶
When st represents an  form, this function returns true, otherwise
it returns false.  This is useful, since code objects normally cannot be queried
for this information using existing built-in functions.  Note that the code
objects created by  cannot be queried like this either, and
are identical to those created by the built-in  function.
