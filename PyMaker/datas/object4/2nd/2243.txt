Deprecated functions and variables¶
A historical way to create temporary files was to first generate a
file name with the  function and then create a file
using this name. Unfortunately this is not secure, because a different
process may create a file with this name in the time between the call
to  and the subsequent attempt to create the file by the
first process. The solution is to combine the two steps and create the
file immediately. This approach is used by  and the
other functions described above.


(suffix='', prefix='tmp', dir=None)¶

Deprecated since version 2.3: Use  instead.

Return an absolute pathname of a file that did not exist at the time the
call is made.  The prefix, suffix, and dir arguments are similar
to those of , except that bytes file names, 
and  are not supported.

Warning
Use of this function may introduce a security hole in your program.  By
the time you get around to doing anything with the file name it returns,
someone else may have beaten you to the punch.   usage can
be replaced easily with , passing it the
 parameter:
