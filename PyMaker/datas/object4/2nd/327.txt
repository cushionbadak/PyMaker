docs:


(object)Â¶
Return the hash value of the object (if it has one).  Hash values are
integers.  They are used to quickly compare dictionary keys during a
dictionary lookup.  Numeric values that compare equal have the same hash
value (even if they are of different types, as is the case for 1 and 1.0).

Note
For objects with custom  methods, note that 
truncates the return value based on the bit width of the host machine.
See  for details.
