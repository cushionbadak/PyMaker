docs:


(fd)¶
Specify that the file descriptor fd be used for typeahead checking.  If fd
is , then no typeahead checking is done.
The curses library does “line-breakout optimization” by looking for typeahead
periodically while updating the screen.  If input is found, and it is coming
from a tty, the current update is postponed until refresh or doupdate is called
again, allowing faster response to commands typed in advance. This function
allows specifying a different file descriptor for typeahead checking.
