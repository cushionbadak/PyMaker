(package, resource)Â¶
Open for binary reading the resource within package.
package is either a name or a module object which conforms to the
 requirements.  resource is the name of the resource to open
within package; it may not contain path separators and it may not have
sub-resources (i.e. it cannot be a directory).  This function returns a
 instance, a binary I/O stream open for reading.
