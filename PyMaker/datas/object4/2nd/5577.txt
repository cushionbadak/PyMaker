(obj, defect)Â¶
Register a defect on obj.  In the email package, defect will always
be a subclass of .
The default implementation calls the  method of the 
attribute of obj.  When the email package calls ,
obj will normally have a  attribute that has an 
method.  Custom object types used with the email package (for example,
custom  objects) should also provide such an attribute,
otherwise defects in parsed messages will raise unexpected errors.
