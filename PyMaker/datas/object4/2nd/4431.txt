docs:


(fs, timeout=None)¶
Returns an iterator over the  instances (possibly created by
different  instances) given by fs that yields futures as
they complete (finished or were cancelled). Any futures given by fs that
are duplicated will be returned once. Any futures that completed before
 is called will be yielded first.  The returned iterator
raises a  if 
is called and the result isn’t available after timeout seconds from the
original call to .  timeout can be an int or float. If
timeout is not specified or , there is no limit to the wait time.
