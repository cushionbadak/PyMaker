History list¶
The following functions operate on a global history list:


()¶
Clear the current history.  This calls  in the
underlying library.  The Python function only exists if Python was
compiled for a version of the library that supports it.



()¶
Return the number of items currently in the history.  (This is different from
, which returns the maximum number of lines that will
be written to a history file.)



(index)¶
Return the current contents of history item at index.  The item index
is one-based.  This calls  in the underlying library.



(pos)¶
Remove history item specified by its position from the history.
The position is zero-based.  This calls  in
the underlying library.



(pos, line)¶
Replace history item specified by its position with line.
The position is zero-based.  This calls 
in the underlying library.



(line)¶
Append line to the history buffer, as if it was the last line typed.
This calls  in the underlying library.



(enabled)¶
Enable or disable automatic calls to  when reading
input via readline.  The enabled argument should be a Boolean value
that when true, enables auto history, and that when false, disables
auto history.

New in version 3.6.


CPython implementation detail: Auto history is enabled by default, and changes to this do not persist
across multiple sessions.
