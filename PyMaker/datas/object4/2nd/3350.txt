Text I/OÂ¶
Text I/O over a binary storage (such as a file) is significantly slower than
binary I/O over the same storage, because it requires conversions between
unicode and binary data using a character codec.  This can become noticeable
handling huge amounts of text data like large log files.  Also,
 and  are both quite slow
due to the reconstruction algorithm used.
, however, is a native in-memory unicode container and will
exhibit similar speed to .
