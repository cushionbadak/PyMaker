Settings and special methods¶


(mode=None)¶




Parameters:mode – one of the strings “standard”, “logo” or “world”



Set turtle mode (“standard”, “logo” or “world”) and perform reset.  If mode
is not given, current mode is returned.
Mode “standard” is compatible with old .  Mode “logo” is
compatible with most Logo turtle graphics.  Mode “world” uses user-defined
“world coordinates”. Attention: in this mode angles appear distorted if
 unit-ratio doesn’t equal 1.

(name, shape=None)¶
There are three different ways to call this function:

name is the name of a gif-file and shape is : Install the
corresponding image shape.



Note
Image shapes do not rotate when turning the turtle, so they do not
display the heading of the turtle!


name is an arbitrary string and shape is a tuple of pairs of
coordinates: Install the corresponding polygon shape.

object: Install the corresponding compound shape.


Add a turtle shape to TurtleScreen’s shapelist.  Only thusly registered
