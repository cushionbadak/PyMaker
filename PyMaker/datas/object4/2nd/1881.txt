docs:


(iterable, n=2)Â¶
Return n independent iterators from a single iterable.
The following Python code helps explain what tee does (although the actual
implementation is more complex and uses only a single underlying
FIFO queue).
Roughly equivalent to:


Once  has made a split, the original iterable should not be
used anywhere else; otherwise, the iterable could get advanced without
the tee objects being informed.
This itertool may require significant auxiliary storage (depending on how
much temporary data needs to be stored). In general, if one iterator uses
most or all of the data before another iterator starts, it is faster to use
 instead of .
