class ¶
Private, abstract base class for pointers.
Concrete pointer types are created by calling  with the
type that will be pointed to; this is done automatically by
.
If a pointer points to an array, its elements can be read and
written using standard subscript and slice accesses.  Pointer objects
have no size, so  will raise .  Negative
subscripts will read from the memory before the pointer (as in C), and
out-of-range subscripts will probably crash with an access violation (if
you’re lucky).


¶
Specifies the type pointed to.



¶
Returns the object to which to pointer points.  Assigning to this
attribute changes the pointer to point to the assigned object.
