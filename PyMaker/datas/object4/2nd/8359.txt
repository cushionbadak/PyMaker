(m=None, name=None, globs=None, verbose=None, report=True, optionflags=0, extraglobs=None, raise_on_error=False, exclude_empty=False)Â¶
All arguments are optional, and all except for m should be specified in
keyword form.
Test examples in docstrings in functions and classes reachable from module m
(or module  if m is not supplied or is ), starting with
.
Also test examples reachable from dict , if it exists and is not
.   maps names (strings) to functions, classes and
strings; function and class docstrings are searched for examples; strings are
searched directly, as if they were docstrings.
Only docstrings attached to objects belonging to module m are searched.
Return .
Optional argument name gives the name of the module; by default, or if
,  is used.
Optional argument exclude_empty defaults to false.  If true, objects for which
no doctests are found are excluded from consideration. The default is a backward
compatibility hack, so that code still using  in
conjunction with  continues to get output for objects with no
tests. The exclude_empty argument to the newer 
constructor defaults to true.
Optional arguments extraglobs, verbose, report, optionflags,
raise_on_error, and globs are the same as for function 
above, except that globs defaults to .
