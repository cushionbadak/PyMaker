(mode)Â¶

(device, mode)
Open an audio device and return an OSS audio device object.  This object
supports many file-like methods, such as , , and
 (although there are subtle differences between conventional Unix
read/write semantics and those of OSS audio devices).  It also supports a number
of audio-specific methods; see below for the complete list of methods.
device is the audio device filename to use.  If it is not specified, this
module first looks in the environment variable  for a device
to use.  If not found, it falls back to .
mode is one of  for read-only (record) access,  for
write-only (playback) access and  for both. Since many sound cards
only allow one process to have the recorder or player open at a time, it is a
good idea to open the device only for the activity needed.  Further, some
sound cards are half-duplex: they can be opened for reading or writing, but
not both at once.
Note the unusual calling syntax: the first argument is optional, and the
second is required.  This is a historical artifact for compatibility with the
older  module which  supersedes.
