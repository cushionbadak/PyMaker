docs:


(secs)¶
Suspend execution of the calling thread for the given number of seconds.
The argument may be a floating point number to indicate a more precise sleep
time. The actual suspension time may be less than that requested because any
caught signal will terminate the  following execution of that
signal’s catching routine.  Also, the suspension time may be longer than
requested by an arbitrary amount because of the scheduling of other activity
in the system.

Changed in version 3.5: The function now sleeps at least secs even if the sleep is interrupted
by a signal, except if the signal handler raises an exception (see
PEP 475 for the rationale).
