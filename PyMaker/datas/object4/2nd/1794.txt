the current thread.
If  has not been called before , then
 will automatically create a new context for use in the
current thread.
The new context is copied from a prototype context called DefaultContext. To
control the defaults so that each thread will use the same values throughout the
application, directly modify the DefaultContext object. This should be done
before any threads are started so that there won’t be a race condition between
threads calling . For example:
