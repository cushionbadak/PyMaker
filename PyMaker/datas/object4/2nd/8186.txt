file system directory trees. The list entries are indented and connected by
branch lines according to their places in the hierarchy.

handling many more items than checkbuttons or radiobuttons.

can be used to display hierarchical data in a tree form. The user can adjust the
view of the tree by opening or closing parts of the tree.
