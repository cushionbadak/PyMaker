Standard option typesÂ¶
 has five built-in option types: , ,
,  and .  If you need to add new
option types, see section Extending optparse.
Arguments to string options are not checked or converted in any way: the text on
the command line is stored in the destination (or passed to the callback) as-is.
Integer arguments (type ) are parsed as follows:

if the number starts with , it is parsed as a hexadecimal number
if the number starts with , it is parsed as an octal number
if the number starts with , it is parsed as a binary number
otherwise, the number is parsed as a decimal number

The conversion is done by calling  with the appropriate base (2, 8,
10, or 16).  If this fails, so will , although with a more useful
error message.
 and  option arguments are converted directly with
 and , with similar error-handling.
 options are a subtype of  options.  The
 option attribute (a sequence of strings) defines the
set of allowed option arguments.   compares
user-supplied option arguments against this master list and raises
 if an invalid string is given.
