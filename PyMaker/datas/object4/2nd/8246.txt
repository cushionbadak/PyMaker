Setting preferences¶
The font preferences, highlighting, keys, and general preferences can be
changed via Configure IDLE on the Option menu.
Non-default user settings are saved in a .idlerc directory in the user’s
home directory.  Problems caused by bad user configuration files are solved
by editing or deleting one or more of the files in .idlerc.
On the Font tab, see the text sample for the effect of font face and size
on multiple characters in multiple languages.  Edit the sample to add
other characters of personal interest.  Use the sample to select
monospaced fonts.  If particular characters have problems in Shell or an
editor, add them to the top of the sample and try changing first size
and then font.
On the Highlights and Keys tab, select a built-in or custom color theme
and key set.  To use a newer built-in color theme or key set with older
IDLEs, save it as a new custom theme or key set and it well be accessible
to older IDLEs.
