class ¶


(item, column=None)¶
Returns the bounding box (relative to the treeview widget’s window) of
the specified item in the form (x, y, width, height).
If column is specified, returns the bounding box of that cell. If the
item is not visible (i.e., if it is a descendant of a closed item or is
scrolled offscreen), returns an empty string.



(item=None)¶
Returns the list of children belonging to item.
If item is not specified, returns root children.



(item, *newchildren)¶
Replaces item’s child with newchildren.
Children present in item that are not present in newchildren are
detached from the tree. No items in newchildren may be an ancestor of
item. Note that not specifying newchildren results in detaching
item’s children.



(column, option=None, **kw)¶
Query or modify the options for the specified column.
If kw is not given, returns a dict of the column option values. If
option is specified then the value for that option is returned.
Otherwise, sets the options to the corresponding values.
The valid options/values are:


id
Returns the column name. This is a read-only option.



anchor: One of the standard Tk anchor values.
Specifies how the text in this column should be aligned with respect
to the cell.



minwidth: width
The minimum width of the column in pixels. The treeview widget will
not make the column any smaller than specified by this option when
the widget is resized or the user drags a column.



stretch: True/False
Specifies whether the column’s width should be adjusted when
the widget is resized.



width: width
The width of the column in pixels.



To configure the tree column, call this with column = “#0”



(*items)¶
Delete all specified items and all their descendants.
The root item may not be deleted.



(*items)¶
Unlinks all of the specified items from the tree.
The items and all of their descendants are still present, and may be
reinserted at another point in the tree, but will not be displayed.
The root item may not be detached.



(item)¶
Returns  if the specified item is present in the tree.



(item=None)¶
If item is specified, sets the focus item to item. Otherwise, returns
the current focus item, or ‘’ if there is none.



(column, option=None, **kw)¶
Query or modify the heading options for the specified column.
If kw is not given, returns a dict of the heading option values. If
option is specified then the value for that option is returned.
Otherwise, sets the options to the corresponding values.
The valid options/values are:


text: text
The text to display in the column heading.



image: imageName
Specifies an image to display to the right of the column heading.



anchor: anchor
Specifies how the heading text should be aligned. One of the standard
Tk anchor values.



command: callback
A callback to be invoked when the heading label is pressed.



To configure the tree column heading, call this with column = “#0”.



(component, x, y)¶
Returns a description of the specified component under the point given
by x and y, or the empty string if no such component is present at
that position.



(y)¶
Returns the item ID of the item at position y.



(x)¶
Returns the data column identifier of the cell at position x.
The tree column has ID #0.



(x, y)¶
Returns one of:






region

(item)¶
Returns the integer index of item within its parent’s list of children.



(parent, index, iid=None, **kw)¶
Creates a new item and returns the item identifier of the newly created
item.
parent is the item ID of the parent item, or the empty string to create
a new top-level item. index is an integer, or the value “end”,
specifying where in the list of parent’s children to insert the new item.
If index is less than or equal to zero, the new node is inserted at
the beginning; if index is greater than or equal to the current number
of children, it is inserted at the end. If iid is specified, it is used
as the item identifier; iid must not already exist in the tree.
Otherwise, a new unique identifier is generated.
See Item Options for the list of available points.



(item, option=None, **kw)¶
Query or modify the options for the specified item.
If no options are given, a dict with options/values for the item is
returned.
If option is specified then the value for that option is returned.
Otherwise, sets the options to the corresponding values as given by kw.



(item, parent, index)¶
Moves item to position index in parent’s list of children.
It is illegal to move an item under one of its descendants. If index is
