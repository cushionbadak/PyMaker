class (html=0, target=None, encoding=None)¶
This class is the low-level building block of the module.  It uses
 for efficient, event-based parsing of XML.  It can
be fed XML data incrementally with the  method, and parsing
events are translated to a push API - by invoking callbacks on the target
object.  If target is omitted, the standard  is used.
The html argument was historically used for backwards compatibility and is
now deprecated.  If encoding [1] is given, the value overrides the
encoding specified in the XML file.

Deprecated since version 3.4: The html argument.  The remaining arguments should be passed via
keyword to prepare for the removal of the html argument.



()¶
Finishes feeding data to the parser.  Returns the result of calling the
 method of the target passed during construction; by default,
this is the toplevel document element.



(name, pubid, system)¶

Deprecated since version 3.2: Define the  method on a custom TreeBuilder
target.




(data)¶
Feeds data to the parser.  data is encoded data.

 calls target’s  method
for each opening tag, its  method for each closing tag, and data
is processed by method .   calls
target’s method .  can be used not only for
building a tree structure. This is an example of counting the maximum depth
of an XML file:
