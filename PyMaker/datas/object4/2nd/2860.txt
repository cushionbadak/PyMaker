Using different digest sizesÂ¶
BLAKE2 has configurable size of digests up to 64 bytes for BLAKE2b and up to 32
bytes for BLAKE2s. For example, to replace SHA-1 with BLAKE2b without changing
the size of output, we can tell BLAKE2b to produce 20-byte digests:


Hash objects with different digest sizes have completely different outputs
(shorter hashes are not prefixes of longer hashes); BLAKE2b and BLAKE2s
produce different outputs even if the output length is the same:
