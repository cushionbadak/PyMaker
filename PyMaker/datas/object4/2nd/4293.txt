()Â¶
Add support for when a program which uses  has been
frozen to produce a Windows executable.  (Has been tested with py2exe,
PyInstaller and cx_Freeze.)
One needs to call this function straight after the  line of the main module.  For example:


If the  line is omitted then trying to run the frozen
executable will raise .
Calling  has no effect when invoked on any operating
system other than Windows.  In addition, if the module is being run
normally by the Python interpreter on Windows (the program has not been
frozen), then  has no effect.
