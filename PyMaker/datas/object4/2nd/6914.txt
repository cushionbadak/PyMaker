(mechanism, authobject)¶
Authenticate command — requires response processing.
mechanism specifies which authentication mechanism is to be used - it should
appear in the instance variable  in the form .
authobject must be a callable object:


It will be called to process server continuation responses; the response
argument it is passed will be .  It should return  data
that will be base64 encoded and sent to the server.  It should return
 if the client abort response  should be sent instead.

Changed in version 3.5: string usernames and passwords are now encoded to  instead of
being limited to ASCII.
