7.3. The  statementÂ¶
Assert statements are a convenient way to insert debugging assertions into a
program:

The simple form, , is equivalent to


The extended form, , is equivalent to


These equivalences assume that  and  refer to
the built-in variables with those names.  In the current implementation, the
built-in variable  is  under normal circumstances,
 when optimization is requested (command line option ).  The current
code generator emits no code for an assert statement when optimization is
requested at compile time.  Note that it is unnecessary to include the source
code for the expression that failed in the error message; it will be displayed
as part of the stack trace.
Assignments to  are illegal.  The value for the built-in variable
is determined when the interpreter starts.
