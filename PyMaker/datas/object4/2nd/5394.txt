(sock, addr)Â¶
Called on listening channels (passive openers) when a connection has been
established with a new remote endpoint that has issued a 
call for the local endpoint.  sock is a new socket object usable to
send and receive data on the connection, and addr is the address
bound to the socket on the other end of the connection.

New in version 3.2.
