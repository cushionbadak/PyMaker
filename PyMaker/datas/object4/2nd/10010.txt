(code)Â¶
This generator function uses the  and 
attributes of the code object code to find the offsets which are starts of
lines in the source code.  They are generated as  pairs.
See Objects/lnotab_notes.txt for the  format and
how to decode it.

Changed in version 3.6: Line numbers can be decreasing. Before, they were always increasing.
