¶
Although the  class of the  module implements this
attribute, the database engine’s own support for the determination of “rows
affected”/”rows selected” is quirky.
For  statements, the number of modifications are summed up
into .
As required by the Python DB API Spec, the  attribute “is -1 in
case no  has been performed on the cursor or the rowcount of the
last operation is not determinable by the interface”. This includes 
statements because we cannot determine the number of rows a query produced
until all rows were fetched.
With SQLite versions before 3.6.5,  is set to 0 if
you make a  without any condition.
