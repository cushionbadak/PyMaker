(population, weights=None, *, cum_weights=None, k=1)Â¶
Return a k sized list of elements chosen from the population with replacement.
If the population is empty, raises .
If a weights sequence is specified, selections are made according to the
relative weights.  Alternatively, if a cum_weights sequence is given, the
selections are made according to the cumulative weights (perhaps computed
using ).  For example, the relative weights
 are equivalent to the cumulative weights
.  Internally, the relative weights are converted to
cumulative weights before making selections, so supplying the cumulative
weights saves work.
If neither weights nor cum_weights are specified, selections are made
with equal probability.  If a weights sequence is supplied, it must be
the same length as the population sequence.  It is a 
to specify both weights and cum_weights.
The weights or cum_weights can use any numeric type that interoperates
with the  values returned by  (that includes
integers, floats, and fractions but excludes decimals).
For a given seed, the  function with equal weighting
typically produces a different sequence than repeated calls to
.  The algorithm used by  uses floating
point arithmetic for internal consistency and speed.  The algorithm used
by  defaults to integer arithmetic with repeated selections
to avoid small biases from round-off error.
