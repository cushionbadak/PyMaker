(dt)¶
This is called from the default 
implementation.  When called from that,  is self, and dt’s
date and time data are to be viewed as expressing a UTC time.  The purpose
of  is to adjust the date and time data, returning an
equivalent datetime in self’s local time.
Most  subclasses should be able to inherit the default
 implementation without problems.  It’s strong enough to handle
fixed-offset time zones, and time zones accounting for both standard and
daylight time, and the latter even if the DST transition times differ in
different years.  An example of a time zone the default 
implementation may not handle correctly in all cases is one where the standard
offset (from UTC) depends on the specific date and time passed, which can happen
for political reasons. The default implementations of  and
 may not produce the result you want if the result is one of the
hours straddling the moment the standard offset changes.
Skipping code for error cases, the default  implementation acts
like:
