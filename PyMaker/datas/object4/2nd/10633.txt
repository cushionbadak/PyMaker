None of my threads seem to run: why?¶
As soon as the main thread exits, all threads are killed.  Your main thread is
running too quickly, giving the threads no time to do any work.
A simple fix is to add a sleep to the end of the program that’s long enough for
all the threads to finish:


But now (on many platforms) the threads don’t run in parallel, but appear to run
sequentially, one at a time!  The reason is that the OS thread scheduler doesn’t
start a new thread until the previous thread is blocked.
A simple fix is to add a tiny sleep to the start of the run function:


Instead of trying to guess a good delay value for ,
it’s better to use some kind of semaphore mechanism.  One idea is to use the
 module to create a queue object, let each thread append a token to
the queue when it finishes, and let the main thread read as many tokens from the
queue as there are threads.
