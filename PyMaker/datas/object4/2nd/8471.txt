(first, second, places=7, msg=None, delta=None)¶

(first, second, places=7, msg=None, delta=None)¶
Test that first and second are approximately (or not approximately)
equal by computing the difference, rounding to the given number of
decimal places (default 7), and comparing to zero.  Note that these
methods round the values to the given number of decimal places (i.e.
like the  function) and not significant digits.
If delta is supplied instead of places then the difference
between first and second must be less or equal to (or greater than) delta.
Supplying both delta and places raises a .

Changed in version 3.2:  automatically considers almost equal objects
that compare equal.   automatically fails
if the objects compare equal.  Added the delta keyword argument.
