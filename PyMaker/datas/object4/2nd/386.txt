docs:


classmethod (bytes, byteorder, *, signed=False)¶
Return the integer represented by the given array of bytes.


The argument bytes must either be a bytes-like object or an
iterable producing bytes.
The byteorder argument determines the byte order used to represent the
integer.  If byteorder is , the most significant byte is at the
beginning of the byte array.  If byteorder is , the most
significant byte is at the end of the byte array.  To request the native
byte order of the host system, use  as the byte order
value.
The signed argument indicates whether two’s complement is used to
represent the integer.

New in version 3.2.
