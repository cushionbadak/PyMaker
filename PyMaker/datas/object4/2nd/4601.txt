Networking and Interprocess Communication¶
The modules described in this chapter provide mechanisms for
networking and inter-processes communication.
Some modules only work for two processes that are on the same machine, e.g.
 and .  Other modules support networking protocols
that two or more processes can use to communicate across machines.
The list of modules described in this chapter is:


 — Asynchronous I/O
 — Low-level networking interface
 — TLS/SSL wrapper for socket objects
 — Waiting for I/O completion
 — High-level I/O multiplexing
 — Asynchronous socket handler
 — Asynchronous socket command/response handler
 — Set handlers for asynchronous events
 — Memory-mapped file support
