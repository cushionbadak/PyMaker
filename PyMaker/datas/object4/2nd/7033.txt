docs:


(address)Â¶
Check the validity of an address on this server using SMTP . Returns a
tuple consisting of code 250 and a full RFC 822 address (including human
name) if the user address is valid. Otherwise returns an SMTP error code of 400
or greater and an error string.

Note
Many sites disable SMTP  in order to foil spammers.
