(logger=None, level=None)¶
A context manager to test that at least one message is logged on
the logger or one of its children, with at least the given
level.
If given, logger should be a  object or a
 giving the name of a logger.  The default is the root
logger, which will catch all messages.
If given, level should be either a numeric logging level or

The test passes if at least one message emitted inside the 
block matches the logger and level conditions, otherwise it fails.
The object returned by the context manager is a recording helper
which keeps tracks of the matching log messages.  It has two
attributes:

A list of  objects of the matching
log messages.
