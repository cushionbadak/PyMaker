(key, value_name, reserved, type, value)¶
Stores data in the value field of an open registry key.
key is an already open key, or one of the predefined
HKEY_* constants.
value_name is a string that names the subkey with which the value is
associated.
reserved can be anything – zero is always passed to the API.
type is an integer that specifies the type of the data. See
Value Types for the available types.
value is a string that specifies the new value.
This method can also set additional value and type information for the specified
key.  The key identified by the key parameter must have been opened with
 access.
To open the key, use the  or  methods.
Value lengths are limited by available memory. Long values (more than 2048
bytes) should be stored as files with the filenames stored in the configuration
registry.  This helps the registry perform efficiently.
