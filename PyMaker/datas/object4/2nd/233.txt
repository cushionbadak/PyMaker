coroutine (value)¶
Returns an awaitable which when run resumes the execution of the
asynchronous generator. As with the  method for a
generator, this “sends” a value into the asynchronous generator function,
and the value argument becomes the result of the current yield expression.
The awaitable returned by the  method will return the next
value yielded by the generator as the value of the raised
, or raises  if the
asynchronous generator exits without yielding another value.  When
 is called to start the asynchronous
generator, it must be called with  as the argument,
because there is no yield expression that could receive the value.
