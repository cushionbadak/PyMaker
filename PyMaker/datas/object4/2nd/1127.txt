docs:


(tz=None)¶
Return a  object with new  attribute tz,
adjusting the date and time data so the result is the same UTC time as
self, but in tz’s local time.
If provided, tz must be an instance of a  subclass, and its
 and  methods must not return .  If self
is naive, it is presumed to represent time in the system timezone.
If called without arguments (or with ) the system local
timezone is assumed for the target timezone.  The  attribute of the converted
datetime instance will be set to an instance of 
with the zone name and offset obtained from the OS.
If  is tz,  is equal to self:  no
adjustment of date or time data is performed. Else the result is local
time in the timezone tz, representing the same UTC time as self:  after
,  will have
the same date and time data as .
If you merely want to attach a time zone object tz to a datetime dt without
adjustment of date and time data, use .  If you
merely want to remove the time zone object from an aware datetime dt without
conversion of date and time data, use .
Note that the default  method can be overridden in a
 subclass to affect the result returned by .
Ignoring error cases,  acts like:



Changed in version 3.3: tz now can be omitted.


Changed in version 3.6: The  method can now be called on naive instances that
are presumed to represent system local time.
