class (host, port=None, key_file=None, cert_file=None, [timeout, ]source_address=None, *, context=None, check_hostname=None, blocksize=8192)¶
A subclass of  that uses SSL for communication with
secure servers.  Default port is .  If context is specified, it
must be a  instance describing the various SSL
options.
Please read Security considerations for more information on best practices.

Changed in version 3.2: source_address, context and check_hostname were added.


Changed in version 3.2: This class now supports HTTPS virtual hosts if possible (that is,
if  is true).


Changed in version 3.4: The strict parameter was removed. HTTP 0.9-style “Simple Responses” are
no longer supported.


Changed in version 3.4.3: This class now performs all the necessary certificate and hostname checks
by default. To revert to the previous, unverified, behavior
 can be passed to the context
parameter.


Deprecated since version 3.6: key_file and cert_file are deprecated in favor of context.
Please use  instead, or let
 select the system’s trusted CA
certificates for you.
The check_hostname parameter is also deprecated; the
 attribute of context should
be used instead.
