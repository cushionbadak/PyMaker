docs:


(result=None)¶
Run the test, collecting the result into the  object
passed as result.  If result is omitted or , a temporary
result object is created (by calling the 
method) and used. The result object is returned to ’s
caller.
The same effect may be had by simply calling the 
instance.

Changed in version 3.3: Previous versions of  did not return the result. Neither did
calling an instance.
