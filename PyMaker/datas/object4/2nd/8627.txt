mock_open¶


(mock=None, read_data=None)¶
A helper function to create a mock to replace the use of . It works
for  called directly or used as a context manager.
The mock argument is the mock object to configure. If  (the
default) then a  will be created for you, with the API limited
to methods or attributes available on standard file handles.
read_data is a string for the ,
, and  methods
of the file handle to return.  Calls to those methods will take data from
read_data until it is depleted.  The mock of these methods is pretty
simplistic: every time the mock is called, the read_data is rewound to
the start.  If you need more control over the data that you are feeding to
the tested code you will need to customize this mock for yourself.  When that
is insufficient, one of the in-memory filesystem packages on PyPI can offer a realistic filesystem for testing.

Changed in version 3.4: Added  and  support.
The mock of  changed to consume read_data rather
than returning it on each call.


Changed in version 3.5: read_data is now reset on each call to the mock.


Changed in version 3.7.1: Added  to implementation so that iteration (such as in for
loops) correctly consumes read_data.


Using  as a context manager is a great way to ensure your file handles
are closed properly and is becoming common:


The issue is that even if you mock out the call to  it is the
returned object that is used as a context manager (and has  and
 called).
Mocking context managers with a  is common enough and fiddly
enough that a helper function is useful.
