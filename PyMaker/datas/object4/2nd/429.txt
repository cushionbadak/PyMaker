()¶
Return true if all characters in the string are decimal
characters and there is at least one character, false
otherwise. Decimal characters are those that can be used to form
numbers in base 10, e.g. U+0660, ARABIC-INDIC DIGIT
ZERO.  Formally a decimal character is a character in the Unicode
General Category “Nd”.
