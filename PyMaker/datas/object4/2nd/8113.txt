docs:


(item, column=None)¶
Returns the bounding box (relative to the treeview widget’s window) of
the specified item in the form (x, y, width, height).
If column is specified, returns the bounding box of that cell. If the
item is not visible (i.e., if it is a descendant of a closed item or is
scrolled offscreen), returns an empty string.
