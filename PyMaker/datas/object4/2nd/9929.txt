(readline)Â¶
The  generator requires one argument, readline, which
must be a callable object which provides the same interface as the
 method of file objects.  Each call to the
function should return one line of input as bytes.
The generator produces 5-tuples with these members: the token type; the
token string; a 2-tuple  of ints specifying the row and
column where the token begins in the source; a 2-tuple  of
ints specifying the row and column where the token ends in the source; and
the line on which the token was found. The line passed (the last tuple item)
is the logical line; continuation lines are included.  The 5 tuple is
returned as a named tuple with the field names:
.
The returned named tuple has an additional property named
 that contains the exact operator type for
 tokens.  For all other token types 
equals the named tuple  field.

Changed in version 3.1: Added support for named tuples.


Changed in version 3.3: Added support for .
