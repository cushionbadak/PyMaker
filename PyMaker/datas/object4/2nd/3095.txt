(path, *, dir_fd=None, follow_symlinks=True)¶
Get the status of a file or a file descriptor. Perform the equivalent of a
 system call on the given path. path may be specified as
either a string or bytes – directly or indirectly through the 
interface – or as an open file descriptor. Return a 
object.
This function normally follows symlinks; to stat a symlink add the argument
, or use .
This function can support specifying a file descriptor and
not following symlinks.
