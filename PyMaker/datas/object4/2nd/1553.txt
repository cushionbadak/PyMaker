(x, y)Â¶
Return the IEEE 754-style remainder of x with respect to y.  For
finite x and finite nonzero y, this is the difference ,
where  is the closest integer to the exact value of the quotient .  If  is exactly halfway between two consecutive integers, the
nearest even integer is used for .  The remainder  thus always satisfies .
Special cases follow IEEE 754: in particular,  is
x for any finite x, and  and
 raise  for any non-NaN x.
If the result of the remainder operation is zero, that zero will have
the same sign as x.
On platforms using IEEE 754 binary floating-point, the result of this
operation is always exactly representable: no rounding error is introduced.

New in version 3.7.
