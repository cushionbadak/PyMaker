(hexstr)¶

(hexstr)¶
Return the binary data represented by the hexadecimal string hexstr.  This
function is the inverse of . hexstr must contain an even number
of hexadecimal digits (which can be upper or lower case), otherwise an
 exception is raised.
Similar functionality (accepting only text string arguments, but more
liberal towards whitespace) is also accessible using the
 class method.
