docs:


Â¶
(default: ) If true, after tab expansion but before wrapping,
the  method will replace each whitespace character
with a single space.  The whitespace characters replaced are
as follows: tab, newline, vertical tab, formfeed, and carriage
return ().

Note
If  is false and  is true,
each tab character will be replaced by a single space, which is not
the same as tab expansion.


Note
If  is false, newlines may appear in the
middle of a line and cause strange output. For this reason, text should
be split into paragraphs (using  or similar)
which are wrapped separately.
