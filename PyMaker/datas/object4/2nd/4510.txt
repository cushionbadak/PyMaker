docs:


(args, *, stdin=None, stdout=None, stderr=None, shell=False, cwd=None, timeout=None)¶
Run the command described by args.  Wait for command to complete, then
return the  attribute.
Code needing to capture stdout or stderr should use  instead:

run(…).returncode
To suppress stdout or stderr, supply a value of .
The arguments shown above are merely some common ones.
The full function signature is the
same as that of the  constructor - this function passes all
supplied arguments other than timeout directly through to that interface.

Note
Do not use  or  with this
function.  The child process will block if it generates enough
output to a pipe to fill up the OS pipe buffer as the pipes are
not being read from.


Changed in version 3.3: timeout was added.
