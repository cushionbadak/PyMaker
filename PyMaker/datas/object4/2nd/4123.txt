class ¶
This non-public class is the base class of all fundamental ctypes data
types. It is mentioned here because it contains the common attributes of the
fundamental ctypes data types.   is a subclass of
, so it inherits their methods and attributes. ctypes data
types that are not and do not contain pointers can now be pickled.
Instances have a single attribute:


¶
This attribute contains the actual value of the instance. For integer and
pointer types, it is an integer, for character types, it is a single
character bytes object or string, for character pointer types it is a
Python bytes object or string.
When the  attribute is retrieved from a ctypes instance, usually
a new object is returned each time.   does not implement
original object return, always a new object is constructed.  The same is
true for all other ctypes object instances.
