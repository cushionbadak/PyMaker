Windows Constants¶
The  module exposes the following constants.


¶
The standard input device. Initially, this is the console input buffer,
.



¶
The standard output device. Initially, this is the active console screen
buffer, .



¶
The standard error device. Initially, this is the active console screen
buffer, .



¶
Hides the window. Another window will be activated.



¶
Specifies that the ,
, and  attributes
contain additional information.



¶
Specifies that the  attribute contains
additional information.



¶
The new process has a new console, instead of inheriting its parent’s
console (the default).



¶
A   parameter to specify that a new process
group will be created. This flag is necessary for using 
on the subprocess.
This flag is ignored if  is specified.



¶
A   parameter to specify that a new process
will have an above average priority.

New in version 3.7.




¶
A   parameter to specify that a new process
will have a below average priority.

New in version 3.7.




¶
A   parameter to specify that a new process
will have a high priority.

New in version 3.7.




¶
A   parameter to specify that a new process
will have an idle (lowest) priority.

New in version 3.7.




¶
A   parameter to specify that a new process
will have an normal priority. (default)

New in version 3.7.




¶
A   parameter to specify that a new process
will have realtime priority.
You should almost never use REALTIME_PRIORITY_CLASS, because this interrupts
system threads that manage mouse input, keyboard input, and background disk
flushing. This class can be appropriate for applications that “talk” directly
to hardware or that perform brief tasks that should have limited interruptions.

New in version 3.7.




¶
A   parameter to specify that a new process
will not create a window.

New in version 3.7.




¶
A   parameter to specify that a new process
will not inherit its parent’s console.
This value cannot be used with CREATE_NEW_CONSOLE.

New in version 3.7.




¶
A   parameter to specify that a new process
does not inherit the error mode of the calling process. Instead, the new
process gets the default error mode.
This feature is particularly useful for multithreaded shell applications
that run with hard errors disabled.

New in version 3.7.




¶
A   parameter to specify that a new process
is not associated with the job.

New in version 3.7.
