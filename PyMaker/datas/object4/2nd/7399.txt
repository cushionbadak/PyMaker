class (address)¶
Construct an IPv6 address.  An  is raised if
address is not a valid IPv6 address.
The following constitutes a valid IPv6 address:

A string consisting of eight groups of four hexadecimal digits, each
group representing 16 bits.  The groups are separated by colons.
This describes an exploded (longhand) notation.  The string can
also be compressed (shorthand notation) by various means.  See
RFC 4291 for details.  For example,
 can be compressed to
.
An integer that fits into 128 bits.
An integer packed into a  object of length 16, big-endian.





¶

The short form of the address representation, with leading zeroes in
groups omitted and the longest sequence of groups consisting entirely of
zeroes collapsed to a single empty group.
This is also the value returned by  for IPv6 addresses.


¶

The long form of the address representation, with all leading zeroes and
groups consisting entirely of zeroes included.
For the following attributes, see the corresponding documentation of the
 class:

 if the address is reserved for site-local usage.  Note that
the site-local address space has been deprecated by RFC 3879. Use
 to test if this address is in the
space of unique local addresses as defined by RFC 4193.

For addresses that appear to be IPv4 mapped addresses (starting with
), this property will report the embedded IPv4 address.
For any other address, this property will be .



¶
For addresses that appear to be 6to4 addresses  (starting with
) as defined by RFC 3056, this property will report
the embedded IPv4 address.  For any other address, this property will
be .



¶
For addresses that appear to be Teredo addresses (starting with
) as defined by RFC 4380, this property will report
the embedded  IP address pair.  For any other
address, this property will be .
