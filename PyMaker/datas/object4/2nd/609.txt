MethodsÂ¶
Methods are functions that are called using the attribute notation. There are
two flavors: built-in methods (such as  on lists) and class
instance methods.  Built-in methods are described with the types that support
them.
If you access a method (a function defined in a class namespace) through an
instance, you get a special object: a bound method (also called
instance method) object. When called, it will add the  argument
to the argument list.  Bound methods have two special read-only attributes:
 is the object on which the method operates, and  is
the function implementing the method.  Calling 
is completely equivalent to calling .
Like function objects, bound method objects support getting arbitrary
attributes.  However, since method attributes are actually stored on the
underlying function object (), setting method attributes on
bound methods is disallowed.  Attempting to set an attribute on a method
results in an  being raised.  In order to set a method
attribute, you need to explicitly set it on the underlying function object:
