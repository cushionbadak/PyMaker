docs:


(banner=None, exitmsg=None)¶
Closely emulate the interactive Python console. The optional banner argument
specify the banner to print before the first interaction; by default it prints a
banner similar to the one printed by the standard Python interpreter, followed
by the class name of the console object in parentheses (so as not to confuse
this with the real interpreter – since it’s so close!).
The optional exitmsg argument specifies an exit message printed when exiting.
Pass the empty string to suppress the exit message. If exitmsg is not given or
, a default message is printed.

Changed in version 3.4: To suppress printing any banner, pass an empty string.


Changed in version 3.6: Print an exit message when exiting.
