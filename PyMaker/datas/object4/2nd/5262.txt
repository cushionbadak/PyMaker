docs:


(curve_name)¶
Set the curve name for Elliptic Curve-based Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key
exchange.  ECDH is significantly faster than regular DH while arguably
as secure.  The curve_name parameter should be a string describing
a well-known elliptic curve, for example  for a widely
supported curve.
This setting doesn’t apply to client sockets.  You can also use the
 option to further improve security.
This method is not available if  is .

New in version 3.3.
