Supported tar formatsÂ¶
There are three tar formats that can be created with the  module:

The POSIX.1-1988 ustar format (). It supports filenames
up to a length of at best 256 characters and linknames up to 100 characters. The
maximum file size is 8 GiB. This is an old and limited but widely
supported format.

The GNU tar format (). It supports long filenames and
linknames, files bigger than 8 GiB and sparse files. It is the de facto
standard on GNU/Linux systems.  fully supports the GNU tar
extensions for long names, sparse file support is read-only.

The POSIX.1-2001 pax format (). It is the most flexible
format with virtually no limits. It supports long filenames and linknames, large
files and stores pathnames in a portable way. However, not all tar
implementations today are able to handle pax archives properly.
The pax format is an extension to the existing ustar format. It uses extra
headers for information that cannot be stored otherwise. There are two flavours
of pax headers: Extended headers only affect the subsequent file header, global
headers are valid for the complete archive and affect all following files. All
the data in a pax header is encoded in UTF-8 for portability reasons.


There are some more variants of the tar format which can be read, but not
created:

The ancient V7 format. This is the first tar format from Unix Seventh Edition,
storing only regular files and directories. Names must not be longer than 100
characters, there is no user/group name information. Some archives have
miscalculated header checksums in case of fields with non-ASCII characters.
The SunOS tar extended format. This format is a variant of the POSIX.1-2001
pax format, but is not compatible.
