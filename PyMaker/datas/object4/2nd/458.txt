()¶
Return a copy of the string with all the cased characters [4] converted to
uppercase.  Note that  might be  if 
contains uncased characters or if the Unicode category of the resulting
character(s) is not “Lu” (Letter, uppercase), but e.g. “Lt” (Letter,
titlecase).
The uppercasing algorithm used is described in section 3.13 of the Unicode
Standard.
