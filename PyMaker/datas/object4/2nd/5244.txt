docs:


Â¶
Hostname of the server:  type, or  for server-side
socket or if the hostname was not specified in the constructor.

New in version 3.2.


Changed in version 3.7: The attribute is now always ASCII text. When  is
an internationalized domain name (IDN), this attribute now stores the
A-label form (), rather than the U-label form
().
