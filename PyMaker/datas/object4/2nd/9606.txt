(path_item)Â¶
Retrieve a finder for the given path_item.
The returned finder is cached in  if it was
newly created by a path hook.
The cache (or part of it) can be cleared manually if a rescan of
 is necessary.

Changed in version 3.3: Updated to be based directly on  rather than relying
on the package internal PEP 302 import emulation.
