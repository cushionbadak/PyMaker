docs:


()Â¶
Take a snapshot of traces of memory blocks allocated by Python. Return a new
 instance.
The snapshot does not include memory blocks allocated before the
 module started to trace memory allocations.
Tracebacks of traces are limited to  frames. Use
the nframe parameter of the  function to store more frames.
The  module must be tracing memory allocations to take a
snapshot, see the  function.
See also the  function.
