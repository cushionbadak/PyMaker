6.14. Expression lists¶

Except when part of a list or set display, an expression list
containing at least one comma yields a tuple.  The length of
the tuple is the number of expressions in the list.  The expressions are
evaluated from left to right.
An asterisk  denotes iterable unpacking.  Its operand must be
an iterable.  The iterable is expanded into a sequence of items,
which are included in the new tuple, list, or set, at the site of
the unpacking.

New in version 3.5: Iterable unpacking in expression lists, originally proposed by PEP 448.

The trailing comma is required only to create a single tuple (a.k.a. a
singleton); it is optional in all other cases.  A single expression without a
trailing comma doesn’t create a tuple, but rather yields the value of that
expression. (To create an empty tuple, use an empty pair of parentheses:
.)
