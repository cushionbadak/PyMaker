class (out=None, encoding='iso-8859-1', short_empty_elements=False)Â¶
This class implements the  interface
by writing SAX
events back into an XML document. In other words, using an 
as the content handler will reproduce the original document being parsed. out
should be a file-like object which will default to sys.stdout. encoding is
the encoding of the output stream which defaults to .
short_empty_elements controls the formatting of elements that contain no
content:  if  (the default) they are emitted as a pair of start/end
tags, if set to  they are emitted as a single self-closed tag.

New in version 3.2: The short_empty_elements parameter.
