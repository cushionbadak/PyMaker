(name)¶
Return the value of the named header field.  name should not include the
colon field separator.  If the header is missing,  is returned; a
 is never raised.
Note that if the named field appears more than once in the message’s
headers, exactly which of those field values will be returned is
undefined.  Use the  method to get the values of all the
extant named headers.
