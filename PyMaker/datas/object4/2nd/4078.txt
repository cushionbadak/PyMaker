Â¶
Assign a ctypes type to specify the result type of the foreign function.
Use  for , a function not returning anything.
It is possible to assign a callable Python object that is not a ctypes
type, in this case the function is assumed to return a C , and
the callable will be called with this integer, allowing further
processing or error checking.  Using this is deprecated, for more flexible
post processing or error checking use a ctypes data type as
 and assign a callable to the  attribute.
