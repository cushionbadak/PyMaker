 — Drop-in replacement for the  module¶
Source code: Lib/dummy_threading.py

Deprecated since version 3.7: Python now always has threading enabled.  Please use  instead.


This module provides a duplicate interface to the  module.
It was meant to be imported when the  module was not provided
on a platform.
Be careful to not use this module where deadlock might occur from a thread being
created that blocks waiting for another thread to be created.  This often occurs
with blocking I/O.
