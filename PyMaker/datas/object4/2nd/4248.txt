Using a pool of workersÂ¶
The  class represents a pool of worker
processes.  It has methods which allows tasks to be offloaded to the worker
processes in a few different ways.
For example:


Note that the methods of a pool should only ever be used by the
process which created it.

Note
Functionality within this package requires that the  module be
importable by the children. This is covered in Programming guidelines
however it is worth pointing out here. This means that some examples, such
as the  examples will not work in the
interactive interpreter. For example:


(If you try this it will actually output three full tracebacks
interleaved in a semi-random fashion, and then you may have to
stop the master process somehow.)
