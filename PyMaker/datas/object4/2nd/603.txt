docs:


()Â¶
Enter the runtime context and return either this object or another object
related to the runtime context. The value returned by this method is bound to
the identifier in the  clause of  statements using
this context manager.

File objects return themselves from __enter__() to allow  to be
used as the context expression in a  statement.
An example of a context manager that returns a related object is the one
returned by . These managers set the active
decimal context to a copy of the original decimal context and then return the
copy. This allows changes to be made to the current decimal context in the body
of the  statement without affecting code outside the
 statement.
