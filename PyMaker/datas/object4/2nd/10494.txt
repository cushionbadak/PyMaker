(who)¶
This function returns an object that describes the resources consumed by either
the current process or its children, as specified by the who parameter.  The
who parameter should be specified using one of the 
constants described below.
The fields of the return value each describe how a particular system resource
has been used, e.g. amount of time spent running is user mode or number of times
the process was swapped out of main memory. Some values are dependent on the
clock tick internal, e.g. the amount of memory the process is using.
For backward compatibility, the return value is also accessible as a tuple of 16
elements.
The fields  and  of the return value are
floating point values representing the amount of time spent executing in user
mode and the amount of time spent executing in system mode, respectively. The
remaining values are integers. Consult the getrusage(2) man page for
detailed information about these values. A brief summary is presented here:

This function will raise a  if an invalid who parameter is
specified. It may also raise  exception in unusual circumstances.
