docs:


(name, value)¶
Retrieves the specialized header associated with name from the
registry (using default_class if name does not appear in the
registry) and composes it with base_class to produce a class,
calls the constructed class’s constructor, passing it the same
argument list, and finally returns the class instance created thereby.
