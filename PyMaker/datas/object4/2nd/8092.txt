()Â¶
Enable keyboard traversal for a toplevel window containing this notebook.
This will extend the bindings for the toplevel window containing the
notebook as follows:

Control-Tab: selects the tab following the currently selected one.
Shift-Control-Tab: selects the tab preceding the currently selected one.
Alt-K: where K is the mnemonic (underlined) character of any tab, will
select that tab.

Multiple notebooks in a single toplevel may be enabled for traversal,
including nested notebooks. However, notebook traversal only works
properly if all panes have the notebook they are in as master.
