docs:


(object_list, timeout=None)Â¶
Wait till an object in object_list is ready.  Returns the list of
those objects in object_list which are ready.  If timeout is a
float then the call blocks for at most that many seconds.  If
timeout is  then it will block for an unlimited period.
A negative timeout is equivalent to a zero timeout.
For both Unix and Windows, an object can appear in object_list if
it is

a readable  object;
a connected and readable  object; or
the  attribute of a
 object.

A connection or socket object is ready when there is data available
to be read from it, or the other end has been closed.
Unix:  almost equivalent
.  The difference is
that, if  is interrupted by a signal, it can
raise  with an error number of , whereas
 will not.
Windows: An item in object_list must either be an integer
handle which is waitable (according to the definition used by the
documentation of the Win32 function )
or it can be an object with a  method which returns a
socket handle or pipe handle.  (Note that pipe handles and socket
handles are not waitable handles.)

New in version 3.3.
