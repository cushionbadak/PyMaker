docs:


()Â¶
Return the current state of the decoder. This must be a tuple with two
items, the first must be the buffer containing the still undecoded
input. The second must be an integer and can be additional state
info. (The implementation should make sure that  is the most common
additional state info.) If this additional state info is  it must be
possible to set the decoder to the state which has no input buffered and
 as the additional state info, so that feeding the previously
buffered input to the decoder returns it to the previous state without
producing any output. (Additional state info that is more complicated than
integers can be converted into an integer by marshaling/pickling the info
and encoding the bytes of the resulting string into an integer.)
