docs:


(name, package=None)Â¶
Find the spec for a module, optionally relative to
the specified package name. If the module is in ,
then  is returned (unless the spec would be
 or is not set, in which case  is raised).
Otherwise a search using  is done.  is
returned if no spec is found.
If name is for a submodule (contains a dot), the parent module is
automatically imported.
name and package work the same as for .

New in version 3.4.


Changed in version 3.7: Raises  instead of  if
package is in fact not a package (i.e. lacks a 
attribute).
