File Operations¶


(fd, mode, nbytes)¶
Lock part of a file based on file descriptor fd from the C runtime.  Raises
 on failure.  The locked region of the file extends from the
current file position for nbytes bytes, and may continue beyond the end of the
file.  mode must be one of the  constants listed below. Multiple
regions in a file may be locked at the same time, but may not overlap.  Adjacent
regions are not merged; they must be unlocked individually.



¶

¶
Locks the specified bytes. If the bytes cannot be locked, the program
immediately tries again after 1 second.  If, after 10 attempts, the bytes cannot
be locked,  is raised.



¶

¶
Locks the specified bytes. If the bytes cannot be locked,  is
raised.



¶
Unlocks the specified bytes, which must have been previously locked.



(fd, flags)¶
Set the line-end translation mode for the file descriptor fd. To set it to
text mode, flags should be ; for binary, it should be
.



(handle, flags)¶
Create a C runtime file descriptor from the file handle handle.  The flags
parameter should be a bitwise OR of , ,
and .  The returned file descriptor may be used as a parameter
to  to create a file object.



(fd)¶
Return the file handle for the file descriptor fd.  Raises  if
fd is not recognized.
