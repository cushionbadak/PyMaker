docs:


(signalnum, flag)Â¶
Change system call restart behaviour: if flag is , system
calls will be restarted when interrupted by signal signalnum, otherwise
system calls will be interrupted.  Returns nothing.
Availability: Unix (see the man page siginterrupt(3)
for further information).
Note that installing a signal handler with  will reset the
restart behaviour to interruptible by implicitly calling
 with a true flag value for the given signal.
