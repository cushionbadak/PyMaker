coroutine ()Â¶
Returns an awaitable that when run will throw a  into
the asynchronous generator function at the point where it was paused.
If the asynchronous generator function then exits gracefully, is already
closed, or raises  (by not catching the exception),
then the returned awaitable will raise a  exception.
Any further awaitables returned by subsequent calls to the asynchronous
generator will raise a  exception.  If the
asynchronous generator yields a value, a  is raised
by the awaitable.  If the asynchronous generator raises any other exception,
it is propagated to the caller of the awaitable.  If the asynchronous
generator has already exited due to an exception or normal exit, then
further calls to  will return an awaitable that does nothing.
