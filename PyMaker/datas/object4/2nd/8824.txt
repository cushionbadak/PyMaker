docs:


(name, fresh=(), blocked=(), deprecated=False)Â¶
This function imports and returns a fresh copy of the named Python module
by removing the named module from  before doing the import.
Note that unlike , the original module is not affected by
this operation.
fresh is an iterable of additional module names that are also removed
from the  cache before doing the import.
blocked is an iterable of module names that are replaced with 
in the module cache during the import to ensure that attempts to import
them raise .
The named module and any modules named in the fresh and blocked
parameters are saved before starting the import and then reinserted into
 when the fresh import is complete.
Module and package deprecation messages are suppressed during this import
if deprecated is .
This function will raise  if the named module cannot be
imported.
