Binary Objects¶


class ¶
This class may be initialized from bytes data (which may include NULs). The
primary access to the content of a  object is provided by an
attribute:


¶
The binary data encapsulated by the  instance.  The data is
provided as a  object.

 objects have the following methods, supported mainly for
internal use by the marshalling/unmarshalling code:


(bytes)¶
Accept a base64  object and decode it as the instance’s new data.



(out)¶
Write the XML-RPC base 64 encoding of this binary item to the out stream object.
The encoded data will have newlines every 76 characters as per
RFC 2045 section 6.8,
which was the de facto standard base64 specification when the
XML-RPC spec was written.

It also supports certain of Python’s built-in operators through 
and  methods.

Example usage of the binary objects.  We’re going to transfer an image over
XMLRPC:


The client gets the image and saves it to a file:
