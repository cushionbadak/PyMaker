(msg, *args, **kwargs)¶
Logs a message with level  on the root logger. The msg is the
message format string, and the args are the arguments which are merged into
msg using the string formatting operator. (Note that this means that you can
use keywords in the format string, together with a single dictionary argument.)
There are three keyword arguments in kwargs which are inspected: exc_info
which, if it does not evaluate as false, causes exception information to be
added to the logging message. If an exception tuple (in the format returned by
) or an exception instance is provided, it is used;
otherwise,  is called to get the exception information.
The second optional keyword argument is stack_info, which defaults to
. If true, stack information is added to the logging
message, including the actual logging call. Note that this is not the same
stack information as that displayed through specifying exc_info: The
former is stack frames from the bottom of the stack up to the logging call
in the current thread, whereas the latter is information about stack frames
which have been unwound, following an exception, while searching for
exception handlers.
You can specify stack_info independently of exc_info, e.g. to just show
how you got to a certain point in your code, even when no exceptions were
raised. The stack frames are printed following a header line which says:


This mimics the  which is used when
displaying exception frames.
The third optional keyword argument is extra which can be used to pass a
dictionary which is used to populate the __dict__ of the LogRecord created for
the logging event with user-defined attributes. These custom attributes can then
be used as you like. For example, they could be incorporated into logged
messages. For example:


would print something like:


The keys in the dictionary passed in extra should not clash with the keys used
by the logging system. (See the  documentation for more
information on which keys are used by the logging system.)
If you choose to use these attributes in logged messages, you need to exercise
some care. In the above example, for instance, the  has been
set up with a format string which expects ‘clientip’ and ‘user’ in the attribute
dictionary of the LogRecord. If these are missing, the message will not be
logged because a string formatting exception will occur. So in this case, you
always need to pass the extra dictionary with these keys.
While this might be annoying, this feature is intended for use in specialized
circumstances, such as multi-threaded servers where the same code executes in
many contexts, and interesting conditions which arise are dependent on this
context (such as remote client IP address and authenticated user name, in the
above example). In such circumstances, it is likely that specialized
s would be used with particular s.

New in version 3.2: The stack_info parameter was added.
