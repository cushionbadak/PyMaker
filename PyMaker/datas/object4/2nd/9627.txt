IntroductionÂ¶
The purpose of the  package is two-fold. One is to provide the
implementation of the  statement (and thus, by extension, the
 function) in Python source code. This provides an
implementation of  which is portable to any Python
interpreter. This also provides an implementation which is easier to
comprehend than one implemented in a programming language other than Python.
Two, the components to implement  are exposed in this
package, making it easier for users to create their own custom objects (known
generically as an importer) to participate in the import process.
