(path)¶
Perform a  system call on the given path.  The return value is
an object whose attributes describe the filesystem on the given path, and
correspond to the members of the  structure, namely:
, , , ,
, , , ,
, , .
Two module-level constants are defined for the  attribute’s
bit-flags: if  is set, the filesystem is mounted
read-only, and if  is set, the semantics of
setuid/setgid bits are disabled or not supported.
Additional module-level constants are defined for GNU/glibc based systems.
These are  (disallow access to device special files),
 (disallow program execution), 
(writes are synced at once),  (allow mandatory locks on an FS),
 (write on file/directory/symlink), 
(append-only file),  (immutable file), 
(do not update access times),  (do not update directory access
times),  (update atime relative to mtime/ctime).
This function can support specifying a file descriptor.
Availability: Unix.

Changed in version 3.2: The  and  constants were added.
