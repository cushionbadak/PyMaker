Text and CDATASection Objects¶
The  interface represents text in the XML document.  If the parser
and DOM implementation support the DOM’s XML extension, portions of the text
enclosed in CDATA marked sections are stored in  objects.
These two interfaces are identical, but provide different values for the
 attribute.
These interfaces extend the  interface.  They cannot have child
nodes.


¶
The content of the text node as a string.


Note
The use of a  node does not indicate that the node
represents a complete CDATA marked section, only that the content of the node
was part of a CDATA section.  A single CDATA section may be represented by more
than one node in the document tree.  There is no way to determine whether two
adjacent  nodes represent different CDATA marked sections.
