(name)Â¶
Return the maximum allowed number of headers named name.
Called when a header is added to an 
or  object.  If the returned value is not
 or , and there are already a number of headers with the
name name greater than or equal to the value returned, a
 is raised.
Because the default behavior of  is to append the
value to the list of headers, it is easy to create duplicate headers
without realizing it.  This method allows certain headers to be limited
in the number of instances of that header that may be added to a
 programmatically.  (The limit is not observed by the parser,
which will faithfully produce as many headers as exist in the message
being parsed.)
The default implementation returns  for all header names.
