Parsing arguments¶
The whole point of creating and populating an OptionParser is to call its
 method:


where the input parameters are


the list of arguments to process (default: )

an  object to store option arguments in (default: a
new instance of ) – if you give an existing object, the
option defaults will not be initialized on it

and the return values are


the same object that was passed in as , or the optparse.Values
instance created by 

the leftover positional arguments after all options have been processed

The most common usage is to supply neither keyword argument.  If you supply
, it will be modified with repeated  calls (roughly one
for every option argument stored to an option destination) and returned by
.
If  encounters any errors in the argument list, it calls the
OptionParser’s  method with an appropriate end-user error message.
This ultimately terminates your process with an exit status of 2 (the
traditional Unix exit status for command-line errors).
