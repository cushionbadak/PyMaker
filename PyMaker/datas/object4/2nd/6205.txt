NodeList Objects¶
A  represents a sequence of nodes.  These objects are used in
two ways in the DOM Core recommendation:  an  object provides
one as its list of child nodes, and the  and
 methods of  return objects with this
interface to represent query results.
The DOM Level 2 recommendation defines one method and one attribute for these
objects:


(i)¶
Return the i’th item from the sequence, if there is one, or .  The
index i is not allowed to be less than zero or greater than or equal to the
length of the sequence.



¶
The number of nodes in the sequence.

In addition, the Python DOM interface requires that some additional support is
provided to allow  objects to be used as Python sequences.  All
 implementations must include support for
 and
; this allows iteration over the  in
 statements and proper support for the  built-in
function.
If a DOM implementation supports modification of the document, the
 implementation must also support the
 and  methods.
