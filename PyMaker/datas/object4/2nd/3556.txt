(**kwargs)¶
Does basic configuration for the logging system by creating a
 with a default  and adding it to the
root logger. The functions , , ,
 and  will call  automatically
if no handlers are defined for the root logger.
This function does nothing if the root logger already has handlers
configured for it.

Note
This function should be called from the main thread
before other threads are started. In versions of Python prior to
2.7.1 and 3.2, if this function is called from multiple threads,
it is possible (in rare circumstances) that a handler will be added
to the root logger more than once, leading to unexpected results
such as messages being duplicated in the log.

The following keyword arguments are supported.






Format
Description



filename
Specifies that a FileHandler be created,
using the specified filename, rather than a
StreamHandler.

filemode
If filename is specified, open the file
in this mode. Defaults
to .

format
Use the specified format string for the
handler.

datefmt
Use the specified date/time format, as
accepted by .

style
If format is specified, use this style
for the format string. One of ,
 or  for printf-style,
 or
 respectively.
Defaults to .

level
Set the root logger level to the specified
level.

stream
Use the specified stream to initialize the
StreamHandler. Note that this argument is
incompatible with filename - if both
are present, a  is raised.

handlers
If specified, this should be an iterable of
already created handlers to add to the root
logger. Any handlers which don’t already
have a formatter set will be assigned the
default formatter created in this function.
Note that this argument is incompatible
with filename or stream - if both
are present, a  is raised.




Changed in version 3.2: The style argument was added.


Changed in version 3.3: The handlers argument was added. Additional checks were added to
catch situations where incompatible arguments are specified (e.g.
handlers together with stream or filename, or stream
together with filename).
