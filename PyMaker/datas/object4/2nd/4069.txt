class (name, mode=DEFAULT_MODE, handle=None, use_errno=False, use_last_error=False)Â¶
Windows only: Instances of this class represent loaded shared libraries,
functions in these libraries use the  calling convention, and are
assumed to return the windows specific  code.  
values contain information specifying whether the function call failed or
succeeded, together with additional error code.  If the return value signals a
failure, an  is automatically raised.

Changed in version 3.3:  used to be raised.
