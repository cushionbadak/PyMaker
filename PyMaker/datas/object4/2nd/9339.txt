(new_target)Â¶
Context manager for temporarily redirecting  to
another file or file-like object.
This tool adds flexibility to existing functions or classes whose output
is hardwired to stdout.
For example, the output of  normally is sent to sys.stdout.
You can capture that output in a string by redirecting the output to an
 object:


To send the output of  to a file on disk, redirect the output
to a regular file:


To send the output of  to sys.stderr:


Note that the global side effect on  means that this
context manager is not suitable for use in library code and most threaded
applications. It also has no effect on the output of subprocesses.
However, it is still a useful approach for many utility scripts.
This context manager is reentrant.

New in version 3.4.
