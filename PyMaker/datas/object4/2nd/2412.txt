(authorizer_callback)¶
This routine registers a callback. The callback is invoked for each attempt to
access a column of a table in the database. The callback should return
 if access is allowed,  if the entire SQL
statement should be aborted with an error and  if the
column should be treated as a NULL value. These constants are available in the
 module.
The first argument to the callback signifies what kind of operation is to be
authorized. The second and third argument will be arguments or 
depending on the first argument. The 4th argument is the name of the database
(“main”, “temp”, etc.) if applicable. The 5th argument is the name of the
inner-most trigger or view that is responsible for the access attempt or
 if this access attempt is directly from input SQL code.
Please consult the SQLite documentation about the possible values for the first
argument and the meaning of the second and third argument depending on the first
one. All necessary constants are available in the  module.
