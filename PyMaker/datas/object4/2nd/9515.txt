(func, *, stop=None)Â¶
Get the object wrapped by func. It follows the chain of 
attributes returning the last object in the chain.
stop is an optional callback accepting an object in the wrapper chain
as its sole argument that allows the unwrapping to be terminated early if
the callback returns a true value. If the callback never returns a true
value, the last object in the chain is returned as usual. For example,
 uses this to stop unwrapping if any object in the
chain has a  attribute defined.
 is raised if a cycle is encountered.

New in version 3.4.
