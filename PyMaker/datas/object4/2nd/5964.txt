docs:


(type, ext, strict=True)Â¶
Add a mapping from the MIME type type to the extension ext. When the
extension is already known, the new type will replace the old one. When the type
is already known the extension will be added to the list of known extensions.
When strict is  (the default), the mapping will be added to the
official MIME types, otherwise to the non-standard ones.
