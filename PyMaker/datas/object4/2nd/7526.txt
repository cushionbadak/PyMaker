(fragment, width, state)Â¶
Convert samples to 4 bit Intel/DVI ADPCM encoding.  ADPCM coding is an adaptive
coding scheme, whereby each 4 bit number is the difference between one sample
and the next, divided by a (varying) step.  The Intel/DVI ADPCM algorithm has
been selected for use by the IMA, so it may well become a standard.
state is a tuple containing the state of the coder.  The coder returns a tuple
, and the newstate should be passed to the next call
of .  In the initial call,  can be passed as the state.
adpcmfrag is the ADPCM coded fragment packed 2 4-bit values per byte.
