Describing Warning Filters¶
The warnings filter is initialized by  options passed to the Python
interpreter command line and the  environment variable.
The interpreter saves the arguments for all supplied entries without
interpretation in ; the  module parses these
when it is first imported (invalid options are ignored, after printing a
message to ).
Individual warnings filters are specified as a sequence of fields separated by
colons:


The meaning of each of these fields is as described in The Warnings Filter.
When listing multiple filters on a single line (as for
), the individual filters are separated by commas,and
the filters listed later take precedence over those listed before them (as
they’re applied left-to-right, and the most recently applied filters take
precedence over earlier ones).
Commonly used warning filters apply to either all warnings, warnings in a
particular category, or warnings raised by particular modules or packages.
Some examples:
