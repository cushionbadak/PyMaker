6.2.1. Identifiers (Names)Â¶
An identifier occurring as an atom is a name.  See section Identifiers and keywords
for lexical definition and section Naming and binding for documentation of naming and
binding.
When the name is bound to an object, evaluation of the atom yields that object.
When a name is not bound, an attempt to evaluate it raises a 
exception.
Private name mangling: When an identifier that textually occurs in a class
definition begins with two or more underscore characters and does not end in two
or more underscores, it is considered a private name of that class.
Private names are transformed to a longer form before code is generated for
them.  The transformation inserts the class name, with leading underscores
removed and a single underscore inserted, in front of the name.  For example,
the identifier  occurring in a class named  will be transformed
to .  This transformation is independent of the syntactical
context in which the identifier is used.  If the transformed name is extremely
long (longer than 255 characters), implementation defined truncation may happen.
If the class name consists only of underscores, no transformation is done.
