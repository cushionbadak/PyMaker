()¶

()¶
Return a copy of the sequence with all the lowercase ASCII characters
converted to their corresponding uppercase counterpart.
For example:


Lowercase ASCII characters are those byte values in the sequence
. Uppercase ASCII characters
are those byte values in the sequence .

Note
The bytearray version of this method does not operate in place - it
always produces a new object, even if no changes were made.
