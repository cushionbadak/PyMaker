([timeout])Â¶
Return whether there is any data available to be read.
If timeout is not specified then it will return immediately.  If
timeout is a number then this specifies the maximum time in seconds to
block.  If timeout is  then an infinite timeout is used.
Note that multiple connection objects may be polled at once by
using .
