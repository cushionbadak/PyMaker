Unpacker Objects¶
The  class offers the following methods:


(data)¶
Resets the string buffer with the given data.



()¶
Returns the current unpack position in the data buffer.



(position)¶
Sets the data buffer unpack position to position.  You should be careful about
using  and .



()¶
Returns the current unpack data buffer as a string.



()¶
Indicates unpack completion.  Raises an  exception if all of the
data has not been unpacked.

In addition, every data type that can be packed with a , can be
unpacked with an .  Unpacking methods are of the form
, and take no arguments.  They return the unpacked object.


()¶
Unpacks a single-precision floating point number.



()¶
Unpacks a double-precision floating point number, similarly to
.

In addition, the following methods unpack strings, bytes, and opaque data:


(n)¶
Unpacks and returns a fixed length string.  n is the number of characters
expected.  Padding with null bytes to guaranteed 4 byte alignment is assumed.



(n)¶
Unpacks and returns a fixed length opaque data stream, similarly to
.



()¶
Unpacks and returns a variable length string.  The length of the string is first
unpacked as an unsigned integer, then the string data is unpacked with
.



()¶
Unpacks and returns a variable length opaque data string, similarly to
.



()¶
Unpacks and returns a variable length byte stream, similarly to
.

The following methods support unpacking arrays and lists:


(unpack_item)¶
Unpacks and returns a list of homogeneous items.  The list is unpacked one
element at a time by first unpacking an unsigned integer flag.  If the flag is
, then the item is unpacked and appended to the list.  A flag of 
indicates the end of the list.  unpack_item is the function that is called to
unpack the items.



(n, unpack_item)¶
Unpacks and returns (as a list) a fixed length array of homogeneous items.  n
is number of list elements to expect in the buffer. As above, unpack_item is
the function used to unpack each element.



(unpack_item)¶
Unpacks and returns a variable length list of homogeneous items. First, the
length of the list is unpacked as an unsigned integer, then each element is
unpacked as in  above.
