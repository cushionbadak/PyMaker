Base Transport¶


()¶
Close the transport.
If the transport has a buffer for outgoing
data, buffered data will be flushed asynchronously.  No more data
will be received.  After all buffered data is flushed, the
protocol’s  method will be called with
 as its argument.



()¶
Return  if the transport is closing or is closed.



(name, default=None)¶
Return information about the transport or underlying resources
it uses.
name is a string representing the piece of transport-specific
information to get.
default is the value to return if the information is not
available, or if the transport does not support querying it
with the given third-party event loop implementation or on the
current platform.
For example, the following code attempts to get the underlying
socket object of the transport:


Categories of information that can be queried on some transports:

socket:
: the remote address to which the socket is
connected, result of 
( on error)
:  instance
: the socket’s own address,
result of 


SSL socket:
: the compression algorithm being used as a
string, or  if the connection isn’t compressed; result
of 
: a three-value tuple containing the name of the
cipher being used, the version of the SSL protocol that defines
its use, and the number of secret bits being used; result of

: peer certificate; result of

:  instance
:  or
 instance


pipe:
: pipe object


subprocess:
:  instance






(protocol)¶
Set a new protocol.
Switching protocol should only be done when both
protocols are documented to support the switch.



()¶
Return the current protocol.
