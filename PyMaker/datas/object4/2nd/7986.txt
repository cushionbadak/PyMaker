Cmd ExampleÂ¶
The  module is mainly useful for building custom shells that let a
user work with a program interactively.
This section presents a simple example of how to build a shell around a few of
the commands in the  module.
Basic turtle commands such as  are added to a
 subclass with method named .  The argument is
converted to a number and dispatched to the turtle module.  The docstring is
used in the help utility provided by the shell.
The example also includes a basic record and playback facility implemented with
the  method which is responsible for converting the input to
lowercase and writing the commands to a file.  The  method
reads the file and adds the recorded commands to the  for
immediate playback:


Here is a sample session with the turtle shell showing the help functions, using
blank lines to repeat commands, and the simple record and playback facility:
