(func)Â¶
Transform an old-style comparison function to a key function.  Used
with tools that accept key functions (such as , ,
, , ,
).  This function is primarily used as a transition
tool for programs being converted from Python 2 which supported the use of
comparison functions.
A comparison function is any callable that accept two arguments, compares them,
and returns a negative number for less-than, zero for equality, or a positive
number for greater-than.  A key function is a callable that accepts one
argument and returns another value to be used as the sort key.
Example:
