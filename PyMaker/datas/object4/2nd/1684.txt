docs:


(other, context=None)Â¶
Return the result of shifting the digits of the first operand by an amount
specified by the second operand.  The second operand must be an integer in
the range -precision through precision.  The absolute value of the second
operand gives the number of places to shift.  If the second operand is
positive then the shift is to the left; otherwise the shift is to the
right.  Digits shifted into the coefficient are zeros.  The sign and
exponent of the first operand are unchanged.
