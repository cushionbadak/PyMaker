class (completekey='tab', stdin=None, stdout=None)¶
A  instance or subclass instance is a line-oriented interpreter
framework.  There is no good reason to instantiate  itself; rather,
it’s useful as a superclass of an interpreter class you define yourself in order
to inherit ’s methods and encapsulate action methods.
The optional argument completekey is the  name of a completion
key; it defaults to Tab. If completekey is not  and
 is available, command completion is done automatically.
The optional arguments stdin and stdout specify the  input and output file
objects that the Cmd instance or subclass  instance will use for input and
output. If not specified, they will default to  and
.
If you want a given stdin to be used, make sure to set the instance’s
 attribute to , otherwise stdin will be
ignored.
