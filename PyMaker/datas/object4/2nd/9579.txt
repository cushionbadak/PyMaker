(source, filename="<input>", symbol="single")Â¶
Tries to compile source, which should be a string of Python code and return a
code object if source is valid Python code. In that case, the filename
attribute of the code object will be filename, which defaults to
. Returns  if source is not valid Python code, but is a
prefix of valid Python code.
If there is a problem with source, an exception will be raised.
 is raised if there is invalid Python syntax, and
 or  if there is an invalid literal.
The symbol argument determines whether source is compiled as a statement
(, the default) or as an expression ().  Any
other value will cause  to  be raised.

Note
It is possible (but not likely) that the parser stops parsing with a
successful outcome before reaching the end of the source; in this case,
trailing symbols may be ignored instead of causing an error.  For example,
a backslash followed by two newlines may be followed by arbitrary garbage.
This will be fixed once the API for the parser is better.
