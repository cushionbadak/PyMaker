5.2.1. Regular packages¶
Python defines two types of packages, regular packages and namespace packages.  Regular
packages are traditional packages as they existed in Python 3.2 and earlier.
A regular package is typically implemented as a directory containing an
 file.  When a regular package is imported, this
 file is implicitly executed, and the objects it defines are
bound to names in the package’s namespace.  The  file can
contain the same Python code that any other module can contain, and Python
will add some additional attributes to the module when it is imported.
For example, the following file system layout defines a top level 
package with three subpackages:


Importing  will implicitly execute  and
.  Subsequent imports of  or
 will execute  and
 respectively.
