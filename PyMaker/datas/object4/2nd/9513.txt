(func, *args, **kwds)Â¶
Bind the args and kwds to the argument names of the Python function or
method func, as if it was called with them. For bound methods, bind also the
first argument (typically named ) to the associated instance. A dict
is returned, mapping the argument names (including the names of the  and
 arguments, if any) to their values from args and kwds. In case of
invoking func incorrectly, i.e. whenever  would raise
an exception because of incompatible signature, an exception of the same type
and the same or similar message is raised. For example:



New in version 3.2.


Deprecated since version 3.5: Use  and  instead.
