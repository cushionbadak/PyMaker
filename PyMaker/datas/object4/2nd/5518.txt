()¶
Return an iterator over all of the immediate sub-parts of the message
that are not candidate “body” parts.  That is, skip the first occurrence
of each of , , , or
 (unless they are explicitly marked as
attachments via Content-Disposition: attachment), and
return all remaining parts.  When applied directly to a
, return an iterator over the all the related parts
except the root part (ie: the part pointed to by the  parameter,
or the first part if there is no  parameter or the 
parameter doesn’t match the Content-ID of any of the
parts).  When applied directly to a  or a
non-, return an empty iterator.
