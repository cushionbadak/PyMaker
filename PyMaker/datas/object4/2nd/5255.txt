()¶
Load a set of default “certification authority” (CA) certificates from
a filesystem path defined when building the OpenSSL library.  Unfortunately,
there’s no easy way to know whether this method succeeds: no error is
returned if no certificates are to be found.  When the OpenSSL library is
provided as part of the operating system, though, it is likely to be
configured properly.
