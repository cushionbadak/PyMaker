(filename, arcname=None, compress_type=None, compresslevel=None)Â¶
Write the file named filename to the archive, giving it the archive name
arcname (by default, this will be the same as filename, but without a drive

overrides the value given for the compression parameter to the constructor for
the new entry. Similarly, compresslevel will override the constructor if
given.

Archive names should be relative to the archive root, that is, they should not
start with a path separator.

a closed ZipFile will raise a .  Previously,
a  was raised.
