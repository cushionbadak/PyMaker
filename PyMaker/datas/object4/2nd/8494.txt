docs:


()¶
Returns a description of the test, or  if no description
has been provided.  The default implementation of this method
returns the first line of the test method’s docstring, if available,
or .

Changed in version 3.1: In 3.1 this was changed to add the test name to the short description
even in the presence of a docstring.  This caused compatibility issues
with unittest extensions and adding the test name was moved to the
 in Python 3.2.
