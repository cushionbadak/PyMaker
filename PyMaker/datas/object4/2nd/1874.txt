(iterable, key=None)¶
Make an iterator that returns consecutive keys and groups from the iterable.
The key is a function computing a key value for each element.  If not
specified or is , key defaults to an identity function and returns
the element unchanged.  Generally, the iterable needs to already be sorted on
the same key function.
The operation of  is similar to the  filter in Unix.  It
generates a break or new group every time the value of the key function changes
(which is why it is usually necessary to have sorted the data using the same key
function).  That behavior differs from SQL’s GROUP BY which aggregates common
elements regardless of their input order.
The returned group is itself an iterator that shares the underlying iterable
with .  Because the source is shared, when the 
object is advanced, the previous group is no longer visible.  So, if that data
is needed later, it should be stored as a list:


 is roughly equivalent to:
