class Â¶
Enable stricter semantics for mixing floats and Decimals.
If the signal is not trapped (default), mixing floats and Decimals is
permitted in the  constructor,
 and all comparison operators.
Both conversion and comparisons are exact. Any occurrence of a mixed
operation is silently recorded by setting  in the
context flags. Explicit conversions with 
or  do not set the flag.
Otherwise (the signal is trapped), only equality comparisons and explicit
conversions are silent. All other mixed operations raise .
