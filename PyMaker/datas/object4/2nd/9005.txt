()¶
This method for the  class removes all leading path
information from file names.  It is very useful in reducing the size of
the printout to fit within (close to) 80 columns.  This method modifies
the object, and the stripped information is lost.  After performing a
strip operation, the object is considered to have its entries in a
“random” order, as it was just after object initialization and loading.
If  causes two function names to be
indistinguishable (they are on the same line of the same filename, and
have the same function name), then the statistics for these two entries
are accumulated into a single entry.
