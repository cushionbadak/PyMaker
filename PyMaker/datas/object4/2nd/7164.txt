Examples¶

 Example¶
This is the server side:


An alternative request handler class that makes use of streams (file-like
objects that simplify communication by providing the standard file interface):


The difference is that the  call in the second handler will call
 multiple times until it encounters a newline character, while the
single  call in the first handler will just return what has been sent
from the client in one  call.
This is the client side:


The output of the example should look something like this:
Server:


Client:




 Example¶
This is the server side:


This is the client side:


The output of the example should look exactly like for the TCP server example.


Asynchronous Mixins¶
To build asynchronous handlers, use the  and
 classes.
An example for the  class:


The output of the example should look something like this:


The  class is used in the same way, except that the server
will spawn a new process for each request.
Available only on POSIX platforms that support .
