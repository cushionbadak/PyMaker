docs:


(bytes, entropy)Â¶
Mix the given bytes into the SSL pseudo-random number generator.  The
parameter entropy (a float) is a lower bound on the entropy contained in
string (so you can always use ).  See RFC 1750 for more
information on sources of entropy.

Changed in version 3.5: Writable bytes-like object is now accepted.
