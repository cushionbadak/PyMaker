(environ)¶
Return a guess for whether  should be “http” or “https”, by
checking for a  environment variable in the environ dictionary.  The
return value is a string.
This function is useful when creating a gateway that wraps CGI or a CGI-like
protocol such as FastCGI.  Typically, servers providing such protocols will
include a  variable with a value of “1” “yes”, or “on” when a request
is received via SSL.  So, this function returns “https” if such a value is
found, and “http” otherwise.
