docs:


(max_size=0, mode='w+b', buffering=None, encoding=None, newline=None, suffix=None, prefix=None, dir=None)¶
This function operates exactly as  does, except that
data is spooled in memory until the file size exceeds max_size, or
until the file’s  method is called, at which point the
contents are written to disk and operation proceeds as with
.
The resulting file has one additional method, , which
causes the file to roll over to an on-disk file regardless of its size.
The returned object is a file-like object whose  attribute
is either an  or  object (depending on
whether binary or text mode was specified) or a true file
object, depending on whether  has been called.  This
file-like object can be used in a  statement, just like
a normal file.

Changed in version 3.3: the truncate method now accepts a  argument.
