Panel Objects¶
Panel objects, as returned by  above, are windows with a
stacking order. There’s always a window associated with a panel which determines
the content, while the panel methods are responsible for the window’s depth in
the panel stack.
Panel objects have the following methods:


()¶

Returns the panel below the current panel.



()¶
Push the panel to the bottom of the stack.

screen invisible.



(y, x)¶
Move the panel to the screen coordinates .



(win)¶
Change the window associated with the panel to the window win.

piece of data with the panel, and can be any Python object.
