docs:


(sub[, start[, end]])Â¶
Returns the highest index in the object where the subsequence sub is
found, such that sub is contained in the range [start, end].
Optional arguments start and end are interpreted as in slice notation.
Returns  on failure.

Changed in version 3.5: Writable bytes-like object is now accepted.
