 — Interface based on ndbm¶
Source code: Lib/dbm/ndbm.py

The  module provides an interface to the Unix “(n)dbm” library.
Dbm objects behave like mappings (dictionaries), except that keys and values are
always stored as bytes. Printing a  object doesn’t print the keys and
values, and the  and  methods are not supported.
This module can be used with the “classic” ndbm interface or the GNU GDBM
compatibility interface. On Unix, the configure script will attempt
to locate the appropriate header file to simplify building this module.


exception ¶
Raised on -specific errors, such as I/O errors.  is raised
for general mapping errors like specifying an incorrect key.



¶
Name of the  implementation library used.



(filename[, flag[, mode]])¶
Open a dbm database and return a  object.  The filename argument is the
name of the database file (without the  or  extensions).
The optional flag argument must be one of these values:






Value
Meaning




Open existing database for reading only
(default)


Open existing database for reading and
writing


Open database for reading and writing,
creating it if it doesn’t exist


Always create a new, empty database, open
for reading and writing



The optional mode argument is the Unix mode of the file, used only when the
database has to be created.  It defaults to octal  (and will be
modified by the prevailing umask).
In addition to the dictionary-like methods,  objects
provide the following method:


()¶
Close the  database.
