(pid, options)Â¶
The details of this function differ on Unix and Windows.
On Unix: Wait for completion of a child process given by process id pid, and
return a tuple containing its process id and exit status indication (encoded as
for ).  The semantics of the call are affected by the value of the
integer options, which should be  for normal operation.
If pid is greater than ,  requests status information for
that specific process.  If pid is , the request is for the status of any
child in the process group of the current process.  If pid is , the
request pertains to any child of the current process.  If pid is less than
, status is requested for any process in the process group  (the
absolute value of pid).
An  is raised with the value of errno when the syscall
returns -1.
On Windows: Wait for completion of a process given by process handle pid, and
return a tuple containing pid, and its exit status shifted left by 8 bits
(shifting makes cross-platform use of the function easier). A pid less than or
equal to  has no special meaning on Windows, and raises an exception. The
value of integer options has no effect. pid can refer to any process whose
id is known, not necessarily a child process. The 
functions called with  return suitable process handles.

Changed in version 3.5: If the system call is interrupted and the signal handler does not raise an
exception, the function now retries the system call instead of raising an
 exception (see PEP 475 for the rationale).
