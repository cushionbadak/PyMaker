docs:


(exporter)¶
A memoryview and a PEP 3118 exporter are equal if their shapes are
equivalent and if all corresponding values are equal when the operands’
respective format codes are interpreted using  syntax.
For the subset of  format strings currently supported by
,  and  are equal if :


If either format string is not supported by the  module,
then the objects will always compare as unequal (even if the format
strings and buffer contents are identical):


Note that, as with floating point numbers,  does not imply
 for memoryview objects.

Changed in version 3.3: Previous versions compared the raw memory disregarding the item format
and the logical array structure.
