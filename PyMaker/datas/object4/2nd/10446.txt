(argv[, master_read[, stdin_read]])¶
Spawn a process, and connect its controlling terminal with the current
process’s standard io. This is often used to baffle programs which insist on
reading from the controlling terminal. It is expected that the process
spawned behind the pty will eventually terminate, and when it does spawn
will return.
The functions master_read and stdin_read are passed a file descriptor
which they should read from, and they should always return a byte string. In
order to force spawn to return before the child process exits an
 should be thrown.
The default implementation for both functions will read and return up to 1024
bytes each time the function is called. The master_read callback is passed
the pseudoterminal’s master file descriptor to read output from the child
process, and stdin_read is passed file descriptor 0, to read from the
parent process’s standard input.
Returning an empty byte string from either callback is interpreted as an
end-of-file (EOF) condition, and that callback will not be called after
that. If stdin_read signals EOF the controlling terminal can no longer
communicate with the parent process OR the child process. Unless the child
process will quit without any input, spawn will then loop forever. If
master_read signals EOF the same behavior results (on linux at least).
If both callbacks signal EOF then spawn will probably never return, unless
select throws an error on your platform when passed three empty lists. This
is a bug, documented in issue 26228.

Changed in version 3.4:  now returns the status value from 
on the child process.
