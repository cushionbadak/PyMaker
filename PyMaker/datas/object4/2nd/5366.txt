abstractmethod (fileobj, events, data=None)Â¶
Register a file object for selection, monitoring it for I/O events.
fileobj is the file object to monitor.  It may either be an integer
file descriptor or an object with a  method.
events is a bitwise mask of events to monitor.
data is an opaque object.
This returns a new  instance, or raises a
 in case of invalid event mask or file descriptor, or
 if the file object is already registered.
