docs:


(path=".", members=None, *, numeric_owner=False)¶
Extract all members from the archive to the current working directory or
directory path. If optional members is given, it must be a subset of the
list returned by . Directory information like owner,
modification time and permissions are set after all members have been extracted.
This is done to work around two problems: A directory’s modification time is
reset each time a file is created in it. And, if a directory’s permissions do
not allow writing, extracting files to it will fail.
If numeric_owner is , the uid and gid numbers from the tarfile
are used to set the owner/group for the extracted files. Otherwise, the named
values from the tarfile are used.

Warning
Never extract archives from untrusted sources without prior inspection.
It is possible that files are created outside of path, e.g. members
that have absolute filenames starting with  or filenames with two
dots .


Changed in version 3.5: Added the numeric_owner parameter.


Changed in version 3.6: The path parameter accepts a path-like object.
