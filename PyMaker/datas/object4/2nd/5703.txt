(param, failobj=None, header='content-type', unquote=True)¶
Return the value of the Content-Type header’s parameter
param as a string.  If the message has no Content-Type
header or if there is no such parameter, then failobj is returned
(defaults to ).
Optional header if given, specifies the message header to use instead of
Content-Type.
Parameter keys are always compared case insensitively.  The return value
can either be a string, or a 3-tuple if the parameter was RFC 2231
encoded.  When it’s a 3-tuple, the elements of the value are of the form
.  Note that both  and
 can be , in which case you should consider 
to be encoded in the  charset.  You can usually ignore
.
If your application doesn’t care whether the parameter was encoded as in
RFC 2231, you can collapse the parameter value by calling
, passing in the return value
from .  This will return a suitably decoded Unicode
string when the value is a tuple, or the original string unquoted if it
isn’t.  For example:


In any case, the parameter value (either the returned string, or the
 item in the 3-tuple) is always unquoted, unless unquote is set
to .
This is a legacy method.  On the
 class its functionality is
replaced by the params property of the individual header objects
returned by the header access methods.
