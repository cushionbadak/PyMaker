When a generator or coroutine function
returns, a new  instance is
raised, and the value returned by the function is used as the
 parameter to the constructor of the exception.

use it to return a value.


Changed in version 3.5: Introduced the RuntimeError transformation via

Changed in version 3.7: Enable PEP 479 for all code by default: a 
error raised in a generator is transformed into a .
