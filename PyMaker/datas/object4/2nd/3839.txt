docs:


([validator])Â¶
This is the entry point you will normally use.  It accepts editing
keystrokes until one of the termination keystrokes is entered.  If
validator is supplied, it must be a function.  It will be called for
each keystroke entered with the keystroke as a parameter; command dispatch
is done on the result. This method returns the window contents as a
string; whether blanks in the window are included is affected by the
 attribute.
