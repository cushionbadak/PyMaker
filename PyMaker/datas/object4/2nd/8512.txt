(name, module=None)¶
Return a suite of all test cases given a string specifier.
The specifier name is a “dotted name” that may resolve either to a
module, a test case class, a test method within a test case class, a
 instance, or a callable object which returns a
 or  instance.  These checks are
applied in the order listed here; that is, a method on a possible test
case class will be picked up as “a test method within a test case class”,
rather than “a callable object”.
For example, if you have a module  containing a
-derived class  with three test
methods (, , and ), the
specifier  would cause this method to
return a suite which will run all three test methods. Using the specifier
 would cause it to return a test
suite which will run only the  test method. The specifier
can refer to modules and packages which have not been imported; they will
be imported as a side-effect.
The method optionally resolves name relative to the given module.

Changed in version 3.5: If an  or  occurs while traversing
name then a synthetic test that raises that error when run will be
returned. These errors are included in the errors accumulated by
self.errors.
