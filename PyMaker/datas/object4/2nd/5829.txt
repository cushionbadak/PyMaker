docs:


(message)¶
Add message to the mailbox and return the key that has been assigned to
it.
Parameter message may be a  instance, an
 instance, a string, a byte string, or a
file-like object (which should be open in binary mode). If message is
an instance of the
appropriate format-specific  subclass (e.g., if it’s an
 instance and this is an  instance), its
format-specific information is used. Otherwise, reasonable defaults for
format-specific information are used.

Changed in version 3.2: Support for binary input was added.
