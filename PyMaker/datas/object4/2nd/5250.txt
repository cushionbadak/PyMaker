(certfile, keyfile=None, password=None)¶
Load a private key and the corresponding certificate.  The certfile
string must be the path to a single file in PEM format containing the
certificate as well as any number of CA certificates needed to establish
the certificate’s authenticity.  The keyfile string, if present, must
point to a file containing the private key in.  Otherwise the private
key will be taken from certfile as well.  See the discussion of
Certificates for more information on how the certificate
is stored in the certfile.
The password argument may be a function to call to get the password for
decrypting the private key.  It will only be called if the private key is
encrypted and a password is necessary.  It will be called with no arguments,
and it should return a string, bytes, or bytearray.  If the return value is
a string it will be encoded as UTF-8 before using it to decrypt the key.
Alternatively a string, bytes, or bytearray value may be supplied directly
as the password argument.  It will be ignored if the private key is not
encrypted and no password is needed.
If the password argument is not specified and a password is required,
OpenSSL’s built-in password prompting mechanism will be used to
interactively prompt the user for a password.
An  is raised if the private key doesn’t
match with the certificate.

Changed in version 3.3: New optional argument password.
