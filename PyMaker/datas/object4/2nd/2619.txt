docs:


(member, path="", set_attrs=True, *, numeric_owner=False)Â¶
Extract a member from the archive to the current working directory, using its
full name. Its file information is extracted as accurately as possible. member
may be a filename or a  object. You can specify a different
directory using path. path may be a path-like object.
File attributes (owner, mtime, mode) are set unless set_attrs is false.
If numeric_owner is , the uid and gid numbers from the tarfile
are used to set the owner/group for the extracted files. Otherwise, the named
values from the tarfile are used.

Note
The  method does not take care of several extraction issues.
In most cases you should consider using the  method.
