(dt)¶
Return the time zone name corresponding to the  object dt, as
a string. Nothing about string names is defined by the  module,
and there’s no requirement that it mean anything in particular.  For example,
“GMT”, “UTC”, “-500”, “-5:00”, “EDT”, “US/Eastern”, “America/New York” are all
valid replies.  Return  if a string name isn’t known.  Note that this is
a method rather than a fixed string primarily because some 
subclasses will wish to return different names depending on the specific value
of dt passed, especially if the  class is accounting for
daylight time.
The default implementation of  raises .
