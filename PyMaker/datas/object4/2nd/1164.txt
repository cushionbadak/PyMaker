class Â¶
This is an abstract base class, meaning that this class should not be
instantiated directly.  You need to derive a concrete subclass, and (at least)
supply implementations of the standard  methods needed by the
 methods you use.  The  module supplies
a simple concrete subclass of , , which can represent
timezones with fixed offset from UTC such as UTC itself or North American EST and
EDT.
An instance of (a concrete subclass of)  can be passed to the
constructors for  and  objects. The latter objects
view their attributes as being in local time, and the  object
supports methods revealing offset of local time from UTC, the name of the time
zone, and DST offset, all relative to a date or time object passed to them.
Special requirement for pickling:  A  subclass must have an
 method that can be called with no arguments, else it can be
pickled but possibly not unpickled again.  This is a technical requirement that
may be relaxed in the future.
A concrete subclass of  may need to implement the following
methods.  Exactly which methods are needed depends on the uses made of aware
 objects.  If in doubt, simply implement all of them.
