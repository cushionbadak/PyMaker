docs:


([size])¶
Read and return up to size bytes, with at most one call to the
underlying raw stream’s  (or
) method.  This can be useful if you are
implementing your own buffering on top of a 
object.
If size is  (the default), an arbitrary number of bytes are
returned (more than zero unless EOF is reached).
