class (raw, buffer_size=DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE)¶
A buffer providing higher-level access to a writeable, sequential
 object.  It inherits .
When writing to this object, data is normally placed into an internal
buffer.  The buffer will be written out to the underlying 
object under various conditions, including:

when the buffer gets too small for all pending data;
when  is called;
when a  is requested (for  objects);
when the  object is closed or destroyed.

The constructor creates a  for the given writeable
raw stream.  If the buffer_size is not given, it defaults to
.
 provides or overrides these methods in addition to
those from  and :


()¶
Force bytes held in the buffer into the raw stream.  A
 should be raised if the raw stream blocks.



(b)¶
Write the bytes-like object, b, and return the
number of bytes written.  When in non-blocking mode, a
 is raised if the buffer needs to be written out but
the raw stream blocks.
