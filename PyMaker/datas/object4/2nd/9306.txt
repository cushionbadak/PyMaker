Available Context Managers¶


class (*, record=False, module=None)¶
A context manager that copies and, upon exit, restores the warnings filter
and the  function.
If the record argument is  (the default) the context manager
returns  on entry. If record is , a list is
returned that is progressively populated with objects as seen by a custom
 function (which also suppresses output to ).
Each object in the list has attributes with the same names as the arguments to
.
The module argument takes a module that will be used instead of the
module returned when you import  whose filter will be
protected. This argument exists primarily for testing the 
module itself.

Note
The  manager works by replacing and
then later restoring the module’s
 function and internal list of filter
specifications.  This means the context manager is modifying
global state and therefore is not thread-safe.
