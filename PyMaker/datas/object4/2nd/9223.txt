¶
An object containing information about the implementation of the
currently running Python interpreter.  The following attributes are
required to exist in all Python implementations.
name is the implementation’s identifier, e.g. .  The actual
string is defined by the Python implementation, but it is guaranteed to be
lower case.
version is a named tuple, in the same format as
.  It represents the version of the Python
implementation.  This has a distinct meaning from the specific
version of the Python language to which the currently running
interpreter conforms, which  represents.  For
example, for PyPy 1.8  might be
, whereas 
would be .  For CPython they
are the same value, since it is the reference implementation.
hexversion is the implementation version in hexadecimal format, like
.
cache_tag is the tag used by the import machinery in the filenames of
cached modules.  By convention, it would be a composite of the
implementation’s name and version, like .  However, a
Python implementation may use some other value if appropriate.  If
 is set to , it indicates that module caching should
be disabled.
 may contain additional attributes specific to
the Python implementation.  These non-standard attributes must start with
an underscore, and are not described here.  Regardless of its contents,
 will not change during a run of the interpreter,
nor between implementation versions.  (It may change between Python
language versions, however.)  See PEP 421 for more information.

New in version 3.3.
