()Â¶
Leave newline mode.  Disable translation of return into newline on input, and
disable low-level translation of newline into newline/return on output (but this
does not change the behavior of , which always does the
equivalent of return and line feed on the virtual screen).  With translation
off, curses can sometimes speed up vertical motion a little; also, it will be
able to detect the return key on input.
