()¶
Fork a child process, using a new pseudo-terminal as the child’s controlling
terminal. Return a pair of , where pid is  in the child, the
new child’s process id in the parent, and fd is the file descriptor of the
master end of the pseudo-terminal.  For a more portable approach, use the
 module.  If an error occurs  is raised.
Availability: some flavors of Unix.
