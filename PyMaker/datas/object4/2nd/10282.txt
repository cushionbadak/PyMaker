 — Useful routines from the MS VC++ runtime¶

These functions provide access to some useful capabilities on Windows platforms.
Some higher-level modules use these functions to build the  Windows
implementations of their services.  For example, the  module uses
this in the implementation of the  function.
Further documentation on these functions can be found in the Platform API
documentation.
The module implements both the normal and wide char variants of the console I/O
api. The normal API deals only with ASCII characters and is of limited use
for internationalized applications. The wide char API should be used where
ever possible.

Changed in version 3.3: Operations in this module now raise  where 
was raised.


File Operations¶


(fd, mode, nbytes)¶
Lock part of a file based on file descriptor fd from the C runtime.  Raises
 on failure.  The locked region of the file extends from the
current file position for nbytes bytes, and may continue beyond the end of the
file.  mode must be one of the  constants listed below. Multiple
regions in a file may be locked at the same time, but may not overlap.  Adjacent
regions are not merged; they must be unlocked individually.



¶

¶
Locks the specified bytes. If the bytes cannot be locked, the program
immediately tries again after 1 second.  If, after 10 attempts, the bytes cannot
be locked,  is raised.



¶

¶
Locks the specified bytes. If the bytes cannot be locked,  is
raised.



¶
Unlocks the specified bytes, which must have been previously locked.



(fd, flags)¶
Set the line-end translation mode for the file descriptor fd. To set it to
text mode, flags should be ; for binary, it should be
.



(handle, flags)¶
Create a C runtime file descriptor from the file handle handle.  The flags
parameter should be a bitwise OR of , ,
and .  The returned file descriptor may be used as a parameter
to  to create a file object.



(fd)¶
Return the file handle for the file descriptor fd.  Raises  if
fd is not recognized.



Console I/O¶


()¶
Return true if a keypress is waiting to be read.



()¶
Read a keypress and return the resulting character as a byte string.
Nothing is echoed to the console.  This call will block if a keypress
is not already available, but will not wait for Enter to be
pressed. If the pressed key was a special function key, this will
return  or ; the next call will return the keycode.
The Control-C keypress cannot be read with this function.



()¶
Wide char variant of , returning a Unicode value.



()¶
Similar to , but the keypress will be echoed if it  represents a
printable character.



()¶
Wide char variant of , returning a Unicode value.



(char)¶
Print the byte string char to the console without buffering.



(unicode_char)¶
Wide char variant of , accepting a Unicode value.



(char)¶
Cause the byte string char to be “pushed back” into the console buffer;
it will be the next character read by  or .



(unicode_char)¶
Wide char variant of , accepting a Unicode value.



Other Functions¶


()¶
Force the  heap to clean itself up and return unused blocks to
the operating system.  On failure, this raises .
