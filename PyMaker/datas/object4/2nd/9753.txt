Â¶
A decorator for 
to set the 
attribute on the returned module. If the attribute is already set the
decorator does nothing. It is assumed that the first positional argument to
the wrapped method (i.e. ) is what  should be set
to.

Changed in version 3.4: Set  if set to , as if the attribute does not
exist.


Deprecated since version 3.4: The import machinery takes care of this automatically.
