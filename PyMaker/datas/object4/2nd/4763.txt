docs:


()Â¶
Get the current event loop.  If there is no current event loop set
in the current OS thread and  has not yet
been called, asyncio will create a new event loop and set it as the
current one.
Because this function has rather complex behavior (especially
when custom event loop policies are in use), using the
 function is preferred to 
in coroutines and callbacks.
Consider also using the  function instead of using
lower level functions to manually create and close an event loop.
