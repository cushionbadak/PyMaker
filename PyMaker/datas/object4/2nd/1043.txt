class (stream, errors='strict')¶
Constructor for a  instance.
All stream readers must provide this constructor interface. They are free to add
additional keyword arguments, but only the ones defined here are used by the
Python codec registry.
The stream argument must be a file-like object open for reading
text or binary data, as appropriate for the specific codec.
The  may implement different error handling schemes by
providing the errors keyword argument. See Error Handlers for
the standard error handlers the underlying stream codec may support.
The errors argument will be assigned to an attribute of the same name.
Assigning to this attribute makes it possible to switch between different error
handling strategies during the lifetime of the  object.
The set of allowed values for the errors argument can be extended with
.


([size[, chars[, firstline]]])¶
Decodes data from the stream and returns the resulting object.
The chars argument indicates the number of decoded
code points or bytes to return. The  method will
never return more data than requested, but it might return less,
if there is not enough available.
The size argument indicates the approximate maximum
number of encoded bytes or code points to read
for decoding. The decoder can modify this setting as
appropriate. The default value -1 indicates to read and decode as much as
possible.  This parameter is intended to
prevent having to decode huge files in one step.
The firstline flag indicates that
it would be sufficient to only return the first
line, if there are decoding errors on later lines.
The method should use a greedy read strategy meaning that it should read
as much data as is allowed within the definition of the encoding and the
given size, e.g.  if optional encoding endings or state markers are
available on the stream, these should be read too.



([size[, keepends]])¶
Read one line from the input stream and return the decoded data.
size, if given, is passed as size argument to the stream’s
 method.
If keepends is false line-endings will be stripped from the lines
returned.



([sizehint[, keepends]])¶
Read all lines available on the input stream and return them as a list of
lines.
Line-endings are implemented using the codec’s decoder method and are
included in the list entries if keepends is true.
sizehint, if given, is passed as the size argument to the stream’s
 method.



()¶
Resets the codec buffers used for keeping state.
Note that no stream repositioning should take place.  This method is
primarily intended to be able to recover from decoding errors.
