docs:


(*, limit=None)Â¶
Return the list of stack frames for this Task.
If the wrapped coroutine is not done, this returns the stack
where it is suspended.  If the coroutine has completed
successfully or was cancelled, this returns an empty list.
If the coroutine was terminated by an exception, this returns
the list of traceback frames.
The frames are always ordered from oldest to newest.
Only one stack frame is returned for a suspended coroutine.
The optional limit argument sets the maximum number of frames
to return; by default all available frames are returned.
The ordering of the returned list differs depending on whether
a stack or a traceback is returned: the newest frames of a
stack are returned, but the oldest frames of a traceback are
returned.  (This matches the behavior of the traceback module.)
