DocCGIXMLRPCRequestHandler¶
The  class is derived from
 and provides a means of creating
self-documenting, XML-RPC CGI scripts. HTTP POST requests are handled as XML-RPC
method calls. HTTP GET requests are handled by generating pydoc-style HTML
documentation. This allows a server to provide its own web-based documentation.


(server_title)¶
Set the title used in the generated HTML documentation. This title will be used
inside the HTML “title” element.



(server_name)¶
Set the name used in the generated HTML documentation. This name will appear at
the top of the generated documentation inside a “h1” element.



(server_documentation)¶
Set the description used in the generated HTML documentation. This description
will appear as a paragraph, below the server name, in the documentation.
