Simple Usage: Checking Examples in a Text File¶
Another simple application of doctest is testing interactive examples in a text
file.  This can be done with the  function:


That short script executes and verifies any interactive Python examples
contained in the file .  The file content is treated as if it
were a single giant docstring; the file doesn’t need to contain a Python
program!   For example, perhaps  contains this:


Running  then finds the error in this
documentation:


As with ,  won’t display anything unless an
example fails.  If an example does fail, then the failing example(s) and the
cause(s) of the failure(s) are printed to stdout, using the same format as
.
By default,  looks for files in the calling module’s directory.
See section Basic API for a description of the optional arguments
that can be used to tell it to look for files in other locations.
Like , ’s verbosity can be set with the
 command-line switch or with the optional keyword argument
verbose.
There is also a command line shortcut for running .  You can
instruct the Python interpreter to run the doctest module directly from the
standard library and pass the file name(s) on the command line:


Because the file name does not end with ,  infers that
it must be run with , not .
