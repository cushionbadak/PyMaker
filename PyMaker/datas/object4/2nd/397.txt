Generator Types¶
Python’s generators provide a convenient way to implement the iterator
protocol.  If a container object’s  method is implemented as a
generator, it will automatically return an iterator object (technically, a
generator object) supplying the  and 
methods.
More information about generators can be found in the documentation for
the yield expression.
