6.6. Unary arithmetic and bitwise operationsÂ¶
All unary arithmetic and bitwise operations have the same priority:

The unary  (minus) operator yields the negation of its numeric argument.
The unary  (plus) operator yields its numeric argument unchanged.
The unary  (invert) operator yields the bitwise inversion of its integer
argument.  The bitwise inversion of  is defined as .  It only
applies to integral numbers.
In all three cases, if the argument does not have the proper type, a
 exception is raised.
