The spawn and forkserver start methods¶
There are a few extra restriction which don’t apply to the fork
start method.
More picklability

Ensure that all arguments to  are picklable.
Also, if you subclass  then make sure that
instances will be picklable when the  method is called.
Global variables

Bear in mind that if code run in a child process tries to access a global
variable, then the value it sees (if any) may not be the same as the value
in the parent process at the time that  was called.
However, global variables which are just module level constants cause no
problems.

Safe importing of main module

Make sure that the main module can be safely imported by a new Python
interpreter without causing unintended side effects (such a starting a new
process).
For example, using the spawn or forkserver start method
running the following module would fail with a
:


Instead one should protect the “entry point” of the program by using  as follows:


(The  line can be omitted if the program will be run
normally instead of frozen.)
This allows the newly spawned Python interpreter to safely import the module
and then run the module’s  function.
Similar restrictions apply if a pool or manager is created in the main
module.
