Temporarily Suppressing WarningsÂ¶
If you are using code that you know will raise a warning, such as a deprecated
function, but do not want to see the warning (even when warnings have been
explicitly configured via the command line), then it is possible to suppress
the warning using the  context manager:


While within the context manager all warnings will simply be ignored. This
allows you to use known-deprecated code without having to see the warning while
not suppressing the warning for other code that might not be aware of its use
of deprecated code.  Note: this can only be guaranteed in a single-threaded
application. If two or more threads use the  context
manager at the same time, the behavior is undefined.
