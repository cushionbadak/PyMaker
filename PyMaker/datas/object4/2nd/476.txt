(suffix[, start[, end]])¶
Return  if the binary data ends with the specified suffix,
otherwise return .  suffix can also be a tuple of suffixes to
look for.  With optional start, test beginning at that position.  With
optional end, stop comparing at that position.
The suffix(es) to search for may be any bytes-like object.
