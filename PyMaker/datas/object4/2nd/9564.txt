(banner=None, readfunc=None, local=None, exitmsg=None)Â¶
Convenience function to run a read-eval-print loop.  This creates a new
instance of  and sets readfunc to be used as
the  method, if provided.  If local is
provided, it is passed to the  constructor for
use as the default namespace for the interpreter loop.  The 
method of the instance is then run with banner and exitmsg passed as the
banner and exit message to use, if provided.  The console object is discarded
after use.

Changed in version 3.6: Added exitmsg parameter.
