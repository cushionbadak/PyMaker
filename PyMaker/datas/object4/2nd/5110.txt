docs:


(bytes, address)¶

(bytes, flags, address)
Send data to the socket.  The socket should not be connected to a remote socket,
since the destination socket is specified by address.  The optional flags
argument has the same meaning as for  above.  Return the number of
bytes sent. (The format of address depends on the address family — see
above.)

Changed in version 3.5: If the system call is interrupted and the signal handler does not raise
an exception, the method now retries the system call instead of raising
an  exception (see PEP 475 for the rationale).
