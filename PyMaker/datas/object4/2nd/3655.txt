HTTPHandler¶
The  class, located in the  module,
supports sending logging messages to a Web server, using either  or
 semantics.


class (host, url, method='GET', secure=False, credentials=None, context=None)¶
Returns a new instance of the  class. The host can be
of the form , should you need to use a specific port number.  If
no method is specified,  is used. If secure is true, a HTTPS
connection will be used. The context parameter may be set to a
 instance to configure the SSL settings used for the
HTTPS connection. If credentials is specified, it should be a 2-tuple
consisting of userid and password, which will be placed in a HTTP
‘Authorization’ header using Basic authentication. If you specify
credentials, you should also specify secure=True so that your userid and
password are not passed in cleartext across the wire.

Changed in version 3.5: The context parameter was added.



(record)¶
Provides a dictionary, based on , which is to be URL-encoded
and sent to the web server. The default implementation just returns
. This method can be overridden if e.g. only a
subset of  is to be sent to the web server, or
if more specific customization of what’s sent to the server is required.



(record)¶
Sends the record to the Web server as a URL-encoded dictionary. The
 method is used to convert the record to the
dictionary to be sent.


Note
Since preparing a record for sending it to a Web server is not
the same as a generic formatting operation, using
 to specify a
 for a  has no effect.
Instead of calling , this handler calls
 and then  to encode the
dictionary in a form suitable for sending to a Web server.
