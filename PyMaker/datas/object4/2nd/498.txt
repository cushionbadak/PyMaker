(table, delete=b'')¶

(table, delete=b'')¶
Return a copy of the bytes or bytearray object where all bytes occurring in
the optional argument delete are removed, and the remaining bytes have
been mapped through the given translation table, which must be a bytes
object of length 256.
You can use the  method to create a translation
table.
Set the table argument to  for translations that only delete
characters:



Changed in version 3.6: delete is now supported as a keyword argument.
