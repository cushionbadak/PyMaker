(sep)¶

(sep)¶
Split the sequence at the first occurrence of sep, and return a 3-tuple
containing the part before the separator, the separator itself or its
bytearray copy, and the part after the separator.
If the separator is not found, return a 3-tuple
containing a copy of the original sequence, followed by two empty bytes or
bytearray objects.
The separator to search for may be any bytes-like object.
