docs:


¶
A pickler object’s dispatch table is a registry of reduction
functions of the kind which can be declared using
.  It is a mapping whose keys are classes
and whose values are reduction functions.  A reduction function
takes a single argument of the associated class and should
conform to the same interface as a 
method.
By default, a pickler object will not have a
 attribute, and it will instead use the
global dispatch table managed by the  module.
However, to customize the pickling for a specific pickler object
one can set the  attribute to a dict-like
object.  Alternatively, if a subclass of  has a
 attribute then this will be used as the
default dispatch table for instances of that class.
See Dispatch Tables for usage examples.

New in version 3.3.
