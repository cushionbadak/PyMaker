class (blocked_domains=None, allowed_domains=None, netscape=True, rfc2965=False, rfc2109_as_netscape=None, hide_cookie2=False, strict_domain=False, strict_rfc2965_unverifiable=True, strict_ns_unverifiable=False, strict_ns_domain=DefaultCookiePolicy.DomainLiberal, strict_ns_set_initial_dollar=False, strict_ns_set_path=False)¶
Constructor arguments should be passed as keyword arguments only.
blocked_domains is a sequence of domain names that we never accept cookies
from, nor return cookies to. allowed_domains if not , this is a
sequence of the only domains for which we accept and return cookies.  For all
other arguments, see the documentation for  and
 objects.
 implements the standard accept / reject rules for
Netscape and RFC 2965 cookies.  By default, RFC 2109 cookies (ie. cookies
received in a Set-Cookie header with a version cookie-attribute of
1) are treated according to the RFC 2965 rules.  However, if RFC 2965 handling
is turned off or  is , RFC 2109 cookies are
‘downgraded’ by the  instance to Netscape cookies, by
setting the  attribute of the  instance to 0.
 also provides some parameters to allow some
fine-tuning of policy.
