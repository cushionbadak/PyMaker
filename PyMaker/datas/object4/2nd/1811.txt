Bookkeeping functions¶


(a=None, version=2)¶
Initialize the random number generator.
If a is omitted or , the current system time is used.  If
randomness sources are provided by the operating system, they are used
instead of the system time (see the  function for details
on availability).
If a is an int, it is used directly.
With version 2 (the default), a , , or 
object gets converted to an  and all of its bits are used.
With version 1 (provided for reproducing random sequences from older versions
of Python), the algorithm for  and  generates a
narrower range of seeds.

Changed in version 3.2: Moved to the version 2 scheme which uses all of the bits in a string seed.




()¶
Return an object capturing the current internal state of the generator.  This
object can be passed to  to restore the state.



(state)¶
state should have been obtained from a previous call to , and
 restores the internal state of the generator to what it was at
the time  was called.



(k)¶
Returns a Python integer with k random bits. This method is supplied with
the MersenneTwister generator and some other generators may also provide it
as an optional part of the API. When available,  enables
 to handle arbitrarily large ranges.
