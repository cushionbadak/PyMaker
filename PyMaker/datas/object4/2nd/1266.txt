(typename, field_names, *, rename=False, defaults=None, module=None)Â¶
Returns a new tuple subclass named typename.  The new subclass is used to
create tuple-like objects that have fields accessible by attribute lookup as
well as being indexable and iterable.  Instances of the subclass also have a
helpful docstring (with typename and field_names) and a helpful 
method which lists the tuple contents in a  format.
The field_names are a sequence of strings such as .
Alternatively, field_names can be a single string with each fieldname
separated by whitespace and/or commas, for example  or .
Any valid Python identifier may be used for a fieldname except for names
starting with an underscore.  Valid identifiers consist of letters, digits,
and underscores but do not start with a digit or underscore and cannot be
a  such as class, for, return, global, pass,
or raise.
If rename is true, invalid fieldnames are automatically replaced
with positional names.  For example,  is
converted to , eliminating the keyword
 and the duplicate fieldname .
defaults can be  or an iterable of default values.
Since fields with a default value must come after any fields without a
default, the defaults are applied to the rightmost parameters.  For
example, if the fieldnames are  and the defaults are
, then  will be a required argument,  will default to
, and  will default to .
If module is defined, the  attribute of the named tuple is
set to that value.
Named tuple instances do not have per-instance dictionaries, so they are
lightweight and require no more memory than regular tuples.

Changed in version 3.1: Added support for rename.


Changed in version 3.6: The verbose and rename parameters became
keyword-only arguments.


Changed in version 3.6: Added the module parameter.


Changed in version 3.7: Remove the verbose parameter and the  attribute.


Changed in version 3.7: Added the defaults parameter and the 
attribute.
