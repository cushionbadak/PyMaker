docs:


(path, *, dir_fd=None)Â¶
Remove (delete) the file path.  If path is a directory,  is
raised.  Use  to remove directories.
This function can support paths relative to directory descriptors.
On Windows, attempting to remove a file that is in use causes an exception to
be raised; on Unix, the directory entry is removed but the storage allocated
to the file is not made available until the original file is no longer in use.
This function is semantically identical to .

New in version 3.3: The dir_fd argument.


Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a path-like object.
