docs:


(function=None, name=None)Â¶
Register a function that can respond to XML-RPC requests.  If name is given,
it will be the method name associated with function, otherwise
 will be used.  name is a string, and may contain
characters not legal in Python identifiers, including the period character.
This method can also be used as a decorator.  When used as a decorator,
name can only be given as a keyword argument to register function under
name.  If no name is given,  will be used.

Changed in version 3.7:  can be used as a decorator.
