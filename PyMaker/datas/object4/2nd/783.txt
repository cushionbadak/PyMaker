(string[, pos[, endpos]])Â¶
Scan through string looking for the first location where this regular
expression produces a match, and return a corresponding match object.  Return  if no position in the string matches the
pattern; note that this is different from finding a zero-length match at some
point in the string.
The optional second parameter pos gives an index in the string where the
search is to start; it defaults to .  This is not completely equivalent to
slicing the string; the  pattern character matches at the real beginning
of the string and at positions just after a newline, but not necessarily at the
index where the search is to start.
The optional parameter endpos limits how far the string will be searched; it
will be as if the string is endpos characters long, so only the characters
from pos to  will be searched for a match.  If endpos is less
than pos, no match will be found; otherwise, if rx is a compiled regular
expression object,  is equivalent to
.
