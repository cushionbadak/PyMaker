class ([default_factory[, ...]])¶
Returns a new dictionary-like object.   is a subclass of the
built-in  class.  It overrides one method and adds one writable
instance variable.  The remaining functionality is the same as for the
 class and is not documented here.
The first argument provides the initial value for the 
attribute; it defaults to . All remaining arguments are treated the same
as if they were passed to the  constructor, including keyword
arguments.
 objects support the following method in addition to the
standard  operations:


(key)¶
If the  attribute is , this raises a
 exception with the key as argument.
If  is not , it is called without arguments
to provide a default value for the given key, this value is inserted in
the dictionary for the key, and returned.
If calling  raises an exception this exception is
propagated unchanged.
This method is called by the  method of the
 class when the requested key is not found; whatever it
returns or raises is then returned or raised by .
Note that  is not called for any operations besides
. This means that  will, like normal
dictionaries, return  as a default rather than using
.

 objects support the following instance variable:


¶
This attribute is used by the  method; it is
initialized from the first argument to the constructor, if present, or to
, if absent.
