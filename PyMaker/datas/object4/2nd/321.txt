(function, iterable)Â¶
Construct an iterator from those elements of iterable for which function
returns true.  iterable may be either a sequence, a container which
supports iteration, or an iterator.  If function is , the identity
function is assumed, that is, all elements of iterable that are false are
removed.
Note that  is equivalent to the generator
expression  if function is
not  and  if function is
.
See  for the complementary function that returns
elements of iterable for which function returns false.
