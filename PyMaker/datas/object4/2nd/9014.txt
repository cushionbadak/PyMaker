Limitations¶
One limitation has to do with accuracy of timing information. There is a
fundamental problem with deterministic profilers involving accuracy.  The most
obvious restriction is that the underlying “clock” is only ticking at a rate
(typically) of about .001 seconds.  Hence no measurements will be more accurate
than the underlying clock.  If enough measurements are taken, then the “error”
will tend to average out. Unfortunately, removing this first error induces a
second source of error.
The second problem is that it “takes a while” from when an event is dispatched
until the profiler’s call to get the time actually gets the state of the
clock.  Similarly, there is a certain lag when exiting the profiler event
handler from the time that the clock’s value was obtained (and then squirreled
away), until the user’s code is once again executing.  As a result, functions
that are called many times, or call many functions, will typically accumulate
this error. The error that accumulates in this fashion is typically less than
the accuracy of the clock (less than one clock tick), but it can accumulate
and become very significant.
The problem is more important with  than with the lower-overhead
.  For this reason,  provides a means of
calibrating itself for a given platform so that this error can be
probabilistically (on the average) removed. After the profiler is calibrated, it
will be more accurate (in a least square sense), but it will sometimes produce
negative numbers (when call counts are exceptionally low, and the gods of
probability work against you :-). )  Do not be alarmed by negative numbers in
the profile.  They should only appear if you have calibrated your profiler,
and the results are actually better than without calibration.
