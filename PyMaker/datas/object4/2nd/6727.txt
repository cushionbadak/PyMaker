(url, filename=None, reporthook=None, data=None)Â¶
Retrieves the contents of url and places it in filename.  The return value
is a tuple consisting of a local filename and either an
 object containing the response headers (for remote
URLs) or  (for local URLs).  The caller must then open and read the
contents of filename.  If filename is not given and the URL refers to a
local file, the input filename is returned.  If the URL is non-local and
filename is not given, the filename is the output of 
with a suffix that matches the suffix of the last path component of the input
URL.  If reporthook is given, it must be a function accepting three numeric
parameters: A chunk number, the maximum size chunks are read in and the total size of the download
(-1 if unknown).  It will be called once at the start and after each chunk of data is read from the
network.  reporthook is ignored for local URLs.
If the url uses the  scheme identifier, the optional data
argument may be given to specify a  request (normally the request type
is ).  The data argument must in standard
application/x-www-form-urlencoded format; see the
 function.
