(flag)Â¶
If used, this function should be called before  or newterm are
called.  When flag is , the values of lines and columns specified in the
terminfo database will be used, even if environment variables 
and  (used by default) are set, or if curses is running in a
window (in which case default behavior would be to use the window size if
 and  are not set).
