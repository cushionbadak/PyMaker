()¶

()¶

()¶
Return an iterator over representations of all messages if called as
 or  or return a list of such
representations if called as . The messages are represented
as instances of the appropriate format-specific  subclass
unless a custom message factory was specified when the 
instance was initialized.

Note
The behavior of  is unlike that of dictionaries, which
iterate over keys.
