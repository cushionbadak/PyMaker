(self, item)¶
Called to implement membership test operators.  Should return true if item
is in self, false otherwise.  For mapping objects, this should consider the
keys of the mapping rather than the values or the key-item pairs.
For objects that don’t define , the membership test first
tries iteration via , then the old sequence iteration
protocol via , see this section in the language
reference.
