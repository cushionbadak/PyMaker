docs:


(prefix)¶
Called when the closing tag is reached for an element  that contained a
namespace declaration.  This is called once for each namespace declaration on
the element in the reverse of the order for which the
 was called to indicate the start of each
namespace declaration’s scope.  Calls to this handler are made after the
corresponding  for the end of the element.
