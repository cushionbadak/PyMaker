docs:


(data, max_length=-1)Â¶
Decompress data (a bytes-like object), returning
uncompressed data as bytes. Some of data may be buffered
internally, for use in later calls to . The
returned data should be concatenated with the output of any
previous calls to .
If max_length is nonnegative, returns at most max_length
bytes of decompressed data. If this limit is reached and further
output can be produced, the  attribute will
be set to . In this case, the next call to
 may provide data as  to obtain
more of the output.
If all of the input data was decompressed and returned (either
because this was less than max_length bytes, or because
max_length was negative), the  attribute
will be set to .
Attempting to decompress data after the end of stream is reached
raises an EOFError.  Any data found after the end of the
stream is ignored and saved in the  attribute.

Changed in version 3.5: Added the max_length parameter.
