Parsing XML¶
We’ll be using the following XML document as the sample data for this section:


We can import this data by reading from a file:


Or directly from a string:


 parses XML from a string directly into an ,
which is the root element of the parsed tree.  Other parsing functions may
create an .  Check the documentation to be sure.
As an ,  has a tag and a dictionary of attributes:


It also has children nodes over which we can iterate:


Children are nested, and we can access specific child nodes by index:



Note
Not all elements of the XML input will end up as elements of the
parsed tree. Currently, this module skips over any XML comments,
processing instructions, and document type declarations in the
input. Nevertheless, trees built using this module’s API rather
than parsing from XML text can have comments and processing
instructions in them; they will be included when generating XML
output. A document type declaration may be accessed by passing a
custom  instance to the 
constructor.
