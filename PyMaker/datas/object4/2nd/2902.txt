¶
A mapping object representing the string environment. For example,
 is the pathname of your home directory (on some platforms),
and is equivalent to  in C.
This mapping is captured the first time the  module is imported,
typically during Python startup as part of processing .  Changes
to the environment made after this time are not reflected in ,
except for changes made by modifying  directly.
If the platform supports the  function, this mapping may be used
to modify the environment as well as query the environment.   will
be called automatically when the mapping is modified.
On Unix, keys and values use  and
 error handler. Use  if you would like
to use a different encoding.

Note
Calling  directly does not change , so it’s better
to modify .


Note
On some platforms, including FreeBSD and Mac OS X, setting  may
cause memory leaks.  Refer to the system documentation for
.

If  is not provided, a modified copy of this mapping  may be
passed to the appropriate process-creation functions to cause  child processes
to use a modified environment.
If the platform supports the  function, you can delete items in
this mapping to unset environment variables.  will be called
automatically when an item is deleted from , and when
one of the  or  methods is called.
