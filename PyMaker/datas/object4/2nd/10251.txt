will be added simultaneously to the  table, and to a CAB file. Then,
when all files have been added, the CAB file can be written, then added to the
MSI file.
name is the name of the CAB file in the MSI file.

Add the file with the pathname full to the CAB file, under the name
logical.  If there is already a file named logical, a new file name is
created.
Return the index of the file in the CAB file, and the new name of the file
inside the CAB file.

Generate a CAB file, add it as a stream to the MSI file, put it into the
 table, and remove the generated file from the disk.
