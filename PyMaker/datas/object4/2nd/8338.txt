What’s the Execution Context?¶
By default, each time  finds a docstring to test, it uses a
shallow copy of ’s globals, so that running tests doesn’t change the
module’s real globals, and so that one test in  can’t leave behind
crumbs that accidentally allow another test to work.  This means examples can
freely use any names defined at top-level in , and names defined earlier
in the docstring being run. Examples cannot see names defined in other
docstrings.
You can force use of your own dict as the execution context by passing
 to  or  instead.
