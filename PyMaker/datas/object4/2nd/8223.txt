Look on the current line. with the cursor, and the line above for a filename
and line number.  If found, open the file if not already open, and show the
line.  Use this to view source lines referenced in an exception traceback
and lines found by Find in Files. Also available in the context menu of
the Shell window and Output windows.

When activated, code entered in the Shell or run from an Editor will run
under the debugger.  In the Editor, breakpoints can be set with the context
menu.  This feature is still incomplete and somewhat experimental.
