docs:


()¶
Perform the SSL setup handshake.

Changed in version 3.4: The handshake method also performs  when the
 attribute of the socket’s
 is true.


Changed in version 3.5: The socket timeout is no more reset each time bytes are received or sent.
The socket timeout is now to maximum total duration of the handshake.


Changed in version 3.7: Hostname or IP address is matched by OpenSSL during handshake. The
function  is no longer used. In case OpenSSL
refuses a hostname or IP address, the handshake is aborted early and
a TLS alert message is send to the peer.
