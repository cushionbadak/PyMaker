()Â¶
Return the list of ciphers shared by the client during the handshake.  Each
entry of the returned list is a three-value tuple containing the name of the
cipher, the version of the SSL protocol that defines its use, and the number
of secret bits the cipher uses.   returns
 if no connection has been established or the socket is a client
socket.
