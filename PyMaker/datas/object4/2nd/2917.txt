()Â¶
Return the name of the user logged in on the controlling terminal of the
process.  For most purposes, it is more useful to use
 since the latter checks the environment variables
 or  to find out who the user is, and
falls back to  to get the login name of the
current real user id.
Availability: Unix, Windows.
