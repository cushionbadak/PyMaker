Standard Options¶
All the  Widgets accepts the following options:







Option
Description



class
Specifies the window class. The class is used when querying
the option database for the window’s other options, to
determine the default bindtags for the window, and to select
the widget’s default layout and style. This option is
read-only, and may only be specified when the window is
created.

cursor
Specifies the mouse cursor to be used for the widget. If set
to the empty string (the default), the cursor is inherited
for the parent widget.

takefocus
Determines whether the window accepts the focus during
keyboard traversal. 0, 1 or an empty string is returned.
If 0 is returned, it means that the window should be skipped
entirely during keyboard traversal. If 1, it means that the
window should receive the input focus as long as it is
viewable. And an empty string means that the traversal
scripts make the decision about whether or not to focus
on the window.

style
May be used to specify a custom widget style.
