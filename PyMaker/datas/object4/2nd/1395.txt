docs:


(name, bases=(), kwds=None)Â¶
Calculates the appropriate metaclass and creates the class namespace.
The arguments are the components that make up a class definition header:
the class name, the base classes (in order) and the keyword arguments
(such as ).
The return value is a 3-tuple: 
metaclass is the appropriate metaclass, namespace is the
prepared class namespace and kwds is an updated copy of the passed
in kwds argument with any  entry removed. If no kwds
argument is passed in, this will be an empty dict.

New in version 3.3.


Changed in version 3.6: The default value for the  element of the returned
tuple has changed.  Now an insertion-order-preserving mapping is
used when the metaclass does not have a  method.
