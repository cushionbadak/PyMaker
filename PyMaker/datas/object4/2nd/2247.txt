docs:


(pathname, *, recursive=False)¶
Return a possibly-empty list of path names that match pathname, which must be
a string containing a path specification. pathname can be either absolute
(like ) or relative (like
), and can contain shell-style wildcards. Broken
symlinks are included in the results (as in the shell).
If recursive is true, the pattern “” will match any files and zero or
more directories and subdirectories.  If the pattern is followed by an
, only directories and subdirectories match.

Note
Using the “” pattern in large directory trees may consume
an inordinate amount of time.


Changed in version 3.5: Support for recursive globs using “”.
