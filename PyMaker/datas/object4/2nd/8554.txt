Signal Handling¶

New in version 3.2.

The  command-line option to unittest,
along with the  parameter to , provide
more friendly handling of control-C during a test run. With catch break
behavior enabled control-C will allow the currently running test to complete,
and the test run will then end and report all the results so far. A second
control-c will raise a  in the usual way.
The control-c handling signal handler attempts to remain compatible with code or
tests that install their own  handler. If the 
handler is called but isn’t the installed  handler,
i.e. it has been replaced by the system under test and delegated to, then it
calls the default handler. This will normally be the expected behavior by code
that replaces an installed handler and delegates to it. For individual tests
that need  control-c handling disabled the 
decorator can be used.
There are a few utility functions for framework authors to enable control-c
handling functionality within test frameworks.


()¶
Install the control-c handler. When a  is received
(usually in response to the user pressing control-c) all registered results
have  called.



(result)¶
Register a  object for control-c handling. Registering a
result stores a weak reference to it, so it doesn’t prevent the result from
being garbage collected.
Registering a  object has no side-effects if control-c
handling is not enabled, so test frameworks can unconditionally register
all results they create independently of whether or not handling is enabled.



(result)¶
Remove a registered result. Once a result has been removed then
 will no longer be called on that result object in
response to a control-c.



(function=None)¶
When called without arguments this function removes the control-c handler
if it has been installed. This function can also be used as a test decorator
to temporarily remove the handler while the test is being executed:
