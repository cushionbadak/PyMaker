docs:


class (message=None)¶
A subclass of the  module’s
. Subclasses of  add
mailbox-format-specific state and behavior.
If message is omitted, the new instance is created in a default, empty state.
If message is an  instance, its contents are
copied; furthermore, any format-specific information is converted insofar as
possible if message is a  instance. If message is a string,
a byte string,
or a file, it should contain an RFC 2822-compliant message, which is read
and parsed.  Files should be open in binary mode, but text mode files
are accepted for backward compatibility.
The format-specific state and behaviors offered by subclasses vary, but in
general it is only the properties that are not specific to a particular
mailbox that are supported (although presumably the properties are specific
to a particular mailbox format). For example, file offsets for single-file
mailbox formats and file names for directory-based mailbox formats are not
retained, because they are only applicable to the original mailbox. But state
such as whether a message has been read by the user or marked as important is
retained, because it applies to the message itself.
There is no requirement that  instances be used to represent
messages retrieved using  instances. In some situations, the
time and memory required to generate  representations might
not be acceptable. For such situations,  instances also
offer string and file-like representations, and a custom message factory may
be specified when a  instance is initialized.
