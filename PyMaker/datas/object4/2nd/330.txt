docs:


(object)¶
Return the “identity” of an object.  This is an integer which
is guaranteed to be unique and constant for this object during its lifetime.
Two objects with non-overlapping lifetimes may have the same 
value.

CPython implementation detail: This is the address of the object in memory.
