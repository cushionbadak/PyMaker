docs:


(args=None)Â¶
Compile several source files.  The files named in args (or on the command
line, if args is ) are compiled and the resulting byte-code is
cached in the normal manner.  This function does not search a directory
structure to locate source files; it only compiles files named explicitly.
If  is the only parameter in args, the list of files is taken from
standard input.

Changed in version 3.2: Added support for .
