Interactive Console Objects¶
The  class is a subclass of
, and so offers all the methods of the
interpreter objects as well as the following additions.


(banner=None, exitmsg=None)¶
Closely emulate the interactive Python console. The optional banner argument
specify the banner to print before the first interaction; by default it prints a
banner similar to the one printed by the standard Python interpreter, followed
by the class name of the console object in parentheses (so as not to confuse
this with the real interpreter – since it’s so close!).
The optional exitmsg argument specifies an exit message printed when exiting.
Pass the empty string to suppress the exit message. If exitmsg is not given or
, a default message is printed.

Changed in version 3.4: To suppress printing any banner, pass an empty string.


Changed in version 3.6: Print an exit message when exiting.




(line)¶
Push a line of source text to the interpreter. The line should not have a
trailing newline; it may have internal newlines.  The line is appended to a
buffer and the interpreter’s  method is called with the
concatenated contents of the buffer as source.  If this indicates that the
command was executed or invalid, the buffer is reset; otherwise, the command is
incomplete, and the buffer is left as it was after the line was appended.  The
return value is  if more input is required,  if the line was
dealt with in some way (this is the same as ).



()¶
Remove any unhandled source text from the input buffer.



(prompt="")¶
Write a prompt and read a line.  The returned line does not include the trailing
newline.  When the user enters the EOF key sequence,  is raised.
The base implementation reads from ; a subclass may replace this
with a different implementation.
