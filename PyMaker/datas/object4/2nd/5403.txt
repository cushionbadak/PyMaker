()¶
Accept a connection.  The socket must be bound to an address and listening
for connections.  The return value can be either  or a pair
 where conn is a new socket object usable to send
and receive data on the connection, and address is the address bound to
the socket on the other end of the connection.
When  is returned it means the connection didn’t take place, in
which case the server should just ignore this event and keep listening
for further incoming connections.
