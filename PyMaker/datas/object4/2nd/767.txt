docs:


(pattern, string, flags=0)Â¶
If zero or more characters at the beginning of string match the regular
expression pattern, return a corresponding match object.  Return  if the string does not match the pattern;
note that this is different from a zero-length match.
Note that even in  mode,  will only match
at the beginning of the string and not at the beginning of each line.
If you want to locate a match anywhere in string, use 
instead (see also search() vs. match()).
