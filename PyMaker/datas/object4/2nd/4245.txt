Exchanging objects between processesÂ¶
 supports two types of communication channel between
processes:
Queues

The  class is a near clone of .  For
example:


Queues are thread and process safe.

Pipes

The  function returns a pair of connection objects connected by a
pipe which by default is duplex (two-way).  For example:


The two connection objects returned by  represent the two ends of
the pipe.  Each connection object has  and
 methods (among others).  Note that data in a pipe
may become corrupted if two processes (or threads) try to read from or write
to the same end of the pipe at the same time.  Of course there is no risk
of corruption from processes using different ends of the pipe at the same
time.
