(in_file, out_file=None, mode=None, quiet=False)Â¶
This call decodes uuencoded file in_file placing the result on file
out_file. If out_file is a pathname, mode is used to set the permission
bits if the file must be created. Defaults for out_file and mode are taken
from the uuencode header.  However, if the file specified in the header already
exists, a  is raised.
 may print a warning to standard error if the input was produced
by an incorrect uuencoder and Python could recover from that error.  Setting
quiet to a true value silences this warning.
