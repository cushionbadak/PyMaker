(domain, localedir=None, languages=None, class_=None, fallback=False, codeset=None)¶
Return a  instance based on the domain, localedir,
and languages, which are first passed to  to get a list of the
associated  file paths.  Instances with identical  file
names are cached.  The actual class instantiated is class_ if
provided, otherwise .  The class’s constructor must
take a single file object argument.  If provided, codeset will change
the charset used to encode translated strings in the
 and 
methods.
If multiple files are found, later files are used as fallbacks for earlier ones.
To allow setting the fallback,  is used to clone each
translation object from the cache; the actual instance data is still shared with
the cache.
If no  file is found, this function raises  if
fallback is false (which is the default), and returns a
 instance if fallback is true.

Changed in version 3.3:  used to be raised instead of .
