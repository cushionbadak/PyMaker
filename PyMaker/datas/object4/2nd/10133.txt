docs:


(argc)Â¶
Calls a callable object with positional arguments.
argc indicates the number of positional arguments.
The top of the stack contains positional arguments, with the right-most
argument on top.  Below the arguments is a callable object to call.
 pops all arguments and the callable object off the stack,
calls the callable object with those arguments, and pushes the return value
returned by the callable object.

Changed in version 3.6: This opcode is used only for calls with positional arguments.
