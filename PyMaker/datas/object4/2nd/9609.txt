docs:


(path=None, prefix='')Â¶
Yields  for all submodules on path, or, if
path is , all top-level modules on .
path should be either  or a list of paths to look for modules in.
prefix is a string to output on the front of every module name on output.

Note
Only works for a finder which defines an 
method. This interface is non-standard, so the module also provides
implementations for  and
.


Changed in version 3.3: Updated to be based directly on  rather than relying
on the package internal PEP 302 import emulation.
