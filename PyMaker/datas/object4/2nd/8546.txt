class (stream=None, descriptions=True, verbosity=1, failfast=False, buffer=False, resultclass=None, warnings=None, *, tb_locals=False)¶
A basic test runner implementation that outputs results to a stream. If stream
is , the default,  is used as the output stream. This class
has a few configurable parameters, but is essentially very simple.  Graphical
applications which run test suites should provide alternate implementations. Such
implementations should accept  as the interface to construct runners
changes when features are added to unittest.
By default this runner shows ,
,  and
 even if they are ignored by default. Deprecation warnings caused by deprecated unittest
methods are also special-cased and, when the warning
filters are  or , they will appear only once
per-module, in order to avoid too many warning messages.  This behavior can
be overridden using Python’s  or  options
(see Warning control) and leaving
warnings to .

Changed in version 3.2: Added the  argument.


Changed in version 3.2: The default stream is set to  at instantiation time rather
than import time.


Changed in version 3.5: Added the tb_locals parameter.

This method returns the instance of  used by .
It is not intended to be called directly, but can be overridden in
subclasses to provide a custom .
 instantiates the class or callable passed in the
 constructor as the  argument. It
defaults to  if no  is provided.
The result class is instantiated with the following arguments:

This method is the main public interface to the . This
method takes a  or  instance. A

results printed to stdout.
