Additional Utility Classes and Functions¶


class ¶
A simple  subclass that provides attribute access to its
namespace, as well as a meaningful repr.
Unlike , with  you can add and remove
attributes.  If a  object is initialized with keyword
arguments, those are directly added to the underlying namespace.
The type is roughly equivalent to the following code:


 may be useful as a replacement for .
However, for a structured record type use 
instead.

New in version 3.3.




(fget=None, fset=None, fdel=None, doc=None)¶
Route attribute access on a class to __getattr__.
This is a descriptor, used to define attributes that act differently when
accessed through an instance and through a class.  Instance access remains
normal, but access to an attribute through a class will be routed to the
class’s __getattr__ method; this is done by raising AttributeError.
This allows one to have properties active on an instance, and have virtual
attributes on the class with the same name (see Enum for an example).

New in version 3.4.
