Trigonometric functions¶


(x)¶
Return the arc cosine of x, in radians.



(x)¶
Return the arc sine of x, in radians.



(x)¶
Return the arc tangent of x, in radians.



(y, x)¶
Return , in radians. The result is between  and .
The vector in the plane from the origin to point  makes this angle
with the positive X axis. The point of  is that the signs of both
inputs are known to it, so it can compute the correct quadrant for the angle.
For example,  and  are both , but  is .



(x)¶
Return the cosine of x radians.



(x, y)¶
Return the Euclidean norm, . This is the length of the vector
from the origin to point .



(x)¶
Return the sine of x radians.



(x)¶
Return the tangent of x radians.
