docs:


Â¶
The string used to separate (or, rather, terminate) lines on the current
platform.  This may be a single character, such as  for POSIX, or
multiple characters, for example,  for Windows. Do not use
os.linesep as a line terminator when writing files opened in text mode (the
default); use a single  instead, on all platforms.
