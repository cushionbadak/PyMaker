(pattern, flags=0)¶
Compile a regular expression pattern into a regular expression object, which can be used for matching using its
,  and other methods, described
below.
The expression’s behaviour can be modified by specifying a flags value.
Values can be any of the following variables, combined using bitwise OR (the
 operator).
The sequence


is equivalent to


but using  and saving the resulting regular expression
object for reuse is more efficient when the expression will be used several
times in a single program.

Note
The compiled versions of the most recent patterns passed to
 and the module-level matching functions are cached, so
programs that use only a few regular expressions at a time needn’t worry
about compiling regular expressions.
