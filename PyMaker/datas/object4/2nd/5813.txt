docs:

Top-level Non-Object, Non-Array ValuesÂ¶
The old version of JSON specified by the obsolete RFC 4627 required that
the top-level value of a JSON text must be either a JSON object or array
(Python  or ), and could not be a JSON null,
boolean, number, or string value.  RFC 7159 removed that restriction, and
this module does not and has never implemented that restriction in either its
serializer or its deserializer.
Regardless, for maximum interoperability, you may wish to voluntarily adhere
to the restriction yourself.
