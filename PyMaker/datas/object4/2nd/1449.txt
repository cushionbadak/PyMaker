(object, context, maxlevels, level)Â¶
Returns three values: the formatted version of object as a string, a flag
indicating whether the result is readable, and a flag indicating whether
recursion was detected.  The first argument is the object to be presented.  The
second is a dictionary which contains the  of objects that are part of
the current presentation context (direct and indirect containers for object
that are affecting the presentation) as the keys; if an object needs to be
presented which is already represented in context, the third return value
should be .  Recursive calls to the  method should add
additional entries for containers to this dictionary.  The third argument,
maxlevels, gives the requested limit to recursion; this will be  if there
is no requested limit.  This argument should be passed unmodified to recursive
calls. The fourth argument, level, gives the current level; recursive calls
should be passed a value less than that of the current call.
