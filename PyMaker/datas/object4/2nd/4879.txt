.

are also used by subprocess-related methods like
.



class (WriteTransport, ReadTransport)¶
Interface representing a bidirectional transport, such as a
TCP connection.
The user does not instantiate a transport directly; they call a

Instances of the Transport class are returned from or used by
event loop methods like ,
,
, , etc.



class (BaseTransport)¶
A transport for datagram (UDP) connections.
Instances of the DatagramTransport class are returned from
the  event loop method.
