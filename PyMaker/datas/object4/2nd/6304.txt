(filename_or_stream, handler, error_handler=handler.ErrorHandler())Â¶
Create a SAX parser and use it to parse a document.  The document, passed in as
filename_or_stream, can be a filename or a file object.  The handler
parameter needs to be a SAX  instance.  If
error_handler is given, it must be a SAX 
instance; if
omitted,   will be raised on all errors.  There is no
return value; all work must be done by the handler passed in.
