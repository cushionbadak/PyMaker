docs:


()Â¶
Returns an asyncgen_hooks object, which is similar to a
 of the form (firstiter, finalizer),
where firstiter and finalizer are expected to be either  or
functions which take an asynchronous generator iterator as an
argument, and are used to schedule finalization of an asynchronous
generator by an event loop.

New in version 3.6: See PEP 525 for more details.


Note
This function has been added on a provisional basis (see PEP 411
for details.)
