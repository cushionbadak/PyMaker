¶
The format of a MIME document allows for some text between the blank line
following the headers, and the first multipart boundary string. Normally,
this text is never visible in a MIME-aware mail reader because it falls
outside the standard MIME armor.  However, when viewing the raw text of
the message, or when viewing the message in a non-MIME aware reader, this
text can become visible.
The preamble attribute contains this leading extra-armor text for MIME
documents.  When the  discovers some text
after the headers but before the first boundary string, it assigns this
text to the message’s preamble attribute.  When the
 is writing out the plain text
representation of a MIME message, and it finds the
message has a preamble attribute, it will write this text in the area
between the headers and the first boundary.  See  and
 for details.
Note that if the message object has no preamble, the preamble attribute
will be .
