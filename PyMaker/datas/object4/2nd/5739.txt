class (input_charset=DEFAULT_CHARSET)¶
Map character sets to their email properties.
This class provides information about the requirements imposed on email for a
specific character set.  It also provides convenience routines for converting
between character sets, given the availability of the applicable codecs.  Given
a character set, it will do its best to provide information on how to use that
character set in an email message in an RFC-compliant way.
Certain character sets must be encoded with quoted-printable or base64 when used
in email headers or bodies.  Certain character sets must be converted outright,
and are not allowed in email.
Optional input_charset is as described below; it is always coerced to lower
case.  After being alias normalized it is also used as a lookup into the
registry of character sets to find out the header encoding, body encoding, and
output conversion codec to be used for the character set.  For example, if
input_charset is , then headers and bodies will be encoded using
quoted-printable and no output conversion codec is necessary.  If
input_charset is , then headers will be encoded with base64, bodies
will not be encoded, but output text will be converted from the 
character set to the  character set.
 instances have the following data attributes:


¶
The initial character set specified.  Common aliases are converted to
their official email names (e.g.  is converted to
).  Defaults to 7-bit .



¶
If the character set must be encoded before it can be used in an email
header, this attribute will be set to  (for
quoted-printable),  (for base64 encoding), or
 for the shortest of QP or BASE64 encoding. Otherwise,
it will be .



¶
Same as header_encoding, but describes the encoding for the mail
message’s body, which indeed may be different than the header encoding.
 is not allowed for body_encoding.



¶
Some character sets must be converted before they can be used in email
headers or bodies.  If the input_charset is one of them, this attribute
will contain the name of the character set output will be converted to.
Otherwise, it will be .



¶
The name of the Python codec used to convert the input_charset to
Unicode.  If no conversion codec is necessary, this attribute will be
.



¶
The name of the Python codec used to convert Unicode to the
output_charset.  If no conversion codec is necessary, this attribute
will have the same value as the input_codec.

 instances also have the following methods:


()¶
Return the content transfer encoding used for body encoding.
This is either the string  or  depending on
the encoding used, or it is a function, in which case you should call the
function with a single argument, the Message object being encoded.  The
function should then set the Content-Transfer-Encoding
header itself to whatever is appropriate.
Returns the string  if body_encoding is ,
returns the string  if body_encoding is , and
returns the string  otherwise.



()¶
Return the output character set.
This is the output_charset attribute if that is not , otherwise
it is input_charset.



(string)¶
Header-encode the string string.
The type of encoding (base64 or quoted-printable) will be based on the
header_encoding attribute.



(string, maxlengths)¶
Header-encode a string by converting it first to bytes.
This is similar to  except that the string is fit
into maximum line lengths as given by the argument maxlengths, which
must be an iterator: each element returned from this iterator will provide
the next maximum line length.



(string)¶
Body-encode the string string.
The type of encoding (base64 or quoted-printable) will be based on the
body_encoding attribute.

The  class also provides a number of methods to support
standard operations and built-in functions.


()¶
Returns input_charset as a string coerced to lower
case.  is an alias for .



(other)¶
This method allows you to compare two  instances for
equality.



(other)¶
This method allows you to compare two  instances for
inequality.
