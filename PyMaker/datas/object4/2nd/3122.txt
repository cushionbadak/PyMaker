¶
A  object indicating which functions in the
 module permit use of their dir_fd parameter.  Different platforms
provide different functionality, and an option that might work on one might
be unsupported on another.  For consistency’s sakes, functions that support
dir_fd always allow specifying the parameter, but will raise an exception
if the functionality is not actually available.
To check whether a particular function permits use of its dir_fd
parameter, use the  operator on .  As an example,
this expression determines whether the dir_fd parameter of 
is locally available:


Currently dir_fd parameters only work on Unix platforms; none of them work
on Windows.

New in version 3.3.
