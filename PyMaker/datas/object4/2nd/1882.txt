(*iterables, fillvalue=None)Â¶
Make an iterator that aggregates elements from each of the iterables. If the
iterables are of uneven length, missing values are filled-in with fillvalue.
Iteration continues until the longest iterable is exhausted.  Roughly equivalent to:


If one of the iterables is potentially infinite, then the 
function should be wrapped with something that limits the number of calls
(for example  or ).  If not specified,
fillvalue defaults to .
