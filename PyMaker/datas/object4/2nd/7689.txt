(format, nchannels, samplerate[, strict=False])¶
Set the key audio sampling parameters—sample format, number of channels, and
sampling rate—in one method call.  format,  nchannels, and samplerate
should be as specified in the , , and
  methods.  If strict is true,  checks to

samplerate) indicating the parameter values that were actually set by the
device driver (i.e., the same as the return values of ,
, and ).
For example,


is equivalent to
