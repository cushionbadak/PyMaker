docs:


(*exceptions)Â¶
Return a context manager that suppresses any of the specified exceptions
if they occur in the body of a with statement and then resumes execution
with the first statement following the end of the with statement.
As with any other mechanism that completely suppresses exceptions, this
context manager should be used only to cover very specific errors where
silently continuing with program execution is known to be the right
thing to do.
For example:


This code is equivalent to:


This context manager is reentrant.

New in version 3.4.
