8.1. The  statementÂ¶
The  statement is used for conditional execution:

It selects exactly one of the suites by evaluating the expressions one by one
until one is found to be true (see section Boolean operations for the definition of
true and false); then that suite is executed (and no other part of the
 statement is executed or evaluated).  If all expressions are
false, the suite of the  clause, if present, is executed.
