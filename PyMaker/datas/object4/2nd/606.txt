Modules¶
The only special operation on a module is attribute access: , where
m is a module and name accesses a name defined in m’s symbol table.
Module attributes can be assigned to.  (Note that the 
statement is not, strictly speaking, an operation on a module object;  does not require a module object named foo to exist, rather it requires
an (external) definition for a module named foo somewhere.)
A special attribute of every module is . This is the
dictionary containing the module’s symbol table. Modifying this dictionary will
actually change the module’s symbol table, but direct assignment to the
 attribute is not possible (you can write
, which defines  to be , but you can’t write
).  Modifying  directly is
not recommended.
Modules built into the interpreter are written like this: .  If loaded from a file, they are written as .
