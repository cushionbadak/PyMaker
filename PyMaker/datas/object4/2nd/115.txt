(self, other)¶
These methods are called to implement the binary arithmetic operations
(, , , , , , , ,
, , , , , , ) with reflected
(swapped) operands.  These functions are only called if the left operand does
not support the corresponding operation [3] and the operands are of different
types. [4] For instance, to evaluate the expression , where y is
an instance of a class that has an  method, 
is called if  returns NotImplemented.
Note that ternary  will not try calling  (the
coercion rules would become too complicated).

Note
If the right operand’s type is a subclass of the left operand’s type and that
subclass provides the reflected method for the operation, this method will be
called before the left operand’s non-reflected method.  This behavior allows
subclasses to override their ancestors’ operations.
