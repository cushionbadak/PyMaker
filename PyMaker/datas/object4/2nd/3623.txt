DatagramHandler¶
The  class, located in the 
module, inherits from  to support sending logging messages
over UDP sockets.

communicate with a remote machine whose address is given by host and port.

using the value in  - otherwise, a UDP socket is created.



()¶
Pickles the record’s attribute dictionary and writes it to the socket in
binary format. If there is an error with the socket, silently drops the
packet. To unpickle the record at the receiving end into a
, use the 
function.



()¶
The factory method of  is here overridden to create
a UDP socket ().



(s)¶
Send a pickled string to a socket.
