class (host='', port=0, local_hostname=None, [timeout, ]source_address=None)Â¶
An  instance encapsulates an SMTP connection.  It has methods
that support a full repertoire of SMTP and ESMTP operations. If the optional
host and port parameters are given, the SMTP  method is
called with those parameters during initialization.  If specified,
local_hostname is used as the FQDN of the local host in the HELO/EHLO
command.  Otherwise, the local hostname is found using
.  If the  call returns anything other
than a success code, an  is raised. The optional
timeout parameter specifies a timeout in seconds for blocking operations
like the connection attempt (if not specified, the global default timeout
setting will be used).  If the timeout expires,  is
raised.  The optional source_address parameter allows binding
to some specific source address in a machine with multiple network
interfaces, and/or to some specific source TCP port. It takes a 2-tuple
(host, port), for the socket to bind to as its source address before
connecting. If omitted (or if host or port are  and/or 0 respectively)
the OS default behavior will be used.
For normal use, you should only require the initialization/connect,
, and  methods.
An example is included below.
The  class supports the  statement.  When used
like this, the SMTP  command is issued automatically when the
 statement exits.  E.g.:



Changed in version 3.3: Support for the  statement was added.


Changed in version 3.3: source_address argument was added.


New in version 3.5: The SMTPUTF8 extension (RFC 6531) is now supported.
