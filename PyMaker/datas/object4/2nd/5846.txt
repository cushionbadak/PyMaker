docs:


(key)Â¶
Return a file-like representation of the message corresponding to key,
or raise a  exception if no such message exists.  The
file-like object behaves as if open in binary mode.  This file should be
closed once it is no longer needed.

Changed in version 3.2: The file object really is a binary file; previously it was incorrectly
returned in text mode.  Also, the file-like object now supports the
context management protocol: you can use a  statement to
automatically close it.


Note
Unlike other representations of messages, file-like representations are
not necessarily independent of the  instance that
created them or of the underlying mailbox.  More specific documentation
is provided by each subclass.
