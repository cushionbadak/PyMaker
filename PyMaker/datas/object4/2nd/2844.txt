(password, *, salt, n, r, p, maxmem=0, dklen=64)Â¶
The function provides scrypt password-based key derivation function as
defined in RFC 7914.
password and salt must be bytes-like objects.  Applications and libraries should limit password
to a sensible length (e.g. 1024).  salt should be about 16 or more
bytes from a proper source, e.g. .
n is the CPU/Memory cost factor, r the block size, p parallelization
factor and maxmem limits memory (OpenSSL 1.1.0 defaults to 32 MiB).
dklen is the length of the derived key.
Availability: OpenSSL 1.1+.

New in version 3.6.
