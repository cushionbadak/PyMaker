docs:


(whitespace)Â¶
Receive notification of ignorable whitespace in element content.
Validating Parsers must use this method to report each chunk of ignorable
whitespace (see the W3C XML 1.0 recommendation, section 2.10): non-validating
parsers may also use this method if they are capable of parsing and using
content models.
SAX parsers may return all contiguous whitespace in a single chunk, or they may
split it into several chunks; however, all of the characters in any single event
must come from the same external entity, so that the Locator provides useful
information.
