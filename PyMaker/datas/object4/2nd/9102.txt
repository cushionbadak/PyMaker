class ¶
Snapshot of traces of memory blocks allocated by Python.
The  function creates a snapshot instance.


(old_snapshot: Snapshot, key_type: str, cumulative: bool=False)¶
Compute the differences with an old snapshot. Get statistics as a sorted
list of  instances grouped by key_type.
See the  method for key_type and cumulative
parameters.
The result is sorted from the biggest to the smallest by: absolute value
of , , absolute
value of ,  and
then by .



(filename)¶
Write the snapshot into a file.
Use  to reload the snapshot.



(filters)¶
Create a new  instance with a filtered 
sequence, filters is a list of  and
 instances.  If filters is an empty list, return a new
 instance with a copy of the traces.
All inclusive filters are applied at once, a trace is ignored if no
inclusive filters match it. A trace is ignored if at least one exclusive
filter matches it.

Changed in version 3.6:  instances are now also accepted in filters.




classmethod (filename)¶
Load a snapshot from a file.

(key_type: str, cumulative: bool=False)¶
Get statistics as a sorted list of  instances grouped
by key_type:






key_type
description




filename


filename and line number


traceback



If cumulative is , cumulate size and count of memory blocks of
all frames of the traceback of a trace, not only the most recent frame.
The cumulative mode can only be used with key_type equals to
 and .
The result is sorted from the biggest to the smallest by:
,  and then by
.



¶
Maximum number of frames stored in the traceback of :
result of the  when the snapshot was taken.



¶
Traces of all memory blocks allocated by Python: sequence of
 instances.
The sequence has an undefined order. Use the 
method to get a sorted list of statistics.
