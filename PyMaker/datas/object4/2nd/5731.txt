(splitchars=';, \t', maxlinelen=None, linesep='\n')¶
Encode a message header into an RFC-compliant format, possibly wrapping
long lines and encapsulating non-ASCII parts in base64 or quoted-printable
encodings.
Optional splitchars is a string containing characters which should be
given extra weight by the splitting algorithm during normal header
wrapping.  This is in very rough support of RFC 2822’s ‘higher level
syntactic breaks’:  split points preceded by a splitchar are preferred
during line splitting, with the characters preferred in the order in
which they appear in the string.  Space and tab may be included in the
string to indicate whether preference should be given to one over the
other as a split point when other split chars do not appear in the line
being split.  Splitchars does not affect RFC 2047 encoded lines.
maxlinelen, if given, overrides the instance’s value for the maximum
line length.
linesep specifies the characters used to separate the lines of the
folded header.  It defaults to the most useful value for Python
application code (), but  can be specified in order
to produce headers with RFC-compliant line separators.

Changed in version 3.2: Added the linesep argument.
