StreamWriter¶


class ¶
Represents a writer object that provides APIs to write data
to the IO stream.
It is not recommended to instantiate StreamWriter objects
directly; use  and 
instead.


()¶
Return True if the underlying transport supports
the  method, False otherwise.



()¶
Close the write end of the stream after the buffered write
data is flushed.



¶
Return the underlying asyncio transport.



(name, default=None)¶
Access optional transport information; see
 for details.



(data)¶
Write data to the stream.
This method is not subject to flow control.  Calls to  should
be followed by .



(data)¶
Write a list (or any iterable) of bytes to the stream.
This method is not subject to flow control. Calls to 
should be followed by .



coroutine ()¶
Wait until it is appropriate to resume writing to the stream.
Example:


This is a flow control method that interacts with the underlying
IO write buffer.  When the size of the buffer reaches
the high watermark, drain() blocks until the size of the
buffer is drained down to the low watermark and writing can
be resumed.  When there is nothing to wait for, the 
returns immediately.



()¶
Close the stream.



()¶
Return  if the stream is closed or in the process of
being closed.

New in version 3.7.




coroutine ()¶
Wait until the stream is closed.
Should be called after  to wait until the underlying
connection is closed.

New in version 3.7.
