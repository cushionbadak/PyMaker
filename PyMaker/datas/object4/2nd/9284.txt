 — Built-in objects¶

This module provides direct access to all ‘built-in’ identifiers of Python; for
example,  is the full name for the built-in function
.  See Built-in Functions and Built-in Constants for
documentation.
This module is not normally accessed explicitly by most applications, but can be
useful in modules that provide objects with the same name as a built-in value,
but in which the built-in of that name is also needed.  For example, in a module
that wants to implement an  function that wraps the built-in
, this module can be used directly:


As an implementation detail, most modules have the name  made
available as part of their globals.  The value of  is normally
either this module or the value of this module’s  attribute.
Since this is an implementation detail, it may not be used by alternate
implementations of Python.
