docs:


(server_name_callback)Â¶
This is a legacy API retained for backwards compatibility. When possible,
you should use  instead. The given server_name_callback
is similar to sni_callback, except that when the server hostname is an
IDN-encoded internationalized domain name, the server_name_callback
receives a decoded U-label ().
If there is an decoding error on the server name, the TLS connection will
terminate with an  fatal TLS
alert message to the client.

New in version 3.4.
