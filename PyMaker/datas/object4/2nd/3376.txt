(format[, t])¶
Convert a tuple or  representing a time as returned by
 or  to a string as specified by the format
argument.  If t is not provided, the current time as returned by
 is used.  format must be a string.   is
raised if any field in t is outside of the allowed range.
0 is a legal argument for any position in the time tuple; if it is normally
illegal the value is forced to a correct one.
The following directives can be embedded in the format string. They are shown
without the optional field width and precision specification, and are replaced
by the indicated characters in the  result:

Notes:

When used with the  function, the  directive only affects
the output hour field if the  directive is used to parse the hour.
The range really is  to ; value  is valid in
timestamps representing leap seconds and value  is supported
for historical reasons.
When used with the  function,  and  are only used in
calculations when the day of the week and the year are specified.

Here is an example, a format for dates compatible with that specified  in the
RFC 2822 Internet email standard.  [1]


Additional directives may be supported on certain platforms, but only the
ones listed here have a meaning standardized by ANSI C.  To see the full set
of format codes supported on your platform, consult the strftime(3)
documentation.
On some platforms, an optional field width and precision specification can
immediately follow the initial  of a directive in the following order;
this is also not portable. The field width is normally 2 except for  where
it is 3.
