 — A foreign function library for Python¶

 is a foreign function library for Python.  It provides C compatible
data types, and allows calling functions in DLLs or shared libraries.  It can be
used to wrap these libraries in pure Python.

ctypes tutorial¶
Note: The code samples in this tutorial use  to make sure that
they actually work.  Since some code samples behave differently under Linux,
Windows, or Mac OS X, they contain doctest directives in comments.
Note: Some code samples reference the ctypes  type.  On platforms
where  it is an alias to .
So, you should not be confused if  is printed if you would expect
 — they are actually the same type.

Loading dynamic link libraries¶
 exports the cdll, and on Windows windll and oledll
objects, for loading dynamic link libraries.
You load libraries by accessing them as attributes of these objects. cdll
loads libraries which export functions using the standard  calling
convention, while windll libraries call functions using the 
calling convention. oledll also uses the  calling convention, and
assumes the functions return a Windows  error code. The error
code is used to automatically raise an  exception when the
function call fails.

Changed in version 3.3: Windows errors used to raise , which is now an alias
of .

Here are some examples for Windows. Note that  is the MS standard C
library containing most standard C functions, and uses the cdecl calling
convention:


Windows appends the usual  file suffix automatically.

Note
Accessing the standard C library through  will use an
outdated version of the library that may be incompatible with the one
being used by Python. Where possible, use native Python functionality,
or else import and use the  module.

On Linux, it is required to specify the filename including the extension to
load a library, so attribute access can not be used to load libraries. Either the
 method of the dll loaders should be used, or you should load
the library by creating an instance of CDLL by calling the constructor:




Accessing functions from loaded dlls¶
Functions are accessed as attributes of dll objects:


Note that win32 system dlls like  and  often export ANSI
as well as UNICODE versions of a function. The UNICODE version is exported with
an  appended to the name, while the ANSI version is exported with an 
appended to the name. The win32  function, which returns a
module handle for a given module name, has the following C prototype, and a
macro is used to expose one of them as  depending on whether
UNICODE is defined or not:


windll does not try to select one of them by magic, you must access the
version you need by specifying  or 
explicitly, and then call it with bytes or string objects respectively.
Sometimes, dlls export functions with names which aren’t valid Python
identifiers, like . In this case you have to use
 to retrieve the function:


On Windows, some dlls export functions not by name but by ordinal. These
functions can be accessed by indexing the dll object with the ordinal number:




Calling functions¶
You can call these functions like any other Python callable. This example uses
the  function, which returns system time in seconds since the Unix
epoch, and the  function, which returns a win32 module
handle.
This example calls both functions with a NULL pointer ( should be used
as the NULL pointer):



Note
 may raise a  after calling the function, if
it detects that an invalid number of arguments were passed.  This behavior
should not be relied upon.  It is deprecated in 3.6.2, and will be removed
in 3.7.

 is raised when you call an  function with the
 calling convention, or vice versa:


To find out the correct calling convention you have to look into the C header
file or the documentation for the function you want to call.
On Windows,  uses win32 structured exception handling to prevent
crashes from general protection faults when functions are called with invalid
argument values:


There are, however, enough ways to crash Python with , so you
should be careful anyway.  The  module can be helpful in
debugging crashes (e.g. from segmentation faults produced by erroneous C library
calls).
, integers, bytes objects and (unicode) strings are the only native
Python objects that can directly be used as parameters in these function calls.
 is passed as a C  pointer, bytes objects and strings are passed
as pointer to the memory block that contains their data ( or
).  Python integers are passed as the platforms default C
 type, their value is masked to fit into the C type.
Before we move on calling functions with other parameter types, we have to learn
more about  data types.


Fundamental data types¶
 defines a number of primitive C compatible data types:







ctypes type
C type
Python type





bool (1)



1-character bytes object



1-character string



int



int



int



int



int



int



int



int


 or 
int


 or

int



int


 or

int



float



float



float


 (NUL terminated)
bytes object or 


 (NUL terminated)
string or 



int or 




The constructor accepts any object with a truth value.

All these types can be created by calling them with an optional initializer of
the correct type and value:


Since these types are mutable, their value can also be changed afterwards:


Assigning a new value to instances of the pointer types ,
, and  changes the memory location they
point to, not the contents of the memory block (of course not, because Python
bytes objects are immutable):


You should be careful, however, not to pass them to functions expecting pointers
to mutable memory. If you need mutable memory blocks, ctypes has a
 function which creates these in various ways.  The
current memory block contents can be accessed (or changed) with the 
property; if you want to access it as NUL terminated string, use the 
property:


The  function replaces the  function
(which is still available as an alias), as well as the  function
from earlier ctypes releases.  To create a mutable memory block containing
unicode characters of the C type  use the
 function.


Calling functions, continued¶
Note that printf prints to the real standard output channel, not to
, so these examples will only work at the console prompt, not
from within IDLE or PythonWin:


As has been mentioned before, all Python types except integers, strings, and
bytes objects have to be wrapped in their corresponding  type, so
that they can be converted to the required C data type:




Calling functions with your own custom data types¶
You can also customize  argument conversion to allow instances of
your own classes be used as function arguments.   looks for an
 attribute and uses this as the function argument.  Of
course, it must be one of integer, string, or bytes:


If you don’t want to store the instance’s data in the 
instance variable, you could define a  which makes the
attribute available on request.


Specifying the required argument types (function prototypes)¶
It is possible to specify the required argument types of functions exported from
DLLs by setting the  attribute.
 must be a sequence of C data types (the  function is
probably not a good example here, because it takes a variable number and
different types of parameters depending on the format string, on the other hand
this is quite handy to experiment with this feature):


Specifying a format protects against incompatible argument types (just as a
prototype for a C function), and tries to convert the arguments to valid types:


If you have defined your own classes which you pass to function calls, you have
to implement a  class method for them to be able to use them
in the  sequence. The  class method receives
the Python object passed to the function call, it should do a typecheck or
whatever is needed to make sure this object is acceptable, and then return the
object itself, its  attribute, or whatever you want to
pass as the C function argument in this case. Again, the result should be an
integer, string, bytes, a  instance, or an object with an
 attribute.


Return types¶
By default functions are assumed to return the C  type.  Other
return types can be specified by setting the  attribute of the
function object.
Here is a more advanced example, it uses the  function, which expects
a string pointer and a char, and returns a pointer to a string:


If you want to avoid the  calls above, you can set the
 attribute, and the second argument will be converted from a
single character Python bytes object into a C char:


You can also use a callable Python object (a function or a class for example) as
the  attribute, if the foreign function returns an integer.  The
callable will be called with the integer the C function returns, and the
result of this call will be used as the result of your function call. This is
useful to check for error return values and automatically raise an exception:


 is a function which will call Windows  api to
get the string representation of an error code, and returns an exception.
 takes an optional error code parameter, if no one is used, it calls
 to retrieve it.
Please note that a much more powerful error checking mechanism is available
through the  attribute; see the reference manual for details.


Passing pointers (or: passing parameters by reference)¶
Sometimes a C api function expects a pointer to a data type as parameter,
probably to write into the corresponding location, or if the data is too large
to be passed by value. This is also known as passing parameters by reference.
 exports the  function which is used to pass parameters
by reference.  The same effect can be achieved with the  function,
although  does a lot more work since it constructs a real pointer
object, so it is faster to use  if you don’t need the pointer
object in Python itself:




Structures and unions¶
Structures and unions must derive from the  and 
base classes which are defined in the  module. Each subclass must
define a  attribute.   must be a list of
2-tuples, containing a field name and a field type.
The field type must be a  type like , or any other
derived  type: structure, union, array, pointer.
Here is a simple example of a POINT structure, which contains two integers named
x and y, and also shows how to initialize a structure in the constructor:


You can, however, build much more complicated structures.  A structure can
itself contain other structures by using a structure as a field type.
Here is a RECT structure which contains two POINTs named upperleft and
lowerright:


Nested structures can also be initialized in the constructor in several ways:


Field descriptors can be retrieved from the class, they are useful
for debugging because they can provide useful information:



Warning
 does not support passing unions or structures with bit-fields
to functions by value.  While this may work on 32-bit x86, it’s not
guaranteed by the library to work in the general case.  Unions and
structures with bit-fields should always be passed to functions by pointer.



Structure/union alignment and byte order¶
By default, Structure and Union fields are aligned in the same way the C
compiler does it. It is possible to override this behavior be specifying a
 class attribute in the subclass definition. This must be set to a
positive integer and specifies the maximum alignment for the fields. This is
what  also does in MSVC.
 uses the native byte order for Structures and Unions.  To build
structures with non-native byte order, you can use one of the
, ,
, and  base classes.  These
classes cannot contain pointer fields.


Bit fields in structures and unions¶
It is possible to create structures and unions containing bit fields. Bit fields
are only possible for integer fields, the bit width is specified as the third
item in the  tuples:




Arrays¶
Arrays are sequences, containing a fixed number of instances of the same type.
The recommended way to create array types is by multiplying a data type with a
positive integer:


Here is an example of a somewhat artificial data type, a structure containing 4
POINTs among other stuff:


Instances are created in the usual way, by calling the class:


The above code print a series of  lines, because the array contents is
initialized to zeros.
Initializers of the correct type can also be specified:




Pointers¶
Pointer instances are created by calling the  function on a
 type:


Pointer instances have a  attribute which
returns the object to which the pointer points, the  object above:


Note that  does not have OOR (original object return), it constructs a
new, equivalent object each time you retrieve an attribute:


Assigning another  instance to the pointer’s contents attribute
would cause the pointer to point to the memory location where this is stored:


Pointer instances can also be indexed with integers:


Assigning to an integer index changes the pointed to value:


It is also possible to use indexes different from 0, but you must know what
you’re doing, just as in C: You can access or change arbitrary memory locations.
Generally you only use this feature if you receive a pointer from a C function,
and you know that the pointer actually points to an array instead of a single
item.
Behind the scenes, the  function does more than simply create
pointer instances, it has to create pointer types first. This is done with the
 function, which accepts any  type, and returns a
new type:


Calling the pointer type without an argument creates a  pointer.
 pointers have a  boolean value:


 checks for  when dereferencing pointers (but dereferencing
invalid non- pointers would crash Python):




Type conversions¶
Usually, ctypes does strict type checking.  This means, if you have
 in the  list of a function or as the type of
a member field in a structure definition, only instances of exactly the same
type are accepted.  There are some exceptions to this rule, where ctypes accepts
other objects.  For example, you can pass compatible array instances instead of
pointer types.  So, for , ctypes accepts an array of c_int:


In addition, if a function argument is explicitly declared to be a pointer type
(such as ) in , an object of the pointed
type ( in this case) can be passed to the function.  ctypes will apply
the required  conversion in this case automatically.
To set a POINTER type field to , you can assign :


Sometimes you have instances of incompatible types.  In C, you can cast one type
into another type.   provides a  function which can be
used in the same way.  The  structure defined above accepts
 pointers or  arrays for its  field,
but not instances of other types:


For these cases, the  function is handy.
The  function can be used to cast a ctypes instance into a pointer
to a different ctypes data type.   takes two parameters, a ctypes
object that is or can be converted to a pointer of some kind, and a ctypes
pointer type.  It returns an instance of the second argument, which references
the same memory block as the first argument:


So,  can be used to assign to the  field of  the
structure:




Incomplete Types¶
Incomplete Types are structures, unions or arrays whose members are not yet
specified. In C, they are specified by forward declarations, which are defined
later:


The straightforward translation into ctypes code would be this, but it does not
work:


because the new  is not available in the class statement itself.
In , we can define the  class and set the 
attribute later, after the class statement:


Lets try it. We create two instances of , and let them point to each
other, and finally follow the pointer chain a few times:




Callback functions¶
 allows creating C callable function pointers from Python callables.
These are sometimes called callback functions.
First, you must create a class for the callback function. The class knows the
calling convention, the return type, and the number and types of arguments this
function will receive.
The  factory function creates types for callback functions
using the  calling convention. On Windows, the 
factory function creates types for callback functions using the 
calling convention.
Both of these factory functions are called with the result type as first
argument, and the callback functions expected argument types as the remaining
arguments.
I will present an example here which uses the standard C library’s
 function, that is used to sort items with the help of a callback
function.   will be used to sort an array of integers:


 must be called with a pointer to the data to sort, the number of
items in the data array, the size of one item, and a pointer to the comparison
function, the callback. The callback will then be called with two pointers to
items, and it must return a negative integer if the first item is smaller than
the second, a zero if they are equal, and a positive integer otherwise.
So our callback function receives pointers to integers, and must return an
integer. First we create the  for the callback function:


To get started, here is a simple callback that shows the values it gets
passed:


The result:


Now we can actually compare the two items and return a useful result:


As we can easily check, our array is sorted now:


The function factories can be used as decorator factories, so we may as well
write:



Note
Make sure you keep references to  objects as long as they
are used from C code.  doesn’t, and if you don’t, they may be
garbage collected, crashing your program when a callback is made.
Also, note that if the callback function is called in a thread created
outside of Python’s control (e.g. by the foreign code that calls the
callback), ctypes creates a new dummy Python thread on every invocation. This
behavior is correct for most purposes, but it means that values stored with
 will not survive across different callbacks, even when
those calls are made from the same C thread.



Accessing values exported from dlls¶
Some shared libraries not only export functions, they also export variables. An
example in the Python library itself is the , an integer
set to 0, 1, or 2, depending on the  or  flag given on
startup.
 can access values like this with the  class methods of
the type.  pythonapi is a predefined symbol giving access to the Python C
api:


If the interpreter would have been started with , the sample would
have printed , or  if  would have been
specified.
An extended example which also demonstrates the use of pointers accesses the
 pointer exported by Python.
Quoting the docs for that value:

This pointer is initialized to point to an array of 
records, terminated by one whose members are all NULL or zero.  When a frozen
module is imported, it is searched in this table.  Third-party code could play
tricks with this to provide a dynamically created collection of frozen modules.
So manipulating this pointer could even prove useful. To restrict the example
size, we show only how this table can be read with :


We have defined the  data type, so we can get the pointer
to the table:


Since  is a  to the array of  records, we
can iterate over it, but we just have to make sure that our loop terminates,
because pointers have no size. Sooner or later it would probably crash with an
access violation or whatever, so it’s better to break out of the loop when we
hit the NULL entry:


The fact that standard Python has a frozen module and a frozen package
(indicated by the negative size member) is not well known, it is only used for
testing. Try it out with  for example.


Surprises¶
There are some edges in  where you might expect something other
than what actually happens.
Consider the following example:


Hm. We certainly expected the last statement to print . What
happened? Here are the steps of the  line above:


Note that  and  are objects still using the internal buffer of
the  object above. So executing  copies the buffer
contents of  into  ‘s buffer.  This, in turn, changes the
contents of . So, the last assignment , doesn’t have
the expected effect.
Keep in mind that retrieving sub-objects from Structure, Unions, and Arrays
doesn’t copy the sub-object, instead it retrieves a wrapper object accessing
the root-object’s underlying buffer.
Another example that may behave different from what one would expect is this:


Why is it printing ?  ctypes instances are objects containing a memory
block plus some descriptors accessing the contents of the memory.
Storing a Python object in the memory block does not store the object itself,
instead the  of the object is stored.  Accessing the contents again
constructs a new Python object each time!


Variable-sized data types¶
 provides some support for variable-sized arrays and structures.
The  function can be used to resize the memory buffer of an
existing ctypes object.  The function takes the object as first argument, and
the requested size in bytes as the second argument.  The memory block cannot be
made smaller than the natural memory block specified by the objects type, a
 is raised if this is tried:


This is nice and fine, but how would one access the additional elements
contained in this array?  Since the type still only knows about 4 elements, we
get errors accessing other elements:


Another way to use variable-sized data types with  is to use the
dynamic nature of Python, and (re-)define the data type after the required size
is already known, on a case by case basis.



ctypes reference¶

Finding shared libraries¶
When programming in a compiled language, shared libraries are accessed when
compiling/linking a program, and when the program is run.
The purpose of the  function is to locate a library in a way
similar to what the compiler or runtime loader does (on platforms with several
versions of a shared library the most recent should be loaded), while the ctypes
library loaders act like when a program is run, and call the runtime loader
directly.
The  module provides a function which can help to determine
the library to load.


(name)
Try to find a library and return a pathname.  name is the library name without
any prefix like lib, suffix like ,  or version number (this
is the form used for the posix linker option ).  If no library can
be found, returns .

The exact functionality is system dependent.
On Linux,  tries to run external programs
(, ,  and ) to find the library file.
It returns the filename of the library file.

Changed in version 3.6: On Linux, the value of the environment variable  is used
when searching for libraries, if a library cannot be found by any other means.

Here are some examples:


On OS X,  tries several predefined naming schemes and paths
to locate the library, and returns a full pathname if successful:


On Windows,  searches along the system search path, and
returns the full pathname, but since there is no predefined naming scheme a call
like  will fail and return .
If wrapping a shared library with , it may be better to determine
the shared library name at development time, and hardcode that into the wrapper
module instead of using  to locate the library at runtime.


Loading shared libraries¶
There are several ways to load shared libraries into the Python process.  One
way is to instantiate one of the following classes:


class (name, mode=DEFAULT_MODE, handle=None, use_errno=False, use_last_error=False)¶
Instances of this class represent loaded shared libraries. Functions in these
libraries use the standard C calling convention, and are assumed to return
.



class (name, mode=DEFAULT_MODE, handle=None, use_errno=False, use_last_error=False)¶
Windows only: Instances of this class represent loaded shared libraries,
functions in these libraries use the  calling convention, and are
assumed to return the windows specific  code.  
values contain information specifying whether the function call failed or
succeeded, together with additional error code.  If the return value signals a
failure, an  is automatically raised.

Changed in version 3.3:  used to be raised.




class (name, mode=DEFAULT_MODE, handle=None, use_errno=False, use_last_error=False)¶
Windows only: Instances of this class represent loaded shared libraries,
functions in these libraries use the  calling convention, and are
assumed to return  by default.
On Windows CE only the standard calling convention is used, for convenience the
 and  use the standard calling convention on this
platform.

The Python global interpreter lock is released before calling any
function exported by these libraries, and reacquired afterwards.


class (name, mode=DEFAULT_MODE, handle=None)¶
Instances of this class behave like  instances, except that the
Python GIL is not released during the function call, and after the function
execution the Python error flag is checked. If the error flag is set, a Python
exception is raised.
Thus, this is only useful to call Python C api functions directly.

All these classes can be instantiated by calling them with at least one
argument, the pathname of the shared library.  If you have an existing handle to
an already loaded shared library, it can be passed as the  named
parameter, otherwise the underlying platforms  or 
function is used to load the library into the process, and to get a handle to
it.
The mode parameter can be used to specify how the library is loaded.  For
details, consult the dlopen(3) manpage.  On Windows, mode is
ignored.  On posix systems, RTLD_NOW is always added, and is not
configurable.
The use_errno parameter, when set to true, enables a ctypes mechanism that
allows accessing the system  error number in a safe way.
 maintains a thread-local copy of the systems 
variable; if you call foreign functions created with  then the
 value before the function call is swapped with the ctypes private
copy, the same happens immediately after the function call.
The function  returns the value of the ctypes private
copy, and the function  changes the ctypes private copy
to a new value and returns the former value.
The use_last_error parameter, when set to true, enables the same mechanism for
the Windows error code which is managed by the  and
 Windows API functions;  and
 are used to request and change the ctypes private
copy of the windows error code.



Flag to use as mode parameter.  On platforms where this flag is not available,
it is defined as the integer zero.




Flag to use as mode parameter.  On platforms where this is not available, it
is the same as RTLD_GLOBAL.




The default mode which is used to load shared libraries.  On OSX 10.3, this is
RTLD_GLOBAL, otherwise it is the same as RTLD_LOCAL.

Instances of these classes have no public methods.  Functions exported by the
shared library can be accessed as attributes or by index.  Please note that
accessing the function through an attribute caches the result and therefore
accessing it repeatedly returns the same object each time.  On the other hand,
accessing it through an index returns a new object each time:


The following public attributes are available, their name starts with an
underscore to not clash with exported function names:


¶
The system handle used to access the library.



¶
The name of the library passed in the constructor.

Shared libraries can also be loaded by using one of the prefabricated objects,
which are instances of the  class, either by calling the
 method, or by retrieving the library as attribute of the
loader instance.


class (dlltype)¶
Class which loads shared libraries.  dlltype should be one of the
, , , or  types.
 has special behavior: It allows loading a shared library by
accessing it as attribute of a library loader instance.  The result is cached,
so repeated attribute accesses return the same library each time.


(name)¶
Load a shared library into the process and return it.  This method always
returns a new instance of the library.


These prefabricated library loaders are available:



Creates  instances.




Windows only: Creates  instances.




Windows only: Creates  instances.




Creates  instances.

For accessing the C Python api directly, a ready-to-use Python shared library
object is available:



An instance of  that exposes Python C API functions as
attributes.  Note that all these functions are assumed to return C
, which is of course not always the truth, so you have to assign
the correct  attribute to use these functions.



Foreign functions¶
As explained in the previous section, foreign functions can be accessed as
attributes of loaded shared libraries.  The function objects created in this way
by default accept any number of arguments, accept any ctypes data instances as
arguments, and return the default result type specified by the library loader.
They are instances of a private class:


class ¶
Base class for C callable foreign functions.
Instances of foreign functions are also C compatible data types; they
represent C function pointers.
This behavior can be customized by assigning to special attributes of the
foreign function object.


¶
Assign a ctypes type to specify the result type of the foreign function.
Use  for , a function not returning anything.
It is possible to assign a callable Python object that is not a ctypes
type, in this case the function is assumed to return a C , and
the callable will be called with this integer, allowing further
processing or error checking.  Using this is deprecated, for more flexible
post processing or error checking use a ctypes data type as
 and assign a callable to the  attribute.



¶
Assign a tuple of ctypes types to specify the argument types that the
function accepts.  Functions using the  calling convention can
only be called with the same number of arguments as the length of this
tuple; functions using the C calling convention accept additional,
unspecified arguments as well.
When a foreign function is called, each actual argument is passed to the
 class method of the items in the 
tuple, this method allows adapting the actual argument to an object that
the foreign function accepts.  For example, a  item in
the  tuple will convert a string passed as argument into
a bytes object using ctypes conversion rules.
New: It is now possible to put items in argtypes which are not ctypes
types, but each item must have a  method which returns a
value usable as argument (integer, string, ctypes instance).  This allows
defining adapters that can adapt custom objects as function parameters.



¶
Assign a Python function or another callable to this attribute. The
callable will be called with three or more arguments:


(result, func, arguments)
result is what the foreign function returns, as specified by the
 attribute.
func is the foreign function object itself, this allows reusing the
same callable object to check or post process the results of several
functions.
arguments is a tuple containing the parameters originally passed to
the function call, this allows specializing the behavior on the
arguments used.

The object that this function returns will be returned from the
foreign function call, but it can also check the result value
and raise an exception if the foreign function call failed.




exception ¶
This exception is raised when a foreign function call cannot convert one of the
passed arguments.



Function prototypes¶
Foreign functions can also be created by instantiating function prototypes.
Function prototypes are similar to function prototypes in C; they describe a
function (return type, argument types, calling convention) without defining an
implementation.  The factory functions must be called with the desired result
type and the argument types of the function, and can be used as decorator
factories, and as such, be applied to functions through the  syntax.
See Callback functions for examples.


(restype, *argtypes, use_errno=False, use_last_error=False)¶
The returned function prototype creates functions that use the standard C
calling convention.  The function will release the GIL during the call.  If
use_errno is set to true, the ctypes private copy of the system
 variable is exchanged with the real  value before
and after the call; use_last_error does the same for the Windows error
code.



(restype, *argtypes, use_errno=False, use_last_error=False)¶
Windows only: The returned function prototype creates functions that use the
 calling convention, except on Windows CE where
 is the same as .  The function will
release the GIL during the call.  use_errno and use_last_error have the
same meaning as above.



(restype, *argtypes)¶
The returned function prototype creates functions that use the Python calling
convention.  The function will not release the GIL during the call.

Function prototypes created by these factory functions can be instantiated in
different ways, depending on the type and number of the parameters in the call:



(address)
Returns a foreign function at the specified address which must be an integer.



(callable)
Create a C callable function (a callback function) from a Python callable.



(func_spec[, paramflags])
Returns a foreign function exported by a shared library. func_spec must
be a 2-tuple . The first item is the name of
the exported function as string, or the ordinal of the exported function
as small integer.  The second item is the shared library instance.



(vtbl_index, name[, paramflags[, iid]])
Returns a foreign function that will call a COM method. vtbl_index is
the index into the virtual function table, a small non-negative
integer. name is name of the COM method. iid is an optional pointer to
the interface identifier which is used in extended error reporting.
COM methods use a special calling convention: They require a pointer to
the COM interface as first argument, in addition to those parameters that
are specified in the  tuple.

The optional paramflags parameter creates foreign function wrappers with much
more functionality than the features described above.
paramflags must be a tuple of the same length as .
Each item in this tuple contains further information about a parameter, it must
be a tuple containing one, two, or three items.
The first item is an integer containing a combination of direction
flags for the parameter:


1
Specifies an input parameter to the function.
2
Output parameter.  The foreign function fills in a value.
4
Input parameter which defaults to the integer zero.


The optional second item is the parameter name as string.  If this is specified,
the foreign function can be called with named parameters.
The optional third item is the default value for this parameter.

This example demonstrates how to wrap the Windows  function so
that it supports default parameters and named arguments. The C declaration from
the windows header file is this:


Here is the wrapping with :


The  foreign function can now be called in these ways:


A second example demonstrates output parameters.  The win32 
function retrieves the dimensions of a specified window by copying them into
 structure that the caller has to supply.  Here is the C declaration:


Here is the wrapping with :


Functions with output parameters will automatically return the output parameter
value if there is a single one, or a tuple containing the output parameter
values when there are more than one, so the GetWindowRect function now returns a
RECT instance, when called.
Output parameters can be combined with the  protocol to do
further output processing and error checking.  The win32  api
function returns a  to signal success or failure, so this function could
do the error checking, and raises an exception when the api call failed:


If the  function returns the argument tuple it receives
unchanged,  continues the normal processing it does on the output
parameters.  If you want to return a tuple of window coordinates instead of a
 instance, you can retrieve the fields in the function and return them
instead, the normal processing will no longer take place:




Utility functions¶


(obj)¶
Returns the address of the memory buffer as integer.  obj must be an
instance of a ctypes type.



(obj_or_type)¶
Returns the alignment requirements of a ctypes type. obj_or_type must be a
ctypes type or instance.



(obj[, offset])¶
Returns a light-weight pointer to obj, which must be an instance of a
ctypes type.  offset defaults to zero, and must be an integer that will be
added to the internal pointer value.
 corresponds to this C code:


The returned object can only be used as a foreign function call parameter.
It behaves similar to , but the construction is a lot faster.



(obj, type)¶
This function is similar to the cast operator in C. It returns a new instance
of type which points to the same memory block as obj.  type must be a
pointer type, and obj must be an object that can be interpreted as a
pointer.



(init_or_size, size=None)¶
This function creates a mutable character buffer. The returned object is a
ctypes array of .
init_or_size must be an integer which specifies the size of the array, or a
bytes object which will be used to initialize the array items.
If a bytes object is specified as first argument, the buffer is made one item
larger than its length so that the last element in the array is a NUL
termination character. An integer can be passed as second argument which allows
specifying the size of the array if the length of the bytes should not be used.



(init_or_size, size=None)¶
This function creates a mutable unicode character buffer. The returned object is
a ctypes array of .
init_or_size must be an integer which specifies the size of the array, or a
string which will be used to initialize the array items.
If a string is specified as first argument, the buffer is made one item
larger than the length of the string so that the last element in the array is a
NUL termination character. An integer can be passed as second argument which
allows specifying the size of the array if the length of the string should not
be used.



()¶
Windows only: This function is a hook which allows implementing in-process
COM servers with ctypes.  It is called from the DllCanUnloadNow function that
the _ctypes extension dll exports.



()¶
Windows only: This function is a hook which allows implementing in-process
COM servers with ctypes.  It is called from the DllGetClassObject function
that the  extension dll exports.



(name)¶
Try to find a library and return a pathname.  name is the library name
without any prefix like , suffix like ,  or version
number (this is the form used for the posix linker option ).  If
no library can be found, returns .
The exact functionality is system dependent.



()¶
Windows only: return the filename of the VC runtime library used by Python,
and by the extension modules.  If the name of the library cannot be
determined,  is returned.
If you need to free memory, for example, allocated by an extension module
with a call to the , it is important that you use the
function in the same library that allocated the memory.



([code])¶
Windows only: Returns a textual description of the error code code.  If no
error code is specified, the last error code is used by calling the Windows
api function GetLastError.



()¶
Windows only: Returns the last error code set by Windows in the calling thread.
This function calls the Windows GetLastError() function directly,
it does not return the ctypes-private copy of the error code.



()¶
Returns the current value of the ctypes-private copy of the system
 variable in the calling thread.



()¶
Windows only: returns the current value of the ctypes-private copy of the system
 variable in the calling thread.



(dst, src, count)¶
Same as the standard C memmove library function: copies count bytes from
src to dst. dst and src must be integers or ctypes instances that can
be converted to pointers.



(dst, c, count)¶
Same as the standard C memset library function: fills the memory block at
address dst with count bytes of value c. dst must be an integer
specifying an address, or a ctypes instance.



(type)¶
This factory function creates and returns a new ctypes pointer type. Pointer
types are cached and reused internally, so calling this function repeatedly is
cheap. type must be a ctypes type.



(obj)¶
This function creates a new pointer instance, pointing to obj. The returned
object is of the type .
Note: If you just want to pass a pointer to an object to a foreign function
call, you should use  which is much faster.



(obj, size)¶
This function resizes the internal memory buffer of obj, which must be an
instance of a ctypes type.  It is not possible to make the buffer smaller
than the native size of the objects type, as given by ,
but it is possible to enlarge the buffer.



(value)¶
Set the current value of the ctypes-private copy of the system 
variable in the calling thread to value and return the previous value.



(value)¶
Windows only: set the current value of the ctypes-private copy of the system
 variable in the calling thread to value and return the
previous value.



(obj_or_type)¶
Returns the size in bytes of a ctypes type or instance memory buffer.
Does the same as the C  operator.



(address, size=-1)¶
This function returns the C string starting at memory address address as a bytes
object. If size is specified, it is used as size, otherwise the string is assumed
to be zero-terminated.



(code=None, descr=None)¶
Windows only: this function is probably the worst-named thing in ctypes. It
creates an instance of OSError.  If code is not specified,
 is called to determine the error code. If descr is not
specified,  is called to get a textual description of the
error.

Changed in version 3.3: An instance of  used to be created.




(address, size=-1)¶
This function returns the wide character string starting at memory address
address as a string.  If size is specified, it is used as the number of
characters of the string, otherwise the string is assumed to be
zero-terminated.



Data types¶


class ¶
This non-public class is the common base class of all ctypes data types.
Among other things, all ctypes type instances contain a memory block that
hold C compatible data; the address of the memory block is returned by the
 helper function. Another instance variable is exposed as
; this contains other Python objects that need to be kept
alive in case the memory block contains pointers.
Common methods of ctypes data types, these are all class methods (to be
exact, they are methods of the metaclass):


(source[, offset])¶
This method returns a ctypes instance that shares the buffer of the
source object.  The source object must support the writeable buffer
interface.  The optional offset parameter specifies an offset into the
source buffer in bytes; the default is zero.  If the source buffer is not
large enough a  is raised.



(source[, offset])¶
This method creates a ctypes instance, copying the buffer from the
source object buffer which must be readable.  The optional offset
parameter specifies an offset into the source buffer in bytes; the default
is zero.  If the source buffer is not large enough a  is
raised.



(address)¶
This method returns a ctypes type instance using the memory specified by
address which must be an integer.



(obj)¶
This method adapts obj to a ctypes type.  It is called with the actual
object used in a foreign function call when the type is present in the
foreign function’s  tuple; it must return an object that
can be used as a function call parameter.
All ctypes data types have a default implementation of this classmethod
that normally returns obj if that is an instance of the type.  Some
types accept other objects as well.



(library, name)¶
This method returns a ctypes type instance exported by a shared
library. name is the name of the symbol that exports the data, library
is the loaded shared library.

Common instance variables of ctypes data types:


¶
Sometimes ctypes data instances do not own the memory block they contain,
instead they share part of the memory block of a base object.  The
 read-only member is the root ctypes object that owns the
memory block.



¶
This read-only variable is true when the ctypes data instance has
allocated the memory block itself, false otherwise.



¶
This member is either  or a dictionary containing Python objects
that need to be kept alive so that the memory block contents is kept
valid.  This object is only exposed for debugging; never modify the
contents of this dictionary.




Fundamental data types¶


class ¶
This non-public class is the base class of all fundamental ctypes data
types. It is mentioned here because it contains the common attributes of the
fundamental ctypes data types.   is a subclass of
, so it inherits their methods and attributes. ctypes data
types that are not and do not contain pointers can now be pickled.
Instances have a single attribute:


¶
This attribute contains the actual value of the instance. For integer and
pointer types, it is an integer, for character types, it is a single
character bytes object or string, for character pointer types it is a
Python bytes object or string.
When the  attribute is retrieved from a ctypes instance, usually
a new object is returned each time.   does not implement
original object return, always a new object is constructed.  The same is
true for all other ctypes object instances.


Fundamental data types, when returned as foreign function call results, or, for
example, by retrieving structure field members or array items, are transparently
converted to native Python types.  In other words, if a foreign function has a
 of , you will always receive a Python bytes
object, not a  instance.
Subclasses of fundamental data types do not inherit this behavior. So, if a
foreign functions  is a subclass of , you will
receive an instance of this subclass from the function call. Of course, you can
get the value of the pointer by accessing the  attribute.
These are the fundamental ctypes data types:

Structured data types¶


class (*args, **kw)¶
Abstract base class for unions in native byte order.



class (*args, **kw)¶
Abstract base class for structures in big endian byte order.



class (*args, **kw)¶
Abstract base class for structures in little endian byte order.

Structures with non-native byte order cannot contain pointer type fields, or any
other data types containing pointer type fields.


class (*args, **kw)¶
Abstract base class for structures in native byte order.
Concrete structure and union types must be created by subclassing one of these
types, and at least define a  class variable.  will
create descriptors which allow reading and writing the fields by direct
attribute accesses.  These are the


¶
A sequence defining the structure fields.  The items must be 2-tuples or
3-tuples.  The first item is the name of the field, the second item
specifies the type of the field; it can be any ctypes data type.
For integer type fields like , a third optional item can be
given.  It must be a small positive integer defining the bit width of the
field.
Field names must be unique within one structure or union.  This is not
checked, only one field can be accessed when names are repeated.
It is possible to define the  class variable after the
class statement that defines the Structure subclass, this allows creating
data types that directly or indirectly reference themselves:


The  class variable must, however, be defined before the
type is first used (an instance is created,  is called on it,
and so on).  Later assignments to the  class variable will
raise an AttributeError.
It is possible to define sub-subclasses of structure types, they inherit
the fields of the base class plus the  defined in the
sub-subclass, if any.



¶
An optional small integer that allows overriding the alignment of
structure fields in the instance.   must already be defined
when  is assigned, otherwise it will have no effect.



¶
An optional sequence that lists the names of unnamed (anonymous) fields.
 must be already defined when  is
assigned, otherwise it will have no effect.
The fields listed in this variable must be structure or union type fields.
 will create descriptors in the structure type that allows
accessing the nested fields directly, without the need to create the
structure or union field.
Here is an example type (Windows):


The  structure describes a COM data type, the  field
specifies which one of the union fields is valid.  Since the  field
is defined as anonymous field, it is now possible to access the members
directly off the TYPEDESC instance.  and 
are equivalent, but the former is faster since it does not need to create
a temporary union instance:



It is possible to define sub-subclasses of structures, they inherit the
fields of the base class.  If the subclass definition has a separate
 variable, the fields specified in this are appended to the
fields of the base class.
Structure and union constructors accept both positional and keyword
arguments.  Positional arguments are used to initialize member fields in the
same order as they are appear in .  Keyword arguments in the
constructor are interpreted as attribute assignments, so they will initialize
 with the same name, or create new attributes for names not
present in .



Arrays and pointers¶


class (*args)¶
Abstract base class for arrays.
The recommended way to create concrete array types is by multiplying any
 data type with a positive integer.  Alternatively, you can subclass
this type and define  and  class variables.
Array elements can be read and written using standard
subscript and slice accesses; for slice reads, the resulting object is
not itself an .


¶
A positive integer specifying the number of elements in the array.
Out-of-range subscripts result in an . Will be
returned by .



¶
Specifies the type of each element in the array.

Array subclass constructors accept positional arguments, used to
initialize the elements in order.



class ¶
Private, abstract base class for pointers.
Concrete pointer types are created by calling  with the
type that will be pointed to; this is done automatically by
.
If a pointer points to an array, its elements can be read and
written using standard subscript and slice accesses.  Pointer objects
have no size, so  will raise .  Negative
subscripts will read from the memory before the pointer (as in C), and
out-of-range subscripts will probably crash with an access violation (if
you’re lucky).


¶
Specifies the type pointed to.



¶
Returns the object to which to pointer points.  Assigning to this
attribute changes the pointer to point to the assigned object.
