(instance)Â¶
Register an object which is used to expose method names  which have not been
registered using . If  instance contains a
 method, it is called with the  requested method name and the
parameters from the  request; the return value is returned to the client as the
result. If instance does not have a  method, it is searched
for an attribute matching the name of the requested method; if  the requested
method name contains periods, each  component of the method name is searched for
individually,  with the effect that a simple hierarchical search is performed.
The value found from this search is then called with the  parameters from the
request, and the return value is passed  back to the client.
