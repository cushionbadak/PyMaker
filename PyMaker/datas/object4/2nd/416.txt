docs:


()Â¶
Return a casefolded copy of the string. Casefolded strings may be used for
caseless matching.
Casefolding is similar to lowercasing but more aggressive because it is
intended to remove all case distinctions in a string. For example, the German
lowercase letter  is equivalent to . Since it is already
lowercase,  would do nothing to ; 
converts it to .
The casefolding algorithm is described in section 3.13 of the Unicode
Standard.

New in version 3.3.
