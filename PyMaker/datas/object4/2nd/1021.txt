docs:


(input[, errors])Â¶
Encodes the object input and returns a tuple (output object, length consumed).
For instance, text encoding converts
a string object to a bytes object using a particular
character set encoding (e.g.,  or ).
The errors argument defines the error handling to apply.
It defaults to  handling.
The method may not store state in the  instance. Use
 for codecs which have to keep state in order to make
encoding efficient.
The encoder must be able to handle zero length input and return an empty object
of the output object type in this situation.
