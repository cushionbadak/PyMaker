docs:


(*args, **kwargs)Â¶
Perform a string formatting operation.  The string on which this method is
called can contain literal text or replacement fields delimited by braces
.  Each replacement field contains either the numeric index of a
positional argument, or the name of a keyword argument.  Returns a copy of
the string where each replacement field is replaced with the string value of
the corresponding argument.


See Format String Syntax for a description of the various formatting options
that can be specified in format strings.

Note
When formatting a number (, , ,
 and subclasses) with the  type
(ex: ), the function temporarily sets the
 locale to the  locale to decode
 and  fields of  if
they are non-ASCII or longer than 1 byte, and the  locale is
different than the  locale.  This temporary change affects
other threads.


Changed in version 3.7: When formatting a number with the  type, the function sets
temporarily the  locale to the  locale in some
cases.
