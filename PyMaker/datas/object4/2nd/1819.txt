Functions for sequences¶


(seq)¶
Return a random element from the non-empty sequence seq. If seq is empty,
raises .



(population, weights=None, *, cum_weights=None, k=1)¶
Return a k sized list of elements chosen from the population with replacement.
If the population is empty, raises .
If a weights sequence is specified, selections are made according to the
relative weights.  Alternatively, if a cum_weights sequence is given, the
selections are made according to the cumulative weights (perhaps computed
using ).  For example, the relative weights
 are equivalent to the cumulative weights
.  Internally, the relative weights are converted to
cumulative weights before making selections, so supplying the cumulative
weights saves work.
If neither weights nor cum_weights are specified, selections are made
with equal probability.  If a weights sequence is supplied, it must be
the same length as the population sequence.  It is a 
to specify both weights and cum_weights.
The weights or cum_weights can use any numeric type that interoperates
with the  values returned by  (that includes
integers, floats, and fractions but excludes decimals).
For a given seed, the  function with equal weighting
typically produces a different sequence than repeated calls to
.  The algorithm used by  uses floating
point arithmetic for internal consistency and speed.  The algorithm used
by  defaults to integer arithmetic with repeated selections
to avoid small biases from round-off error.

New in version 3.6.




(x[, random])¶
Shuffle the sequence x in place.
The optional argument random is a 0-argument function returning a random
float in [0.0, 1.0); by default, this is the function .
To shuffle an immutable sequence and return a new shuffled list, use
 instead.
Note that even for small , the total number of permutations of x
can quickly grow larger than the period of most random number generators.
This implies that most permutations of a long sequence can never be
generated.  For example, a sequence of length 2080 is the largest that
can fit within the period of the Mersenne Twister random number generator.



(population, k)¶
Return a k length list of unique elements chosen from the population sequence
or set. Used for random sampling without replacement.
Returns a new list containing elements from the population while leaving the
original population unchanged.  The resulting list is in selection order so that
all sub-slices will also be valid random samples.  This allows raffle winners
(the sample) to be partitioned into grand prize and second place winners (the
subslices).
Members of the population need not be hashable or unique.  If the population
contains repeats, then each occurrence is a possible selection in the sample.
To choose a sample from a range of integers, use a  object as an
argument.  This is especially fast and space efficient for sampling from a large
population:  .
If the sample size is larger than the population size, a 
is raised.
