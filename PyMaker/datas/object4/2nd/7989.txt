docs:


(s, comments=False, posix=True)Â¶
Split the string s using shell-like syntax. If comments is 
(the default), the parsing of comments in the given string will be disabled
(setting the  attribute of the
 instance to the empty string).  This function operates
in POSIX mode by default, but uses non-POSIX mode if the posix argument is
false.

Note
Since the  function instantiates a 
instance, passing  for s will read the string to split from
standard input.
