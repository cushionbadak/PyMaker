docs:


(ctype)Â¶
Set the default content type.  ctype should either be
text/plain or message/rfc822, although this is
not enforced.  The default content type is not stored in the
Content-Type header, so it only affects the return value of
the  methods when no Content-Type
header is present in the message.
