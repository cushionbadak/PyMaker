class (stdin, stdout, stderr, environ, multithread=True, multiprocess=False)¶

software other than HTTP “origin servers”.  If you are writing a gateway
protocol implementation (such as CGI, FastCGI, SCGI, etc.) that uses a
 header to send an HTTP status, you probably want to subclass this
instead of .
