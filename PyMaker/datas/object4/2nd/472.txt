(sub[, start[, end]])¶

(sub[, start[, end]])¶
Return the number of non-overlapping occurrences of subsequence sub in
the range [start, end].  Optional arguments start and end are
interpreted as in slice notation.
The subsequence to search for may be any bytes-like object or an
integer in the range 0 to 255.

Changed in version 3.3: Also accept an integer in the range 0 to 255 as the subsequence.
