docs:


(fn)Â¶
Attaches the callable fn to the future.  fn will be called, with the
future as its only argument, when the future is cancelled or finishes
running.
Added callables are called in the order that they were added and are
always called in a thread belonging to the process that added them.  If
the callable raises an  subclass, it will be logged and
ignored.  If the callable raises a  subclass, the
behavior is undefined.
If the future has already completed or been cancelled, fn will be
called immediately.
