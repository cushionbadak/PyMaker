docs:


(src, dst, *, follow_symlinks=True)Â¶
Copy the permission bits from src to dst.  The file contents, owner, and
group are unaffected.  src and dst are path names given as strings.
If follow_symlinks is false, and both src and dst are symbolic links,
 will attempt to modify the mode of dst itself (rather
than the file it points to).  This functionality is not available on every
platform; please see  for more information.  If
 cannot modify symbolic links on the local platform, and it
is asked to do so, it will do nothing and return.

Changed in version 3.3: Added follow_symlinks argument.
