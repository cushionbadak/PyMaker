(path='.')Â¶
Return a list containing the names of the entries in the directory given by
path.  The list is in arbitrary order, and does not include the special
entries  and  even if they are present in the directory.
path may be a path-like object.  If path is of type 
(directly or indirectly through the  interface),
the filenames returned will also be of type ;
in all other circumstances, they will be of type .
This function can also support specifying a file descriptor; the file descriptor must refer to a directory.

Note
To encode  filenames to , use .

The  function returns directory entries along with
file attribute information, giving better performance for many
common use cases.

New in version 3.3: Added support for specifying an open file descriptor for path.


Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a path-like object.
