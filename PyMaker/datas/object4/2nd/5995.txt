docs:


(b, *, foldspaces=False, wrapcol=0, pad=False, adobe=False)¶
Encode the bytes-like object b using Ascii85 and return the
encoded .
foldspaces is an optional flag that uses the special short sequence ‘y’
instead of 4 consecutive spaces (ASCII 0x20) as supported by ‘btoa’. This
feature is not supported by the “standard” Ascii85 encoding.
wrapcol controls whether the output should have newline ()
characters added to it. If this is non-zero, each output line will be
at most this many characters long.
pad controls whether the input is padded to a multiple of 4
before encoding. Note that the  implementation always pads.
adobe controls whether the encoded byte sequence is framed with 
and , which is used by the Adobe implementation.

New in version 3.4.
