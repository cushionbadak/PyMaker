docs:


(levelname)¶
Maps a logging level name to a syslog priority name.
You may need to override this if you are using custom levels, or
if the default algorithm is not suitable for your needs. The
default algorithm maps , , ,  and
 to the equivalent syslog names, and all other level
names to ‘warning’.
