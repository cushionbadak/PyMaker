docs:


(src, dst, *, follow_symlinks=True)Â¶
Copy the contents (no metadata) of the file named src to a file named
dst and return dst.  src and dst are path names given as strings.
dst must be the complete target file name; look at 
for a copy that accepts a target directory path.  If src and dst
specify the same file,  is raised.
The destination location must be writable; otherwise, an 
exception will be raised. If dst already exists, it will be replaced.
Special files such as character or block devices and pipes cannot be
copied with this function.
If follow_symlinks is false and src is a symbolic link,
a new symbolic link will be created instead of copying the
file src points to.

Changed in version 3.3:  used to be raised instead of .
Added follow_symlinks argument.
Now returns dst.


Changed in version 3.4: Raise  instead of .  Since the former is
a subclass of the latter, this change is backward compatible.
