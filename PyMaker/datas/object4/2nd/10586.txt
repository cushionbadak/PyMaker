docs:


¶
A dictionary mapping type names to type-checking functions.  A type-checking
function has the following signature:


where  is an  instance,  is an option string
(e.g., ), and  is the string from the command line that must
be checked and converted to your desired type.   should
return an object of the hypothetical type .  The value returned by
a type-checking function will wind up in the OptionValues instance returned
by , or be passed to a callback as the
 parameter.
Your type-checking function should raise  if it
encounters any problems.   takes a single string
argument, which is passed as-is to ’s 
method, which in turn prepends the program name and the string 
and prints everything to stderr before terminating the process.
