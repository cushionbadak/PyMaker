(threshold0[, threshold1[, threshold2]])Â¶
Set the garbage collection thresholds (the collection frequency). Setting
threshold0 to zero disables collection.
The GC classifies objects into three generations depending on how many
collection sweeps they have survived.  New objects are placed in the youngest
generation (generation ).  If an object survives a collection it is moved
into the next older generation.  Since generation  is the oldest
generation, objects in that generation remain there after a collection.  In
order to decide when to run, the collector keeps track of the number object
allocations and deallocations since the last collection.  When the number of
allocations minus the number of deallocations exceeds threshold0, collection
starts.  Initially only generation  is examined.  If generation  has
been examined more than threshold1 times since generation  has been
examined, then generation  is examined as well.  Similarly, threshold2
controls the number of collections of generation  before collecting
generation .
