docs:


(dhfile)¶
Load the key generation parameters for Diffie-Hellman (DH) key exchange.
Using DH key exchange improves forward secrecy at the expense of
computational resources (both on the server and on the client).
The dhfile parameter should be the path to a file containing DH
parameters in PEM format.
This setting doesn’t apply to client sockets.  You can also use the
 option to further improve security.

New in version 3.3.
