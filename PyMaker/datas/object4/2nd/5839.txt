()¶

()¶
Return an iterator over (key, message) pairs, where key is a key and
message is a message representation, if called as  or
return a list of such pairs if called as . The messages are
represented as instances of the appropriate format-specific
 subclass unless a custom message factory was specified
when the  instance was initialized.
