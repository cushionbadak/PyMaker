(msg, decode=False)¶
This iterates over all the payloads in all the subparts of msg, returning the
string payloads line-by-line.  It skips over all the subpart headers, and it
skips over any subpart with a payload that isn’t a Python string.  This is
somewhat equivalent to reading the flat text representation of the message from
a file using , skipping over all the
intervening headers.
Optional decode is passed through to .
