docs:


(name, default=None)¶
Return the value of the header name, or default if there is no header
matching name.  If there is more than one  header with the name name,
return all of the values joined by ‘, ‘.  If ‘default’ is any iterable other
than a single string, its elements are similarly returned joined by commas.
