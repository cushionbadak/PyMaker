¶


class (message=None)¶
A message with MH-specific behaviors. Parameter message has the same meaning
as with the  constructor.
MH messages do not support marks or flags in the traditional sense, but they
do support sequences, which are logical groupings of arbitrary messages. Some
mail reading programs (although not the standard mh and
nmh) use sequences in much the same way flags are used with other
formats, as follows:






Sequence
Explanation



unseen
Not read, but previously detected by MUA

replied
Replied to

flagged
Marked as important



 instances offer the following methods:


()¶
Return a list of the names of sequences that include this message.



(sequences)¶
Set the list of sequences that include this message.



(sequence)¶
Add sequence to the list of sequences that include this message.



(sequence)¶
Remove sequence from the list of sequences that include this message.

 instance, the following conversions take place:

When an  instance is created based upon an
