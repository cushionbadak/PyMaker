docs:


(self, format_spec)¶
Called by the  built-in function,
and by extension, evaluation of formatted string literals and the  method, to produce a “formatted”
string representation of an object. The format_spec argument is
a string that contains a description of the formatting options desired.
The interpretation of the format_spec argument is up to the type
implementing , however most classes will either
delegate formatting to one of the built-in types, or use a similar
formatting option syntax.
See Format Specification Mini-Language for a description of the standard formatting syntax.
The return value must be a string object.

Changed in version 3.4: The __format__ method of  itself raises a 
if passed any non-empty string.


Changed in version 3.7:  is now equivalent to  rather
than .
