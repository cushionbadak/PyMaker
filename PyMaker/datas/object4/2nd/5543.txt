docs:


(fp, headersonly=False)Â¶
Read all the data from the binary file-like object fp, parse the
resulting bytes, and return the message object.  fp must support
both the  and the 
methods.
The bytes contained in fp must be formatted as a block of RFC 5322
(or, if  is , RFC 6532)
style headers and header continuation lines, optionally preceded by an
envelope header.  The header block is terminated either by the end of the
data or by a blank line.  Following the header block is the body of the
message (which may contain MIME-encoded subparts, including subparts
with a Content-Transfer-Encoding of ).
Optional headersonly is a flag specifying whether to stop parsing after
reading the headers or not.  The default is , meaning it parses
the entire contents of the file.
