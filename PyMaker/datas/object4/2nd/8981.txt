Â¶
Create an alias called name that executes command.  The command must
not be enclosed in quotes.  Replaceable parameters can be indicated by
, , and so on, while  is replaced by all the parameters.
If no command is given, the current alias for name is shown. If no
arguments are given, all aliases are listed.
Aliases may be nested and can contain anything that can be legally typed at
the pdb prompt.  Note that internal pdb commands can be overridden by
aliases.  Such a command is then hidden until the alias is removed.  Aliasing
is recursively applied to the first word of the command line; all other words
in the line are left alone.
As an example, here are two useful aliases (especially when placed in the
 file):
