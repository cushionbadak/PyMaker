class ¶
A enumeration of possible methods the interpreter can use to determine
whether a bytecode file is up to date with a source file. The  file
indicates the desired invalidation mode in its header. See
Cached bytecode invalidation for more information on how Python invalidates
 files at runtime.

New in version 3.7.



¶
The  file includes the timestamp and size of the source file,
which Python will compare against the metadata of the source file at
runtime to determine if the  file needs to be regenerated.



¶
The  file includes a hash of the source file content, which Python
will compare against the source at runtime to determine if the 
file needs to be regenerated.



¶
Like , the  file includes a hash of the source
file content. However, Python will at runtime assume the  file is
up to date and not validate the  against the source file at all.
This option is useful when the  are kept up to date by some
system external to Python like a build system.
