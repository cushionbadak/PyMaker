docs:


Â¶
If this attribute is set to a callable, the 
method delegates to this callable. The parameters passed to the callable
are those passed to .

Note
The namer function is called quite a few times during rollover,
so it should be as simple and as fast as possible. It should also
return the same output every time for a given input, otherwise the
rollover behaviour may not work as expected.


New in version 3.3.
