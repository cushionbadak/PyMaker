docs:


(sourcelines)¶
The email package calls this method with a list of strings, each string
ending with the line separation characters found in the source being
parsed.  The first line includes the field header name and separator.
All whitespace in the source is preserved.  The method should return the
 tuple that is to be stored in the  to
represent the parsed header.
If an implementation wishes to retain compatibility with the existing
email package policies, name should be the case preserved name (all
characters up to the ‘’ separator), while value should be the
unfolded value (all line separator characters removed, but whitespace
kept intact), stripped of leading whitespace.
sourcelines may contain surrogateescaped binary data.
There is no default implementation
