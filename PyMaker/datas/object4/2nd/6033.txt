(input, output, header=False)¶
Decode the contents of the input file and write the resulting decoded binary
data to the output file. input and output must be binary file objects.  If the optional argument header is present and true, underscore
will be decoded as space. This is used to decode “Q”-encoded headers as
described in RFC 1522: “MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions)
