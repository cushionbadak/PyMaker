Warning Categories¶
There are a number of built-in exceptions that represent warning categories.
This categorization is useful to be able to filter out groups of warnings.
While these are technically
built-in exceptions, they are
documented here, because conceptually they belong to the warnings mechanism.
User code can define additional warning categories by subclassing one of the
standard warning categories.  A warning category must always be a subclass of
the  class.
The following warnings category classes are currently defined:

Changed in version 3.7: Previously  and  were
distinguished based on whether a feature was being removed entirely or
changing its behaviour. They are now distinguished based on their
intended audience and the way they’re handled by the default warnings
filters.
