class ¶
Address headers are one of the most complex structured header types.
The  class provides a generic interface to any address
header.
This header type provides the following additional attributes:


¶
A tuple of  objects encoding the
addresses and groups found in the header value.  Addresses that are
not part of a group are represented in this list as single-address
 whose  is .



¶
A tuple of  objects encoding all
of the individual addresses from the header value.  If the header value
contains any groups, the individual addresses from the group are included
in the list at the point where the group occurs in the value (that is,
the list of addresses is “flattened” into a one dimensional list).

The  value of the header will have all encoded words decoded to
unicode.   encoded domain names are also decoded to
unicode.  The  value is set by ing the
 value of the elements of the  attribute with .
A list of  and  objects in any combination
may be used to set the value of an address header.   objects whose
 is  will be interpreted as single addresses, which
allows an address list to be copied with groups intact by using the list
obtained from the  attribute of the source header.
