ipaddress.summarize_address_range(first, last)Â¶
Return an iterator of the summarized network range given the first and last
IP addresses.  first is the first IPv4Address or
IPv6Address in the range and last is the last IPv4Address
or IPv6Address in the range.  A TypeError is raised if
first or last are not IP addresses or are not of the same version.  A
ValueError is raised if last is not greater than first or if
first address version is not 4 or 6.
