Running Blocking CodeÂ¶
Blocking (CPU-bound) code should not be called directly.  For example,
if a function performs a CPU-intensive calculation for 1 second,
all concurrent asyncio Tasks and IO operations would be delayed
by 1 second.
An executor can be used to run a task in a different thread or even in
a different process to avoid blocking block the OS thread with the
event loop.  See the loop.run_in_executor() method for more
details.
