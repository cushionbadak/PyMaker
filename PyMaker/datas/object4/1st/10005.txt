dis.dis(x=None, *, file=None, depth=None)¶
Disassemble the x object.  x can denote either a module, a class, a
method, a function, a generator, an asynchronous generator, a coroutine,
a code object, a string of source code or a byte sequence of raw bytecode.
For a module, it disassembles all functions. For a class, it disassembles
all methods (including class and static methods). For a code object or
sequence of raw bytecode, it prints one line per bytecode instruction.
It also recursively disassembles nested code objects (the code of
comprehensions, generator expressions and nested functions, and the code
used for building nested classes).
Strings are first compiled to code objects with the compile()
built-in function before being disassembled.  If no object is provided, this
function disassembles the last traceback.
The disassembly is written as text to the supplied file argument if
provided and to sys.stdout otherwise.
The maximal depth of recursion is limited by depth unless it is None.
depth=0 means no recursion.

Changed in version 3.4: Added file parameter.


Changed in version 3.7: Implemented recursive disassembling and added depth parameter.


Changed in version 3.7: This can now handle coroutine and asynchronous generator objects.
