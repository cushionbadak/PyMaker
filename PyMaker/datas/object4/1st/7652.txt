read(size=-1)Â¶
Read at most size bytes from the chunk (less if the read hits the end of
the chunk before obtaining size bytes).  If the size argument is
negative or omitted, read all data until the end of the chunk.  An empty
bytes object is returned when the end of the chunk is encountered
immediately.
