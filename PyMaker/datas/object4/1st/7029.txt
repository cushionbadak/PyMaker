SMTP.helo(name='')Â¶
Identify yourself to the SMTP server using HELO.  The hostname argument
defaults to the fully qualified domain name of the local host.
The message returned by the server is stored as the helo_resp attribute
of the object.
In normal operation it should not be necessary to call this method explicitly.
It will be implicitly called by the sendmail() when necessary.
