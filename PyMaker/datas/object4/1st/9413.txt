classmethod extract(frame_gen, *, limit=None, lookup_lines=True, capture_locals=False)Â¶
Construct a StackSummary object from a frame generator (such as
is returned by walk_stack() or
walk_tb()).
If limit is supplied, only this many frames are taken from frame_gen.
If lookup_lines is False, the returned FrameSummary
objects will not have read their lines in yet, making the cost of
creating the StackSummary cheaper (which may be valuable if it
may not actually get formatted). If capture_locals is True the
local variables in each FrameSummary are captured as object
representations.
