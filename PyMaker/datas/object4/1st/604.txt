contextmanager.__exit__(exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb)Â¶
Exit the runtime context and return a Boolean flag indicating if any exception
that occurred should be suppressed. If an exception occurred while executing the
body of the with statement, the arguments contain the exception type,
value and traceback information. Otherwise, all three arguments are None.
Returning a true value from this method will cause the with statement
to suppress the exception and continue execution with the statement immediately
following the with statement. Otherwise the exception continues
propagating after this method has finished executing. Exceptions that occur
during execution of this method will replace any exception that occurred in the
body of the with statement.
The exception passed in should never be reraised explicitly - instead, this
method should return a false value to indicate that the method completed
successfully and does not want to suppress the raised exception. This allows
context management code to easily detect whether or not an __exit__()
method has actually failed.
