codecs.EncodedFile(file, data_encoding, file_encoding=None, errors='strict')Â¶
Return a StreamRecoder instance, a wrapped version of file
which provides transparent transcoding. The original file is closed
when the wrapped version is closed.
Data written to the wrapped file is decoded according to the given
data_encoding and then written to the original file as bytes using
file_encoding. Bytes read from the original file are decoded
according to file_encoding, and the result is encoded
using data_encoding.
If file_encoding is not given, it defaults to data_encoding.
errors may be given to define the error handling. It defaults to
'strict', which causes ValueError to be raised in case an encoding
error occurs.
