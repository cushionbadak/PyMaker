@abc.abstractclassmethodÂ¶

New in version 3.2.


Deprecated since version 3.3: It is now possible to use classmethod with
abstractmethod(), making this decorator redundant.

A subclass of the built-in classmethod(), indicating an abstract
classmethod. Otherwise it is similar to abstractmethod().
This special case is deprecated, as the classmethod() decorator
is now correctly identified as abstract when applied to an abstract
method:
class C(ABC):
    @classmethod
    @abstractmethod
    def my_abstract_classmethod(cls, ...):
        ...
