webbrowser.open(url, new=0, autoraise=True)¶
Display url using the default browser. If new is 0, the url is opened
in the same browser window if possible.  If new is 1, a new browser window
is opened if possible.  If new is 2, a new browser page (“tab”) is opened
if possible.  If autoraise is True, the window is raised if possible
(note that under many window managers this will occur regardless of the
setting of this variable).
Note that on some platforms, trying to open a filename using this function,
may work and start the operating system’s associated program.  However, this
is neither supported nor portable.
