socket.ioctl(control, option)Â¶




Platform:Windows



The ioctl() method is a limited interface to the WSAIoctl system
interface.  Please refer to the Win32 documentation for more
information.
On other platforms, the generic fcntl.fcntl() and fcntl.ioctl()
functions may be used; they accept a socket object as their first argument.
Currently only the following control codes are supported:
SIO_RCVALL, SIO_KEEPALIVE_VALS, and SIO_LOOPBACK_FAST_PATH.

Changed in version 3.6: SIO_LOOPBACK_FAST_PATH was added.
