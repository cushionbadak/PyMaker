process_message(peer, mailfrom, rcpttos, data, **kwargs)¶
Raise a NotImplementedError exception. Override this in subclasses to
do something useful with this message. Whatever was passed in the
constructor as remoteaddr will be available as the _remoteaddr
attribute. peer is the remote host’s address, mailfrom is the envelope
originator, rcpttos are the envelope recipients and data is a string
containing the contents of the e-mail (which should be in RFC 5321
format).
If the decode_data constructor keyword is set to True, the data
argument will be a unicode string.  If it is set to False, it
will be a bytes object.
kwargs is a dictionary containing additional information. It is empty
if decode_data=True was given as an init argument, otherwise
it contains the following keys:


mail_options:
a list of all received parameters to the MAIL
command (the elements are uppercase strings; example:
['BODY=8BITMIME', 'SMTPUTF8']).
rcpt_options:
same as mail_options but for the RCPT command.
Currently no RCPT TO options are supported, so for now
this will always be an empty list.


Implementations of process_message should use the **kwargs
signature to accept arbitrary keyword arguments, since future feature
enhancements may add keys to the kwargs dictionary.
Return None to request a normal 250 Ok response; otherwise
return the desired response string in RFC 5321 format.
