find_class(module, name)Â¶
Import module if necessary and return the object called name from it,
where the module and name arguments are str objects.  Note,
unlike its name suggests, find_class() is also used for finding
functions.
Subclasses may override this to gain control over what type of objects and
how they can be loaded, potentially reducing security risks. Refer to
Restricting Globals for details.
