os.mknod(path, mode=0o600, device=0, *, dir_fd=None)Â¶
Create a filesystem node (file, device special file or named pipe) named
path. mode specifies both the permissions to use and the type of node
to be created, being combined (bitwise OR) with one of stat.S_IFREG,
stat.S_IFCHR, stat.S_IFBLK, and stat.S_IFIFO (those constants are
available in stat).  For stat.S_IFCHR and stat.S_IFBLK,
device defines the newly created device special file (probably using
os.makedev()), otherwise it is ignored.
This function can also support paths relative to directory descriptors.
Availability: Unix.

New in version 3.3: The dir_fd argument.


Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a path-like object.
