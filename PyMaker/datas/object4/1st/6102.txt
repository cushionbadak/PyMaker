xml.etree.ElementTree.ProcessingInstruction(target, text=None)Â¶
PI element factory.  This factory function creates a special element that
will be serialized as an XML processing instruction.  target is a string
containing the PI target.  text is a string containing the PI contents, if
given.  Returns an element instance, representing a processing instruction.
Note that XMLParser skips over processing instructions
in the input instead of creating comment objects for them. An
ElementTree will only contain processing instruction nodes if
they have been inserted into to the tree using one of the
Element methods.
