asyncio.as_completed(aws, *, loop=None, timeout=None)Â¶
Run awaitable objects in the aws
set concurrently.  Return an iterator of Future objects.
Each Future object returned represents the earliest result
from the set of the remaining awaitables.
Raises asyncio.TimeoutError if the timeout occurs before
all Futures are done.
Example:
for f in as_completed(aws):
    earliest_result = await f
    # ...
