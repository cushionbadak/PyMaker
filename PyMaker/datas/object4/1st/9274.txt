sysconfig.get_path(name[, scheme[, vars[, expand]]])Â¶
Return an installation path corresponding to the path name, from the
install scheme named scheme.
name has to be a value from the list returned by get_path_names().
sysconfig stores installation paths corresponding to each path name,
for each platform, with variables to be expanded.  For instance the stdlib
path for the nt scheme is: {base}/Lib.
get_path() will use the variables returned by get_config_vars()
to expand the path.  All variables have default values for each platform so
one may call this function and get the default value.
If scheme is provided, it must be a value from the list returned by
get_scheme_names().  Otherwise, the default scheme for the current
platform is used.
If vars is provided, it must be a dictionary of variables that will update
the dictionary return by get_config_vars().
If expand is set to False, the path will not be expanded using the
variables.
If name is not found, return None.
