iter_attachments()¶
Return an iterator over all of the immediate sub-parts of the message
that are not candidate “body” parts.  That is, skip the first occurrence
of each of text/plain, text/html, multipart/related, or
multipart/alternative (unless they are explicitly marked as
attachments via Content-Disposition: attachment), and
return all remaining parts.  When applied directly to a
multipart/related, return an iterator over the all the related parts
except the root part (ie: the part pointed to by the start parameter,
or the first part if there is no start parameter or the start
parameter doesn’t match the Content-ID of any of the
parts).  When applied directly to a multipart/alternative or a
non-multipart, return an empty iterator.
