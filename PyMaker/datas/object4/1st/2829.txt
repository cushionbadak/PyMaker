hashlib.new(name[, data])Â¶
Is a generic constructor that takes the string name of the desired
algorithm as its first parameter.  It also exists to allow access to the
above listed hashes as well as any other algorithms that your OpenSSL
library may offer.  The named constructors are much faster than new()
and should be preferred.
