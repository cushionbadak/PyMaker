ExtensionsÂ¶
IDLE contains an extension facility.  Preferences for extensions can be
changed with the Extensions tab of the preferences dialog. See the
beginning of config-extensions.def in the idlelib directory for further
information.  The only current default extension is zzdummy, an example
also used for testing.
