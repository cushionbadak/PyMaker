calendar.timegm(tuple)¶
An unrelated but handy function that takes a time tuple such as returned by
the gmtime() function in the time module, and returns the
corresponding Unix timestamp value, assuming an epoch of 1970, and the POSIX
encoding.  In fact, time.gmtime() and timegm() are each others’
inverse.
