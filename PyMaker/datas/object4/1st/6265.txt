exception xml.dom.InvalidCharacterErr¶
This exception is raised when a string parameter contains a character that is
not permitted in the context it’s being used in by the XML 1.0 recommendation.
For example, attempting to create an Element node with a space in the
element type name will cause this error to be raised.
