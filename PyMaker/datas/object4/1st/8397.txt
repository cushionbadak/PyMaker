summarize(verbose=None)¶
Print a summary of all the test cases that have been run by this DocTestRunner,
and return a named tuple TestResults(failed, attempted).
The optional verbose argument controls how detailed the summary is.  If the
verbosity is not specified, then the DocTestRunner’s verbosity is
used.
