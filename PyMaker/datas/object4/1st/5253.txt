SSLContext.get_ca_certs(binary_form=False)¶
Get a list of loaded “certification authority” (CA) certificates. If the
binary_form parameter is False each list
entry is a dict like the output of SSLSocket.getpeercert(). Otherwise
the method returns a list of DER-encoded certificates. The returned list
does not contain certificates from capath unless a certificate was
requested and loaded by a SSL connection.

Note
Certificates in a capath directory aren’t loaded unless they have
been used at least once.


New in version 3.4.
