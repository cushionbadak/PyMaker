class importlib.abc.ResourceLoader¶
An abstract base class for a loader which implements the optional
PEP 302 protocol for loading arbitrary resources from the storage
back-end.

Deprecated since version 3.7: This ABC is deprecated in favour of supporting resource loading
through importlib.abc.ResourceReader.



abstractmethod get_data(path)¶
An abstract method to return the bytes for the data located at path.
Loaders that have a file-like storage back-end
that allows storing arbitrary data
can implement this abstract method to give direct access
to the data stored. OSError is to be raised if the path cannot
be found. The path is expected to be constructed using a module’s
__file__ attribute or an item from a package’s __path__.

Changed in version 3.4: Raises OSError instead of NotImplementedError.
