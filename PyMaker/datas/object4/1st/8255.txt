Type aliasesÂ¶
A type alias is defined by assigning the type to the alias. In this example,
Vector and List[float] will be treated as interchangeable synonyms:
from typing import List
Vector = List[float]

def scale(scalar: float, vector: Vector) -> Vector:
    return [scalar * num for num in vector]

# typechecks; a list of floats qualifies as a Vector.
new_vector = scale(2.0, [1.0, -4.2, 5.4])


Type aliases are useful for simplifying complex type signatures. For example:
from typing import Dict, Tuple, Sequence

ConnectionOptions = Dict[str, str]
Address = Tuple[str, int]
Server = Tuple[Address, ConnectionOptions]

def broadcast_message(message: str, servers: Sequence[Server]) -> None:
    ...

# The static type checker will treat the previous type signature as
# being exactly equivalent to this one.
def broadcast_message(
        message: str,
        servers: Sequence[Tuple[Tuple[str, int], Dict[str, str]]]) -> None:
    ...


Note that None as a type hint is a special case and is replaced by
type(None).
