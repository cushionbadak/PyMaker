object.__setattr__(self, name, value)Â¶
Called when an attribute assignment is attempted.  This is called instead of
the normal mechanism (i.e. store the value in the instance dictionary).
name is the attribute name, value is the value to be assigned to it.
If __setattr__() wants to assign to an instance attribute, it should
call the base class method with the same name, for example,
object.__setattr__(self, name, value).
