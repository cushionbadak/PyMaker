Boolean Operations — and, or, not¶
These are the Boolean operations, ordered by ascending priority:







Operation
Result
Notes



x or y
if x is false, then y, else
x
(1)

x and y
if x is false, then x, else
y
(2)

not x
if x is false, then True,
else False
(3)



Notes:

This is a short-circuit operator, so it only evaluates the second
argument if the first one is false.
This is a short-circuit operator, so it only evaluates the second
argument if the first one is true.
not has a lower priority than non-Boolean operators, so not a == b is
interpreted as not (a == b), and a == not b is a syntax error.
