logging.setLoggerClass(klass)Â¶
Tells the logging system to use the class klass when instantiating a logger.
The class should define __init__() such that only a name argument is
required, and the __init__() should call Logger.__init__(). This
function is typically called before any loggers are instantiated by applications
which need to use custom logger behavior.
