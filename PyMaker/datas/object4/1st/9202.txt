sys.float_repr_style¶
A string indicating how the repr() function behaves for
floats.  If the string has value 'short' then for a finite
float x, repr(x) aims to produce a short string with the
property that float(repr(x)) == x.  This is the usual behaviour
in Python 3.1 and later.  Otherwise, float_repr_style has value
'legacy' and repr(x) behaves in the same way as it did in
versions of Python prior to 3.1.

New in version 3.1.
