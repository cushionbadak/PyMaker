datetime.timestamp()Â¶
Return POSIX timestamp corresponding to the datetime
instance.  The return value is a float similar to that
returned by time.time().
Naive datetime instances are assumed to represent local
time and this method relies on the platform C mktime()
function to perform the conversion.  Since datetime
supports wider range of values than mktime() on many
platforms, this method may raise OverflowError for times far
in the past or far in the future.
For aware datetime instances, the return value is computed
as:
(dt - datetime(1970, 1, 1, tzinfo=timezone.utc)).total_seconds()



New in version 3.3.


Changed in version 3.6: The timestamp() method uses the fold attribute to
disambiguate the times during a repeated interval.


Note
There is no method to obtain the POSIX timestamp directly from a
naive datetime instance representing UTC time.  If your
application uses this convention and your system timezone is not
set to UTC, you can obtain the POSIX timestamp by supplying
tzinfo=timezone.utc:
timestamp = dt.replace(tzinfo=timezone.utc).timestamp()


or by calculating the timestamp directly:
timestamp = (dt - datetime(1970, 1, 1)) / timedelta(seconds=1)
