notify(n=1)¶
By default, wake up one thread waiting on this condition, if any.  If the
calling thread has not acquired the lock when this method is called, a
RuntimeError is raised.
This method wakes up at most n of the threads waiting for the condition
variable; it is a no-op if no threads are waiting.
The current implementation wakes up exactly n threads, if at least n
threads are waiting.  However, it’s not safe to rely on this behavior.
A future, optimized implementation may occasionally wake up more than
n threads.
Note: an awakened thread does not actually return from its wait()
call until it can reacquire the lock.  Since notify() does not
release the lock, its caller should.
