@classmethod¶
Transform a method into a class method.
A class method receives the class as implicit first argument, just like an
instance method receives the instance. To declare a class method, use this
idiom:
class C:
    @classmethod
    def f(cls, arg1, arg2, ...): ...


The @classmethod form is a function decorator – see
Function definitions for details.
A class method can be called either on the class (such as C.f()) or on an instance (such
as C().f()).  The instance is ignored except for its class. If a class
method is called for a derived class, the derived class object is passed as the
implied first argument.
Class methods are different than C++ or Java static methods. If you want those,
see staticmethod().
For more information on class methods, see The standard type hierarchy.
