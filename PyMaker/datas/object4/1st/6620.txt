urllib.request.getproxies()¶
This helper function returns a dictionary of scheme to proxy server URL
mappings. It scans the environment for variables named <scheme>_proxy,
in a case insensitive approach, for all operating systems first, and when it
cannot find it, looks for proxy information from Mac OSX System
Configuration for Mac OS X and Windows Systems Registry for Windows.
If both lowercase and uppercase environment variables exist (and disagree),
lowercase is preferred.

Note
If the environment variable REQUEST_METHOD is set, which usually
indicates your script is running in a CGI environment, the environment
variable HTTP_PROXY (uppercase _PROXY) will be ignored. This is
because that variable can be injected by a client using the “Proxy:” HTTP
header. If you need to use an HTTP proxy in a CGI environment, either use
ProxyHandler explicitly, or make sure the variable name is in
lowercase (or at least the _proxy suffix).
