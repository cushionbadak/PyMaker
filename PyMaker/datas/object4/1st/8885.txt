dispatch_line(frame)Â¶
If the debugger should stop on the current line, invoke the
user_line() method (which should be overridden in subclasses).
Raise a BdbQuit exception if the Bdb.quitting flag is set
(which can be set from user_line()).  Return a reference to the
trace_dispatch() method for further tracing in that scope.
