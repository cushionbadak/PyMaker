<dd><p>Set the ignore count for the given breakpoint number.  If count is omitted,
the ignore count is set to 0.  A breakpoint becomes active when the ignore
count is zero.  When non-zero, the count is decremented each time the
breakpoint is reached and the breakpoint is not disabled and any associated
condition evaluates to true.</p>
