abstractmethod register(fileobj, events, data=None)Â¶
Register a file object for selection, monitoring it for I/O events.
fileobj is the file object to monitor.  It may either be an integer
file descriptor or an object with a fileno() method.
events is a bitwise mask of events to monitor.
data is an opaque object.
This returns a new SelectorKey instance, or raises a
ValueError in case of invalid event mask or file descriptor, or
KeyError if the file object is already registered.
