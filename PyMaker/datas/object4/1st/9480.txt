inspect.getsource(object)¶
Return the text of the source code for an object. The argument may be a module,
class, method, function, traceback, frame, or code object.  The source code is
returned as a single string.  An OSError is raised if the source code
cannot be retrieved.

Changed in version 3.3: OSError is raised instead of IOError, now an alias of the
former.
