epilogÂ¶
Some programs like to display additional description of the program after the
description of the arguments.  Such text can be specified using the epilog=
argument to ArgumentParser:
>>> parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(
...     description='A foo that bars',
...     epilog="And that's how you'd foo a bar")
>>> parser.print_help()
usage: argparse.py [-h]

A foo that bars

optional arguments:
 -h, --help  show this help message and exit

And that's how you'd foo a bar


As with the description argument, the epilog= text is by default
line-wrapped, but this behavior can be adjusted with the formatter_class
argument to ArgumentParser.
