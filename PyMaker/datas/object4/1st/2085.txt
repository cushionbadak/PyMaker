os.path.expandvars(path)Â¶
Return the argument with environment variables expanded.  Substrings of the form
$name or ${name} are replaced by the value of environment variable
name.  Malformed variable names and references to non-existing variables are
left unchanged.
On Windows, %name% expansions are supported in addition to $name and
${name}.

Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a path-like object.
