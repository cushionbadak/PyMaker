socket.close()Â¶
Mark the socket closed.  The underlying system resource (e.g. a file
descriptor) is also closed when all file objects from makefile()
are closed.  Once that happens, all future operations on the socket
object will fail. The remote end will receive no more data (after
queued data is flushed).
Sockets are automatically closed when they are garbage-collected, but
it is recommended to close() them explicitly, or to use a
with statement around them.

Changed in version 3.6: OSError is now raised if an error occurs when the underlying
close() call is made.


Note
close() releases the resource associated with a connection but
does not necessarily close the connection immediately.  If you want
to close the connection in a timely fashion, call shutdown()
before close().
