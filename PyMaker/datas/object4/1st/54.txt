object.__bool__(self)Â¶
Called to implement truth value testing and the built-in operation
bool(); should return False or True.  When this method is not
defined, __len__() is called, if it is defined, and the object is
considered true if its result is nonzero.  If a class defines neither
__len__() nor __bool__(), all its instances are considered
true.
