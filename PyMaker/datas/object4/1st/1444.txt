PrettyPrinter Objects¶
PrettyPrinter instances have the following methods:


PrettyPrinter.pformat(object)¶
Return the formatted representation of object.  This takes into account the
options passed to the PrettyPrinter constructor.



PrettyPrinter.pprint(object)¶
Print the formatted representation of object on the configured stream,
followed by a newline.

The following methods provide the implementations for the corresponding
functions of the same names.  Using these methods on an instance is slightly
more efficient since new PrettyPrinter objects don’t need to be
created.


PrettyPrinter.isreadable(object)¶
Determine if the formatted representation of the object is “readable,” or can be
used to reconstruct the value using eval().  Note that this returns
False for recursive objects.  If the depth parameter of the
PrettyPrinter is set and the object is deeper than allowed, this
returns False.



PrettyPrinter.isrecursive(object)¶
Determine if the object requires a recursive representation.

This method is provided as a hook to allow subclasses to modify the way objects
are converted to strings.  The default implementation uses the internals of the
saferepr() implementation.


PrettyPrinter.format(object, context, maxlevels, level)¶
Returns three values: the formatted version of object as a string, a flag
indicating whether the result is readable, and a flag indicating whether
recursion was detected.  The first argument is the object to be presented.  The
second is a dictionary which contains the id() of objects that are part of
the current presentation context (direct and indirect containers for object
that are affecting the presentation) as the keys; if an object needs to be
presented which is already represented in context, the third return value
should be True.  Recursive calls to the format() method should add
additional entries for containers to this dictionary.  The third argument,
maxlevels, gives the requested limit to recursion; this will be 0 if there
is no requested limit.  This argument should be passed unmodified to recursive
calls. The fourth argument, level, gives the current level; recursive calls
should be passed a value less than that of the current call.
