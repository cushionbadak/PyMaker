-m <mainfn>, --main=<mainfn>¶
Write a __main__.py file to the archive that executes mainfn.  The
mainfn argument should have the form “pkg.mod:fn”, where “pkg.mod” is a
package/module in the archive, and “fn” is a callable in the given module.
The __main__.py file will execute that callable.
--main cannot be specified when copying an archive.
