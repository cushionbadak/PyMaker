Mixer Device Objects¶
The mixer object provides two file-like methods:


oss_mixer_device.close()¶
This method closes the open mixer device file.  Any further attempts to use the
mixer after this file is closed will raise an OSError.



oss_mixer_device.fileno()¶
Returns the file handle number of the open mixer device file.


Changed in version 3.2: Mixer objects also support the context management protocol.

The remaining methods are specific to audio mixing:


oss_mixer_device.controls()¶
This method returns a bitmask specifying the available mixer controls (“Control”
being a specific mixable “channel”, such as SOUND_MIXER_PCM or
SOUND_MIXER_SYNTH).  This bitmask indicates a subset of all available
mixer controls—the SOUND_MIXER_* constants defined at module level.
To determine if, for example, the current mixer object supports a PCM mixer, use
the following Python code:
mixer=ossaudiodev.openmixer()
if mixer.controls() & (1 << ossaudiodev.SOUND_MIXER_PCM):
    # PCM is supported
    ... code ...


For most purposes, the SOUND_MIXER_VOLUME (master volume) and
SOUND_MIXER_PCM controls should suffice—but code that uses the mixer
should be flexible when it comes to choosing mixer controls.  On the Gravis
Ultrasound, for example, SOUND_MIXER_VOLUME does not exist.



oss_mixer_device.stereocontrols()¶
Returns a bitmask indicating stereo mixer controls.  If a bit is set, the
corresponding control is stereo; if it is unset, the control is either
monophonic or not supported by the mixer (use in combination with
controls() to determine which).
See the code example for the controls() function for an example of getting
data from a bitmask.



oss_mixer_device.reccontrols()¶
Returns a bitmask specifying the mixer controls that may be used to record.  See
the code example for controls() for an example of reading from a bitmask.



oss_mixer_device.get(control)¶
Returns the volume of a given mixer control.  The returned volume is a 2-tuple
(left_volume,right_volume).  Volumes are specified as numbers from 0
(silent) to 100 (full volume).  If the control is monophonic, a 2-tuple is still
returned, but both volumes are the same.
Raises OSSAudioError if an invalid control is specified, or
OSError if an unsupported control is specified.



oss_mixer_device.set(control, (left, right))¶
Sets the volume for a given mixer control to (left,right). left and
right must be ints and between 0 (silent) and 100 (full volume).  On
success, the new volume is returned as a 2-tuple. Note that this may not be
exactly the same as the volume specified, because of the limited resolution of
some soundcard’s mixers.
Raises OSSAudioError if an invalid mixer control was specified, or if the
specified volumes were out-of-range.



oss_mixer_device.get_recsrc()¶
This method returns a bitmask indicating which control(s) are currently being
used as a recording source.



oss_mixer_device.set_recsrc(bitmask)¶
Call this function to specify a recording source.  Returns a bitmask indicating
the new recording source (or sources) if successful; raises OSError if an
invalid source was specified.  To set the current recording source to the
microphone input:
mixer.setrecsrc (1 << ossaudiodev.SOUND_MIXER_MIC)
