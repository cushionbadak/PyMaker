fcntl.flock(fd, operation)Â¶
Perform the lock operation operation on file descriptor fd (file objects providing
a fileno() method are accepted as well). See the Unix manual
flock(2) for details.  (On some systems, this function is emulated
using fcntl().)
If the flock() fails, an OSError exception is raised.
