class turtle.Shape(type_, data)¶




Parameters:type_ – one of the strings “polygon”, “image”, “compound”



Data structure modeling shapes.  The pair (type_, data) must follow this
specification:






type_
data



“polygon”
a polygon-tuple, i.e. a tuple of pairs of coordinates

“image”
an image  (in this form only used internally!)

“compound”
None (a compound shape has to be constructed using the
addcomponent() method)





addcomponent(poly, fill, outline=None)¶




Parameters:
poly – a polygon, i.e. a tuple of pairs of numbers
fill – a color the poly will be filled with
outline – a color for the poly’s outline (if given)





Example:
>>> poly = ((0,0),(10,-5),(0,10),(-10,-5))
>>> s = Shape("compound")
>>> s.addcomponent(poly, "red", "blue")
>>> # ... add more components and then use register_shape()
