coroutine loop.sock_connect(sock, address)Â¶
Connect sock to a remote socket at address.
Asynchronous version of socket.connect().
sock must be a non-blocking socket.

Changed in version 3.5.2: address no longer needs to be resolved.  sock_connect
will try to check if the address is already resolved by calling
socket.inet_pton().  If not,
loop.getaddrinfo() will be used to resolve the
address.
