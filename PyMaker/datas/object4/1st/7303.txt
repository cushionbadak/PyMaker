Cookie.rfc2109¶
True if this cookie was received as an RFC 2109 cookie (ie. the cookie
arrived in a Set-Cookie header, and the value of the Version
cookie-attribute in that header was 1).  This attribute is provided because
http.cookiejar may ‘downgrade’ RFC 2109 cookies to Netscape cookies, in
which case version is 0.
