class smtplib.LMTP(host='', port=LMTP_PORT, local_hostname=None, source_address=None)¶
The LMTP protocol, which is very similar to ESMTP, is heavily based on the
standard SMTP client. It’s common to use Unix sockets for LMTP, so our
connect() method must support that as well as a regular host:port
server. The optional arguments local_hostname and source_address have the
same meaning as they do in the SMTP class. To specify a Unix
socket, you must use an absolute path for host, starting with a ‘/’.
Authentication is supported, using the regular SMTP mechanism. When using a
Unix socket, LMTP generally don’t support or require any authentication, but
your mileage might vary.
