sys.set_coroutine_origin_tracking_depth(depth)Â¶
Allows enabling or disabling coroutine origin tracking. When
enabled, the cr_origin attribute on coroutine objects will
contain a tuple of (filename, line number, function name) tuples
describing the traceback where the coroutine object was created,
with the most recent call first. When disabled, cr_origin will
be None.
To enable, pass a depth value greater than zero; this sets the
number of frames whose information will be captured. To disable,
pass set depth to zero.
This setting is thread-specific.

New in version 3.7.


Note
This function has been added on a provisional basis (see PEP 411
for details.)  Use it only for debugging purposes.
