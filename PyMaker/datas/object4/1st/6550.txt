cgitb.enable(display=1, logdir=None, context=5, format="html")¶
This function causes the cgitb module to take over the interpreter’s
default handling for exceptions by setting the value of sys.excepthook.
The optional argument display defaults to 1 and can be set to 0 to
suppress sending the traceback to the browser. If the argument logdir is
present, the traceback reports are written to files.  The value of logdir
should be a directory where these files will be placed. The optional argument
context is the number of lines of context to display around the current line
of source code in the traceback; this defaults to 5. If the optional
argument format is "html", the output is formatted as HTML.  Any other
value forces plain text output.  The default value is "html".
