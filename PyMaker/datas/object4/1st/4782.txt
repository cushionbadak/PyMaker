Creating Futures and Tasks¶


loop.create_future()¶
Create an asyncio.Future object attached to the event loop.
This is the preferred way to create Futures in asyncio. This lets
third-party event loops provide alternative implementations of
the Future object (with better performance or instrumentation).

New in version 3.5.2.




loop.create_task(coro)¶
Schedule the execution of a Coroutines.
Return a Task object.
Third-party event loops can use their own subclass of Task
for interoperability. In this case, the result type is a subclass
of Task.



loop.set_task_factory(factory)¶
Set a task factory that will be used by
loop.create_task().
If factory is None the default task factory will be set.
Otherwise, factory must be a callable with the signature matching
(loop, coro), where loop is a reference to the active
event loop, and coro is a coroutine object.  The callable
must return a asyncio.Future-compatible object.



loop.get_task_factory()¶
Return a task factory or None if the default one is in use.
