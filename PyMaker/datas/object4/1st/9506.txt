inspect.getclasstree(classes, unique=False)Â¶
Arrange the given list of classes into a hierarchy of nested lists. Where a
nested list appears, it contains classes derived from the class whose entry
immediately precedes the list.  Each entry is a 2-tuple containing a class and a
tuple of its base classes.  If the unique argument is true, exactly one entry
appears in the returned structure for each class in the given list.  Otherwise,
classes using multiple inheritance and their descendants will appear multiple
times.
