class threading.BoundedSemaphore(value=1)¶
Class implementing bounded semaphore objects.  A bounded semaphore checks to
make sure its current value doesn’t exceed its initial value.  If it does,
ValueError is raised. In most situations semaphores are used to guard
resources with limited capacity.  If the semaphore is released too many times
it’s a sign of a bug.  If not given, value defaults to 1.

Changed in version 3.3: changed from a factory function to a class.
