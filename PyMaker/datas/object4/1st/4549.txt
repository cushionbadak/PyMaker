Queue.get(block=True, timeout=None)Â¶
Remove and return an item from the queue. If optional args block is true and
timeout is None (the default), block if necessary until an item is available.
If timeout is a positive number, it blocks at most timeout seconds and
raises the Empty exception if no item was available within that time.
Otherwise (block is false), return an item if one is immediately available,
else raise the Empty exception (timeout is ignored in that case).
Prior to 3.0 on POSIX systems, and for all versions on Windows, if
block is true and timeout is None, this operation goes into
an uninterruptible wait on an underlying lock. This means that no exceptions
can occur, and in particular a SIGINT will not trigger a KeyboardInterrupt.
