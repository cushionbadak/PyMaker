winreg.DisableReflectionKey(key)Â¶
Disables registry reflection for 32-bit processes running on a 64-bit
operating system.
key is an already open key, or one of the predefined HKEY_* constants.
Will generally raise NotImplemented if executed on a 32-bit operating
system.
If the key is not on the reflection list, the function succeeds but has no
effect.  Disabling reflection for a key does not affect reflection of any
subkeys.
