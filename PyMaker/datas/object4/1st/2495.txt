bz2.open(filename, mode='r', compresslevel=9, encoding=None, errors=None, newline=None)Â¶
Open a bzip2-compressed file in binary or text mode, returning a file
object.
As with the constructor for BZ2File, the filename argument can be
an actual filename (a str or bytes object), or an existing
file object to read from or write to.
The mode argument can be any of 'r', 'rb', 'w', 'wb',
'x', 'xb', 'a' or 'ab' for binary mode, or 'rt',
'wt', 'xt', or 'at' for text mode. The default is 'rb'.
The compresslevel argument is an integer from 1 to 9, as for the
BZ2File constructor.
For binary mode, this function is equivalent to the BZ2File
constructor: BZ2File(filename, mode, compresslevel=compresslevel). In
this case, the encoding, errors and newline arguments must not be
provided.
For text mode, a BZ2File object is created, and wrapped in an
io.TextIOWrapper instance with the specified encoding, error
handling behavior, and line ending(s).

New in version 3.3.


Changed in version 3.4: The 'x' (exclusive creation) mode was added.


Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a path-like object.
