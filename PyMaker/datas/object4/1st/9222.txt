sys.hexversionÂ¶
The version number encoded as a single integer.  This is guaranteed to increase
with each version, including proper support for non-production releases.  For
example, to test that the Python interpreter is at least version 1.5.2, use:
if sys.hexversion >= 0x010502F0:
    # use some advanced feature
    ...
else:
    # use an alternative implementation or warn the user
    ...


This is called hexversion since it only really looks meaningful when viewed
as the result of passing it to the built-in hex() function.  The
struct sequence sys.version_info may be used for a more
human-friendly encoding of the same information.
More details of hexversion can be found at API and ABI Versioning.
