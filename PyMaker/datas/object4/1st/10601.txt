imp.source_from_cache(path)Â¶
Given the path to a PEP 3147 file name, return the associated source code
file path.  For example, if path is
/foo/bar/__pycache__/baz.cpython-32.pyc the returned path would be
/foo/bar/baz.py.  path need not exist, however if it does not conform
to PEP 3147 format, a ValueError is raised. If
sys.implementation.cache_tag is not defined,
NotImplementedError is raised.

Changed in version 3.3: Raise NotImplementedError when
sys.implementation.cache_tag is not defined.


Deprecated since version 3.4: Use importlib.util.source_from_cache() instead.
