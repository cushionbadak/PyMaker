class formatter.NullFormatter(writer=None)¶
A formatter which does nothing.  If writer is omitted, a NullWriter
instance is created.  No methods of the writer are called by
NullFormatter instances.  Implementations should inherit from this
class if implementing a writer interface but don’t need to inherit any
implementation.
