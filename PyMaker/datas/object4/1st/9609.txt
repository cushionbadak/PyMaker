pkgutil.iter_modules(path=None, prefix='')Â¶
Yields ModuleInfo for all submodules on path, or, if
path is None, all top-level modules on sys.path.
path should be either None or a list of paths to look for modules in.
prefix is a string to output on the front of every module name on output.

Note
Only works for a finder which defines an iter_modules()
method. This interface is non-standard, so the module also provides
implementations for importlib.machinery.FileFinder and
zipimport.zipimporter.


Changed in version 3.3: Updated to be based directly on importlib rather than relying
on the package internal PEP 302 import emulation.
