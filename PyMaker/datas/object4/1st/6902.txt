class imaplib.IMAP4(host='', port=IMAP4_PORT)Â¶
This class implements the actual IMAP4 protocol.  The connection is created and
protocol version (IMAP4 or IMAP4rev1) is determined when the instance is
initialized. If host is not specified, '' (the local host) is used. If
port is omitted, the standard IMAP4 port (143) is used.
The IMAP4 class supports the with statement.  When used
like this, the IMAP4 LOGOUT command is issued automatically when the
with statement exits.  E.g.:
>>> from imaplib import IMAP4
>>> with IMAP4("domain.org") as M:
...     M.noop()
...
('OK', [b'Nothing Accomplished. d25if65hy903weo.87'])



Changed in version 3.5: Support for the with statement was added.
