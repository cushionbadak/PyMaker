How do I program using threads?Â¶
Be sure to use the threading module and not the _thread module.
The threading module builds convenient abstractions on top of the
low-level primitives provided by the _thread module.
Aahz has a set of slides from his threading tutorial that are helpful; see
http://www.pythoncraft.com/OSCON2001/.
