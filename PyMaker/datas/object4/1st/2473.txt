Compress.flush([mode])Â¶
All pending input is processed, and a bytes object containing the remaining compressed
output is returned.  mode can be selected from the constants
Z_NO_FLUSH, Z_PARTIAL_FLUSH, Z_SYNC_FLUSH,
Z_FULL_FLUSH, Z_BLOCK (zlib 1.2.3.4), or Z_FINISH,
defaulting to Z_FINISH.  Except Z_FINISH, all constants
allow compressing further bytestrings of data, while Z_FINISH finishes the
compressed stream and prevents compressing any more data.  After calling flush()
with mode set to Z_FINISH, the compress() method cannot be called again;
the only realistic action is to delete the object.
