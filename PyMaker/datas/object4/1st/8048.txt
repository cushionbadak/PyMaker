Using Ttk¶
To start using Ttk, import its module:
from tkinter import ttk


To override the basic Tk widgets, the import should follow the Tk import:
from tkinter import *
from tkinter.ttk import *


That code causes several tkinter.ttk widgets (Button,
Checkbutton, Entry, Frame, Label,
LabelFrame, Menubutton, PanedWindow,
Radiobutton, Scale and Scrollbar) to
automatically replace the Tk widgets.
This has the direct benefit of using the new widgets which gives a better
look and feel across platforms; however, the replacement widgets are not
completely compatible. The main difference is that widget options such as
“fg”, “bg” and others related to widget styling are no
longer present in Ttk widgets.  Instead, use  the ttk.Style class
for improved styling effects.
