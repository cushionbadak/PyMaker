HTTPPasswordMgr Objects¶
These methods are available on HTTPPasswordMgr and
HTTPPasswordMgrWithDefaultRealm objects.


HTTPPasswordMgr.add_password(realm, uri, user, passwd)¶
uri can be either a single URI, or a sequence of URIs. realm, user and
passwd must be strings. This causes (user, passwd) to be used as
authentication tokens when authentication for realm and a super-URI of any of
the given URIs is given.



HTTPPasswordMgr.find_user_password(realm, authuri)¶
Get user/password for given realm and URI, if any.  This method will return
(None, None) if there is no matching user/password.
For HTTPPasswordMgrWithDefaultRealm objects, the realm None will be
searched if the given realm has no matching user/password.
