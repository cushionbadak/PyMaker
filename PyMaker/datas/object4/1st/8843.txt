class test.support.TransientResource(exc, **kwargs)Â¶
Instances are a context manager that raises ResourceDenied if the
specified exception type is raised.  Any keyword arguments are treated as
attribute/value pairs to be compared against any exception raised within the
with statement.  Only if all pairs match properly against
attributes on the exception is ResourceDenied raised.
