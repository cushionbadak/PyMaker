generator.__next__()¶
Starts the execution of a generator function or resumes it at the last
executed yield expression.  When a generator function is resumed with a
__next__() method, the current yield expression always
evaluates to None.  The execution then continues to the next yield
expression, where the generator is suspended again, and the value of the
expression_list is returned to __next__()’s caller.  If the
generator exits without yielding another value, a StopIteration
exception is raised.
This method is normally called implicitly, e.g. by a for loop, or
by the built-in next() function.
