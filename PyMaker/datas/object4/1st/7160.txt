handle()Â¶
This function must do all the work required to service a request.  The
default implementation does nothing.  Several instance attributes are
available to it; the request is available as self.request; the client
address as self.client_address; and the server instance as
self.server, in case it needs access to per-server information.
The type of self.request is different for datagram or stream
services.  For stream services, self.request is a socket object; for
datagram services, self.request is a pair of string and socket.
