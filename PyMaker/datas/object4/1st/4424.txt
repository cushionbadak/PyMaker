exception(timeout=None)¶
Return the exception raised by the call.  If the call hasn’t yet
completed then this method will wait up to timeout seconds.  If the
call hasn’t completed in timeout seconds, then a
concurrent.futures.TimeoutError will be raised.  timeout can be
an int or float.  If timeout is not specified or None, there is no
limit to the wait time.
If the future is cancelled before completing then CancelledError
will be raised.
If the call completed without raising, None is returned.
