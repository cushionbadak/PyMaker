object.__round__(self[, ndigits])¶

object.__floor__(self)¶

object.__ceil__(self)¶
Called to implement the built-in function round() and math
functions trunc(), floor() and ceil().
Unless ndigits is passed to __round__() all these methods should
return the value of the object truncated to an Integral
(typically an int).
If __int__() is not defined then the built-in function int()
falls back to __trunc__().
