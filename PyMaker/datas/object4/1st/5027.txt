socket.CAN_RAW_FD_FRAMESÂ¶
Enables CAN FD support in a CAN_RAW socket. This is disabled by default.
This allows your application to send both CAN and CAN FD frames; however,
you one must accept both CAN and CAN FD frames when reading from the socket.
This constant is documented in the Linux documentation.
Availability: Linux >= 3.6.

New in version 3.5.
