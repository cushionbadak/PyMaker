tzinfo.utcoffset(dt)¶
Return offset of local time from UTC, as a timedelta object that is
positive east of UTC.  If local time is
west of UTC, this should be negative.  Note that this is intended to be the
total offset from UTC; for example, if a tzinfo object represents both
time zone and DST adjustments, utcoffset() should return their sum.  If
the UTC offset isn’t known, return None.  Else the value returned must be a
timedelta object strictly between -timedelta(hours=24) and
timedelta(hours=24) (the magnitude of the offset must be less
than one day).  Most implementations of utcoffset() will probably look
like one of these two:
return CONSTANT                 # fixed-offset class
return CONSTANT + self.dst(dt)  # daylight-aware class


If utcoffset() does not return None, dst() should not return
None either.
The default implementation of utcoffset() raises
NotImplementedError.

Changed in version 3.7: The UTC offset is not restricted to a whole number of minutes.
