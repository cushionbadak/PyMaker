most_common([n])Â¶
Return a list of the n most common elements and their counts from the
most common to the least.  If n is omitted or None,
most_common() returns all elements in the counter.
Elements with equal counts are ordered arbitrarily:
>>> Counter('abracadabra').most_common(3)  # doctest: +SKIP
[('a', 5), ('r', 2), ('b', 2)]
