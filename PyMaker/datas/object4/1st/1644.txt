compare_total_mag(other, context=None)Â¶
Compare two operands using their abstract representation rather than their
value as in compare_total(), but ignoring the sign of each operand.
x.compare_total_mag(y) is equivalent to
x.copy_abs().compare_total(y.copy_abs()).
This operation is unaffected by context and is quiet: no flags are changed
and no rounding is performed.  As an exception, the C version may raise
InvalidOperation if the second operand cannot be converted exactly.
