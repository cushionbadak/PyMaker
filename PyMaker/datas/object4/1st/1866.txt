classmethod chain.from_iterable(iterable)Â¶
Alternate constructor for chain().  Gets chained inputs from a
single iterable argument that is evaluated lazily.  Roughly equivalent to:
def from_iterable(iterables):
    # chain.from_iterable(['ABC', 'DEF']) --> A B C D E F
    for it in iterables:
        for element in it:
            yield element
