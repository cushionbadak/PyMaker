marshal.load(file)¶
Read one value from the open file and return it.  If no valid value is read
(e.g. because the data has a different Python version’s incompatible marshal
format), raise EOFError, ValueError or TypeError.  The
file must be a readable binary file.

Note
If an object containing an unsupported type was marshalled with dump(),
load() will substitute None for the unmarshallable type.
