class calendar.HTMLCalendar(firstweekday=0)¶
This class can be used to generate HTML calendars.
HTMLCalendar instances have the following methods:


formatmonth(theyear, themonth, withyear=True)¶
Return a month’s calendar as an HTML table. If withyear is true the year
will be included in the header, otherwise just the month name will be
used.



formatyear(theyear, width=3)¶
Return a year’s calendar as an HTML table. width (defaulting to 3)
specifies the number of months per row.



formatyearpage(theyear, width=3, css='calendar.css', encoding=None)¶
Return a year’s calendar as a complete HTML page. width (defaulting to
3) specifies the number of months per row. css is the name for the
cascading style sheet to be used. None can be passed if no style
sheet should be used. encoding specifies the encoding to be used for the
output (defaulting to the system default encoding).

HTMLCalendar has the following attributes you can override to
customize the CSS classes used by the calendar:


cssclasses¶
A list of CSS classes used for each weekday. The default class list is:
cssclasses = ["mon", "tue", "wed", "thu", "fri", "sat", "sun"]


more styles can be added for each day:
cssclasses = ["mon text-bold", "tue", "wed", "thu", "fri", "sat", "sun red"]


Note that the length of this list must be seven items.



cssclass_noday¶
The CSS class for a weekday occurring in the previous or coming month.

New in version 3.7.




cssclasses_weekday_head¶
A list of CSS classes used for weekday names in the header row.
The default is the same as cssclasses.

New in version 3.7.




cssclass_month_head¶
The month’s head CSS class (used by formatmonthname()).
The default value is "month".

New in version 3.7.




cssclass_month¶
The CSS class for the whole month’s table (used by formatmonth()).
The default value is "month".

New in version 3.7.




cssclass_year¶
The CSS class for the whole year’s table of tables (used by
formatyear()). The default value is "year".

New in version 3.7.




cssclass_year_head¶
The CSS class for the table head for the whole year (used by
formatyear()). The default value is "year".

New in version 3.7.


Note that although the naming for the above described class attributes is
singular (e.g. cssclass_month cssclass_noday), one can replace the
single CSS class with a space separated list of CSS classes, for example:
"text-bold text-red"


Here is an example how HTMLCalendar can be customized:
class CustomHTMLCal(calendar.HTMLCalendar):
    cssclasses = [style + " text-nowrap" for style in
                  calendar.HTMLCalendar.cssclasses]
    cssclass_month_head = "text-center month-head"
    cssclass_month = "text-center month"
    cssclass_year = "text-italic lead"
