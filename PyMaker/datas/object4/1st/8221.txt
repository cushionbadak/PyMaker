Run menu (Editor window only)Â¶

Python Shell
Open or wake up the Python Shell window.
Check Module
Check the syntax of the module currently open in the Editor window. If the
module has not been saved IDLE will either prompt the user to save or
autosave, as selected in the General tab of the Idle Settings dialog.  If
there is a syntax error, the approximate location is indicated in the
Editor window.
Run Module
Do Check Module (above).  If no error, restart the shell to clean the
environment, then execute the module.  Output is displayed in the Shell
window.  Note that output requires use of print or write.
When execution is complete, the Shell retains focus and displays a prompt.
At this point, one may interactively explore the result of execution.
This is similar to executing a file with python -i file at a command
line.
