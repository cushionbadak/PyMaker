join(timeout=None)¶
Wait until the thread terminates. This blocks the calling thread until
the thread whose join() method is called terminates – either
normally or through an unhandled exception – or until the optional
timeout occurs.
When the timeout argument is present and not None, it should be a
floating point number specifying a timeout for the operation in seconds
(or fractions thereof). As join() always returns None,
you must call is_alive() after join() to
decide whether a timeout happened – if the thread is still alive, the
join() call timed out.
When the timeout argument is not present or None, the operation will
block until the thread terminates.
A thread can be join()ed many times.
join() raises a RuntimeError if an attempt is made
to join the current thread as that would cause a deadlock. It is also
an error to join() a thread before it has been started
and attempts to do so raise the same exception.
