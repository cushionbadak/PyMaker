flatten(msg, unixfrom=False, linesep=None)Â¶
Print the textual representation of the message object structure rooted
at msg to the output file specified when the BytesGenerator
instance was created.
If the policy option cte_type
is 8bit (the default), copy any headers in the original parsed
message that have not been modified to the output with any bytes with the
high bit set reproduced as in the original, and preserve the non-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding of any body parts that have them.
If cte_type is 7bit, convert the bytes with the high bit set as
needed using an ASCII-compatible Content-Transfer-Encoding.
That is, transform parts with non-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding
(Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit) to an ASCII compatible
Content-Transfer-Encoding, and encode RFC-invalid non-ASCII
bytes in headers using the MIME unknown-8bit character set, thus
rendering them RFC-compliant.
If unixfrom is True, print the envelope header delimiter used by
the Unix mailbox format (see mailbox) before the first of the
RFC 5322 headers of the root message object.  If the root object has
no envelope header, craft a standard one.  The default is False.
Note that for subparts, no envelope header is ever printed.
If linesep is not None, use it as the separator character between
all the lines of the flattened message.  If linesep is None (the
default), use the value specified in the policy.
