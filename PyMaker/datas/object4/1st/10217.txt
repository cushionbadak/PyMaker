msilib.OpenDatabase(path, persist)Â¶
Return a new database object by calling MsiOpenDatabase.   path is the file
name of the MSI file; persist can be one of the constants
MSIDBOPEN_CREATEDIRECT, MSIDBOPEN_CREATE, MSIDBOPEN_DIRECT,
MSIDBOPEN_READONLY, or MSIDBOPEN_TRANSACT, and may include the flag
MSIDBOPEN_PATCHFILE. See the Microsoft documentation for the meaning of
these flags; depending on the flags, an existing database is opened, or a new
one created.
