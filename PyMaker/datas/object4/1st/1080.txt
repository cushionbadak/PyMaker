classmethod date.fromtimestamp(timestamp)¶
Return the local date corresponding to the POSIX timestamp, such as is returned
by time.time().  This may raise OverflowError, if the timestamp is out
of the range of values supported by the platform C localtime() function,
and OSError on localtime() failure.
It’s common for this to be restricted to years from 1970 through 2038.  Note
that on non-POSIX systems that include leap seconds in their notion of a
timestamp, leap seconds are ignored by fromtimestamp().

Changed in version 3.3: Raise OverflowError instead of ValueError if the timestamp
is out of the range of values supported by the platform C
localtime() function. Raise OSError instead of
ValueError on localtime() failure.
