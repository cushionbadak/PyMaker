docs:


Match.__getitem__(g)Â¶
This is identical to m.group(g).  This allows easier access to
an individual group from a match:
>>> m = re.match(r"(\w+) (\w+)", "Isaac Newton, physicist")
>>> m[0]       # The entire match
'Isaac Newton'
>>> m[1]       # The first parenthesized subgroup.
'Isaac'
>>> m[2]       # The second parenthesized subgroup.
'Newton'



New in version 3.6.
