NNTP.login(user=None, password=None, usenetrc=True)Â¶
Send AUTHINFO commands with the user name and password.  If user
and password are None and usenetrc is true, credentials from
~/.netrc will be used if possible.
Unless intentionally delayed, login is normally performed during the
NNTP object initialization and separately calling this function
is unnecessary.  To force authentication to be delayed, you must not set
user or password when creating the object, and must set usenetrc to
False.

New in version 3.2.
