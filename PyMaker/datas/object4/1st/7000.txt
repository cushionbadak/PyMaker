NNTP.post(data)¶
Post an article using the POST command.  The data argument is either
a file object opened for binary reading, or any iterable of bytes
objects (representing raw lines of the article to be posted).  It should
represent a well-formed news article, including the required headers.  The
post() method automatically escapes lines beginning with . and
appends the termination line.
If the method succeeds, the server’s response is returned.  If the server
refuses posting, a NNTPReplyError is raised.
