json.loads(s, *, encoding=None, cls=None, object_hook=None, parse_float=None, parse_int=None, parse_constant=None, object_pairs_hook=None, **kw)Â¶
Deserialize s (a str, bytes or bytearray
instance containing a JSON document) to a Python object using this
conversion table.
The other arguments have the same meaning as in load(), except
encoding which is ignored and deprecated.
If the data being deserialized is not a valid JSON document, a
JSONDecodeError will be raised.

Changed in version 3.6: s can now be of type bytes or bytearray. The
input encoding should be UTF-8, UTF-16 or UTF-32.
