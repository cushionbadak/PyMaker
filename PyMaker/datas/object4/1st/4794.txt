coroutine loop.connect_accepted_socket(protocol_factory, sock, *, ssl=None, ssl_handshake_timeout=None)Â¶
Wrap an already accepted connection into a transport/protocol pair.
This method can be used by servers that accept connections outside
of asyncio but that use asyncio to handle them.
Parameters:

protocol_factory must be a callable returning a
protocol implementation.
sock is a preexisting socket object returned from
socket.accept.
ssl can be set to an SSLContext to enable SSL over
the accepted connections.
ssl_handshake_timeout is (for an SSL connection) the time in seconds to
wait for the SSL handshake to complete before aborting the connection.
60.0 seconds if None (default).

Returns a (transport, protocol) pair.

New in version 3.7: The ssl_handshake_timeout parameter.


New in version 3.5.3.
