sqlite3.enable_callback_tracebacks(flag)Â¶
By default you will not get any tracebacks in user-defined functions,
aggregates, converters, authorizer callbacks etc. If you want to debug them,
you can call this function with flag set to True. Afterwards, you will
get tracebacks from callbacks on sys.stderr. Use False to
disable the feature again.
