__missing__(key)Â¶
If the default_factory attribute is None, this raises a
KeyError exception with the key as argument.
If default_factory is not None, it is called without arguments
to provide a default value for the given key, this value is inserted in
the dictionary for the key, and returned.
If calling default_factory raises an exception this exception is
propagated unchanged.
This method is called by the __getitem__() method of the
dict class when the requested key is not found; whatever it
returns or raises is then returned or raised by __getitem__().
Note that __missing__() is not called for any operations besides
__getitem__(). This means that get() will, like normal
dictionaries, return None as a default rather than using
default_factory.
