os.path.commonprefix(list)Â¶
Return the longest path prefix (taken character-by-character) that is a
prefix of all paths in  list.  If list is empty, return the empty string
('').

Note
This function may return invalid paths because it works a
character at a time.  To obtain a valid path, see
commonpath().
>>> os.path.commonprefix(['/usr/lib', '/usr/local/lib'])
'/usr/l'

>>> os.path.commonpath(['/usr/lib', '/usr/local/lib'])
'/usr'




Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a path-like object.
