HTMLParser.handle_charref(name)Â¶
This method is called to process decimal and hexadecimal numeric character
references of the form &#NNN; and &#xNNN;.  For example, the decimal
equivalent for &gt; is &#62;, whereas the hexadecimal is &#x3E;;
in this case the method will receive '62' or 'x3E'.  This method
is never called if convert_charrefs is True.
