ipaddress.get_mixed_type_key(obj)¶
Return a key suitable for sorting between networks and addresses.  Address
and Network objects are not sortable by default; they’re fundamentally
different, so the expression:
IPv4Address('192.0.2.0') <= IPv4Network('192.0.2.0/24')


doesn’t make sense.  There are some times however, where you may wish to
have ipaddress sort these anyway.  If you need to do this, you can use
this function as the key argument to sorted().
obj is either a network or address object.
