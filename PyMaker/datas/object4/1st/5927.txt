MHMessage¶


class mailbox.MHMessage(message=None)¶
A message with MH-specific behaviors. Parameter message has the same meaning
as with the Message constructor.
MH messages do not support marks or flags in the traditional sense, but they
do support sequences, which are logical groupings of arbitrary messages. Some
mail reading programs (although not the standard mh and
nmh) use sequences in much the same way flags are used with other
formats, as follows:






Sequence
Explanation



unseen
Not read, but previously detected by MUA

replied
Replied to

flagged
Marked as important



MHMessage instances offer the following methods:


get_sequences()¶
Return a list of the names of sequences that include this message.



set_sequences(sequences)¶
Set the list of sequences that include this message.



add_sequence(sequence)¶
Add sequence to the list of sequences that include this message.



remove_sequence(sequence)¶
Remove sequence from the list of sequences that include this message.


When an MHMessage instance is created based upon a
MaildirMessage instance, the following conversions take place:






Resulting state
MaildirMessage state



“unseen” sequence
no S flag

“replied” sequence
R flag

“flagged” sequence
F flag



When an MHMessage instance is created based upon an
mboxMessage or MMDFMessage instance, the Status
and X-Status headers are omitted and the following conversions
take place:






Resulting state
mboxMessage or MMDFMessage
state



“unseen” sequence
no R flag

“replied” sequence
A flag

“flagged” sequence
F flag



When an MHMessage instance is created based upon a
BabylMessage instance, the following conversions take place:






Resulting state
BabylMessage state



“unseen” sequence
“unseen” label

“replied” sequence
“answered” label
