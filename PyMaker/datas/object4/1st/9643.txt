find_loader(fullname)Â¶
A legacy method for finding a loader for the specified
module.  Returns a 2-tuple of (loader, portion) where portion
is a sequence of file system locations contributing to part of a namespace
package. The loader may be None while specifying portion to
signify the contribution of the file system locations to a namespace
package. An empty list can be used for portion to signify the loader
is not part of a namespace package. If loader is None and
portion is the empty list then no loader or location for a namespace
package were found (i.e. failure to find anything for the module).
If find_spec() is defined then backwards-compatible functionality is
provided.

Changed in version 3.4: Returns (None, []) instead of raising NotImplementedError.
Uses find_spec() when available to provide functionality.


Deprecated since version 3.4: Use find_spec() instead.
