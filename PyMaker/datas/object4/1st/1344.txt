<dd><p>Return a tuple <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">(address,</span> <span class="pre">length)</span></code> giving the current memory address and the
length in elements of the buffer used to hold array’s contents.  The size of the
memory buffer in bytes can be computed as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">array.buffer_info()[1]</span> <span class="pre">*</span>
<span class="pre">array.itemsize</span></code>.  This is occasionally useful when working with low-level (and
inherently unsafe) I/O interfaces that require memory addresses, such as certain
<code class="xref c c-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ioctl()</span></code> operations.  The returned numbers are valid as long as the array
exists and no length-changing operations are applied to it.</p>

<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">When using array objects from code written in C or C++ (the only way to
effectively make use of this information), it makes more sense to use the buffer
interface supported by array objects.  This method is maintained for backward
compatibility and should be avoided in new code.  The buffer interface is
documented in <a class="reference internal" href="../c-api/buffer.html#bufferobjects"><span class="std std-ref">Buffer Protocol</span></a>.</p>
