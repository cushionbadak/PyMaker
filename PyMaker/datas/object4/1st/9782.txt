Exceptions and Error Handling¶
The parser module defines a single exception, but may also pass other built-in
exceptions from other portions of the Python runtime environment.  See each
function for information about the exceptions it can raise.


exception parser.ParserError¶
Exception raised when a failure occurs within the parser module.  This is
generally produced for validation failures rather than the built-in
SyntaxError raised during normal parsing. The exception argument is
either a string describing the reason of the failure or a tuple containing a
sequence causing the failure from a parse tree passed to sequence2st()
and an explanatory string.  Calls to sequence2st() need to be able to
handle either type of exception, while calls to other functions in the module
will only need to be aware of the simple string values.

Note that the functions compilest(), expr(), and suite() may
raise exceptions which are normally raised by the parsing and compilation
process.  These include the built in exceptions MemoryError,
OverflowError, SyntaxError, and SystemError.  In these
cases, these exceptions carry all the meaning normally associated with them.
Refer to the descriptions of each function for detailed information.
