CGIXMLRPCRequestHandler¶
The CGIXMLRPCRequestHandler class can be used to handle XML-RPC
requests sent to Python CGI scripts.


CGIXMLRPCRequestHandler.register_function(function=None, name=None)¶
Register a function that can respond to XML-RPC requests.  If name is given,
it will be the method name associated with function, otherwise
function.__name__ will be used.  name is a string, and may contain
characters not legal in Python identifiers, including the period character.
This method can also be used as a decorator.  When used as a decorator,
name can only be given as a keyword argument to register function under
name.  If no name is given, function.__name__ will be used.

Changed in version 3.7: register_function() can be used as a decorator.




CGIXMLRPCRequestHandler.register_instance(instance)¶
Register an object which is used to expose method names  which have not been
registered using register_function(). If  instance contains a
_dispatch() method, it is called with the  requested method name and the
parameters from the  request; the return value is returned to the client as the
result. If instance does not have a _dispatch() method, it is searched
for an attribute matching the name of the requested method; if  the requested
method name contains periods, each  component of the method name is searched for
individually,  with the effect that a simple hierarchical search is performed.
The value found from this search is then called with the  parameters from the
request, and the return value is passed  back to the client.



CGIXMLRPCRequestHandler.register_introspection_functions()¶
Register the XML-RPC introspection functions  system.listMethods,
system.methodHelp and  system.methodSignature.



CGIXMLRPCRequestHandler.register_multicall_functions()¶
Register the XML-RPC multicall function system.multicall.



CGIXMLRPCRequestHandler.handle_request(request_text=None)¶
Handle an XML-RPC request. If request_text is given, it should be the POST
data provided by the HTTP server,  otherwise the contents of stdin will be used.

Example:
class MyFuncs:
    def mul(self, x, y):
        return x * y


handler = CGIXMLRPCRequestHandler()
handler.register_function(pow)
handler.register_function(lambda x,y: x+y, 'add')
handler.register_introspection_functions()
handler.register_instance(MyFuncs())
handler.handle_request()
