ssl.CERT_OPTIONALÂ¶
Possible value for SSLContext.verify_mode, or the cert_reqs
parameter to wrap_socket().  In client mode, CERT_OPTIONAL
has the same meaning as CERT_REQUIRED. It is recommended to
use CERT_REQUIRED for client-side sockets instead.
In server mode, a client certificate request is sent to the client.  The
client may either ignore the request or send a certificate in order
perform TLS client cert authentication.  If the client chooses to send
a certificate, it is verified.  Any verification error immediately aborts
the TLS handshake.
Use of this setting requires a valid set of CA certificates to
be passed, either to SSLContext.load_verify_locations() or as a
value of the ca_certs parameter to wrap_socket().
