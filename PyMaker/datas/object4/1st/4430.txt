concurrent.futures.wait(fs, timeout=None, return_when=ALL_COMPLETED)Â¶
Wait for the Future instances (possibly created by different
Executor instances) given by fs to complete.  Returns a named
2-tuple of sets.  The first set, named done, contains the futures that
completed (finished or were cancelled) before the wait completed.  The second
set, named not_done, contains uncompleted futures.
timeout can be used to control the maximum number of seconds to wait before
returning.  timeout can be an int or float.  If timeout is not specified
or None, there is no limit to the wait time.
return_when indicates when this function should return.  It must be one of
the following constants:






Constant
Description

exception then it is equivalent to
