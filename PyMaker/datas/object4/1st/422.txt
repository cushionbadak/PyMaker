docs:


str.find(sub[, start[, end]])Â¶
Return the lowest index in the string where substring sub is found within
the slice s[start:end].  Optional arguments start and end are
interpreted as in slice notation.  Return -1 if sub is not found.

Note
The find() method should be used only if you need to know the
position of sub.  To check if sub is a substring or not, use the
in operator:
>>> 'Py' in 'Python'
True
