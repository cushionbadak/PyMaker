ZipFile.write(filename, arcname=None, compress_type=None, compresslevel=None)Â¶
Write the file named filename to the archive, giving it the archive name
arcname (by default, this will be the same as filename, but without a drive
letter and with leading path separators removed).  If given, compress_type
overrides the value given for the compression parameter to the constructor for
the new entry. Similarly, compresslevel will override the constructor if
given.
The archive must be open with mode 'w', 'x' or 'a'.

Note
Archive names should be relative to the archive root, that is, they should not
start with a path separator.


Note
If arcname (or filename, if arcname is  not given) contains a null
byte, the name of the file in the archive will be truncated at the null byte.


Changed in version 3.6: Calling write() on a ZipFile created with mode 'r' or
a closed ZipFile will raise a ValueError.  Previously,
a RuntimeError was raised.
