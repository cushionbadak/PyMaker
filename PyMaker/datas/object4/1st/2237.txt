tempfile.gettempdir()Â¶
Return the name of the directory used for temporary files. This
defines the default value for the dir argument to all functions
in this module.
Python searches a standard list of directories to find one which
the calling user can create files in.  The list is:

The directory named by the TMPDIR environment variable.
The directory named by the TEMP environment variable.
The directory named by the TMP environment variable.
A platform-specific location:
On Windows, the directories C:\TEMP, C:\TMP,
\TEMP, and \TMP, in that order.
On all other platforms, the directories /tmp, /var/tmp, and
/usr/tmp, in that order.


As a last resort, the current working directory.

The result of this search is cached, see the description of
tempdir below.
