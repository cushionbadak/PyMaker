refold_sourceÂ¶
If the value for a header in the Message object originated from a
parser (as opposed to being set by a program), this
attribute indicates whether or not a generator should refold that value
when transforming the message back into serialized form.  The possible
values are:






none
all source values use original folding

long
source values that have any line that is longer than
max_line_length will be refolded

all
all values are refolded.



The default is long.
