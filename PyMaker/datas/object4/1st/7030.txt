SMTP.ehlo(name='')Â¶
Identify yourself to an ESMTP server using EHLO.  The hostname argument
defaults to the fully qualified domain name of the local host.  Examine the
response for ESMTP option and store them for use by has_extn().
Also sets several informational attributes: the message returned by
the server is stored as the ehlo_resp attribute, does_esmtp
is set to true or false depending on whether the server supports ESMTP, and
esmtp_features will be a dictionary containing the names of the
SMTP service extensions this server supports, and their parameters (if any).
Unless you wish to use has_extn() before sending mail, it should not be
necessary to call this method explicitly.  It will be implicitly called by
sendmail() when necessary.
