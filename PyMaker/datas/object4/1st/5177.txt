ssl.PROTOCOL_SSLv2¶
Selects SSL version 2 as the channel encryption protocol.
This protocol is not available if OpenSSL is compiled with the
OPENSSL_NO_SSL2 flag.

Warning
SSL version 2 is insecure.  Its use is highly discouraged.


Deprecated since version 3.6: OpenSSL has removed support for SSLv2.
