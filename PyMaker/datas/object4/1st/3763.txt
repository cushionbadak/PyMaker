<dd><p>Set the window’s background.  A window’s background consists of a character and
any combination of attributes.  The attribute part of the background is combined
(OR’ed) with all non-blank characters that are written into the window.  Both
the character and attribute parts of the background are combined with the blank
characters.  The background becomes a property of the character and moves with
the character through any scrolling and insert/delete line/character operations.</p>
