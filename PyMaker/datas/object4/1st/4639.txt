classmethod all_tasks(loop=None)Â¶
Return a set of all tasks for an event loop.
By default all tasks for the current event loop are returned.
If loop is None, the get_event_loop() function
is used to get the current loop.
This method is deprecated and will be removed in
Python 3.9.  Use the asyncio.all_tasks() function instead.
