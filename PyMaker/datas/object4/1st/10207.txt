Writer Implementations¶
Three implementations of the writer object interface are provided as examples by
this module.  Most applications will need to derive new writer classes from the
NullWriter class.


class formatter.NullWriter¶
A writer which only provides the interface definition; no actions are taken on
any methods.  This should be the base class for all writers which do not need to
inherit any implementation methods.



class formatter.AbstractWriter¶
A writer which can be used in debugging formatters, but not much else.  Each
method simply announces itself by printing its name and arguments on standard
output.



class formatter.DumbWriter(file=None, maxcol=72)¶
Simple writer class which writes output on the file object passed
in as file or, if file is omitted, on standard output.  The output is
simply word-wrapped to the number of columns specified by maxcol.  This
class is suitable for reflowing a sequence of paragraphs.
