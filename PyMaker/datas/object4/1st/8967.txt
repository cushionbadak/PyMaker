unt(il) [lineno]Â¶
Without argument, continue execution until the line with a number greater
than the current one is reached.
With a line number, continue execution until a line with a number greater or
equal to that is reached.  In both cases, also stop when the current frame
returns.

Changed in version 3.2: Allow giving an explicit line number.
