socket.inet_ntop(address_family, packed_ip)Â¶
Convert a packed IP address (a bytes-like object of some number of
bytes) to its standard, family-specific string representation (for
example, '7.10.0.5' or '5aef:2b::8').
inet_ntop() is useful when a library or network protocol returns an
object of type struct in_addr (similar to inet_ntoa()) or
struct in6_addr.
Supported values for address_family are currently AF_INET and
AF_INET6. If the bytes object packed_ip is not the correct
length for the specified address family, ValueError will be raised.
OSError is raised for errors from the call to inet_ntop().
Availability: Unix (maybe not all platforms), Windows.

Changed in version 3.4: Windows support added


Changed in version 3.5: Writable bytes-like object is now accepted.
