loop.set_task_factory(factory)Â¶
Set a task factory that will be used by
loop.create_task().
If factory is None the default task factory will be set.
Otherwise, factory must be a callable with the signature matching
(loop, coro), where loop is a reference to the active
event loop, and coro is a coroutine object.  The callable
must return a asyncio.Future-compatible object.
