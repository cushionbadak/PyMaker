shutil.copyfileobj(fsrc, fdst[, length])Â¶
Copy the contents of the file-like object fsrc to the file-like object fdst.
The integer length, if given, is the buffer size. In particular, a negative
length value means to copy the data without looping over the source data in
chunks; by default the data is read in chunks to avoid uncontrolled memory
consumption. Note that if the current file position of the fsrc object is not
0, only the contents from the current file position to the end of the file will
be copied.
