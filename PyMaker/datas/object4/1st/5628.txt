class email.headerregistry.SingleAddressHeader¶
A subclass of AddressHeader that adds one
additional attribute:


address¶
The single address encoded by the header value.  If the header value
actually contains more than one address (which would be a violation of
the RFC under the default policy), accessing this attribute
will result in a ValueError.
