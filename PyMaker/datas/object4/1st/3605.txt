rotate(source, dest)¶
When rotating, rotate the current log.
The default implementation calls the ‘rotator’ attribute of the handler,
if it’s callable, passing the source and dest arguments to it. If the
attribute isn’t callable (the default is None), the source is simply
renamed to the destination.




Parameters:
source – The source filename. This is normally the base
filename, e.g. ‘test.log’.
dest – The destination filename. This is normally
what the source is rotated to, e.g. ‘test.log.1’.






New in version 3.3.
