exception asyncio.CancelledErrorÂ¶
The operation has been cancelled.
This exception can be caught to perform custom operations
when asyncio Tasks are cancelled.  In almost all situations the
exception must be re-raised.

Important
This exception is a subclass of Exception, so it can be
accidentally suppressed by an overly broad try..except block:
try:
    await operation
except Exception:
    # The cancellation is broken because the *except* block
    # suppresses the CancelledError exception.
    log.log('an error has occurred')


Instead, the following pattern should be used:
try:
    await operation
except asyncio.CancelledError:
    raise
except Exception:
    log.log('an error has occurred')
