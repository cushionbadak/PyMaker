WITH_CLEANUP_START¶
Cleans up the stack when a with statement block exits.  TOS is the
context manager’s __exit__() bound method. Below TOS are 1–3 values
indicating how/why the finally clause was entered:

SECOND = None
(SECOND, THIRD) = (WHY_{RETURN,CONTINUE}), retval
SECOND = WHY_*; no retval below it
(SECOND, THIRD, FOURTH) = exc_info()

In the last case, TOS(SECOND, THIRD, FOURTH) is called, otherwise
TOS(None, None, None).  Pushes SECOND and result of the call
to the stack.
