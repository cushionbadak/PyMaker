exception signal.ItimerErrorÂ¶
Raised to signal an error from the underlying setitimer() or
getitimer() implementation. Expect this error if an invalid
interval timer or a negative time is passed to setitimer().
This error is a subtype of OSError.

New in version 3.3: This error used to be a subtype of IOError, which is now an
alias of OSError.
