bytes.swapcase()¶

bytearray.swapcase()¶
Return a copy of the sequence with all the lowercase ASCII characters
converted to their corresponding uppercase counterpart and vice-versa.
For example:
>>> b'Hello World'.swapcase()
b'hELLO wORLD'


Lowercase ASCII characters are those byte values in the sequence
b'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. Uppercase ASCII characters
are those byte values in the sequence b'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'.
Unlike str.swapcase(), it is always the case that
bin.swapcase().swapcase() == bin for the binary versions. Case
conversions are symmetrical in ASCII, even though that is not generally
true for arbitrary Unicode code points.

Note
The bytearray version of this method does not operate in place - it
always produces a new object, even if no changes were made.
