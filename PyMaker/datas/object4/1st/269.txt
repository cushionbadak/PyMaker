7.9. The break statementÂ¶

break_stmt ::=  "break"

break may only occur syntactically nested in a for or
while loop, but not nested in a function or class definition within
that loop.
It terminates the nearest enclosing loop, skipping the optional else
clause if the loop has one.
If a for loop is terminated by break, the loop control
target keeps its current value.
When break passes control out of a try statement with a
finally clause, that finally clause is executed before
really leaving the loop.
