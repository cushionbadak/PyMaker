class asyncio.FastChildWatcherÂ¶
This implementation reaps every terminated processes by calling
os.waitpid(-1) directly, possibly breaking other code spawning
processes and waiting for their termination.
There is no noticeable overhead when handling a big number of
children (O(1) each time a child terminates).
