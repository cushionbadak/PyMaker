popitem()Â¶
Return an arbitrary (key, message) pair, where key is a key and
message is a message representation, and delete the corresponding
message. If the mailbox is empty, raise a KeyError exception. The
message is represented as an instance of the appropriate format-specific
Message subclass unless a custom message factory was specified
when the Mailbox instance was initialized.
