get([block[, timeout]])Â¶
Remove and return an item from the queue.  If optional args block is
True (the default) and timeout is None (the default), block if
necessary until an item is available.  If timeout is a positive number,
it blocks at most timeout seconds and raises the queue.Empty
exception if no item was available within that time.  Otherwise (block is
False), return an item if one is immediately available, else raise the
queue.Empty exception (timeout is ignored in that case).
