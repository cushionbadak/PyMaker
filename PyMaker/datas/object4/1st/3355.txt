Functions¶


time.asctime([t])¶
Convert a tuple or struct_time representing a time as returned by
gmtime() or localtime() to a string of the following
form: 'Sun Jun 20 23:21:05 1993'.  If t is not provided, the current time
as returned by localtime() is used. Locale information is not used by
asctime().

Note
Unlike the C function of the same name, asctime() does not add a
trailing newline.




time.clock()¶
On Unix, return the current processor time as a floating point number expressed
in seconds.  The precision, and in fact the very definition of the meaning of
“processor time”, depends on that of the C function of the same name.
On Windows, this function returns wall-clock seconds elapsed since the first
call to this function, as a floating point number, based on the Win32 function
QueryPerformanceCounter(). The resolution is typically better than one
microsecond.

Deprecated since version 3.3: The behaviour of this function depends on the platform: use
perf_counter() or process_time() instead, depending on your
requirements, to have a well defined behaviour.




time.pthread_getcpuclockid(thread_id)¶
Return the clk_id of the thread-specific CPU-time clock for the specified thread_id.
Use threading.get_ident() or the ident
attribute of threading.Thread objects to get a suitable value
for thread_id.

Warning
Passing an invalid or expired thread_id may result in
undefined behavior, such as segmentation fault.

Availability: Unix (see the man page for pthread_getcpuclockid(3) for
further information).

New in version 3.7.




time.clock_getres(clk_id)¶
Return the resolution (precision) of the specified clock clk_id.  Refer to
Clock ID Constants for a list of accepted values for clk_id.
Availability: Unix.

New in version 3.3.




time.clock_gettime(clk_id) → float¶
Return the time of the specified clock clk_id.  Refer to
Clock ID Constants for a list of accepted values for clk_id.
Availability: Unix.

New in version 3.3.




time.clock_gettime_ns(clk_id) → int¶
Similar to clock_gettime() but return time as nanoseconds.
Availability: Unix.

New in version 3.7.




time.clock_settime(clk_id, time: float)¶
Set the time of the specified clock clk_id.  Currently,
CLOCK_REALTIME is the only accepted value for clk_id.
Availability: Unix.

New in version 3.3.




time.clock_settime_ns(clk_id, time: int)¶
Similar to clock_settime() but set time with nanoseconds.
Availability: Unix.

New in version 3.7.




time.ctime([secs])¶
Convert a time expressed in seconds since the epoch to a string representing
local time. If secs is not provided or None, the current time as
returned by time() is used.  ctime(secs) is equivalent to
asctime(localtime(secs)). Locale information is not used by ctime().



time.get_clock_info(name)¶
Get information on the specified clock as a namespace object.
Supported clock names and the corresponding functions to read their value
are:

'clock': time.clock()
'monotonic': time.monotonic()
'perf_counter': time.perf_counter()
'process_time': time.process_time()
'thread_time': time.thread_time()
'time': time.time()

The result has the following attributes:

adjustable: True if the clock can be changed automatically (e.g. by
a NTP daemon) or manually by the system administrator, False otherwise
implementation: The name of the underlying C function used to get
the clock value.  Refer to Clock ID Constants for possible values.
monotonic: True if the clock cannot go backward,
False otherwise
resolution: The resolution of the clock in seconds (float)


New in version 3.3.




time.gmtime([secs])¶
Convert a time expressed in seconds since the epoch to a struct_time in
UTC in which the dst flag is always zero.  If secs is not provided or
None, the current time as returned by time() is used.  Fractions
of a second are ignored.  See above for a description of the
struct_time object. See calendar.timegm() for the inverse of this
function.



time.localtime([secs])¶
Like gmtime() but converts to local time.  If secs is not provided or
None, the current time as returned by time() is used.  The dst
flag is set to 1 when DST applies to the given time.



time.mktime(t)¶
This is the inverse function of localtime().  Its argument is the
struct_time or full 9-tuple (since the dst flag is needed; use -1
as the dst flag if it is unknown) which expresses the time in local time, not
UTC.  It returns a floating point number, for compatibility with time().
If the input value cannot be represented as a valid time, either
OverflowError or ValueError will be raised (which depends on
whether the invalid value is caught by Python or the underlying C libraries).
The earliest date for which it can generate a time is platform-dependent.



time.monotonic() → float¶
Return the value (in fractional seconds) of a monotonic clock, i.e. a clock
that cannot go backwards.  The clock is not affected by system clock updates.
The reference point of the returned value is undefined, so that only the
difference between the results of consecutive calls is valid.

New in version 3.3.


Changed in version 3.5: The function is now always available and always system-wide.




time.monotonic_ns() → int¶
Similar to monotonic(), but return time as nanoseconds.

New in version 3.7.




time.perf_counter() → float¶
Return the value (in fractional seconds) of a performance counter, i.e. a
clock with the highest available resolution to measure a short duration.  It
does include time elapsed during sleep and is system-wide.  The reference
point of the returned value is undefined, so that only the difference between
the results of consecutive calls is valid.

New in version 3.3.




time.perf_counter_ns() → int¶
Similar to perf_counter(), but return time as nanoseconds.

New in version 3.7.




time.process_time() → float¶
Return the value (in fractional seconds) of the sum of the system and user
CPU time of the current process.  It does not include time elapsed during
sleep.  It is process-wide by definition.  The reference point of the
returned value is undefined, so that only the difference between the results
of consecutive calls is valid.

New in version 3.3.




time.process_time_ns() → int¶
Similar to process_time() but return time as nanoseconds.

New in version 3.7.




time.sleep(secs)¶
Suspend execution of the calling thread for the given number of seconds.
The argument may be a floating point number to indicate a more precise sleep
time. The actual suspension time may be less than that requested because any
caught signal will terminate the sleep() following execution of that
signal’s catching routine.  Also, the suspension time may be longer than
requested by an arbitrary amount because of the scheduling of other activity
in the system.

Changed in version 3.5: The function now sleeps at least secs even if the sleep is interrupted
by a signal, except if the signal handler raises an exception (see
PEP 475 for the rationale).




time.strftime(format[, t])¶
Convert a tuple or struct_time representing a time as returned by
gmtime() or localtime() to a string as specified by the format
argument.  If t is not provided, the current time as returned by
localtime() is used.  format must be a string.  ValueError is
raised if any field in t is outside of the allowed range.
0 is a legal argument for any position in the time tuple; if it is normally
illegal the value is forced to a correct one.
The following directives can be embedded in the format string. They are shown
without the optional field width and precision specification, and are replaced
by the indicated characters in the strftime() result:







Directive
Meaning
Notes



%a
Locale’s abbreviated weekday name.
 

%A
Locale’s full weekday name.
 

%b
Locale’s abbreviated month name.
 

%B
Locale’s full month name.
 

%c
Locale’s appropriate date and time
representation.

(2)

%U
Week number of the year (Sunday as the first
day of the week) as a decimal number [00,53].

Notes:

When used with the strptime() function, the %p directive only affects
the output hour field if the %I directive is used to parse the hour.
The range really is 0 to 61; value 60 is valid in
timestamps representing leap seconds and value 61 is supported
for historical reasons.
When used with the strptime() function, %U and %W are only used in
calculations when the day of the week and the year are specified.

Here is an example, a format for dates compatible with that specified  in the
RFC 2822 Internet email standard.  [1]
>>> from time import gmtime, strftime
>>> strftime("%a, %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S +0000", gmtime())
'Thu, 28 Jun 2001 14:17:15 +0000'


Additional directives may be supported on certain platforms, but only the
ones listed here have a meaning standardized by ANSI C.  To see the full set
of format codes supported on your platform, consult the strftime(3)
documentation.
On some platforms, an optional field width and precision specification can
immediately follow the initial '%' of a directive in the following order;
this is also not portable. The field width is normally 2 except for %j where
it is 3.



time.strptime(string[, format])¶
Parse a string representing a time according to a format.  The return value
is a struct_time as returned by gmtime() or
localtime().
The format parameter uses the same directives as those used by
strftime(); it defaults to "%a %b %d %H:%M:%S %Y" which matches the
formatting returned by ctime(). If string cannot be parsed according
to format, or if it has excess data after parsing, ValueError is
raised. The default values used to fill in any missing data when more
accurate values cannot be inferred are (1900, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, -1).
Both string and format must be strings.
For example:
>>> import time
>>> time.strptime("30 Nov 00", "%d %b %y")   # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
time.struct_time(tm_year=2000, tm_mon=11, tm_mday=30, tm_hour=0, tm_min=0,
                 tm_sec=0, tm_wday=3, tm_yday=335, tm_isdst=-1)


Support for the %Z directive is based on the values contained in tzname
and whether daylight is true.  Because of this, it is platform-specific
except for recognizing UTC and GMT which are always known (and are considered to
be non-daylight savings timezones).
Only the directives specified in the documentation are supported.  Because
strftime() is implemented per platform it can sometimes offer more
directives than those listed.  But strptime() is independent of any platform
and thus does not necessarily support all directives available that are not
documented as supported.



class time.struct_time¶
The type of the time value sequence returned by gmtime(),
localtime(), and strptime().  It is an object with a named
tuple interface: values can be accessed by index and by attribute name.  The
following values are present:







Index
Attribute
Values



0
tm_year
(for example, 1993)

1
tm_mon
range [1, 12]

2
tm_mday
range [1, 31]

3
tm_hour
range [0, 23]

4
tm_min
range [0, 59]

5
tm_sec
range [0, 61]; see (2) in
strftime() description

6
tm_wday
range [0, 6], Monday is 0

7
tm_yday
range [1, 366]

8
tm_isdst
0, 1 or -1; see below

N/A
tm_zone
abbreviation of timezone name

N/A
tm_gmtoff
offset east of UTC in seconds



Note that unlike the C structure, the month value is a range of [1, 12], not
[0, 11].
In calls to mktime(), tm_isdst may be set to 1 when daylight
savings time is in effect, and 0 when it is not.  A value of -1 indicates that
this is not known, and will usually result in the correct state being filled in.
When a tuple with an incorrect length is passed to a function expecting a
struct_time, or having elements of the wrong type, a
TypeError is raised.



time.time() → float¶
Return the time in seconds since the epoch as a floating point
number. The specific date of the epoch and the handling of
leap seconds is platform dependent.
On Windows and most Unix systems, the epoch is January 1, 1970,
00:00:00 (UTC) and leap seconds are not counted towards the time
in seconds since the epoch. This is commonly referred to as
Unix time.
To find out what the epoch is on a given platform, look at
gmtime(0).
Note that even though the time is always returned as a floating point
number, not all systems provide time with a better precision than 1 second.
While this function normally returns non-decreasing values, it can return a
lower value than a previous call if the system clock has been set back
between the two calls.
The number returned by time() may be converted into a more common
time format (i.e. year, month, day, hour, etc…) in UTC by passing it to
gmtime() function or in local time by passing it to the
localtime() function. In both cases a
struct_time object is returned, from which the components
of the calendar date may be accessed as attributes.



time.thread_time() → float¶
Return the value (in fractional seconds) of the sum of the system and user
CPU time of the current thread.  It does not include time elapsed during
sleep.  It is thread-specific by definition.  The reference point of the
returned value is undefined, so that only the difference between the results
of consecutive calls in the same thread is valid.
Availability: Windows, Linux, Unix systems supporting
CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID.

New in version 3.7.




time.thread_time_ns() → int¶
Similar to thread_time() but return time as nanoseconds.

New in version 3.7.




time.time_ns() → int¶
Similar to time() but returns time as an integer number of nanoseconds
since the epoch.

New in version 3.7.




time.tzset()¶
Reset the time conversion rules used by the library routines. The environment
variable TZ specifies how this is done. It will also set the variables
tzname (from the TZ environment variable), timezone (non-DST
seconds West of UTC), altzone (DST seconds west of UTC) and daylight
(to 0 if this timezone does not have any daylight saving time rules, or to
nonzero if there is a time, past, present or future when daylight saving time
applies).
Availability: Unix.

Note
Although in many cases, changing the TZ environment variable may
affect the output of functions like localtime() without calling
tzset(), this behavior should not be relied on.
The TZ environment variable should contain no whitespace.

The standard format of the TZ environment variable is (whitespace
added for clarity):
std offset [dst [offset [,start[/time], end[/time]]]]


Where the components are:

std and dst
Three or more alphanumerics giving the timezone abbreviations. These will be
propagated into time.tzname
offset
The offset has the form: ± hh[:mm[:ss]]. This indicates the value
added the local time to arrive at UTC.  If preceded by a ‘-‘, the timezone
is east of the Prime Meridian; otherwise, it is west. If no offset follows
dst, summer time is assumed to be one hour ahead of standard time.
start[/time], end[/time]
Indicates when to change to and back from DST. The format of the
start and end dates are one of the following:

Jn
The Julian day n (1 <= n <= 365). Leap days are not counted, so in
all years February 28 is day 59 and March 1 is day 60.
n
The zero-based Julian day (0 <= n <= 365). Leap days are counted, and
it is possible to refer to February 29.
Mm.n.d
The d’th day (0 <= d <= 6) of week n of month m of the year (1
<= n <= 5, 1 <= m <= 12, where week 5 means “the last d day in
month m” which may occur in either the fourth or the fifth
week). Week 1 is the first week in which the d’th day occurs. Day
zero is a Sunday.

time has the same format as offset except that no leading sign
(‘-‘ or ‘+’) is allowed. The default, if time is not given, is 02:00:00.


>>> os.environ['TZ'] = 'EST+05EDT,M4.1.0,M10.5.0'
>>> time.tzset()
>>> time.strftime('%X %x %Z')
'02:07:36 05/08/03 EDT'
>>> os.environ['TZ'] = 'AEST-10AEDT-11,M10.5.0,M3.5.0'
>>> time.tzset()
>>> time.strftime('%X %x %Z')
'16:08:12 05/08/03 AEST'


On many Unix systems (including *BSD, Linux, Solaris, and Darwin), it is more
convenient to use the system’s zoneinfo (tzfile(5))  database to
specify the timezone rules. To do this, set the  TZ environment
variable to the path of the required timezone  datafile, relative to the root of
the systems ‘zoneinfo’ timezone database, usually located at
/usr/share/zoneinfo. For example,  'US/Eastern',
'Australia/Melbourne', 'Egypt' or  'Europe/Amsterdam'.
>>> os.environ['TZ'] = 'US/Eastern'
>>> time.tzset()
>>> time.tzname
('EST', 'EDT')
>>> os.environ['TZ'] = 'Egypt'
>>> time.tzset()
>>> time.tzname
('EET', 'EEST')
