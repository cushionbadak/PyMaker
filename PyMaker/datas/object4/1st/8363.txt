doctest.DocTestSuite(module=None, globs=None, extraglobs=None, test_finder=None, setUp=None, tearDown=None, checker=None)Â¶
Convert doctest tests for a module to a unittest.TestSuite.
The returned unittest.TestSuite is to be run by the unittest framework
and runs each doctest in the module.  If any of the doctests fail, then the
synthesized unit test fails, and a failureException exception is raised
showing the name of the file containing the test and a (sometimes approximate)
line number.
Optional argument module provides the module to be tested.  It can be a module
object or a (possibly dotted) module name.  If not specified, the module calling
this function is used.
Optional argument globs is a dictionary containing the initial global
variables for the tests.  A new copy of this dictionary is created for each
test.  By default, globs is a new empty dictionary.
Optional argument extraglobs specifies an extra set of global variables, which
is merged into globs.  By default, no extra globals are used.
Optional argument test_finder is the DocTestFinder object (or a
drop-in replacement) that is used to extract doctests from the module.
Optional arguments setUp, tearDown, and optionflags are the same as for
function DocFileSuite() above.
This function uses the same search technique as testmod().

Changed in version 3.5: DocTestSuite() returns an empty unittest.TestSuite if module
contains no docstrings instead of raising ValueError.
