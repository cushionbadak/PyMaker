Browser Controller Objects¶
Browser controllers provide these methods which parallel three of the
module-level convenience functions:


controller.open(url, new=0, autoraise=True)¶
Display url using the browser handled by this controller. If new is 1, a new
browser window is opened if possible. If new is 2, a new browser page (“tab”)
is opened if possible.



controller.open_new(url)¶
Open url in a new window of the browser handled by this controller, if
possible, otherwise, open url in the only browser window.  Alias
open_new().



controller.open_new_tab(url)¶
Open url in a new page (“tab”) of the browser handled by this controller, if
possible, otherwise equivalent to open_new().
