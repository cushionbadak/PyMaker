<dd><p>Return true if all characters in the string are alphabetic and there is at least
one character, false otherwise.  Alphabetic characters are those characters defined
in the Unicode character database as “Letter”, i.e., those with general category
property being one of “Lm”, “Lt”, “Lu”, “Ll”, or “Lo”.  Note that this is different
from the “Alphabetic” property defined in the Unicode Standard.</p>
