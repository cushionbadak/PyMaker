addError(test, err)¶
Called when the test case test raises an unexpected exception. err is a
tuple of the form returned by sys.exc_info(): (type, value,
traceback).
The default implementation appends a tuple (test, formatted_err) to
the instance’s errors attribute, where formatted_err is a
formatted traceback derived from err.
