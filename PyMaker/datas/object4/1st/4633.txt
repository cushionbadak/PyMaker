result()¶
Return the result of the Task.
If the Task is done, the result of the wrapped coroutine
is returned (or if the coroutine raised an exception, that
exception is re-raised.)
If the Task has been cancelled, this method raises
a CancelledError exception.
If the Task’s result isn’t yet available, this method raises
a InvalidStateError exception.
