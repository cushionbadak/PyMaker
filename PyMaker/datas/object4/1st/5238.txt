<dd><p>Performs the SSL shutdown handshake, which removes the TLS layer from the
underlying socket, and returns the underlying socket object.  This can be
used to go from encrypted operation over a connection to unencrypted.  The
returned socket should always be used for further communication with the
other side of the connection, rather than the original socket.</p>
