socket.gethostbyname(hostname)Â¶
Translate a host name to IPv4 address format.  The IPv4 address is returned as a
string, such as  '100.50.200.5'.  If the host name is an IPv4 address itself
it is returned unchanged.  See gethostbyname_ex() for a more complete
interface. gethostbyname() does not support IPv6 name resolution, and
getaddrinfo() should be used instead for IPv4/v6 dual stack support.
