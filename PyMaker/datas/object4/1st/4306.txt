send_bytes(buffer[, offset[, size]])Â¶
Send byte data from a bytes-like object as a complete message.
If offset is given then data is read from that position in buffer.  If
size is given then that many bytes will be read from buffer.  Very large
buffers (approximately 32 MiB+, though it depends on the OS) may raise a
ValueError exception
