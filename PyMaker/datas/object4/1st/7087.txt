Telnet.expect(list, timeout=None)Â¶
Read until one from a list of a regular expressions matches.
The first argument is a list of regular expressions, either compiled
(regex objects) or uncompiled (byte strings). The
optional second argument is a timeout, in seconds; the default is to block
indefinitely.
Return a tuple of three items: the index in the list of the first regular
expression that matches; the match object returned; and the bytes read up
till and including the match.
If end of file is found and no bytes were read, raise EOFError.
Otherwise, when nothing matches, return (-1, None, data) where data is
the bytes received so far (may be empty bytes if a timeout happened).
If a regular expression ends with a greedy match (such as .*) or if more
than one expression can match the same input, the results are
non-deterministic, and may depend on the I/O timing.
