truncate(size=None)¶
Resize the stream to the given size in bytes (or the current position
if size is not specified).  The current stream position isn’t changed.
This resizing can extend or reduce the current file size.  In case of
extension, the contents of the new file area depend on the platform
(on most systems, additional bytes are zero-filled).  The new file size
is returned.

Changed in version 3.5: Windows will now zero-fill files when extending.
