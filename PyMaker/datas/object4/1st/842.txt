get_opcodes()Â¶
Return list of 5-tuples describing how to turn a into b. Each tuple is
of the form (tag, i1, i2, j1, j2).  The first tuple has i1 == j1 ==
0, and remaining tuples have i1 equal to the i2 from the preceding
tuple, and, likewise, j1 equal to the previous j2.
The tag values are strings, with these meanings:






Value
Meaning



'replace'
a[i1:i2] should be replaced by
b[j1:j2].

'delete'
a[i1:i2] should be deleted.  Note that
j1 == j2 in this case.

'insert'
b[j1:j2] should be inserted at
a[i1:i1]. Note that i1 == i2 in
this case.

'equal'
a[i1:i2] == b[j1:j2] (the sub-sequences
are equal).



For example:
>>> a = "qabxcd"
>>> b = "abycdf"
>>> s = SequenceMatcher(None, a, b)
>>> for tag, i1, i2, j1, j2 in s.get_opcodes():
...     print('{:7}   a[{}:{}] --> b[{}:{}] {!r:>8} --> {!r}'.format(
...         tag, i1, i2, j1, j2, a[i1:i2], b[j1:j2]))
delete    a[0:1] --> b[0:0]      'q' --> ''
equal     a[1:3] --> b[0:2]     'ab' --> 'ab'
replace   a[3:4] --> b[2:3]      'x' --> 'y'
equal     a[4:6] --> b[3:5]     'cd' --> 'cd'
insert    a[6:6] --> b[5:6]       '' --> 'f'
