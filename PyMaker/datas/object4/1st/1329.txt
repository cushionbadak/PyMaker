bisect.bisect_left(a, x, lo=0, hi=len(a))Â¶
Locate the insertion point for x in a to maintain sorted order.
The parameters lo and hi may be used to specify a subset of the list
which should be considered; by default the entire list is used.  If x is
already present in a, the insertion point will be before (to the left of)
any existing entries.  The return value is suitable for use as the first
parameter to list.insert() assuming that a is already sorted.
The returned insertion point i partitions the array a into two halves so
that all(val < x for val in a[lo:i]) for the left side and
all(val >= x for val in a[i:hi]) for the right side.
