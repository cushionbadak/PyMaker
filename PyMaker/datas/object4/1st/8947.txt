class pdb.Pdb(completekey='tab', stdin=None, stdout=None, skip=None, nosigint=False, readrc=True)¶
Pdb is the debugger class.
The completekey, stdin and stdout arguments are passed to the
underlying cmd.Cmd class; see the description there.
The skip argument, if given, must be an iterable of glob-style module name
patterns.  The debugger will not step into frames that originate in a module
that matches one of these patterns. [1]
By default, Pdb sets a handler for the SIGINT signal (which is sent when the
user presses Ctrl-C on the console) when you give a continue command.
This allows you to break into the debugger again by pressing Ctrl-C.  If you
want Pdb not to touch the SIGINT handler, set nosigint to true.
The readrc argument defaults to true and controls whether Pdb will load
.pdbrc files from the filesystem.
Example call to enable tracing with skip:
import pdb; pdb.Pdb(skip=['django.*']).set_trace()



New in version 3.1: The skip argument.


New in version 3.2: The nosigint argument.  Previously, a SIGINT handler was never set by
Pdb.


Changed in version 3.6: The readrc argument.
