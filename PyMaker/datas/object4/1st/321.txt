filter(function, iterable)Â¶
Construct an iterator from those elements of iterable for which function
returns true.  iterable may be either a sequence, a container which
supports iteration, or an iterator.  If function is None, the identity
function is assumed, that is, all elements of iterable that are false are
removed.
Note that filter(function, iterable) is equivalent to the generator
expression (item for item in iterable if function(item)) if function is
not None and (item for item in iterable if item) if function is
None.
See itertools.filterfalse() for the complementary function that returns
elements of iterable for which function returns false.
