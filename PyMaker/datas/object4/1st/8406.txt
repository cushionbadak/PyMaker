doctest.debug_src(src, pm=False, globs=None)Â¶
Debug the doctests in a string.
This is like function debug() above, except that a string containing
doctest examples is specified directly, via the src argument.
Optional argument pm has the same meaning as in function debug() above.
Optional argument globs gives a dictionary to use as both local and global
execution context.  If not specified, or None, an empty dictionary is used.
If specified, a shallow copy of the dictionary is used.
