inspect.isdatadescriptor(object)Â¶
Return true if the object is a data descriptor.
Data descriptors have both a __get__ and a __set__ method.
Examples are properties (defined in Python), getsets, and members.  The
latter two are defined in C and there are more specific tests available for
those types, which is robust across Python implementations.  Typically, data
descriptors will also have __name__ and __doc__ attributes
(properties, getsets, and members have both of these attributes), but this is
not guaranteed.
