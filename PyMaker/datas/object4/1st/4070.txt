class ctypes.WinDLL(name, mode=DEFAULT_MODE, handle=None, use_errno=False, use_last_error=False)Â¶
Windows only: Instances of this class represent loaded shared libraries,
functions in these libraries use the stdcall calling convention, and are
assumed to return int by default.
On Windows CE only the standard calling convention is used, for convenience the
WinDLL and OleDLL use the standard calling convention on this
platform.
