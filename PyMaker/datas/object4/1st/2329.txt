object.__setstate__(state)¶
Upon unpickling, if the class defines __setstate__(), it is called with
the unpickled state.  In that case, there is no requirement for the state
object to be a dictionary.  Otherwise, the pickled state must be a dictionary
and its items are assigned to the new instance’s dictionary.

Note
If __getstate__() returns a false value, the __setstate__()
method will not be called upon unpickling.
