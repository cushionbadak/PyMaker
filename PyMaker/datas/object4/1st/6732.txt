urllib.response — Response classes used by urllib¶
The urllib.response module defines functions and classes which define a
minimal file like interface, including read() and readline(). The
typical response object is an addinfourl instance, which defines an info()
method and that returns headers and a geturl() method that returns the url.
Functions defined by this module are used internally by the
urllib.request module.
