lastrowidÂ¶
This read-only attribute provides the rowid of the last modified row. It is
only set if you issued an INSERT or a REPLACE statement using the
execute() method.  For operations other than INSERT or
REPLACE or when executemany() is called, lastrowid is
set to None.
If the INSERT or REPLACE statement failed to insert the previous
successful rowid is returned.

Changed in version 3.6: Added support for the REPLACE statement.
