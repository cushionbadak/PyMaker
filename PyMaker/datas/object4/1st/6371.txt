XMLReader.parse(source)¶
Process an input source, producing SAX events. The source object can be a
system identifier (a string identifying the input source – typically a file
name or a URL), a file-like object, or an InputSource object. When
parse() returns, the input is completely processed, and the parser object
can be discarded or reset.

Changed in version 3.5: Added support of character streams.
