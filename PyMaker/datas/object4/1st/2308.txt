pickle.dump(obj, file, protocol=None, *, fix_imports=True)Â¶
Write a pickled representation of obj to the open file object file.
This is equivalent to Pickler(file, protocol).dump(obj).
The optional protocol argument, an integer, tells the pickler to use
the given protocol; supported protocols are 0 to HIGHEST_PROTOCOL.
If not specified, the default is DEFAULT_PROTOCOL.  If a negative
number is specified, HIGHEST_PROTOCOL is selected.
The file argument must have a write() method that accepts a single bytes
argument.  It can thus be an on-disk file opened for binary writing, an
io.BytesIO instance, or any other custom object that meets this
interface.
If fix_imports is true and protocol is less than 3, pickle will try to
map the new Python 3 names to the old module names used in Python 2, so
that the pickle data stream is readable with Python 2.
