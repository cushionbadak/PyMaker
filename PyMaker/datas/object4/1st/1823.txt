random.sample(population, k)Â¶
Return a k length list of unique elements chosen from the population sequence
or set. Used for random sampling without replacement.
Returns a new list containing elements from the population while leaving the
original population unchanged.  The resulting list is in selection order so that
all sub-slices will also be valid random samples.  This allows raffle winners
(the sample) to be partitioned into grand prize and second place winners (the
subslices).
Members of the population need not be hashable or unique.  If the population
contains repeats, then each occurrence is a possible selection in the sample.
To choose a sample from a range of integers, use a range() object as an
argument.  This is especially fast and space efficient for sampling from a large
population:  sample(range(10000000), k=60).
If the sample size is larger than the population size, a ValueError
is raised.
