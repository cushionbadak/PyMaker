NullHandler¶

New in version 3.1.

The NullHandler class, located in the core logging package,
does not do any formatting or output. It is essentially a ‘no-op’ handler
for use by library developers.


class logging.NullHandler¶
Returns a new instance of the NullHandler class.


emit(record)¶
This method does nothing.



handle(record)¶
This method does nothing.



createLock()¶
This method returns None for the lock, since there is no
underlying I/O to which access needs to be serialized.


See Configuring Logging for a Library for more information on how to use
NullHandler.
