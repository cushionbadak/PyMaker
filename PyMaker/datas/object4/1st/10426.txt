crypt.crypt(word, salt=None)¶
word will usually be a user’s password as typed at a prompt or  in a graphical
interface.  The optional salt is either a string as returned from
mksalt(), one of the crypt.METHOD_* values (though not all
may be available on all platforms), or a full encrypted password
including salt, as returned by this function.  If salt is not
provided, the strongest method will be used (as returned by
methods()).
Checking a password is usually done by passing the plain-text password
as word and the full results of a previous crypt() call,
which should be the same as the results of this call.
salt (either a random 2 or 16 character string, possibly prefixed with
$digit$ to indicate the method) which will be used to perturb the
encryption algorithm.  The characters in salt must be in the set
[./a-zA-Z0-9], with the exception of Modular Crypt Format which
prefixes a $digit$.
Returns the hashed password as a string, which will be composed of
characters from the same alphabet as the salt.
Since a few crypt(3) extensions allow different values, with
different sizes in the salt, it is recommended to use  the full crypted
password as salt when checking for a password.

Changed in version 3.3: Accept crypt.METHOD_* values in addition to strings for salt.
