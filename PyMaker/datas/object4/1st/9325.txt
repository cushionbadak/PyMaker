Default factory functionsÂ¶

If a field() specifies a default_factory, it is called with
zero arguments when a default value for the field is needed.  For
example, to create a new instance of a list, use:
mylist: list = field(default_factory=list)


If a field is excluded from __init__() (using init=False)
and the field also specifies default_factory, then the default
factory function will always be called from the generated
__init__() function.  This happens because there is no other
way to give the field an initial value.
