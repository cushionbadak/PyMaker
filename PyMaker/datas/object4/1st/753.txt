re.A¶

re.ASCII¶
Make \w, \W, \b, \B, \d, \D, \s and \S
perform ASCII-only matching instead of full Unicode matching.  This is only
meaningful for Unicode patterns, and is ignored for byte patterns.
Corresponds to the inline flag (?a).
Note that for backward compatibility, the re.U flag still
exists (as well as its synonym re.UNICODE and its embedded
counterpart (?u)), but these are redundant in Python 3 since
matches are Unicode by default for strings (and Unicode matching
isn’t allowed for bytes).
