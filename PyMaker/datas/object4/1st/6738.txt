urllib.parse.parse_qsl(qs, keep_blank_values=False, strict_parsing=False, encoding='utf-8', errors='replace', max_num_fields=None)Â¶
Parse a query string given as a string argument (data of type
application/x-www-form-urlencoded).  Data are returned as a list of
name, value pairs.
The optional argument keep_blank_values is a flag indicating whether blank
values in percent-encoded queries should be treated as blank strings. A true value
indicates that blanks should be retained as  blank strings.  The default false
value indicates that blank values are to be ignored and treated as if they were
not included.
The optional argument strict_parsing is a flag indicating what to do with
parsing errors.  If false (the default), errors are silently ignored.  If true,
errors raise a ValueError exception.
The optional encoding and errors parameters specify how to decode
percent-encoded sequences into Unicode characters, as accepted by the
bytes.decode() method.
The optional argument max_num_fields is the maximum number of fields to
read. If set, then throws a ValueError if there are more than
max_num_fields fields read.
Use the urllib.parse.urlencode() function to convert such lists of pairs into
query strings.

Changed in version 3.2: Add encoding and errors parameters.


Changed in version 3.7.2: Added max_num_fields parameter.
