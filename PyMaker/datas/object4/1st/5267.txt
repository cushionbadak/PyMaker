SSLContext.session_stats()Â¶
Get statistics about the SSL sessions created or managed by this context.
A dictionary is returned which maps the names of each piece of information to their
numeric values.  For example, here is the total number of hits and misses
in the session cache since the context was created:
>>> stats = context.session_stats()
>>> stats['hits'], stats['misses']
(0, 0)
