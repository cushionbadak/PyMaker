doctest.set_unittest_reportflags(flags)¶
Set the doctest reporting flags to use.
Argument flags takes the bitwise OR of option flags.  See
section Option Flags.  Only “reporting flags” can be used.
This is a module-global setting, and affects all future doctests run by module
unittest:  the runTest() method of DocTestCase looks at
the option flags specified for the test case when the DocTestCase
instance was constructed.  If no reporting flags were specified (which is the
typical and expected case), doctest’s unittest reporting flags are
bitwise ORed into the option flags, and the option flags
so augmented are passed to the DocTestRunner instance created to
run the doctest.  If any reporting flags were specified when the
DocTestCase instance was constructed, doctest’s
unittest reporting flags are ignored.
The value of the unittest reporting flags in effect before the function
was called is returned by the function.
