sys.__breakpointhook__¶

sys.__displayhook__¶

sys.__excepthook__¶
These objects contain the original values of breakpointhook,
displayhook, and excepthook at the start of the program.  They are
saved so that breakpointhook, displayhook and excepthook can be
restored in case they happen to get replaced with broken or alternative
objects.

New in version 3.7: __breakpointhook__
