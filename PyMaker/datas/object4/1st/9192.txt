sys.excepthook(type, value, traceback)Â¶
This function prints out a given traceback and exception to sys.stderr.
When an exception is raised and uncaught, the interpreter calls
sys.excepthook with three arguments, the exception class, exception
instance, and a traceback object.  In an interactive session this happens just
before control is returned to the prompt; in a Python program this happens just
before the program exits.  The handling of such top-level exceptions can be
customized by assigning another three-argument function to sys.excepthook.
