class wsgiref.simple_server.WSGIServer(server_address, RequestHandlerClass)¶
Create a WSGIServer instance.  server_address should be a
(host,port) tuple, and RequestHandlerClass should be the subclass of
http.server.BaseHTTPRequestHandler that will be used to process
requests.
You do not normally need to call this constructor, as the make_server()
function can handle all the details for you.
WSGIServer is a subclass of http.server.HTTPServer, so all
of its methods (such as serve_forever() and handle_request()) are
available. WSGIServer also provides these WSGI-specific methods:


set_app(application)¶
Sets the callable application as the WSGI application that will receive
requests.



get_app()¶
Returns the currently-set application callable.

Normally, however, you do not need to use these additional methods, as
set_app() is normally called by make_server(), and the
get_app() exists mainly for the benefit of request handler instances.
