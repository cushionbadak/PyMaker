Using Tix¶


class tkinter.tix.Tk(screenName=None, baseName=None, className='Tix')¶
Toplevel widget of Tix which represents mostly the main window of an
application. It has an associated Tcl interpreter.
Classes in the tkinter.tix module subclasses the classes in the
tkinter. The former imports the latter, so to use tkinter.tix
with Tkinter, all you need to do is to import one module. In general, you
can just import tkinter.tix, and replace the toplevel call to
tkinter.Tk with tix.Tk:
from tkinter import tix
from tkinter.constants import *
root = tix.Tk()



To use tkinter.tix, you must have the Tix widgets installed, usually
alongside your installation of the Tk widgets. To test your installation, try
the following:
from tkinter import tix
root = tix.Tk()
root.tk.eval('package require Tix')
