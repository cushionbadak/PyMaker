pkgutil.get_data(package, resource)Â¶
Get a resource from a package.
This is a wrapper for the loader
get_data API.  The
package argument should be the name of a package, in standard module format
(foo.bar).  The resource argument should be in the form of a relative
filename, using / as the path separator.  The parent directory name
.. is not allowed, and nor is a rooted name (starting with a /).
The function returns a binary string that is the contents of the specified
resource.
For packages located in the filesystem, which have already been imported,
this is the rough equivalent of:
d = os.path.dirname(sys.modules[package].__file__)
data = open(os.path.join(d, resource), 'rb').read()


If the package cannot be located or loaded, or it uses a loader
which does not support get_data,
then None is returned.  In particular, the loader for
namespace packages does not support
get_data.
