class http.server.ThreadingHTTPServer(server_address, RequestHandlerClass)Â¶
This class is identical to HTTPServer but uses threads to handle
requests by using the ThreadingMixIn. This
is useful to handle web browsers pre-opening sockets, on which
HTTPServer would wait indefinitely.

New in version 3.7.
