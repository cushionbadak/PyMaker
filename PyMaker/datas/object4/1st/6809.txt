docs:


HTTPConnection.getresponse()Â¶
Should be called after a request is sent to get the response from the server.
Returns an HTTPResponse instance.

Note
Note that you must have read the whole response before you can send a new
request to the server.


Changed in version 3.5: If a ConnectionError or subclass is raised, the
HTTPConnection object will be ready to reconnect when
a new request is sent.
