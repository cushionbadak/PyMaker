formatter.assert_line_data(flag=1)Â¶
Inform the formatter that data has been added to the current paragraph
out-of-band.  This should be used when the writer has been manipulated
directly.  The optional flag argument can be set to false if the writer
manipulations produced a hard line break at the end of the output.
