server_addressÂ¶
The address on which the server is listening.  The format of addresses varies
depending on the protocol family;
see the documentation for the socket module
for details.  For Internet protocols, this is a tuple containing a string giving
the address, and an integer port number: ('127.0.0.1', 80), for example.
