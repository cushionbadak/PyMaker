mapPriority(levelname)¶
Maps a logging level name to a syslog priority name.
You may need to override this if you are using custom levels, or
if the default algorithm is not suitable for your needs. The
default algorithm maps DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR and
CRITICAL to the equivalent syslog names, and all other level
names to ‘warning’.
