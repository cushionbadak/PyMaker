find_spec(fullname, path, target=None)Â¶
An abstract method for finding a spec for
the specified module.  If this is a top-level import, path will
be None.  Otherwise, this is a search for a subpackage or
module and path will be the value of __path__ from the
parent package. If a spec cannot be found, None is returned.
When passed in, target is a module object that the finder may
use to make a more educated guess about what spec to return.

New in version 3.4.
