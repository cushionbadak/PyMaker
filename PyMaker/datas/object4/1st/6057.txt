HTMLParser.get_starttag_text()¶
Return the text of the most recently opened start tag.  This should not normally
be needed for structured processing, but may be useful in dealing with HTML “as
deployed” or for re-generating input with minimal changes (whitespace between
attributes can be preserved, etc.).
