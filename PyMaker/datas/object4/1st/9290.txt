Warning Categories¶
There are a number of built-in exceptions that represent warning categories.
This categorization is useful to be able to filter out groups of warnings.
While these are technically
built-in exceptions, they are
documented here, because conceptually they belong to the warnings mechanism.
User code can define additional warning categories by subclassing one of the
standard warning categories.  A warning category must always be a subclass of
the Warning class.
The following warnings category classes are currently defined:






Class
Description



Warning
This is the base class of all warning
category classes.  It is a subclass of
Exception.

UserWarning
The default category for warn().

DeprecationWarning
Base category for warnings about deprecated
features when those warnings are intended for
other Python developers (ignored by default,
unless triggered by code in __main__).

SyntaxWarning
Base category for warnings about dubious
syntactic features.

RuntimeWarning
Base category for warnings about dubious
runtime features.

FutureWarning
Base category for warnings about deprecated
features when those warnings are intended for
end users of applications that are written in
Python.

PendingDeprecationWarning
Base category for warnings about features
that will be deprecated in the future
(ignored by default).

ImportWarning
Base category for warnings triggered during
the process of importing a module (ignored by
default).

UnicodeWarning
Base category for warnings related to
Unicode.

BytesWarning
Base category for warnings related to
bytes and bytearray.

ResourceWarning
Base category for warnings related to
resource usage.




Changed in version 3.7: Previously DeprecationWarning and FutureWarning were
distinguished based on whether a feature was being removed entirely or
changing its behaviour. They are now distinguished based on their
intended audience and the way they’re handled by the default warnings
filters.
