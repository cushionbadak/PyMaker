time.time() → float¶
Return the time in seconds since the epoch as a floating point
number. The specific date of the epoch and the handling of
leap seconds is platform dependent.
On Windows and most Unix systems, the epoch is January 1, 1970,
00:00:00 (UTC) and leap seconds are not counted towards the time
in seconds since the epoch. This is commonly referred to as
Unix time.
To find out what the epoch is on a given platform, look at
gmtime(0).
Note that even though the time is always returned as a floating point
number, not all systems provide time with a better precision than 1 second.
While this function normally returns non-decreasing values, it can return a
lower value than a previous call if the system clock has been set back
between the two calls.
The number returned by time() may be converted into a more common
time format (i.e. year, month, day, hour, etc…) in UTC by passing it to
gmtime() function or in local time by passing it to the
localtime() function. In both cases a
struct_time object is returned, from which the components
of the calendar date may be accessed as attributes.
