@typing.type_check_onlyÂ¶
Decorator to mark a class or function to be unavailable at runtime.
This decorator is itself not available at runtime. It is mainly
intended to mark classes that are defined in type stub files if
an implementation returns an instance of a private class:
@type_check_only
class Response:  # private or not available at runtime
    code: int
    def get_header(self, name: str) -> str: ...

def fetch_response() -> Response: ...


Note that returning instances of private classes is not recommended.
It is usually preferable to make such classes public.
