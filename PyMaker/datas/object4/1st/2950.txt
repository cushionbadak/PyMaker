File Object Creation¶
This function creates new file objects.  (See also
open() for opening file descriptors.)


os.fdopen(fd, *args, **kwargs)¶
Return an open file object connected to the file descriptor fd.  This is an
alias of the open() built-in function and accepts the same arguments.
The only difference is that the first argument of fdopen() must always
be an integer.
