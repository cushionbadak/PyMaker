Wave_read Objects¶
Wave_read objects, as returned by open(), have the following methods:


Wave_read.close()¶
Close the stream if it was opened by wave, and make the instance
unusable.  This is called automatically on object collection.



Wave_read.getnchannels()¶
Returns number of audio channels (1 for mono, 2 for stereo).



Wave_read.getsampwidth()¶
Returns sample width in bytes.



Wave_read.getframerate()¶
Returns sampling frequency.



Wave_read.getnframes()¶
Returns number of audio frames.



Wave_read.getcomptype()¶
Returns compression type ('NONE' is the only supported type).



Wave_read.getcompname()¶
Human-readable version of getcomptype(). Usually 'not compressed'
parallels 'NONE'.



Wave_read.getparams()¶
Returns a namedtuple() (nchannels, sampwidth,
framerate, nframes, comptype, compname), equivalent to output of the
get*() methods.



Wave_read.readframes(n)¶
Reads and returns at most n frames of audio, as a bytes object.



Wave_read.rewind()¶
Rewind the file pointer to the beginning of the audio stream.

The following two methods are defined for compatibility with the aifc
module, and don’t do anything interesting.


Wave_read.getmarkers()¶
Returns None.



Wave_read.getmark(id)¶
Raise an error.

The following two methods define a term “position” which is compatible between
them, and is otherwise implementation dependent.


Wave_read.setpos(pos)¶
Set the file pointer to the specified position.



Wave_read.tell()¶
Return current file pointer position.
