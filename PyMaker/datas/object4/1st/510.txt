bytes.rstrip([chars])¶

bytearray.rstrip([chars])¶
Return a copy of the sequence with specified trailing bytes removed.  The
chars argument is a binary sequence specifying the set of byte values to
be removed - the name refers to the fact this method is usually used with
ASCII characters.  If omitted or None, the chars argument defaults to
removing ASCII whitespace.  The chars argument is not a suffix; rather,
all combinations of its values are stripped:
>>> b'   spacious   '.rstrip()
b'   spacious'
>>> b'mississippi'.rstrip(b'ipz')
b'mississ'


The binary sequence of byte values to remove may be any
bytes-like object.

Note
The bytearray version of this method does not operate in place -
it always produces a new object, even if no changes were made.
