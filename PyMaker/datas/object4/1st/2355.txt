marshal.dump(value, file[, version])¶
Write the value on the open file.  The value must be a supported type.  The
file must be a writeable binary file.
If the value has (or contains an object that has) an unsupported type, a
ValueError exception is raised — but garbage data will also be written
to the file.  The object will not be properly read back by load().
The version argument indicates the data format that dump should use
(see below).
