urllib.parse.urlunparse(parts)Â¶
Construct a URL from a tuple as returned by urlparse(). The parts
argument can be any six-item iterable. This may result in a slightly
different, but equivalent URL, if the URL that was parsed originally had
unnecessary delimiters (for example, a ? with an empty query; the RFC
states that these are equivalent).
