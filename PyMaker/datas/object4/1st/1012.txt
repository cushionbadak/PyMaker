codecs.register_error(name, error_handler)Â¶
Register the error handling function error_handler under the name name.
The error_handler argument will be called during encoding and decoding
in case of an error, when name is specified as the errors parameter.
For encoding, error_handler will be called with a UnicodeEncodeError
instance, which contains information about the location of the error. The
error handler must either raise this or a different exception, or return a
tuple with a replacement for the unencodable part of the input and a position
where encoding should continue. The replacement may be either str or
bytes.  If the replacement is bytes, the encoder will simply copy
them into the output buffer. If the replacement is a string, the encoder will
encode the replacement.  Encoding continues on original input at the
specified position. Negative position values will be treated as being
relative to the end of the input string. If the resulting position is out of
bound an IndexError will be raised.
Decoding and translating works similarly, except UnicodeDecodeError or
UnicodeTranslateError will be passed to the handler and that the
replacement from the error handler will be put into the output directly.
