urllib.parse.quote_plus(string, safe='', encoding=None, errors=None)¶
Like quote(), but also replace spaces by plus signs, as required for
quoting HTML form values when building up a query string to go into a URL.
Plus signs in the original string are escaped unless they are included in
safe.  It also does not have safe default to '/'.
Example: quote_plus('/El Niño/') yields '%2FEl+Ni%C3%B1o%2F'.
