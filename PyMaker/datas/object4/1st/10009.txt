dis.get_instructions(x, *, first_line=None)Â¶
Return an iterator over the instructions in the supplied function, method,
source code string or code object.
The iterator generates a series of Instruction named tuples giving
the details of each operation in the supplied code.
If first_line is not None, it indicates the line number that should be
reported for the first source line in the disassembled code.  Otherwise, the
source line information (if any) is taken directly from the disassembled code
object.

New in version 3.4.
