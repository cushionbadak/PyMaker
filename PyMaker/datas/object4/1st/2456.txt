Using shortcut methods¶
Using the nonstandard execute(), executemany() and
executescript() methods of the Connection object, your code can
be written more concisely because you don’t have to create the (often
superfluous) Cursor objects explicitly. Instead, the Cursor
objects are created implicitly and these shortcut methods return the cursor
objects. This way, you can execute a SELECT statement and iterate over it
directly using only a single call on the Connection object.
import sqlite3

persons = [
    ("Hugo", "Boss"),
    ("Calvin", "Klein")
    ]

con = sqlite3.connect(":memory:")

# Create the table
con.execute("create table person(firstname, lastname)")

# Fill the table
con.executemany("insert into person(firstname, lastname) values (?, ?)", persons)

# Print the table contents
for row in con.execute("select firstname, lastname from person"):
    print(row)

print("I just deleted", con.execute("delete from person").rowcount, "rows")
