class email.mime.base.MIMEBase(_maintype, _subtype, *, policy=compat32, **_params)¶
Module: email.mime.base
This is the base class for all the MIME-specific subclasses of
Message.  Ordinarily you won’t create instances
specifically of MIMEBase, although you could.  MIMEBase
is provided primarily as a convenient base class for more specific
MIME-aware subclasses.
_maintype is the Content-Type major type (e.g. text
or image), and _subtype is the Content-Type minor
type  (e.g. plain or gif).  _params is a parameter
key/value dictionary and is passed directly to Message.add_header.
If policy is specified, (defaults to the
compat32 policy) it will be passed to
Message.
The MIMEBase class always adds a Content-Type header
(based on _maintype, _subtype, and _params), and a
MIME-Version header (always set to 1.0).

Changed in version 3.6: Added policy keyword-only parameter.
