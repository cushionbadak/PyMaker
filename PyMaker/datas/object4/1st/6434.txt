xmlparser.ordered_attributesÂ¶
Setting this attribute to a non-zero integer causes the attributes to be
reported as a list rather than a dictionary.  The attributes are presented in
the order found in the document text.  For each attribute, two list entries are
presented: the attribute name and the attribute value.  (Older versions of this
module also used this format.)  By default, this attribute is false; it may be
changed at any time.
