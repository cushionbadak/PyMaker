random.shuffle(x[, random])Â¶
Shuffle the sequence x in place.
The optional argument random is a 0-argument function returning a random
float in [0.0, 1.0); by default, this is the function random().
To shuffle an immutable sequence and return a new shuffled list, use
sample(x, k=len(x)) instead.
Note that even for small len(x), the total number of permutations of x
can quickly grow larger than the period of most random number generators.
This implies that most permutations of a long sequence can never be
generated.  For example, a sequence of length 2080 is the largest that
can fit within the period of the Mersenne Twister random number generator.
