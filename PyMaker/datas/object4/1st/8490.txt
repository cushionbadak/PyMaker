maxDiffÂ¶
This attribute controls the maximum length of diffs output by assert
methods that report diffs on failure. It defaults to 80*8 characters.
Assert methods affected by this attribute are
assertSequenceEqual() (including all the sequence comparison
methods that delegate to it), assertDictEqual() and
assertMultiLineEqual().
Setting maxDiff to None means that there is no maximum length of
diffs.

New in version 3.2.
