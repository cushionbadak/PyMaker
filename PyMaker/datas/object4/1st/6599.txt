log_exception(exc_info)¶
Log the exc_info tuple in the server log.  exc_info is a (type, value,
traceback) tuple.  The default implementation simply writes the traceback to
the request’s wsgi.errors stream and flushes it.  Subclasses can override
this method to change the format or retarget the output, mail the traceback to
an administrator, or whatever other action may be deemed suitable.
