ComparisonsÂ¶
Enumeration members are compared by identity:
>>> Color.RED is Color.RED
True
>>> Color.RED is Color.BLUE
False
>>> Color.RED is not Color.BLUE
True


Ordered comparisons between enumeration values are not supported.  Enum
members are not integers (but see IntEnum below):
>>> Color.RED < Color.BLUE
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'Color' and 'Color'


Equality comparisons are defined though:
>>> Color.BLUE == Color.RED
False
>>> Color.BLUE != Color.RED
True
>>> Color.BLUE == Color.BLUE
True


Comparisons against non-enumeration values will always compare not equal
(again, IntEnum was explicitly designed to behave differently, see
below):
>>> Color.BLUE == 2
False
