gettext.ngettext(singular, plural, n)Â¶
Like gettext(), but consider plural forms. If a translation is found,
apply the plural formula to n, and return the resulting message (some
languages have more than two plural forms). If no translation is found, return
singular if n is 1; return plural otherwise.
The Plural formula is taken from the catalog header. It is a C or Python
expression that has a free variable n; the expression evaluates to the index
of the plural in the catalog. See
the GNU gettext documentation
for the precise syntax to be used in .po files and the
formulas for a variety of languages.
