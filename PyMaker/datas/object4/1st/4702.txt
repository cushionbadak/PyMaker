BoundedSemaphore¶


class asyncio.BoundedSemaphore(value=1, *, loop=None)¶
A bounded semaphore object.  Not thread-safe.
Bounded Semaphore is a version of Semaphore that raises
a ValueError in release() if it
increases the internal counter above the initial value.



Deprecated since version 3.7: Acquiring a lock using await lock or yield from lock and/or
with statement (with await lock, with (yield from
lock)) is deprecated.  Use async with lock instead.
