from_buffer(source[, offset])Â¶
This method returns a ctypes instance that shares the buffer of the
source object.  The source object must support the writeable buffer
interface.  The optional offset parameter specifies an offset into the
source buffer in bytes; the default is zero.  If the source buffer is not
large enough a ValueError is raised.
