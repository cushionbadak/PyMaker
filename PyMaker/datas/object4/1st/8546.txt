class unittest.TextTestRunner(stream=None, descriptions=True, verbosity=1, failfast=False, buffer=False, resultclass=None, warnings=None, *, tb_locals=False)¶
A basic test runner implementation that outputs results to a stream. If stream
is None, the default, sys.stderr is used as the output stream. This class
has a few configurable parameters, but is essentially very simple.  Graphical
applications which run test suites should provide alternate implementations. Such
implementations should accept **kwargs as the interface to construct runners
changes when features are added to unittest.
By default this runner shows DeprecationWarning,
PendingDeprecationWarning, ResourceWarning and
ImportWarning even if they are ignored by default. Deprecation warnings caused by deprecated unittest
methods are also special-cased and, when the warning
filters are 'default' or 'always', they will appear only once
per-module, in order to avoid too many warning messages.  This behavior can
be overridden using Python’s -Wd or -Wa options
(see Warning control) and leaving
warnings to None.

Changed in version 3.2: Added the warnings argument.


Changed in version 3.2: The default stream is set to sys.stderr at instantiation time rather
than import time.


Changed in version 3.5: Added the tb_locals parameter.



_makeResult()¶
This method returns the instance of TestResult used by run().
It is not intended to be called directly, but can be overridden in
subclasses to provide a custom TestResult.
_makeResult() instantiates the class or callable passed in the
TextTestRunner constructor as the resultclass argument. It
defaults to TextTestResult if no resultclass is provided.
The result class is instantiated with the following arguments:
stream, descriptions, verbosity





run(test)¶
This method is the main public interface to the TextTestRunner. This
method takes a TestSuite or TestCase instance. A
TestResult is created by calling
_makeResult() and the test(s) are run and the
results printed to stdout.
