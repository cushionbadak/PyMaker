os.fpathconf(fd, name)Â¶
Return system configuration information relevant to an open file. name
specifies the configuration value to retrieve; it may be a string which is the
name of a defined system value; these names are specified in a number of
standards (POSIX.1, Unix 95, Unix 98, and others).  Some platforms define
additional names as well.  The names known to the host operating system are
given in the pathconf_names dictionary.  For configuration variables not
included in that mapping, passing an integer for name is also accepted.
If name is a string and is not known, ValueError is raised.  If a
specific value for name is not supported by the host system, even if it is
included in pathconf_names, an OSError is raised with
errno.EINVAL for the error number.
As of Python 3.3, this is equivalent to os.pathconf(fd, name).
Availability: Unix.
