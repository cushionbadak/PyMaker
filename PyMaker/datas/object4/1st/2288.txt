shutil.unpack_archive(filename[, extract_dir[, format]])¶
Unpack an archive. filename is the full path of the archive.
extract_dir is the name of the target directory where the archive is
unpacked. If not provided, the current working directory is used.
format is the archive format: one of “zip”, “tar”, “gztar”, “bztar”, or
“xztar”.  Or any other format registered with
register_unpack_format().  If not provided, unpack_archive()
will use the archive file name extension and see if an unpacker was
registered for that extension.  In case none is found,
a ValueError is raised.

Changed in version 3.7: Accepts a path-like object for filename and extract_dir.
