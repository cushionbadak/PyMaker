fold(*, policy)Â¶
Return a string containing linesep
characters as required to correctly fold the header according to
policy.  A cte_type of 8bit will be
treated as if it were 7bit, since headers may not contain arbitrary
binary data.  If utf8 is False,
non-ASCII data will be RFC 2047 encoded.
