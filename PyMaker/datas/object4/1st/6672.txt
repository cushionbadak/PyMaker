BaseHandler.unknown_open(req)Â¶
This method is not defined in BaseHandler, but subclasses should
define it if they want to catch all URLs with no specific registered handler to
open it.
This method, if implemented, will be called by the parent
OpenerDirector.  Return values should be the same as for
default_open().
