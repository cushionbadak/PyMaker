codecs.register(search_function)Â¶
Register a codec search function. Search functions are expected to take one
argument, being the encoding name in all lower case letters, and return a
CodecInfo object. In case a search function cannot find
a given encoding, it should return None.

Note
Search function registration is not currently reversible,
which may cause problems in some cases, such as unit testing or
module reloading.
