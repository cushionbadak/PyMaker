devpoll.poll([timeout])¶
Polls the set of registered file descriptors, and returns a possibly-empty list
containing (fd, event) 2-tuples for the descriptors that have events or
errors to report. fd is the file descriptor, and event is a bitmask with
bits set for the reported events for that descriptor — POLLIN for
waiting input, POLLOUT to indicate that the descriptor can be written
to, and so forth. An empty list indicates that the call timed out and no file
descriptors had any events to report. If timeout is given, it specifies the
length of time in milliseconds which the system will wait for events before
returning. If timeout is omitted, -1, or None, the call will
block until there is an event for this poll object.

Changed in version 3.5: The function is now retried with a recomputed timeout when interrupted by
a signal, except if the signal handler raises an exception (see
PEP 475 for the rationale), instead of raising
InterruptedError.
