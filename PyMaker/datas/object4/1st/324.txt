getattr(object, name[, default])¶
Return the value of the named attribute of object.  name must be a string.
If the string is the name of one of the object’s attributes, the result is the
value of that attribute.  For example, getattr(x, 'foobar') is equivalent to
x.foobar.  If the named attribute does not exist, default is returned if
provided, otherwise AttributeError is raised.
