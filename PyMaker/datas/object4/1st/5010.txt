exception socket.gaierrorÂ¶
A subclass of OSError, this exception is raised for
address-related errors by getaddrinfo() and getnameinfo().
The accompanying value is a pair (error, string) representing an error
returned by a library call.  string represents the description of
error, as returned by the gai_strerror() C function.  The
numeric error value will match one of the EAI_* constants
defined in this module.

Changed in version 3.3: This class was made a subclass of OSError.
