class bool([x])¶
Return a Boolean value, i.e. one of True or False.  x is converted
using the standard truth testing procedure.  If x is false
or omitted, this returns False; otherwise it returns True.  The
bool class is a subclass of int (see Numeric Types — int, float, complex).
It cannot be subclassed further.  Its only instances are False and
True (see Boolean Values).

Changed in version 3.7: x is now a positional-only parameter.
