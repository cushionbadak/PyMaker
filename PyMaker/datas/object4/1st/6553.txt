cgitb.handler(info=None)¶
This function handles an exception using the default settings (that is, show a
report in the browser, but don’t log to a file). This can be used when you’ve
caught an exception and want to report it using cgitb.  The optional
info argument should be a 3-tuple containing an exception type, exception
value, and traceback object, exactly like the tuple returned by
sys.exc_info().  If the info argument is not supplied, the current
exception is obtained from sys.exc_info().
