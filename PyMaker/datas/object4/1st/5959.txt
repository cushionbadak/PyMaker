mimetypes.guess_type(url, strict=True)¶
Guess the type of a file based on its filename or URL, given by url.  The
return value is a tuple (type, encoding) where type is None if the
type can’t be guessed (missing or unknown suffix) or a string of the form
'type/subtype', usable for a MIME content-type header.
encoding is None for no encoding or the name of the program used to encode
(e.g. compress or gzip). The encoding is suitable for use
as a Content-Encoding header, not as a
Content-Transfer-Encoding header. The mappings are table driven.
Encoding suffixes are case sensitive; type suffixes are first tried case
sensitively, then case insensitively.
The optional strict argument is a flag specifying whether the list of known MIME types
is limited to only the official types registered with IANA.
When strict is True (the default), only the IANA types are supported; when
strict is False, some additional non-standard but commonly used MIME types
are also recognized.
