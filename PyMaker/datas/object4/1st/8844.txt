class test.support.EnvironmentVarGuardÂ¶
Class used to temporarily set or unset environment variables.  Instances can
be used as a context manager and have a complete dictionary interface for
querying/modifying the underlying os.environ. After exit from the
context manager all changes to environment variables done through this
instance will be rolled back.

Changed in version 3.1: Added dictionary interface.
