signal.signal(signalnum, handler)Â¶
Set the handler for signal signalnum to the function handler.  handler can
be a callable Python object taking two arguments (see below), or one of the
special values signal.SIG_IGN or signal.SIG_DFL.  The previous
signal handler will be returned (see the description of getsignal()
above).  (See the Unix man page signal(2).)
When threads are enabled, this function can only be called from the main thread;
attempting to call it from other threads will cause a ValueError
exception to be raised.
The handler is called with two arguments: the signal number and the current
stack frame (None or a frame object; for a description of frame objects,
see the description in the type hierarchy or see the
attribute descriptions in the inspect module).
On Windows, signal() can only be called with SIGABRT,
SIGFPE, SIGILL, SIGINT, SIGSEGV,
SIGTERM, or SIGBREAK.
A ValueError will be raised in any other case.
Note that not all systems define the same set of signal names; an
AttributeError will be raised if a signal name is not defined as
SIG* module level constant.
