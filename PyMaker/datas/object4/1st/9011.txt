print_callers(*restrictions)Â¶
This method for the Stats class prints a list of all functions
that called each function in the profiled database.  The ordering is
identical to that provided by print_stats(), and the
definition of the restricting argument is also identical.  Each caller is
reported on its own line.  The format differs slightly depending on the
profiler that produced the stats:

With profile, a number is shown in parentheses after each caller
to show how many times this specific call was made.  For convenience, a
second non-parenthesized number repeats the cumulative time spent in the
function at the right.
With cProfile, each caller is preceded by three numbers: the
number of times this specific call was made, and the total and
cumulative times spent in the current function while it was invoked by
this specific caller.
