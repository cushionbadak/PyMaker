which relative positions the
'thousands_sep' is
expected.  If the sequence is
terminated with
CHAR_MAX, no further
grouping is performed. If the
sequence terminates with a
0,  the last group size is
repeatedly used.

 
'thousands_sep'
Character used between groups.

LC_MONETARY
'int_curr_symbol'
International currency symbol.

 
'currency_symbol'
Local currency symbol.

 
'p_cs_precedes/n_cs_precedes'
Whether the currency symbol
precedes the value (for
positive resp. negative
values).

 
'p_sep_by_space/n_sep_by_space'
Whether the currency symbol is
separated from the value  by a
space (for positive resp.
negative values).

 
'mon_decimal_point'

monetary values.

 
'frac_digits'
Number of fractional digits
used in local formatting of
monetary values.

 
'int_frac_digits'

formatting of monetary values.

 
'mon_thousands_sep'

monetary values.

 
'mon_grouping'
Equivalent to 'grouping',
used for monetary values.

 
'positive_sign'
Symbol used to annotate a
positive monetary value.

 
'negative_sign'
Symbol used to annotate a
negative monetary value.

 
'p_sign_posn/n_sign_posn'
The position of the sign (for
positive resp. negative
values), see below.



All numeric values can be set to CHAR_MAX to indicate that there is no
value specified in this locale.
The possible values for 'p_sign_posn' and 'n_sign_posn' are given below.






Value
Explanation



0
Currency and value are surrounded by
parentheses.

1
The sign should precede the value and
currency symbol.

2
The sign should follow the value and
currency symbol.

3
The sign should immediately precede the
value.

4
The sign should immediately follow the
value.

CHAR_MAX
Nothing is specified in this locale.



The function sets temporarily the LC_CTYPE locale to the LC_NUMERIC
locale or the LC_MONETARY locale if locales are different and numeric or
monetary strings are non-ASCII. This temporary change affects other threads.

Changed in version 3.7: The function now sets temporarily the LC_CTYPE locale to the
LC_NUMERIC locale in some cases.
