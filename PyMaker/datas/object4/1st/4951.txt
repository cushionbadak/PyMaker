The following functions can be used to get and set the policy
for the current process:


asyncio.get_event_loop_policy()¶
Return the current process-wide policy.



asyncio.set_event_loop_policy(policy)¶
Set the current process-wide policy to policy.
If policy is set to None, the default policy is restored.
