FTP.retrlines(cmd, callback=None)Â¶
Retrieve a file or directory listing in ASCII transfer mode.  cmd should be
an appropriate RETR command (see retrbinary()) or a command such as
LIST or NLST (usually just the string 'LIST').
LIST retrieves a list of files and information about those files.
NLST retrieves a list of file names.
The callback function is called for each line with a string argument
containing the line with the trailing CRLF stripped.  The default callback
prints the line to sys.stdout.
