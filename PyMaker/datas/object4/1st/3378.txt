class time.struct_timeÂ¶
The type of the time value sequence returned by gmtime(),
localtime(), and strptime().  It is an object with a named
tuple interface: values can be accessed by index and by attribute name.  The
following values are present:







Index
Attribute
Values



0
tm_year
(for example, 1993)

1
tm_mon
range [1, 12]

2
tm_mday
range [1, 31]

3
tm_hour
range [0, 23]

4
tm_min
range [0, 59]

5
tm_sec
range [0, 61]; see (2) in
strftime() description

6
tm_wday
range [0, 6], Monday is 0

7
tm_yday
range [1, 366]

8
tm_isdst
0, 1 or -1; see below

N/A
tm_zone
abbreviation of timezone name

N/A
tm_gmtoff
offset east of UTC in seconds



Note that unlike the C structure, the month value is a range of [1, 12], not
[0, 11].
In calls to mktime(), tm_isdst may be set to 1 when daylight
savings time is in effect, and 0 when it is not.  A value of -1 indicates that
this is not known, and will usually result in the correct state being filled in.
When a tuple with an incorrect length is passed to a function expecting a
struct_time, or having elements of the wrong type, a
TypeError is raised.
