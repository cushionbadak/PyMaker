docs:


is_symlink()¶
Return True if this entry is a symbolic link (even if broken);
return False if the entry points to a directory or any kind of file,
or if it doesn’t exist anymore.
The result is cached on the os.DirEntry object. Call
os.path.islink() to fetch up-to-date information.
On the first, uncached call, no system call is required in most cases.
Specifically, neither Windows or Unix require a system call, except on
certain Unix file systems, such as network file systems, that return
dirent.d_type == DT_UNKNOWN.
This method can raise OSError, such as PermissionError,
but FileNotFoundError is caught and not raised.
