logging.getLoggerClass()Â¶
Return either the standard Logger class, or the last class passed to
setLoggerClass(). This function may be called from within a new class
definition, to ensure that installing a customized Logger class will
not undo customizations already applied by other code. For example:
class MyLogger(logging.getLoggerClass()):
    # ... override behaviour here
