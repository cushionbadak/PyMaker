docs:


detach()Â¶
Separate the underlying binary buffer from the TextIOBase and
return it.
After the underlying buffer has been detached, the TextIOBase is
in an unusable state.
Some TextIOBase implementations, like StringIO, may not
have the concept of an underlying buffer and calling this method will
raise UnsupportedOperation.

New in version 3.1.
