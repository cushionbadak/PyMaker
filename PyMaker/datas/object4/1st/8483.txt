assertListEqual(first, second, msg=None)¶

assertTupleEqual(first, second, msg=None)¶
Tests that two lists or tuples are equal.  If not, an error message is
constructed that shows only the differences between the two.  An error
is also raised if either of the parameters are of the wrong type.
These methods are used by default when comparing lists or tuples with
assertEqual().

New in version 3.1.
