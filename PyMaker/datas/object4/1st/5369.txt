abstractmethod select(timeout=None)¶
Wait until some registered file objects become ready, or the timeout
expires.
If timeout > 0, this specifies the maximum wait time, in seconds.
If timeout <= 0, the call won’t block, and will report the currently
ready file objects.
If timeout is None, the call will block until a monitored file object
becomes ready.
This returns a list of (key, events) tuples, one for each ready file
object.
key is the SelectorKey instance corresponding to a ready file
object.
events is a bitmask of events ready on this file object.

Note
This method can return before any file object becomes ready or the
timeout has elapsed if the current process receives a signal: in this
case, an empty list will be returned.


Changed in version 3.5: The selector is now retried with a recomputed timeout when interrupted
by a signal if the signal handler did not raise an exception (see
PEP 475 for the rationale), instead of returning an empty list
of events before the timeout.
