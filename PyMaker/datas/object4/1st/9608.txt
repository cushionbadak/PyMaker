pkgutil.iter_importers(fullname='')¶
Yield finder objects for the given module name.
If fullname contains a ‘.’, the finders will be for the package
containing fullname, otherwise they will be all registered top level
finders (i.e. those on both sys.meta_path and sys.path_hooks).
If the named module is in a package, that package is imported as a side
effect of invoking this function.
If no module name is specified, all top level finders are produced.

Changed in version 3.3: Updated to be based directly on importlib rather than relying
on the package internal PEP 302 import emulation.
