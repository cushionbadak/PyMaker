exception email.errors.MultipartConversionError¶
Raised when a payload is added to a Message object
using add_payload(), but the payload is already a scalar and the
message’s Content-Type main type is not either
multipart or missing.  MultipartConversionError multiply
inherits from MessageError and the built-in TypeError.
Since Message.add_payload() is deprecated, this exception is rarely
raised in practice.  However the exception may also be raised if the
attach()
method is called on an instance of a class derived from
MIMENonMultipart (e.g.
MIMEImage).
