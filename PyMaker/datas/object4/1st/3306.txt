read1([size])¶
Read and return up to size bytes, with at most one call to the
underlying raw stream’s read() (or
readinto()) method.  This can be useful if you are
implementing your own buffering on top of a BufferedIOBase
object.
If size is -1 (the default), an arbitrary number of bytes are
returned (more than zero unless EOF is reached).
