asyncore.loop([timeout[, use_poll[, map[, count]]]])Â¶
Enter a polling loop that terminates after count passes or all open
channels have been closed.  All arguments are optional.  The count
parameter defaults to None, resulting in the loop terminating only when all
channels have been closed.  The timeout argument sets the timeout
parameter for the appropriate select() or poll()
call, measured in seconds; the default is 30 seconds.  The use_poll
parameter, if true, indicates that poll() should be used in
preference to select() (the default is False).
The map parameter is a dictionary whose items are the channels to watch.
As channels are closed they are deleted from their map.  If map is
omitted, a global map is used. Channels (instances of
asyncore.dispatcher, asynchat.async_chat and subclasses
thereof) can freely be mixed in the map.
