parse(format_string)Â¶
Loop over the format_string and return an iterable of tuples
(literal_text, field_name, format_spec, conversion).  This is used
by vformat() to break the string into either literal text, or
replacement fields.
The values in the tuple conceptually represent a span of literal text
followed by a single replacement field.  If there is no literal text
(which can happen if two replacement fields occur consecutively), then
literal_text will be a zero-length string.  If there is no replacement
field, then the values of field_name, format_spec and conversion
will be None.
