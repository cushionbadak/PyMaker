audioop.lin2lin(fragment, width, newwidth)Â¶
Convert samples between 1-, 2-, 3- and 4-byte formats.

Note
In some audio formats, such as .WAV files, 16, 24 and 32 bit samples are
signed, but 8 bit samples are unsigned.  So when converting to 8 bit wide
samples for these formats, you need to also add 128 to the result:
new_frames = audioop.lin2lin(frames, old_width, 1)
new_frames = audioop.bias(new_frames, 1, 128)


The same, in reverse, has to be applied when converting from 8 to 16, 24
or 32 bit width samples.
