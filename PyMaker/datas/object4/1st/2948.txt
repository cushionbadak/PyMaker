os.uname()Â¶
Returns information identifying the current operating system.
The return value is an object with five attributes:

sysname - operating system name
nodename - name of machine on network (implementation-defined)
release - operating system release
version - operating system version
machine - hardware identifier

For backwards compatibility, this object is also iterable, behaving
like a five-tuple containing sysname, nodename,
release, version, and machine
in that order.
Some systems truncate nodename to 8 characters or to the
leading component; a better way to get the hostname is
socket.gethostname()  or even
socket.gethostbyaddr(socket.gethostname()).
Availability: recent flavors of Unix.

Changed in version 3.3: Return type changed from a tuple to a tuple-like object
with named attributes.
