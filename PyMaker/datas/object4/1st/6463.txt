xmlparser.ExternalEntityRefHandler(context, base, systemId, publicId)Â¶
Called for references to external entities.  base is the current base, as set
by a previous call to SetBase().  The public and system identifiers,
systemId and publicId, are strings if given; if the public identifier is not
given, publicId will be None.  The context value is opaque and should
only be used as described below.
For external entities to be parsed, this handler must be implemented. It is
responsible for creating the sub-parser using
ExternalEntityParserCreate(context), initializing it with the appropriate
callbacks, and parsing the entity.  This handler should return an integer; if it
returns 0, the parser will raise an
XML_ERROR_EXTERNAL_ENTITY_HANDLING error, otherwise parsing will
continue.
If this handler is not provided, external entities are reported by the
DefaultHandler callback, if provided.
