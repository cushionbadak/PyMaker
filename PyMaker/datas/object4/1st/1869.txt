itertools.compress(data, selectors)Â¶
Make an iterator that filters elements from data returning only those that
have a corresponding element in selectors that evaluates to True.
Stops when either the data or selectors iterables has been exhausted.
Roughly equivalent to:
def compress(data, selectors):
    # compress('ABCDEF', [1,0,1,0,1,1]) --> A C E F
    return (d for d, s in zip(data, selectors) if s)



New in version 3.1.
