Packer.pack_farray(n, array, pack_item)Â¶
Packs a fixed length list (array) of homogeneous items.  n is the length of
the list; it is not packed into the buffer, but a ValueError exception
is raised if len(array) is not equal to n.  As above, pack_item is the
function used to pack each element.
