signal.setitimer(which, seconds, interval=0.0)Â¶
Sets given interval timer (one of signal.ITIMER_REAL,
signal.ITIMER_VIRTUAL or signal.ITIMER_PROF) specified
by which to fire after seconds (float is accepted, different from
alarm()) and after that every interval seconds (if interval
is non-zero). The interval timer specified by which can be cleared by
setting seconds to zero.
When an interval timer fires, a signal is sent to the process.
The signal sent is dependent on the timer being used;
signal.ITIMER_REAL will deliver SIGALRM,
signal.ITIMER_VIRTUAL sends SIGVTALRM,
and signal.ITIMER_PROF will deliver SIGPROF.
The old values are returned as a tuple: (delay, interval).
Attempting to pass an invalid interval timer will cause an
ItimerError.
