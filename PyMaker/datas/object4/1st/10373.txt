PyHKEY.__enter__()¶

PyHKEY.__exit__(*exc_info)¶
The HKEY object implements __enter__() and
__exit__() and thus supports the context protocol for the
with statement:
with OpenKey(HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, "foo") as key:
    ...  # work with key


will automatically close key when control leaves the with block.
