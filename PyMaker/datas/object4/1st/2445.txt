exception sqlite3.OperationalError¶
Exception raised for errors that are related to the database’s operation
and not necessarily under the control of the programmer, e.g. an unexpected
disconnect occurs, the data source name is not found, a transaction could
not be processed, etc.  It is a subclass of DatabaseError.
