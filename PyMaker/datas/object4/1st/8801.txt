@test.support.run_with_locale(catstr, *locales)Â¶
A decorator for running a function in a different locale, correctly
resetting it after it has finished.  catstr is the locale category as
a string (for example "LC_ALL").  The locales passed will be tried
sequentially, and the first valid locale will be used.
