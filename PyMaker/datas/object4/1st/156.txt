3.4.1. Awaitable Objects¶
An awaitable object generally implements an __await__() method.
Coroutine objects returned from async def functions
are awaitable.

Note
The generator iterator objects returned from generators
decorated with types.coroutine() or asyncio.coroutine()
are also awaitable, but they do not implement __await__().



object.__await__(self)¶
Must return an iterator.  Should be used to implement
awaitable objects.  For instance, asyncio.Future implements
this method to be compatible with the await expression.


New in version 3.5.

PEP 492 for additional information about awaitable objects.
