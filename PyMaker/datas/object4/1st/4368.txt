map(func, iterable[, chunksize])Â¶
A parallel equivalent of the map() built-in function (it supports only
one iterable argument though).  It blocks until the result is ready.
This method chops the iterable into a number of chunks which it submits to
the process pool as separate tasks.  The (approximate) size of these
chunks can be specified by setting chunksize to a positive integer.
Note that it may cause high memory usage for very long iterables. Consider
using imap() or imap_unordered() with explicit chunksize
option for better efficiency.
