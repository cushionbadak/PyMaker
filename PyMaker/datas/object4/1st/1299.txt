ABCs for read-only and mutable sequences.
Implementation note: Some of the mixin methods, such as
__iter__(), __reversed__() and index(), make
repeated calls to the underlying __getitem__() method.
Consequently, if __getitem__() is implemented with constant
access speed, the mixin methods will have linear performance;
however, if the underlying method is linear (as it would be with a
linked list), the mixins will have quadratic performance and will
likely need to be overridden.

Changed in version 3.5: The index() method added support for stop and start
arguments.
