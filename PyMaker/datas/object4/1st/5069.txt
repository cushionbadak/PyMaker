<dd><p>Convert 16-bit positive integers from network to host byte order.  On machines
where the host byte order is the same as network byte order, this is a no-op;
otherwise, it performs a 2-byte swap operation.</p>
<div class="deprecated">
<p><span class="versionmodified">Deprecated since version 3.7: </span>In case <em>x</em> does not fit in 16-bit unsigned integer, but does fit in a
positive C int, it is silently truncated to 16-bit unsigned integer.
This silent truncation feature is deprecated, and will raise an
exception in future versions of Python.</p>
