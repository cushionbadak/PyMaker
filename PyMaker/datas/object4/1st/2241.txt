tempfile.tempdirÂ¶
When set to a value other than None, this variable defines the
default value for the dir argument to the functions defined in this
module.
If tempdir is None (the default) at any call to any of the above
functions except gettempprefix() it is initialized following the
algorithm described in gettempdir().
