sys.last_type¶

sys.last_value¶

sys.last_traceback¶
These three variables are not always defined; they are set when an exception is
not handled and the interpreter prints an error message and a stack traceback.
Their intended use is to allow an interactive user to import a debugger module
and engage in post-mortem debugging without having to re-execute the command
that caused the error.  (Typical use is import pdb; pdb.pm() to enter the
post-mortem debugger; see pdb module for
more information.)
The meaning of the variables is the same as that of the return values from
exc_info() above.
