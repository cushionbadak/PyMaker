os.kill(pid, sig)Â¶
Send signal sig to the process pid.  Constants for the specific signals
available on the host platform are defined in the signal module.
Windows: The signal.CTRL_C_EVENT and
signal.CTRL_BREAK_EVENT signals are special signals which can
only be sent to console processes which share a common console window,
e.g., some subprocesses. Any other value for sig will cause the process
to be unconditionally killed by the TerminateProcess API, and the exit code
will be set to sig. The Windows version of kill() additionally takes
process handles to be killed.
See also signal.pthread_kill().

New in version 3.2: Windows support.
