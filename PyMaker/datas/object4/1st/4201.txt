acquire(blocking=True, timeout=-1)Â¶
Acquire a lock, blocking or non-blocking.
When invoked with the blocking argument set to True (the default),
block until the lock is unlocked, then set it to locked and return True.
When invoked with the blocking argument set to False, do not block.
If a call with blocking set to True would block, return False
immediately; otherwise, set the lock to locked and return True.
When invoked with the floating-point timeout argument set to a positive
value, block for at most the number of seconds specified by timeout
and as long as the lock cannot be acquired.  A timeout argument of -1
specifies an unbounded wait.  It is forbidden to specify a timeout
when blocking is false.
The return value is True if the lock is acquired successfully,
False if not (for example if the timeout expired).

Changed in version 3.2: The timeout parameter is new.


Changed in version 3.2: Lock acquisition can now be interrupted by signals on POSIX if the
underlying threading implementation supports it.
