Footnotes



[1]The default locale directory is system dependent; for example, on RedHat Linux
it is /usr/share/locale, but on Solaris it is /usr/lib/locale.
The gettext module does not try to support these system dependent
defaults; instead its default is sys.prefix/share/locale (see
sys.prefix). For this reason, it is always best to call
bindtextdomain() with an explicit absolute path at the start of your
application.
