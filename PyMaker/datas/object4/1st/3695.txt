curses.filter()Â¶
The filter() routine, if used, must be called before initscr() is
called.  The effect is that, during those calls, LINES is set to 1; the
capabilities clear, cup, cud, cud1, cuu1, cuu, vpa are disabled; and the home
string is set to the value of cr. The effect is that the cursor is confined to
the current line, and so are screen updates.  This may be used for enabling
character-at-a-time  line editing without touching the rest of the screen.
