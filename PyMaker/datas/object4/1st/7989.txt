shlex.split(s, comments=False, posix=True)Â¶
Split the string s using shell-like syntax. If comments is False
(the default), the parsing of comments in the given string will be disabled
(setting the commenters attribute of the
shlex instance to the empty string).  This function operates
in POSIX mode by default, but uses non-POSIX mode if the posix argument is
false.

Note
Since the split() function instantiates a shlex
instance, passing None for s will read the string to split from
standard input.
