to_eng_string(context=None)Â¶
Convert to a string, using engineering notation if an exponent is needed.
Engineering notation has an exponent which is a multiple of 3.  This
can leave up to 3 digits to the left of the decimal place and may
require the addition of either one or two trailing zeros.
For example, this converts Decimal('123E+1') to Decimal('1.23E+3').
