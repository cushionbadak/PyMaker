docs:


class logging.StreamHandler(stream=None)¶
Returns a new instance of the StreamHandler class. If stream is
specified, the instance will use it for logging output; otherwise, sys.stderr
will be used.


emit(record)¶
If a formatter is specified, it is used to format the record. The record
is then written to the stream with a terminator. If exception information
is present, it is formatted using traceback.print_exception() and
appended to the stream.



flush()¶
Flushes the stream by calling its flush() method. Note that the
close() method is inherited from Handler and so
does no output, so an explicit flush() call may be needed at times.



setStream(stream)¶
Sets the instance’s stream to the specified value, if it is different.
The old stream is flushed before the new stream is set.




Parameters:stream – The stream that the handler should use.

Returns:the old stream, if the stream was changed, or None if it wasn’t.





New in version 3.7.
