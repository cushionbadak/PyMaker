Finding all Adverbs and their PositionsÂ¶
If one wants more information about all matches of a pattern than the matched
text, finditer() is useful as it provides match objects instead of strings.  Continuing with the previous example, if
a writer wanted to find all of the adverbs and their positions in
some text, they would use finditer() in the following manner:
>>> text = "He was carefully disguised but captured quickly by police."
>>> for m in re.finditer(r"\w+ly", text):
...     print('%02d-%02d: %s' % (m.start(), m.end(), m.group(0)))
07-16: carefully
40-47: quickly
