multiprocessing.get_all_start_methods()Â¶
Returns a list of the supported start methods, the first of which
is the default.  The possible start methods are 'fork',
'spawn' and 'forkserver'.  On Windows only 'spawn' is
available.  On Unix 'fork' and 'spawn' are always
supported, with 'fork' being the default.

New in version 3.4.
