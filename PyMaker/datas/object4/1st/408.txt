class range(stop)¶

class range(start, stop[, step])
The arguments to the range constructor must be integers (either built-in
int or any object that implements the __index__ special
method).  If the step argument is omitted, it defaults to 1.
If the start argument is omitted, it defaults to 0.
If step is zero, ValueError is raised.
For a positive step, the contents of a range r are determined by the
formula r[i] = start + step*i where i >= 0 and
r[i] < stop.
For a negative step, the contents of the range are still determined by
the formula r[i] = start + step*i, but the constraints are i >= 0
and r[i] > stop.
A range object will be empty if r[0] does not meet the value
constraint. Ranges do support negative indices, but these are interpreted
as indexing from the end of the sequence determined by the positive
indices.
Ranges containing absolute values larger than sys.maxsize are
permitted but some features (such as len()) may raise
OverflowError.
Range examples:
>>> list(range(10))
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
>>> list(range(1, 11))
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
>>> list(range(0, 30, 5))
[0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25]
>>> list(range(0, 10, 3))
[0, 3, 6, 9]
>>> list(range(0, -10, -1))
[0, -1, -2, -3, -4, -5, -6, -7, -8, -9]
>>> list(range(0))
[]
>>> list(range(1, 0))
[]


Ranges implement all of the common sequence operations
except concatenation and repetition (due to the fact that range objects can
only represent sequences that follow a strict pattern and repetition and
concatenation will usually violate that pattern).


start¶
The value of the start parameter (or 0 if the parameter was
not supplied)



stop¶
The value of the stop parameter



step¶
The value of the step parameter (or 1 if the parameter was
not supplied)
