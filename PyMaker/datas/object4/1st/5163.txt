ssl.CERT_NONE¶
Possible value for SSLContext.verify_mode, or the cert_reqs
parameter to wrap_socket().  Except for PROTOCOL_TLS_CLIENT,
it is the default mode.  With client-side sockets, just about any
cert is accepted.  Validation errors, such as untrusted or expired cert,
are ignored and do not abort the TLS/SSL handshake.
In server mode, no certificate is requested from the client, so the client
does not send any for client cert authentication.
See the discussion of Security considerations below.
