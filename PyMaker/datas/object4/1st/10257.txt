add_file(file, src=None, version=None, language=None)Â¶
Add a file to the current component of the directory, starting a new one
if there is no current component. By default, the file name in the source
and the file table will be identical. If the src file is specified, it
is interpreted relative to the current directory. Optionally, a version
and a language can be specified for the entry in the File table.
