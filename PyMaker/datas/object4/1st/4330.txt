multiprocessing.sharedctypes.synchronized(obj[, lock])Â¶
Return a process-safe wrapper object for a ctypes object which uses lock to
synchronize access.  If lock is None (the default) then a
multiprocessing.RLock object is created automatically.
A synchronized wrapper will have two methods in addition to those of the
object it wraps: get_obj() returns the wrapped object and
get_lock() returns the lock object used for synchronization.
Note that accessing the ctypes object through the wrapper can be a lot slower
than accessing the raw ctypes object.

Changed in version 3.5: Synchronized objects support the context manager protocol.
