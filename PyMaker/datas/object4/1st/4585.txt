reset(token)Â¶
Reset the context variable to the value it had before the
ContextVar.set() that created the token was used.
For example:
var = ContextVar('var')

token = var.set('new value')
# code that uses 'var'; var.get() returns 'new value'.
var.reset(token)

# After the reset call the var has no value again, so
# var.get() would raise a LookupError.
