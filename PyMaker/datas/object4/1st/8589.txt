Deleting Attributes¶
Mock objects create attributes on demand. This allows them to pretend to be
objects of any type.
You may want a mock object to return False to a hasattr() call, or raise an
AttributeError when an attribute is fetched. You can do this by providing
an object as a spec for a mock, but that isn’t always convenient.
You “block” attributes by deleting them. Once deleted, accessing an attribute
will raise an AttributeError.
>>> mock = MagicMock()
>>> hasattr(mock, 'm')
True
>>> del mock.m
>>> hasattr(mock, 'm')
False
>>> del mock.f
>>> mock.f
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
AttributeError: f
