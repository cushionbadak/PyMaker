from_param(obj)¶
This method adapts obj to a ctypes type.  It is called with the actual
object used in a foreign function call when the type is present in the
foreign function’s argtypes tuple; it must return an object that
can be used as a function call parameter.
All ctypes data types have a default implementation of this classmethod
that normally returns obj if that is an instance of the type.  Some
types accept other objects as well.
