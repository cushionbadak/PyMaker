Raising exceptions with mocksÂ¶
A useful attribute is side_effect. If you set this to an
exception class or instance then the exception will be raised when the mock
is called.
>>> mock = Mock(side_effect=Exception('Boom!'))
>>> mock()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
Exception: Boom!
