Supported __dunder__ names¶
__members__ is an OrderedDict of member_name:member
items.  It is only available on the class.
__new__(), if specified, must create and return the enum members; it is
also a very good idea to set the member’s _value_ appropriately.  Once
all the members are created it is no longer used.
