SSLSocket.get_channel_binding(cb_type="tls-unique")¶
Get channel binding data for current connection, as a bytes object.  Returns
None if not connected or the handshake has not been completed.
The cb_type parameter allow selection of the desired channel binding
type. Valid channel binding types are listed in the
CHANNEL_BINDING_TYPES list.  Currently only the ‘tls-unique’ channel
binding, defined by RFC 5929, is supported.  ValueError will be
raised if an unsupported channel binding type is requested.

New in version 3.3.
