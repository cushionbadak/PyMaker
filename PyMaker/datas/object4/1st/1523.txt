class numbers.Complex¶
Subclasses of this type describe complex numbers and include the operations
that work on the built-in complex type. These are: conversions to
complex and bool, real, imag, +,
-, *, /, abs(), conjugate(), ==, and !=. All
except - and != are abstract.


real¶
Abstract. Retrieves the real component of this number.



imag¶
Abstract. Retrieves the imaginary component of this number.



abstractmethod conjugate()¶
Abstract. Returns the complex conjugate. For example, (1+3j).conjugate()
== (1-3j).
