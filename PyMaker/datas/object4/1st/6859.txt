FTP.dir(argument[, ...])¶
Produce a directory listing as returned by the LIST command, printing it to
standard output.  The optional argument is a directory to list (default is the
current server directory).  Multiple arguments can be used to pass non-standard
options to the LIST command.  If the last argument is a function, it is used
as a callback function as for retrlines(); the default prints to
sys.stdout.  This method returns None.

Note
If your server supports the command, mlsd() offers a better API.
