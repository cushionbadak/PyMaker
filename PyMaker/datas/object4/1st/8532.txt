stop()Â¶
This method can be called to signal that the set of tests being run should
be aborted by setting the shouldStop attribute to True.
TestRunner objects should respect this flag and return without
running any additional tests.
For example, this feature is used by the TextTestRunner class to
stop the test framework when the user signals an interrupt from the
keyboard.  Interactive tools which provide TestRunner
implementations can use this in a similar manner.
