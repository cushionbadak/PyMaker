ZipFile.read(name, pwd=None)Â¶
Return the bytes of the file name in the archive.  name is the name of the
file in the archive, or a ZipInfo object.  The archive must be open for
read or append. pwd is the password used for encrypted  files and, if specified,
it will override the default password set with setpassword().  Calling
read() on a ZipFile that uses a compression method other than
ZIP_STORED, ZIP_DEFLATED, ZIP_BZIP2 or
ZIP_LZMA will raise a NotImplementedError. An error will also
be raised if the corresponding compression module is not available.

Changed in version 3.6: Calling read() on a closed ZipFile will raise a ValueError.
Previously, a RuntimeError was raised.
