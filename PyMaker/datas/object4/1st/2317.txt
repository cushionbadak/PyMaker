persistent_id(obj)Â¶
Do nothing by default.  This exists so a subclass can override it.
If persistent_id() returns None, obj is pickled as usual.  Any
other value causes Pickler to emit the returned value as a
persistent ID for obj.  The meaning of this persistent ID should be
defined by Unpickler.persistent_load().  Note that the value
returned by persistent_id() cannot itself have a persistent ID.
See Persistence of External Objects for details and examples of uses.
