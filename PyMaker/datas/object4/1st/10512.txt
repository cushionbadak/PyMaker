syslog.setlogmask(maskpri)Â¶
Set the priority mask to maskpri and return the previous mask value.  Calls
to syslog() with a priority level not set in maskpri are ignored.
The default is to log all priorities.  The function LOG_MASK(pri)
calculates the mask for the individual priority pri.  The function
LOG_UPTO(pri) calculates the mask for all priorities up to and including
pri.
