Mock names and the name attribute¶
Since “name” is an argument to the Mock constructor, if you want your
mock object to have a “name” attribute you can’t just pass it in at creation
time. There are two alternatives. One option is to use
configure_mock():
>>> mock = MagicMock()
>>> mock.configure_mock(name='my_name')
>>> mock.name
'my_name'


A simpler option is to simply set the “name” attribute after mock creation:
>>> mock = MagicMock()
>>> mock.name = "foo"
