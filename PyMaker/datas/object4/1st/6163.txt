read_events()Â¶
Return an iterator over the events which have been encountered in the
data fed to the
parser.  The iterator yields (event, elem) pairs, where event is a
string representing the type of event (e.g. "end") and elem is the
encountered Element object.
Events provided in a previous call to read_events() will not be
yielded again.  Events are consumed from the internal queue only when
they are retrieved from the iterator, so multiple readers iterating in
parallel over iterators obtained from read_events() will have
unpredictable results.
