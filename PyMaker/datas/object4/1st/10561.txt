OptionParser.disable_interspersed_args()¶
Set parsing to stop on the first non-option.  For example, if -a and
-b are both simple options that take no arguments, optparse
normally accepts this syntax:
prog -a arg1 -b arg2


and treats it as equivalent to
prog -a -b arg1 arg2


To disable this feature, call disable_interspersed_args().  This
restores traditional Unix syntax, where option parsing stops with the first
non-option argument.
Use this if you have a command processor which runs another command which has
options of its own and you want to make sure these options don’t get
confused.  For example, each command might have a different set of options.
