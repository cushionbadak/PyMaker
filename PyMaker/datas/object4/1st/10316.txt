winreg.EnumKey(key, index)Â¶
Enumerates subkeys of an open registry key, returning a string.
key is an already open key, or one of the predefined
HKEY_* constants.
index is an integer that identifies the index of the key to retrieve.
The function retrieves the name of one subkey each time it is called.  It is
typically called repeatedly until an OSError exception is
raised, indicating, no more values are available.

Changed in version 3.3: See above.
