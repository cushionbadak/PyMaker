test.support.load_package_tests(pkg_dir, loader, standard_tests, pattern)¶
Generic implementation of the unittest load_tests protocol for
use in test packages.  pkg_dir is the root directory of the package;
loader, standard_tests, and pattern are the arguments expected by
load_tests.  In simple cases, the test package’s __init__.py
can be the following:
import os
from test.support import load_package_tests

def load_tests(*args):
    return load_package_tests(os.path.dirname(__file__), *args)
