class zipfile.ZipInfo(filename='NoName', date_time=(1980, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0))Â¶
Class used to represent information about a member of an archive. Instances
of this class are returned by the getinfo() and infolist()
methods of ZipFile objects.  Most users of the zipfile module
will not need to create these, but only use those created by this
module. filename should be the full name of the archive member, and
date_time should be a tuple containing six fields which describe the time
of the last modification to the file; the fields are described in section
ZipInfo Objects.
