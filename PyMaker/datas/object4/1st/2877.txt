hmac.compare_digest(a, b)¶
Return a == b.  This function uses an approach designed to prevent
timing analysis by avoiding content-based short circuiting behaviour,
making it appropriate for cryptography.  a and b must both be of the
same type: either str (ASCII only, as e.g. returned by
HMAC.hexdigest()), or a bytes-like object.

Note
If a and b are of different lengths, or if an error occurs,
a timing attack could theoretically reveal information about the
types and lengths of a and b—but not their values.


New in version 3.3.
