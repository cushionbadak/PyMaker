check_output(want, got, optionflags)¶
Return True iff the actual output from an example (got) matches the
expected output (want).  These strings are always considered to match if
they are identical; but depending on what option flags the test runner is
using, several non-exact match types are also possible.  See section
Option Flags for more information about option flags.
