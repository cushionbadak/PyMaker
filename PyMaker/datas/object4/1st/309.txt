breakpoint(*args, **kws)¶
This function drops you into the debugger at the call site.  Specifically,
it calls sys.breakpointhook(), passing args and kws straight
through.  By default, sys.breakpointhook() calls
pdb.set_trace() expecting no arguments.  In this case, it is
purely a convenience function so you don’t have to explicitly import
pdb or type as much code to enter the debugger.  However,
sys.breakpointhook() can be set to some other function and
breakpoint() will automatically call that, allowing you to drop into
the debugger of choice.

New in version 3.7.
