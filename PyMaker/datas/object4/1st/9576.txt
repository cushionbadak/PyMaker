InteractiveConsole.raw_input(prompt="")Â¶
Write a prompt and read a line.  The returned line does not include the trailing
newline.  When the user enters the EOF key sequence, EOFError is raised.
The base implementation reads from sys.stdin; a subclass may replace this
with a different implementation.
