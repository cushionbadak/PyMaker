Clock ID Constants¶
These constants are used as parameters for clock_getres() and
clock_gettime().


time.CLOCK_BOOTTIME¶
Identical to CLOCK_MONOTONIC, except it also includes any time that
the system is suspended.
This allows applications to get a suspend-aware monotonic  clock  without
having to deal with the complications of CLOCK_REALTIME, which may
have  discontinuities if the time is changed using settimeofday() or
similar.
Availability: Linux 2.6.39 or later.

New in version 3.7.




time.CLOCK_HIGHRES¶
The Solaris OS has a CLOCK_HIGHRES timer that attempts to use an optimal
hardware source, and may give close to nanosecond resolution.
CLOCK_HIGHRES is the nonadjustable, high-resolution clock.
Availability: Solaris.

New in version 3.3.




time.CLOCK_MONOTONIC¶
Clock that cannot be set and represents monotonic time since some unspecified
starting point.
Availability: Unix.

New in version 3.3.




time.CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW¶
Similar to CLOCK_MONOTONIC, but provides access to a raw
hardware-based time that is not subject to NTP adjustments.
Availability: Linux 2.6.28 and newer, macOS 10.12 and newer.

New in version 3.3.




time.CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID¶
High-resolution per-process timer from the CPU.
Availability: Unix.

New in version 3.3.




time.CLOCK_PROF¶
High-resolution per-process timer from the CPU.
Availability: FreeBSD, NetBSD 7 or later, OpenBSD.

New in version 3.7.




time.CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID¶
Thread-specific CPU-time clock.
Availability: Unix.

New in version 3.3.




time.CLOCK_UPTIME¶
Time whose absolute value is the time the system has been running and not
suspended, providing accurate uptime measurement, both absolute and
interval.
Availability: FreeBSD, OpenBSD 5.5 or later.

New in version 3.7.


The following constant is the only parameter that can be sent to
clock_settime().


time.CLOCK_REALTIME¶
System-wide real-time clock.  Setting this clock requires appropriate
privileges.
Availability: Unix.

New in version 3.3.
