ast.literal_eval(node_or_string)¶
Safely evaluate an expression node or a string containing a Python literal or
container display.  The string or node provided may only consist of the
following Python literal structures: strings, bytes, numbers, tuples, lists,
dicts, sets, booleans, and None.
This can be used for safely evaluating strings containing Python values from
untrusted sources without the need to parse the values oneself.  It is not
capable of evaluating arbitrarily complex expressions, for example involving
operators or indexing.

Warning
It is possible to crash the Python interpreter with a
sufficiently large/complex string due to stack depth limitations
in Python’s AST compiler.


Changed in version 3.2: Now allows bytes and set literals.
