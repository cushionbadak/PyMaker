NNTP.starttls(context=None)Â¶
Send a STARTTLS command.  This will enable encryption on the NNTP
connection.  The context argument is optional and should be a
ssl.SSLContext object.  Please read Security considerations for best
practices.
Note that this may not be done after authentication information has
been transmitted, and authentication occurs by default if possible during a
NNTP object initialization.  See NNTP.login() for information
on suppressing this behavior.

New in version 3.2.


Changed in version 3.4: The method now supports hostname check with
ssl.SSLContext.check_hostname and Server Name Indication (see
ssl.HAS_SNI).
