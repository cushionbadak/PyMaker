inspect.ismethoddescriptor(object)¶
Return true if the object is a method descriptor, but not if
ismethod(), isclass(), isfunction() or isbuiltin()
are true.
This, for example, is true of int.__add__.  An object passing this test
has a __get__() method but not a __set__()
method, but beyond that the set of attributes varies.  A
__name__ attribute is usually
sensible, and __doc__ often is.
Methods implemented via descriptors that also pass one of the other tests
return false from the ismethoddescriptor() test, simply because the
other tests promise more – you can, e.g., count on having the
__func__ attribute (etc) when an object passes ismethod().
