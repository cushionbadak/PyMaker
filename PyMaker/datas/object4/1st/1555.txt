Power and logarithmic functions¶


math.exp(x)¶
Return e raised to the power x, where e = 2.718281… is the base
of natural logarithms.  This is usually more accurate than math.e ** x
or pow(math.e, x).



math.expm1(x)¶
Return e raised to the power x, minus 1.  Here e is the base of natural
logarithms.  For small floats x, the subtraction in exp(x) - 1
can result in a significant loss of precision; the expm1()
function provides a way to compute this quantity to full precision:
>>> from math import exp, expm1
>>> exp(1e-5) - 1  # gives result accurate to 11 places
1.0000050000069649e-05
>>> expm1(1e-5)    # result accurate to full precision
1.0000050000166668e-05



New in version 3.2.




math.log(x[, base])¶
With one argument, return the natural logarithm of x (to base e).
With two arguments, return the logarithm of x to the given base,
calculated as log(x)/log(base).



math.log1p(x)¶
Return the natural logarithm of 1+x (base e). The
result is calculated in a way which is accurate for x near zero.



math.log2(x)¶
Return the base-2 logarithm of x. This is usually more accurate than
log(x, 2).

New in version 3.3.

int.bit_length() returns the number of bits necessary to represent
an integer in binary, excluding the sign and leading zeros.




math.log10(x)¶
Return the base-10 logarithm of x.  This is usually more accurate
than log(x, 10).



math.pow(x, y)¶
Return x raised to the power y.  Exceptional cases follow
Annex ‘F’ of the C99 standard as far as possible.  In particular,
pow(1.0, x) and pow(x, 0.0) always return 1.0, even
when x is a zero or a NaN.  If both x and y are finite,
x is negative, and y is not an integer then pow(x, y)
is undefined, and raises ValueError.
Unlike the built-in ** operator, math.pow() converts both
its arguments to type float.  Use ** or the built-in
pow() function for computing exact integer powers.



math.sqrt(x)¶
Return the square root of x.
