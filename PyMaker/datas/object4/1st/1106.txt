classmethod datetime.utcfromtimestamp(timestamp)¶
Return the UTC datetime corresponding to the POSIX timestamp, with
tzinfo None. This may raise OverflowError, if the timestamp is
out of the range of values supported by the platform C gmtime() function,
and OSError on gmtime() failure.
It’s common for this to be restricted to years in 1970 through 2038.
To get an aware datetime object, call fromtimestamp():
datetime.fromtimestamp(timestamp, timezone.utc)


On the POSIX compliant platforms, it is equivalent to the following
expression:
datetime(1970, 1, 1, tzinfo=timezone.utc) + timedelta(seconds=timestamp)


except the latter formula always supports the full years range: between
MINYEAR and MAXYEAR inclusive.

Changed in version 3.3: Raise OverflowError instead of ValueError if the timestamp
is out of the range of values supported by the platform C
gmtime() function. Raise OSError instead of
ValueError on gmtime() failure.
