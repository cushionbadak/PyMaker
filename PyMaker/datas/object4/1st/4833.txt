coroutine loop.subprocess_shell(protocol_factory, cmd, *, stdin=subprocess.PIPE, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE, **kwargs)¶
Create a subprocess from cmd, which can be a str or a
bytes string encoded to the
filesystem encoding,
using the platform’s “shell” syntax.
This is similar to the standard library subprocess.Popen
class called with shell=True.
The protocol_factory must be a callable returning a subclass of the
SubprocessProtocol class.
See subprocess_exec() for more details about
the remaining arguments.
Returns a pair of (transport, protocol), where transport
conforms to the SubprocessTransport base class and
protocol is an object instantiated by the protocol_factory.
