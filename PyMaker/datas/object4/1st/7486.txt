class ipaddress.IPv4Interface(address)¶
Construct an IPv4 interface.  The meaning of address is as in the
constructor of IPv4Network, except that arbitrary host addresses
are always accepted.
IPv4Interface is a subclass of IPv4Address, so it inherits
all the attributes from that class.  In addition, the following attributes
are available:


ip¶
The address (IPv4Address) without network information.
>>> interface = IPv4Interface('192.0.2.5/24')
>>> interface.ip
IPv4Address('192.0.2.5')





network¶
The network (IPv4Network) this interface belongs to.
>>> interface = IPv4Interface('192.0.2.5/24')
>>> interface.network
IPv4Network('192.0.2.0/24')





with_prefixlen¶
A string representation of the interface with the mask in prefix notation.
>>> interface = IPv4Interface('192.0.2.5/24')
>>> interface.with_prefixlen
'192.0.2.5/24'





with_netmask¶
A string representation of the interface with the network as a net mask.
>>> interface = IPv4Interface('192.0.2.5/24')
>>> interface.with_netmask
'192.0.2.5/255.255.255.0'





with_hostmask¶
A string representation of the interface with the network as a host mask.
>>> interface = IPv4Interface('192.0.2.5/24')
>>> interface.with_hostmask
'192.0.2.5/0.0.0.255'
