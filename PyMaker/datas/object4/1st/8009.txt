<dd><p>This attribute is <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">None</span></code> by default.  If you assign a string to it, that
string will be recognized as a lexical-level inclusion request similar to the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">source</span></code> keyword in various shells.  That is, the immediately following token
will be opened as a filename and input will be taken from that stream until
EOF, at which point the <a class="reference internal" href="io.html#io.IOBase.close" title="io.IOBase.close"><code class="xref py py-meth docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">close()</span></code></a> method of that stream will be
called and the input source will again become the original input stream.  Source
requests may be stacked any number of levels deep.</p>
