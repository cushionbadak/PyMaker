__package__¶
The module’s __package__ attribute must be set.  Its value must
be a string, but it can be the same value as its __name__.  When
the module is a package, its __package__ value should be set to
its __name__.  When the module is not a package, __package__
should be set to the empty string for top-level modules, or for
submodules, to the parent package’s name.  See PEP 366 for further
details.
This attribute is used instead of __name__ to calculate explicit
relative imports for main modules, as defined in PEP 366. It is
expected to have the same value as __spec__.parent.

Changed in version 3.6: The value of __package__ is expected to be the same as
__spec__.parent.
