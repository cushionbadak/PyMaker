exception urllib.error.HTTPError¶
Though being an exception (a subclass of URLError), an
HTTPError can also function as a non-exceptional file-like return
value (the same thing that urlopen() returns).  This
is useful when handling exotic HTTP errors, such as requests for
authentication.


code¶
An HTTP status code as defined in RFC 2616.  This numeric value corresponds
to a value found in the dictionary of codes as found in
http.server.BaseHTTPRequestHandler.responses.



reason¶
This is usually a string explaining the reason for this error.



headers¶
The HTTP response headers for the HTTP request that caused the
HTTPError.

New in version 3.4.
