resource.setrlimit(resource, limits)Â¶
Sets new limits of consumption of resource. The limits argument must be a
tuple (soft, hard) of two integers describing the new limits. A value of
RLIM_INFINITY can be used to request a limit that is
unlimited.
Raises ValueError if an invalid resource is specified, if the new soft
limit exceeds the hard limit, or if a process tries to raise its hard limit.
Specifying a limit of RLIM_INFINITY when the hard or
system limit for that resource is not unlimited will result in a
ValueError.  A process with the effective UID of super-user can
request any valid limit value, including unlimited, but ValueError
will still be raised if the requested limit exceeds the system imposed
limit.
setrlimit may also raise error if the underlying system call
fails.
