docs:


turtle.onclick(fun, btn=1, add=None)

turtle.onscreenclick(fun, btn=1, add=None)¶




Parameters:
fun – a function with two arguments which will be called with the
coordinates of the clicked point on the canvas
btn – number of the mouse-button, defaults to 1 (left mouse button)
add – True or False – if True, a new binding will be
added, otherwise it will replace a former binding





Bind fun to mouse-click events on this screen.  If fun is None,
existing bindings are removed.
Example for a TurtleScreen instance named screen and a Turtle instance
named turtle:
>>> screen.onclick(turtle.goto) # Subsequently clicking into the TurtleScreen will
>>>                             # make the turtle move to the clicked point.
>>> screen.onclick(None)        # remove event binding again



Note
This TurtleScreen method is available as a global function only under the
name onscreenclick.  The global function onclick is another one
derived from the Turtle method onclick.
