os.RWF_HIPRIÂ¶
High priority read/write. Allows block-based filesystems to use polling
of the device, which provides lower latency, but may use additional
resources.
Currently, on Linux, this feature is usable only on a file descriptor opened
using the O_DIRECT flag.
Availability: Linux 4.6 and newer.

New in version 3.7.
