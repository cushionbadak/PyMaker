exc_msg¶
The exception message generated by the example, if the example is expected to
generate an exception; or None if it is not expected to generate an
exception.  This exception message is compared against the return value of
traceback.format_exception_only().  exc_msg ends with a newline
unless it’s None.  The constructor adds a newline if needed.
