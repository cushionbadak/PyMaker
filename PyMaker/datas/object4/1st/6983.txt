NNTP.getcapabilities()¶
Return the RFC 3977 capabilities advertised by the server, as a
dict instance mapping capability names to (possibly empty) lists
of values. On legacy servers which don’t understand the CAPABILITIES
command, an empty dictionary is returned instead.
>>> s = NNTP('news.gmane.org')
>>> 'POST' in s.getcapabilities()
True



New in version 3.2.
