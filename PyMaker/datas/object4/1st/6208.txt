DocumentType Objects¶
Information about the notations and entities declared by a document (including
the external subset if the parser uses it and can provide the information) is
available from a DocumentType object.  The DocumentType for a
document is available from the Document object’s doctype
attribute; if there is no DOCTYPE declaration for the document, the
document’s doctype attribute will be set to None instead of an
instance of this interface.
DocumentType is a specialization of Node, and adds the
following attributes:


DocumentType.publicId¶
The public identifier for the external subset of the document type definition.
This will be a string or None.



DocumentType.systemId¶
The system identifier for the external subset of the document type definition.
This will be a URI as a string, or None.



DocumentType.internalSubset¶
A string giving the complete internal subset from the document. This does not
include the brackets which enclose the subset.  If the document has no internal
subset, this should be None.



DocumentType.name¶
The name of the root element as given in the DOCTYPE declaration, if
present.



DocumentType.entities¶
This is a NamedNodeMap giving the definitions of external entities.
For entity names defined more than once, only the first definition is provided
(others are ignored as required by the XML recommendation).  This may be
None if the information is not provided by the parser, or if no entities are
defined.



DocumentType.notations¶
This is a NamedNodeMap giving the definitions of notations. For
notation names defined more than once, only the first definition is provided
(others are ignored as required by the XML recommendation).  This may be
None if the information is not provided by the parser, or if no notations
are defined.
