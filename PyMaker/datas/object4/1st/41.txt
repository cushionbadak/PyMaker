object.__init__(self[, ...])¶
Called after the instance has been created (by __new__()), but before
it is returned to the caller.  The arguments are those passed to the
class constructor expression.  If a base class has an __init__()
method, the derived class’s __init__() method, if any, must explicitly
call it to ensure proper initialization of the base class part of the
instance; for example: super().__init__([args...]).
Because __new__() and __init__() work together in constructing
objects (__new__() to create it, and __init__() to customize it),
no non-None value may be returned by __init__(); doing so will
cause a TypeError to be raised at runtime.
