socket.CMSG_SPACE(length)Â¶
Return the buffer size needed for recvmsg() to
receive an ancillary data item with associated data of the given
length, along with any trailing padding.  The buffer space needed
to receive multiple items is the sum of the CMSG_SPACE()
values for their associated data lengths.  Raises
OverflowError if length is outside the permissible range
of values.
Note that some systems might support ancillary data without
providing this function.  Also note that setting the buffer size
using the results of this function may not precisely limit the
amount of ancillary data that can be received, since additional
data may be able to fit into the padding area.
Availability: most Unix platforms, possibly others.

New in version 3.3.
