select.devpoll()Â¶
(Only supported on Solaris and derivatives.)  Returns a /dev/poll
polling object; see section /dev/poll Polling Objects below for the
methods supported by devpoll objects.
devpoll() objects are linked to the number of file
descriptors allowed at the time of instantiation. If your program
reduces this value, devpoll() will fail. If your program
increases this value, devpoll() may return an
incomplete list of active file descriptors.
The new file descriptor is non-inheritable.

New in version 3.3.


Changed in version 3.4: The new file descriptor is now non-inheritable.
