Supported DatatypesÂ¶
Config parsers do not guess datatypes of values in configuration files, always
storing them internally as strings.  This means that if you need other
datatypes, you should convert on your own:
>>> int(topsecret['Port'])
50022
>>> float(topsecret['CompressionLevel'])
9.0


Since this task is so common, config parsers provide a range of handy getter
methods to handle integers, floats and booleans.  The last one is the most
interesting because simply passing the value to bool() would do no good
since bool('False') is still True.  This is why config parsers also
provide getboolean().  This method is case-insensitive and
recognizes Boolean values from 'yes'/'no', 'on'/'off',
'true'/'false' and '1'/'0' [1].  For example:
>>> topsecret.getboolean('ForwardX11')
False
>>> config['bitbucket.org'].getboolean('ForwardX11')
True
>>> config.getboolean('bitbucket.org', 'Compression')
True


Apart from getboolean(), config parsers also
provide equivalent getint() and
getfloat() methods.  You can register your own
converters and customize the provided ones. [1]
