class test.support.SuppressCrashReport¶
A context manager used to try to prevent crash dialog popups on tests that
are expected to crash a subprocess.
On Windows, it disables Windows Error Reporting dialogs using
SetErrorMode.
On UNIX, resource.setrlimit() is used to set
resource.RLIMIT_CORE’s soft limit to 0 to prevent coredump file
creation.
On both platforms, the old value is restored by __exit__().
