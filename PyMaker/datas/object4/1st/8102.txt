Sizegrip¶
The ttk.Sizegrip widget (also known as a grow box) allows the user to
resize the containing toplevel window by pressing and dragging the grip.
This widget has neither specific options nor specific methods, besides the
ones inherited from ttk.Widget.

Platform-specific notes¶

On MacOS X, toplevel windows automatically include a built-in size grip
by default. Adding a Sizegrip is harmless, since the built-in
grip will just mask the widget.



Bugs¶

If the containing toplevel’s position was specified relative to the right
or bottom of the screen (e.g. ….), the Sizegrip widget will
not resize the window.
This widget supports only “southeast” resizing.
