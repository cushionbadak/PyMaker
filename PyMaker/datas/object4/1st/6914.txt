IMAP4.authenticate(mechanism, authobject)¶
Authenticate command — requires response processing.
mechanism specifies which authentication mechanism is to be used - it should
appear in the instance variable capabilities in the form AUTH=mechanism.
authobject must be a callable object:
data = authobject(response)


It will be called to process server continuation responses; the response
argument it is passed will be bytes.  It should return bytes data
that will be base64 encoded and sent to the server.  It should return
None if the client abort response * should be sent instead.

Changed in version 3.5: string usernames and passwords are now encoded to utf-8 instead of
being limited to ASCII.
