docs:


peek(n)Â¶
Read n uncompressed bytes without advancing the file position.
At most one single read on the compressed stream is done to satisfy
the call.  The number of bytes returned may be more or less than
requested.

Note
While calling peek() does not change the file position of
the GzipFile, it may change the position of the underlying
file object (e.g. if the GzipFile was constructed with the
fileobj parameter).


New in version 3.2.
