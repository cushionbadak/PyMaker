2.4.7. Imaginary literalsÂ¶
Imaginary literals are described by the following lexical definitions:

imagnumber ::=  (floatnumber | digitpart) ("j" | "J")

An imaginary literal yields a complex number with a real part of 0.0.  Complex
numbers are represented as a pair of floating point numbers and have the same
restrictions on their range.  To create a complex number with a nonzero real
part, add a floating point number to it, e.g., (3+4j).  Some examples of
imaginary literals:
3.14j   10.j    10j     .001j   1e100j   3.14e-10j   3.14_15_93j
