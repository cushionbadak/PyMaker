imap(func, iterable[, chunksize])Â¶
A lazier version of map().
The chunksize argument is the same as the one used by the map()
method.  For very long iterables using a large value for chunksize can
make the job complete much faster than using the default value of
1.
Also if chunksize is 1 then the next() method of the iterator
returned by the imap() method has an optional timeout parameter:
next(timeout) will raise multiprocessing.TimeoutError if the
result cannot be returned within timeout seconds.
