ImagesÂ¶
Images of different formats can be created through the corresponding subclass
of tkinter.Image:

BitmapImage for images in XBM format.
PhotoImage for images in PGM, PPM, GIF and PNG formats. The latter
is supported starting with Tk 8.6.

Either type of image is created through either the file or the data
option (other options are available as well).
The image object can then be used wherever an image option is supported by
some widget (e.g. labels, buttons, menus). In these cases, Tk will not keep a
reference to the image. When the last Python reference to the image object is
deleted, the image data is deleted as well, and Tk will display an empty box
wherever the image was used.

The Pillow package adds support for
formats such as BMP, JPEG, TIFF, and WebP, among others.
