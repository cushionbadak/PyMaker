@importlib.util.set_loaderÂ¶
A decorator for importlib.abc.Loader.load_module()
to set the __loader__
attribute on the returned module. If the attribute is already set the
decorator does nothing. It is assumed that the first positional argument to
the wrapped method (i.e. self) is what __loader__ should be set
to.

Changed in version 3.4: Set __loader__ if set to None, as if the attribute does not
exist.


Deprecated since version 3.4: The import machinery takes care of this automatically.
