MemoryHandler¶
The MemoryHandler class, located in the logging.handlers module,
supports buffering of logging records in memory, periodically flushing them to a
target handler. Flushing occurs whenever the buffer is full, or when an
event of a certain severity or greater is seen.
MemoryHandler is a subclass of the more general
BufferingHandler, which is an abstract class. This buffers logging
records in memory. Whenever each record is added to the buffer, a check is made
by calling shouldFlush() to see if the buffer should be flushed.  If it
should, then flush() is expected to do the flushing.


class logging.handlers.BufferingHandler(capacity)¶
Initializes the handler with a buffer of the specified capacity.


emit(record)¶
Appends the record to the buffer. If shouldFlush() returns true,
calls flush() to process the buffer.



flush()¶
You can override this to implement custom flushing behavior. This version
just zaps the buffer to empty.



shouldFlush(record)¶
Returns true if the buffer is up to capacity. This method can be
overridden to implement custom flushing strategies.




class logging.handlers.MemoryHandler(capacity, flushLevel=ERROR, target=None, flushOnClose=True)¶
Returns a new instance of the MemoryHandler class. The instance is
initialized with a buffer size of capacity. If flushLevel is not specified,
ERROR is used. If no target is specified, the target will need to be
set using setTarget() before this handler does anything useful. If
flushOnClose is specified as False, then the buffer is not flushed when
the handler is closed. If not specified or specified as True, the previous
behaviour of flushing the buffer will occur when the handler is closed.

Changed in version 3.6: The flushOnClose parameter was added.



close()¶
Calls flush(), sets the target to None and clears the
buffer.



flush()¶
For a MemoryHandler, flushing means just sending the buffered
records to the target, if there is one. The buffer is also cleared when
this happens. Override if you want different behavior.



setTarget(target)¶
Sets the target handler for this handler.



shouldFlush(record)¶
Checks for buffer full or a record at the flushLevel or higher.
