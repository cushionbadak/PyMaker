__package__Â¶
Which package a module belongs to. If the module is top-level
(i.e. not a part of any specific package) then the attribute should be set
to '', else it should be set to the name of the package (which can be
__name__ if the module is a package itself). Defaults to None.

Changed in version 3.4: Defaults to None. Previously the attribute was optional.
