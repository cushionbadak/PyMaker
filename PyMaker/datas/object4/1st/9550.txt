site.USER_BASE¶
Path to the base directory for the user site-packages.  Can be None if
getuserbase() hasn’t been called yet.  Default value is
~/.local for UNIX and Mac OS X non-framework builds,
~/Library/Python/X.Y for Mac framework builds, and
%APPDATA%\Python for Windows.  This value is used by Distutils to
compute the installation directories for scripts, data files, Python modules,
etc. for the user installation scheme.
See also PYTHONUSERBASE.
