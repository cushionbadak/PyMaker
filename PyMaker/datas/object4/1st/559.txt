docs:


formatÂ¶
A string containing the format (in struct module style) for each
element in the view. A memoryview can be created from exporters with
arbitrary format strings, but some methods (e.g. tolist()) are
restricted to native single element formats.

Changed in version 3.3: format 'B' is now handled according to the struct module syntax.
This means that memoryview(b'abc')[0] == b'abc'[0] == 97.
