Node.parentNodeÂ¶
The parent of the current node, or None for the document node. The value is
always a Node object or None.  For Element nodes, this
will be the parent element, except for the root element, in which case it will
be the Document object. For Attr nodes, this is always
None. This is a read-only attribute.
