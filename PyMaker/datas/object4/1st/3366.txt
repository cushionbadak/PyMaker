time.gmtime([secs])Â¶
Convert a time expressed in seconds since the epoch to a struct_time in
UTC in which the dst flag is always zero.  If secs is not provided or
None, the current time as returned by time() is used.  Fractions
of a second are ignored.  See above for a description of the
struct_time object. See calendar.timegm() for the inverse of this
function.
