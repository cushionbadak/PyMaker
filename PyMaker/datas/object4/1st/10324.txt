winreg.QueryValue(key, sub_key)¶
Retrieves the unnamed value for a key, as a string.
key is an already open key, or one of the predefined
HKEY_* constants.
sub_key is a string that holds the name of the subkey with which the value is
associated.  If this parameter is None or empty, the function retrieves the
value set by the SetValue() method for the key identified by key.
Values in the registry have name, type, and data components. This method
retrieves the data for a key’s first value that has a NULL name. But the
underlying API call doesn’t return the type, so always use
QueryValueEx() if possible.
