addFailure(test, err)¶
Called when the test case test signals a failure. err is a tuple of
the form returned by sys.exc_info(): (type, value, traceback).
The default implementation appends a tuple (test, formatted_err) to
the instance’s failures attribute, where formatted_err is a
formatted traceback derived from err.
