os.read(fd, n)¶
Read at most n bytes from file descriptor fd.
Return a bytestring containing the bytes read. If the end of the file
referred to by fd has been reached, an empty bytes object is returned.

Note
This function is intended for low-level I/O and must be applied to a file
descriptor as returned by os.open() or pipe().  To read a
“file object” returned by the built-in function open() or by
popen() or fdopen(), or sys.stdin, use its
read() or readline() methods.


Changed in version 3.5: If the system call is interrupted and the signal handler does not raise an
exception, the function now retries the system call instead of raising an
InterruptedError exception (see PEP 475 for the rationale).
