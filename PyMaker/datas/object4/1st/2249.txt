glob.escape(pathname)Â¶
Escape all special characters ('?', '*' and '[').
This is useful if you want to match an arbitrary literal string that may
have special characters in it.  Special characters in drive/UNC
sharepoints are not escaped, e.g. on Windows
escape('//?/c:/Quo vadis?.txt') returns '//?/c:/Quo vadis[?].txt'.

New in version 3.4.
