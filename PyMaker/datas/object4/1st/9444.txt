gc.DEBUG_UNCOLLECTABLE¶
Print information of uncollectable objects found (objects which are not
reachable but cannot be freed by the collector).  These objects will be added
to the garbage list.

Changed in version 3.2: Also print the contents of the garbage list at
interpreter shutdown, if it isn’t empty.
