warnings.showwarning(message, category, filename, lineno, file=None, line=None)Â¶
Write a warning to a file.  The default implementation calls
formatwarning(message, category, filename, lineno, line) and writes the
resulting string to file, which defaults to sys.stderr.  You may replace
this function with any callable by assigning to warnings.showwarning.
line is a line of source code to be included in the warning
message; if line is not supplied, showwarning() will
try to read the line specified by filename and lineno.
