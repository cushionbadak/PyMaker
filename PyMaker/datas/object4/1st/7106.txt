<dd><p>Get the hardware address as a 48-bit positive integer.  The first time this
runs, it may launch a separate program, which could be quite slow.  If all
attempts to obtain the hardware address fail, we choose a random 48-bit
number with the multicast bit (least significant bit of the first octet)
set to 1 as recommended in <span class="target" id="index-4"></span><a class="rfc reference external" href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122.html"><strong>RFC 4122</strong></a>.  “Hardware address” means the MAC
address of a network interface.  On a machine with multiple network
interfaces, universally administered MAC addresses (i.e. where the second
least significant bit of the first octet is <em>unset</em>) will be preferred over
locally administered MAC addresses, but with no other ordering guarantees.</p>
<div class="versionchanged">
<p><span class="versionmodified">Changed in version 3.7: </span>Universally administered MAC addresses are preferred over locally
administered MAC addresses, since the former are guaranteed to be
globally unique, while the latter are not.</p>
