dis.findlinestarts(code)Â¶
This generator function uses the co_firstlineno and co_lnotab
attributes of the code object code to find the offsets which are starts of
lines in the source code.  They are generated as (offset, lineno) pairs.
See Objects/lnotab_notes.txt for the co_lnotab format and
how to decode it.

Changed in version 3.6: Line numbers can be decreasing. Before, they were always increasing.
