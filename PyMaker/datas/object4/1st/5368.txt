docs:


modify(fileobj, events, data=None)¶
Change a registered file object’s monitored events or attached data.
This is equivalent to BaseSelector.unregister(fileobj)() followed
by BaseSelector.register(fileobj, events, data)(), except that it
can be implemented more efficiently.
This returns a new SelectorKey instance, or raises a
ValueError in case of invalid event mask or file descriptor, or
KeyError if the file object is not registered.
