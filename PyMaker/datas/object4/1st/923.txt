readline.append_history_file(nelements[, filename])Â¶
Append the last nelements items of history to a file.  The default filename is
~/.history.  The file must already exist.  This calls
append_history() in the underlying library.  This function
only exists if Python was compiled for a version of the library
that supports it.

New in version 3.5.
