docs:


get_filename(failobj=None)Â¶
Return the value of the filename parameter of the
Content-Disposition header of the message.  If the header
does not have a filename parameter, this method falls back to looking
for the name parameter on the Content-Type header.  If
neither is found, or the header is missing, then failobj is returned.
The returned string will always be unquoted as per
email.utils.unquote().
