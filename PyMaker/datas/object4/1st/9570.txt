InteractiveInterpreter.showtraceback()¶
Display the exception that just occurred.  We remove the first stack item
because it is within the interpreter object implementation. The output is
written by the write() method.

Changed in version 3.5: The full chained traceback is displayed instead
of just the primary traceback.
