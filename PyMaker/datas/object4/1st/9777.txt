parser.st2tuple(st, line_info=False, col_info=False)Â¶
This function accepts an ST object from the caller in st and returns a
Python tuple representing the equivalent parse tree.  Other than returning a
tuple instead of a list, this function is identical to st2list().
If line_info is true, line number information will be included for all
terminal tokens as a third element of the list representing the token.  This
information is omitted if the flag is false or omitted.
