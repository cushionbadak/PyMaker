Localizing your applicationÂ¶
If you are localizing your application, you can install the _() function
globally into the built-in namespace, usually in the main driver file of your
application.  This will let all your application-specific files just use
_('...') without having to explicitly install it in each file.
In the simple case then, you need only add the following bit of code to the main
driver file of your application:
import gettext
gettext.install('myapplication')


If you need to set the locale directory, you can pass it into the
install() function:
import gettext
gettext.install('myapplication', '/usr/share/locale')
