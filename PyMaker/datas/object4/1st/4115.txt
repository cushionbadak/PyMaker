from_buffer_copy(source[, offset])Â¶
This method creates a ctypes instance, copying the buffer from the
source object buffer which must be readable.  The optional offset
parameter specifies an offset into the source buffer in bytes; the default
is zero.  If the source buffer is not large enough a ValueError is
raised.
