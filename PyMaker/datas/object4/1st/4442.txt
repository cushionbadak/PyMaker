class subprocess.CompletedProcess¶
The return value from run(), representing a process that has finished.


args¶
The arguments used to launch the process. This may be a list or a string.



returncode¶
Exit status of the child process. Typically, an exit status of 0 indicates
that it ran successfully.
A negative value -N indicates that the child was terminated by signal
N (POSIX only).



stdout¶
Captured stdout from the child process. A bytes sequence, or a string if
run() was called with an encoding, errors, or text=True.
None if stdout was not captured.
If you ran the process with stderr=subprocess.STDOUT, stdout and
stderr will be combined in this attribute, and stderr will be
None.



stderr¶
Captured stderr from the child process. A bytes sequence, or a string if
run() was called with an encoding, errors, or text=True.
None if stderr was not captured.



check_returncode()¶
If returncode is non-zero, raise a CalledProcessError.
