__str__()Â¶
Returns an approximation of the Header as a string, using an
unlimited line length.  All pieces are converted to unicode using the
specified encoding and joined together appropriately.  Any pieces with a
charset of 'unknown-8bit' are decoded as ASCII using the 'replace'
error handler.

Changed in version 3.2: Added handling for the 'unknown-8bit' charset.
