xmlparser.UseForeignDTD([flag])Â¶
Calling this with a true value for flag (the default) will cause Expat to call
the ExternalEntityRefHandler with None for all arguments to
allow an alternate DTD to be loaded.  If the document does not contain a
document type declaration, the ExternalEntityRefHandler will still be
called, but the StartDoctypeDeclHandler and
EndDoctypeDeclHandler will not be called.
Passing a false value for flag will cancel a previous call that passed a true
value, but otherwise has no effect.
This method can only be called before the Parse() or ParseFile()
methods are called; calling it after either of those have been called causes
ExpatError to be raised with the code attribute set to
errors.codes[errors.XML_ERROR_CANT_CHANGE_FEATURE_ONCE_PARSING].
