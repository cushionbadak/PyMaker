serve_forever(poll_interval=0.5)Â¶
Handle requests until an explicit shutdown() request.  Poll for
shutdown every poll_interval seconds.
Ignores the timeout attribute.  It
also calls service_actions(), which may be used by a subclass or mixin
to provide actions specific to a given service.  For example, the
ForkingMixIn class uses service_actions() to clean up zombie
child processes.

Changed in version 3.3: Added service_actions call to the serve_forever method.
