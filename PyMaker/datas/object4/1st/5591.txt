header_store_parse(name, value)Â¶
The name is returned unchanged.  If the input value has a name
attribute and it matches name ignoring case, the value is returned
unchanged.  Otherwise the name and value are passed to
header_factory, and the resulting header object is returned as
the value.  In this case a ValueError is raised if the input value
contains CR or LF characters.
