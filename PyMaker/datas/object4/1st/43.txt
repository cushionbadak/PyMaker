object.__repr__(self)¶
Called by the repr() built-in function to compute the “official” string
representation of an object.  If at all possible, this should look like a
valid Python expression that could be used to recreate an object with the
same value (given an appropriate environment).  If this is not possible, a
string of the form <...some useful description...> should be returned.
The return value must be a string object. If a class defines __repr__()
but not __str__(), then __repr__() is also used when an
“informal” string representation of instances of that class is required.
This is typically used for debugging, so it is important that the representation
is information-rich and unambiguous.
