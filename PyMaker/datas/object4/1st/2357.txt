marshal.dumps(value[, version])Â¶
Return the bytes object that would be written to a file by dump(value, file).  The
value must be a supported type.  Raise a ValueError exception if value
has (or contains an object that has) an unsupported type.
The version argument indicates the data format that dumps should use
(see below).
