Directory Objects¶


class msilib.Directory(database, cab, basedir, physical, logical, default[, componentflags])¶
Create a new directory in the Directory table. There is a current component at
each point in time for the directory, which is either explicitly created through
start_component(), or implicitly when files are added for the first time.
Files are added into the current component, and into the cab file.  To create a
directory, a base directory object needs to be specified (can be None), the
path to the physical directory, and a logical directory name.  default
specifies the DefaultDir slot in the directory table. componentflags specifies
the default flags that new components get.


start_component(component=None, feature=None, flags=None, keyfile=None, uuid=None)¶
Add an entry to the Component table, and make this component the current
component for this directory. If no component name is given, the directory
name is used. If no feature is given, the current feature is used. If no
flags are given, the directory’s default flags are used. If no keyfile
is given, the KeyPath is left null in the Component table.



add_file(file, src=None, version=None, language=None)¶
Add a file to the current component of the directory, starting a new one
if there is no current component. By default, the file name in the source
and the file table will be identical. If the src file is specified, it
is interpreted relative to the current directory. Optionally, a version
and a language can be specified for the entry in the File table.



glob(pattern, exclude=None)¶
Add a list of files to the current component as specified in the glob
pattern.  Individual files can be excluded in the exclude list.



remove_pyc()¶
Remove .pyc files on uninstall.
