exception socket.herrorÂ¶
A subclass of OSError, this exception is raised for
address-related errors, i.e. for functions that use h_errno in the POSIX
C API, including gethostbyname_ex() and gethostbyaddr().
The accompanying value is a pair (h_errno, string) representing an
error returned by a library call.  h_errno is a numeric value, while
string represents the description of h_errno, as returned by the
hstrerror() C function.

Changed in version 3.3: This class was made a subclass of OSError.
