multiprocessing.connection.Client(address[, family[, authkey]])Â¶
Attempt to set up a connection to the listener which is using address
address, returning a Connection.
The type of the connection is determined by family argument, but this can
generally be omitted since it can usually be inferred from the format of
address. (See Address Formats)
If authkey is given and not None, it should be a byte string and will be
used as the secret key for an HMAC-based authentication challenge. No
authentication is done if authkey is None.
AuthenticationError is raised if authentication fails.
See Authentication keys.
