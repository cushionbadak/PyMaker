winsound.MessageBeep(type=MB_OK)¶
Call the underlying MessageBeep() function from the Platform API.  This
plays a sound as specified in the registry.  The type argument specifies which
sound to play; possible values are -1, MB_ICONASTERISK,
MB_ICONEXCLAMATION, MB_ICONHAND, MB_ICONQUESTION, and MB_OK, all
described below.  The value -1 produces a “simple beep”; this is the final
fallback if a sound cannot be played otherwise.  If the system indicates an
error, RuntimeError is raised.
