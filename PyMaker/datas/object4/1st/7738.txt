install(names=None)¶
This method installs gettext() into the built-in namespace,
binding it to _.
If the names parameter is given, it must be a sequence containing the
names of functions you want to install in the builtins namespace in
addition to _().  Supported names are 'gettext', 'ngettext',
'lgettext' and 'lngettext'.
Note that this is only one way, albeit the most convenient way, to make
the _() function available to your application.  Because it affects
the entire application globally, and specifically the built-in namespace,
localized modules should never install _(). Instead, they should use
this code to make _() available to their module:
import gettext
t = gettext.translation('mymodule', ...)
_ = t.gettext


This puts _() only in the module’s global namespace and so only
affects calls within this module.
