class ipaddress.IPv6Network(address, strict=True)¶
Construct an IPv6 network definition.  address can be one of the following:

A string consisting of an IP address and an optional prefix length,
separated by a slash (/).  The IP address is the network address,
and the prefix length must be a single number, the prefix.  If no
prefix length is provided, it’s considered to be /128.
Note that currently expanded netmasks are not supported.  That means
2001:db00::0/24 is a valid argument while 2001:db00::0/ffff:ff00::
not.

An integer that fits into 128 bits.  This is equivalent to a
single-address network, with the network address being address and
the mask being /128.

An integer packed into a bytes object of length 16, big-endian.
The interpretation is similar to an integer address.

A two-tuple of an address description and a netmask, where the address
description is either a string, a 128-bits integer, a 16-bytes packed
integer, or an existing IPv6Address object; and the netmask is an
integer representing the prefix length.


An AddressValueError is raised if address is not a valid IPv6
address.  A NetmaskValueError is raised if the mask is not valid for
an IPv6 address.
If strict is True and host bits are set in the supplied address,
then ValueError is raised.  Otherwise, the host bits are masked out
to determine the appropriate network address.

Changed in version 3.5: Added the two-tuple form for the address constructor parameter.

hosts()¶
Returns an iterator over the usable hosts in the network.  The usable
hosts are all the IP addresses that belong to the network, except the
Subnet-Router anycast address.  For networks with a mask length of 127,
the Subnet-Router anycast address is also included in the result.

is_site_local¶
These attribute is true for the network as a whole if it is true
for both the network address and the broadcast address.
