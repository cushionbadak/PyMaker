wsgiref.util.shift_path_info(environ)¶
Shift a single name from PATH_INFO to SCRIPT_NAME and return the name.
The environ dictionary is modified in-place; use a copy if you need to keep
the original PATH_INFO or SCRIPT_NAME intact.
If there are no remaining path segments in PATH_INFO, None is returned.
Typically, this routine is used to process each portion of a request URI path,
for example to treat the path as a series of dictionary keys. This routine
modifies the passed-in environment to make it suitable for invoking another WSGI
application that is located at the target URI. For example, if there is a WSGI
application at /foo, and the request URI path is /foo/bar/baz, and the
WSGI application at /foo calls shift_path_info(), it will receive the
string “bar”, and the environment will be updated to be suitable for passing to
a WSGI application at /foo/bar.  That is, SCRIPT_NAME will change from
/foo to /foo/bar, and PATH_INFO will change from /bar/baz to
/baz.
When PATH_INFO is just a “/”, this routine returns an empty string and
appends a trailing slash to SCRIPT_NAME, even though empty path segments are
normally ignored, and SCRIPT_NAME doesn’t normally end in a slash.  This is
intentional behavior, to ensure that an application can tell the difference
between URIs ending in /x from ones ending in /x/ when using this
routine to do object traversal.
