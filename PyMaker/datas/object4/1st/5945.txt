set_from(from_, time_=None)¶
Set the “From ” line to from_, which should be specified without a
leading “From ” or trailing newline. For convenience, time_ may be
specified and will be formatted appropriately and appended to from_. If
time_ is specified, it should be a time.struct_time instance, a
tuple suitable for passing to time.strftime(), or True (to use
time.gmtime()).
