4.2.4. Interaction with dynamic featuresÂ¶
Name resolution of free variables occurs at runtime, not at compile time.
This means that the following code will print 42:
i = 10
def f():
    print(i)
i = 42
f()


The eval() and exec() functions do not have access to the full
environment for resolving names.  Names may be resolved in the local and global
namespaces of the caller.  Free variables are not resolved in the nearest
enclosing namespace, but in the global namespace.  [1] The exec() and
eval() functions have optional arguments to override the global and local
namespace.  If only one namespace is specified, it is used for both.
