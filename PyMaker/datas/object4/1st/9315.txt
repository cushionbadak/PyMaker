dataclasses.asdict(instance, *, dict_factory=dict)Â¶
Converts the dataclass instance to a dict (by using the
factory function dict_factory).  Each dataclass is converted
to a dict of its fields, as name: value pairs.  dataclasses, dicts,
lists, and tuples are recursed into.  For example:
@dataclass
class Point:
     x: int
     y: int

@dataclass
class C:
     mylist: List[Point]

p = Point(10, 20)
assert asdict(p) == {'x': 10, 'y': 20}

c = C([Point(0, 0), Point(10, 4)])
assert asdict(c) == {'mylist': [{'x': 0, 'y': 0}, {'x': 10, 'y': 4}]}


Raises TypeError if instance is not a dataclass instance.
