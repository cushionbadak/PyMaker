replace_whitespaceÂ¶
(default: True) If true, after tab expansion but before wrapping,
the wrap() method will replace each whitespace character
with a single space.  The whitespace characters replaced are
as follows: tab, newline, vertical tab, formfeed, and carriage
return ('\t\n\v\f\r').

Note
If expand_tabs is false and replace_whitespace is true,
each tab character will be replaced by a single space, which is not
the same as tab expansion.


Note
If replace_whitespace is false, newlines may appear in the
middle of a line and cause strange output. For this reason, text should
be split into paragraphs (using str.splitlines() or similar)
which are wrapped separately.
