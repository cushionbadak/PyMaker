coroutine drain()Â¶
Wait until it is appropriate to resume writing to the stream.
Example:
writer.write(data)
await writer.drain()


This is a flow control method that interacts with the underlying
IO write buffer.  When the size of the buffer reaches
the high watermark, drain() blocks until the size of the
buffer is drained down to the low watermark and writing can
be resumed.  When there is nothing to wait for, the drain()
returns immediately.
