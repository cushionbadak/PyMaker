getEffectiveLevel()Â¶
Indicates the effective level for this logger. If a value other than
NOTSET has been set using setLevel(), it is returned. Otherwise,
the hierarchy is traversed towards the root until a value other than
NOTSET is found, and that value is returned. The value returned is
an integer, typically one of logging.DEBUG, logging.INFO
etc.
