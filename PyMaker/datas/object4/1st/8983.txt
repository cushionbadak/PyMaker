! statementÂ¶
Execute the (one-line) statement in the context of the current stack frame.
The exclamation point can be omitted unless the first word of the statement
resembles a debugger command.  To set a global variable, you can prefix the
assignment command with a global statement on the same line,
e.g.:
(Pdb) global list_options; list_options = ['-l']
(Pdb)
