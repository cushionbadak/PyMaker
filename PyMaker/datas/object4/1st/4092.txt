ctypes.create_unicode_buffer(init_or_size, size=None)Â¶
This function creates a mutable unicode character buffer. The returned object is
a ctypes array of c_wchar.
init_or_size must be an integer which specifies the size of the array, or a
string which will be used to initialize the array items.
If a string is specified as first argument, the buffer is made one item
larger than the length of the string so that the last element in the array is a
NUL termination character. An integer can be passed as second argument which
allows specifying the size of the array if the length of the string should not
be used.
