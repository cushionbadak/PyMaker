class decimal.OverflowÂ¶
Numerical overflow.
Indicates the exponent is larger than Emax after rounding has
occurred.  If not trapped, the result depends on the rounding mode, either
pulling inward to the largest representable finite number or rounding outward
to Infinity.  In either case, Inexact and Rounded
are also signaled.
