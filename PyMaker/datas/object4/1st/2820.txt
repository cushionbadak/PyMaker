class plistlib.Data(data)¶
Return a “data” wrapper object around the bytes object data.  This is used
in functions converting from/to plists to represent the <data> type
available in plists.
It has one attribute, data, that can be used to retrieve the Python
bytes object stored in it.

Deprecated since version 3.4: Use a bytes object instead.
