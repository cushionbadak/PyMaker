docs:


new_child(m=None)Â¶
Returns a new ChainMap containing a new map followed by
all of the maps in the current instance.  If m is specified,
it becomes the new map at the front of the list of mappings; if not
specified, an empty dict is used, so that a call to d.new_child()
is equivalent to: ChainMap({}, *d.maps).  This method is used for
creating subcontexts that can be updated without altering values in any
of the parent mappings.

Changed in version 3.4: The optional m parameter was added.
