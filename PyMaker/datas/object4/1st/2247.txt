glob.glob(pathname, *, recursive=False)¶
Return a possibly-empty list of path names that match pathname, which must be
a string containing a path specification. pathname can be either absolute
(like /usr/src/Python-1.5/Makefile) or relative (like
../../Tools/*/*.gif), and can contain shell-style wildcards. Broken
symlinks are included in the results (as in the shell).
If recursive is true, the pattern “**” will match any files and zero or
more directories and subdirectories.  If the pattern is followed by an
os.sep, only directories and subdirectories match.

Note
Using the “**” pattern in large directory trees may consume
an inordinate amount of time.


Changed in version 3.5: Support for recursive globs using “**”.
