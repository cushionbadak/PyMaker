getopt.getopt(args, shortopts, longopts=[])Â¶
Parses command line options and parameter list.  args is the argument list to
be parsed, without the leading reference to the running program. Typically, this
means sys.argv[1:]. shortopts is the string of option letters that the
script wants to recognize, with options that require an argument followed by a
colon (':'; i.e., the same format that Unix getopt() uses).

Note
Unlike GNU getopt(), after a non-option argument, all further
arguments are considered also non-options. This is similar to the way
non-GNU Unix systems work.

longopts, if specified, must be a list of strings with the names of the
long options which should be supported.  The leading '--' characters
should not be included in the option name.  Long options which require an
argument should be followed by an equal sign ('=').  Optional arguments
are not supported.  To accept only long options, shortopts should be an
empty string.  Long options on the command line can be recognized so long as
they provide a prefix of the option name that matches exactly one of the
accepted options.  For example, if longopts is ['foo', 'frob'], the
option --fo will match as --foo, but --f will
not match uniquely, so GetoptError will be raised.
The return value consists of two elements: the first is a list of (option,
value) pairs; the second is the list of program arguments left after the
option list was stripped (this is a trailing slice of args).  Each
option-and-value pair returned has the option as its first element, prefixed
with a hyphen for short options (e.g., '-x') or two hyphens for long
options (e.g., '--long-option'), and the option argument as its
second element, or an empty string if the option has no argument.  The
options occur in the list in the same order in which they were found, thus
allowing multiple occurrences.  Long and short options may be mixed.
