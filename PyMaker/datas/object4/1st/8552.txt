setUpClass and tearDownClassÂ¶
These must be implemented as class methods:
import unittest

class Test(unittest.TestCase):
    @classmethod
    def setUpClass(cls):
        cls._connection = createExpensiveConnectionObject()

    @classmethod
    def tearDownClass(cls):
        cls._connection.destroy()


If you want the setUpClass and tearDownClass on base classes called
then you must call up to them yourself. The implementations in
TestCase are empty.
If an exception is raised during a setUpClass then the tests in the class
are not run and the tearDownClass is not run. Skipped classes will not
have setUpClass or tearDownClass run. If the exception is a
SkipTest exception then the class will be reported as having been skipped
instead of as an error.
