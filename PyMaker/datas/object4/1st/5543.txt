parse(fp, headersonly=False)Â¶
Read all the data from the binary file-like object fp, parse the
resulting bytes, and return the message object.  fp must support
both the readline() and the read()
methods.
The bytes contained in fp must be formatted as a block of RFC 5322
(or, if utf8 is True, RFC 6532)
style headers and header continuation lines, optionally preceded by an
envelope header.  The header block is terminated either by the end of the
data or by a blank line.  Following the header block is the body of the
message (which may contain MIME-encoded subparts, including subparts
with a Content-Transfer-Encoding of 8bit).
Optional headersonly is a flag specifying whether to stop parsing after
reading the headers or not.  The default is False, meaning it parses
the entire contents of the file.
