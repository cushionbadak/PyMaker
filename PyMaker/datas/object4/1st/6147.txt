TreeBuilder Objects¶


class xml.etree.ElementTree.TreeBuilder(element_factory=None)¶
Generic element structure builder.  This builder converts a sequence of
start, data, and end method calls to a well-formed element structure.  You
can use this class to build an element structure using a custom XML parser,
or a parser for some other XML-like format.  element_factory, when given,
must be a callable accepting two positional arguments: a tag and
a dict of attributes.  It is expected to return a new element instance.


close()¶
Flushes the builder buffers, and returns the toplevel document
element.  Returns an Element instance.



data(data)¶
Adds text to the current element.  data is a string.  This should be
either a bytestring, or a Unicode string.



end(tag)¶
Closes the current element.  tag is the element name.  Returns the
closed element.



start(tag, attrs)¶
Opens a new element.  tag is the element name.  attrs is a dictionary
containing element attributes.  Returns the opened element.

In addition, a custom TreeBuilder object can provide the
following method:


doctype(name, pubid, system)¶
Handles a doctype declaration.  name is the doctype name.  pubid is
the public identifier.  system is the system identifier.  This method
does not exist on the default TreeBuilder class.

New in version 3.2.
