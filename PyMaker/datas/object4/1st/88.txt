object.__len__(self)¶
Called to implement the built-in function len().  Should return the length
of the object, an integer >= 0.  Also, an object that doesn’t define a
__bool__() method and whose __len__() method returns zero is
considered to be false in a Boolean context.

CPython implementation detail: In CPython, the length is required to be at most sys.maxsize.
If the length is larger than sys.maxsize some features (such as
len()) may raise OverflowError.  To prevent raising
OverflowError by truth value testing, an object must define a
__bool__() method.
