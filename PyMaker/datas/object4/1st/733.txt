get_field(field_name, args, kwargs)¶
Given field_name as returned by parse() (see above), convert it to
an object to be formatted.  Returns a tuple (obj, used_key).  The default
version takes strings of the form defined in PEP 3101, such as
“0[name]” or “label.title”.  args and kwargs are as passed in to
vformat().  The return value used_key has the same meaning as the
key parameter to get_value().
