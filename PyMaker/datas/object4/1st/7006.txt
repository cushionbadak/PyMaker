NNTP.xover(start, end, *, file=None)Â¶
Send an XOVER command.  start and end are article numbers
delimiting the range of articles to select.  The return value is the
same of for over().  It is recommended to use over()
instead, since it will automatically use the newer OVER command
if available.
