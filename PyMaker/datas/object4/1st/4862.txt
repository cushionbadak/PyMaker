docs:


asyncio.ensure_future(obj, *, loop=None)Â¶
Return:

obj argument as is, if obj is a Future,
a Task, or a Future-like object (isfuture()
is used for the test.)
a Task object wrapping obj, if obj is a
coroutine (iscoroutine() is used for the test.)
a Task object that would await on obj, if obj is an
awaitable (inspect.isawaitable() is used for the test.)

If obj is neither of the above a TypeError is raised.

Important
See also the create_task() function which is the
preferred way for creating new Tasks.


Changed in version 3.5.1: The function accepts any awaitable object.
