@abc.abstractstaticmethodÂ¶

New in version 3.2.


Deprecated since version 3.3: It is now possible to use staticmethod with
abstractmethod(), making this decorator redundant.

A subclass of the built-in staticmethod(), indicating an abstract
staticmethod. Otherwise it is similar to abstractmethod().
This special case is deprecated, as the staticmethod() decorator
is now correctly identified as abstract when applied to an abstract
method:
class C(ABC):
    @staticmethod
    @abstractmethod
    def my_abstract_staticmethod(...):
        ...
