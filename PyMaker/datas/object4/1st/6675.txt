HTTPRedirectHandler.redirect_request(req, fp, code, msg, hdrs, newurl)¶
Return a Request or None in response to a redirect. This is called
by the default implementations of the http_error_30*() methods when a
redirection is received from the server.  If a redirection should take place,
return a new Request to allow http_error_30*() to perform the
redirect to newurl.  Otherwise, raise HTTPError if
no other handler should try to handle this URL, or return None if you
can’t but another handler might.

Note
The default implementation of this method does not strictly follow RFC 2616,
which says that 301 and 302 responses to POST requests must not be
automatically redirected without confirmation by the user.  In reality, browsers
do allow automatic redirection of these responses, changing the POST to a
GET, and the default implementation reproduces this behavior.
