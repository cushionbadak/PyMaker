HTTPConnection.set_debuglevel(level)Â¶
Set the debugging level.  The default debug level is 0, meaning no
debugging output is printed.  Any value greater than 0 will cause all
currently defined debug output to be printed to stdout.  The debuglevel
is passed to any new HTTPResponse objects that are created.

New in version 3.1.
