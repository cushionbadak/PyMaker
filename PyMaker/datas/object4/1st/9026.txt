autorange(callback=None)¶
Automatically determine how many times to call timeit().
This is a convenience function that calls timeit() repeatedly
so that the total time >= 0.2 second, returning the eventual
(number of loops, time taken for that number of loops). It calls
timeit() with increasing numbers from the sequence 1, 2, 5,
10, 20, 50, … until the time taken is at least 0.2 second.
If callback is given and is not None, it will be called after
each trial with two arguments: callback(number, time_taken).

New in version 3.6.
