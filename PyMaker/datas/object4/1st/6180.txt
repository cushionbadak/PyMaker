DOMImplementation.createDocument(namespaceUri, qualifiedName, doctype)Â¶
Return a new Document object (the root of the DOM), with a child
Element object having the given namespaceUri and qualifiedName. The
doctype must be a DocumentType object created by
createDocumentType(), or None. In the Python DOM API, the first two
arguments can also be None in order to indicate that no Element
child is to be created.
