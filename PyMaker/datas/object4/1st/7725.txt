gettext.install(domain, localedir=None, codeset=None, names=None)¶
This installs the function _() in Python’s builtins namespace, based on
domain, localedir, and codeset which are passed to the function
translation().
For the names parameter, please see the description of the translation
object’s install() method.
As seen below, you usually mark the strings in your application that are
candidates for translation, by wrapping them in a call to the _()
function, like this:
print(_('This string will be translated.'))


For convenience, you want the _() function to be installed in Python’s
builtins namespace, so it is easily accessible in all modules of your
application.
