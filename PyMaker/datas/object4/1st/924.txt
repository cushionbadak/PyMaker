readline.get_history_length()¶

readline.set_history_length(length)¶
Set or return the desired number of lines to save in the history file.
The write_history_file() function uses this value to truncate
the history file, by calling history_truncate_file() in
the underlying library.  Negative values imply
unlimited history file size.
