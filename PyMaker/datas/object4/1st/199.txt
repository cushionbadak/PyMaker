__cached__¶
__file__ is optional. If set, this attribute’s value must be a
string.  The import system may opt to leave __file__ unset if it
has no semantic meaning (e.g. a module loaded from a database).
If __file__ is set, it may also be appropriate to set the
__cached__ attribute which is the path to any compiled version of
the code (e.g. byte-compiled file). The file does not need to exist
to set this attribute; the path can simply point to where the
compiled file would exist (see PEP 3147).
It is also appropriate to set __cached__ when __file__ is not
set.  However, that scenario is quite atypical.  Ultimately, the
loader is what makes use of __file__ and/or __cached__.  So
if a loader can load from a cached module but otherwise does not load
from a file, that atypical scenario may be appropriate.
