shlex.wordcharsÂ¶
The string of characters that will accumulate into multi-character tokens.  By
default, includes all ASCII alphanumerics and underscore.  In POSIX mode, the
accented characters in the Latin-1 set are also included.  If
punctuation_chars is not empty, the characters ~-./*?=, which can
appear in filename specifications and command line parameters, will also be
included in this attribute, and any characters which appear in
punctuation_chars will be removed from wordchars if they are present
there.
