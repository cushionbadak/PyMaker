os.getlogin()Â¶
Return the name of the user logged in on the controlling terminal of the
process.  For most purposes, it is more useful to use
getpass.getuser() since the latter checks the environment variables
LOGNAME or USERNAME to find out who the user is, and
falls back to pwd.getpwuid(os.getuid())[0] to get the login name of the
current real user id.
Availability: Unix, Windows.
