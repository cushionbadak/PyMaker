wait_for(predicate, timeout=None)Â¶
Wait until a condition evaluates to true.  predicate should be a
callable which result will be interpreted as a boolean value.
A timeout may be provided giving the maximum time to wait.
This utility method may call wait() repeatedly until the predicate
is satisfied, or until a timeout occurs. The return value is
the last return value of the predicate and will evaluate to
False if the method timed out.
Ignoring the timeout feature, calling this method is roughly equivalent to
writing:
while not predicate():
    cv.wait()


Therefore, the same rules apply as with wait(): The lock must be
held when called and is re-acquired on return.  The predicate is evaluated
with the lock held.

New in version 3.2.
