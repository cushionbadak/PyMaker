Tab Options¶
There are also specific options for tabs:







Option
Description



state
Either “normal”, “disabled” or “hidden”. If “disabled”, then
the tab is not selectable. If “hidden”, then the tab is not
shown.

sticky
Specifies how the child window is positioned within the pane
area. Value is a string containing zero or more of the
characters “n”, “s”, “e” or “w”. Each letter refers to a
side (north, south, east or west) that the child window will
stick to, as per the grid() geometry manager.

padding
Specifies the amount of extra space to add between the
notebook and this pane. Syntax is the same as for the option
padding used by this widget.

text
Specifies a text to be displayed in the tab.

image
Specifies an image to display in the tab. See the option
image described in Widget.

compound
Specifies how to display the image relative to the text, in
the case both options text and image are present. See
Label Options for legal values.

underline
Specifies the index (0-based) of a character to underline in
the text string. The underlined character is used for
mnemonic activation if Notebook.enable_traversal() is
called.
