importlib.util.resolve_name(name, package)Â¶
Resolve a relative module name to an absolute one.
If  name has no leading dots, then name is simply returned. This
allows for usage such as
importlib.util.resolve_name('sys', __package__) without doing a
check to see if the package argument is needed.
ValueError is raised if name is a relative module name but
package is a false value (e.g. None or the empty string).
ValueError is also raised a relative name would escape its containing
package (e.g. requesting ..bacon from within the spam package).

New in version 3.3.
