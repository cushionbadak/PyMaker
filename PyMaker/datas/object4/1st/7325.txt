Binary Objects¶


class xmlrpc.client.Binary¶
This class may be initialized from bytes data (which may include NULs). The
primary access to the content of a Binary object is provided by an
attribute:


data¶
The binary data encapsulated by the Binary instance.  The data is
provided as a bytes object.

Binary objects have the following methods, supported mainly for
internal use by the marshalling/unmarshalling code:


decode(bytes)¶
Accept a base64 bytes object and decode it as the instance’s new data.



encode(out)¶
Write the XML-RPC base 64 encoding of this binary item to the out stream object.
The encoded data will have newlines every 76 characters as per
RFC 2045 section 6.8,
which was the de facto standard base64 specification when the
XML-RPC spec was written.

It also supports certain of Python’s built-in operators through __eq__()
and __ne__() methods.

Example usage of the binary objects.  We’re going to transfer an image over
XMLRPC:
from xmlrpc.server import SimpleXMLRPCServer
import xmlrpc.client

def python_logo():
    with open("python_logo.jpg", "rb") as handle:
        return xmlrpc.client.Binary(handle.read())

server = SimpleXMLRPCServer(("localhost", 8000))
print("Listening on port 8000...")
server.register_function(python_logo, 'python_logo')

server.serve_forever()


The client gets the image and saves it to a file:
import xmlrpc.client

proxy = xmlrpc.client.ServerProxy("http://localhost:8000/")
with open("fetched_python_logo.jpg", "wb") as handle:
    handle.write(proxy.python_logo().data)
