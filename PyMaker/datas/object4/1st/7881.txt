Set turtle shape to shape with given name or, if name is not given, return

shape dictionary.  Initially there are the following polygon shapes: “arrow”,
“turtle”, “circle”, “square”, “triangle”, “classic”.  To learn about how to
deal with shapes see Screen method register_shape().
>>> turtle.shape()

>>> turtle.shape("turtle")
>>> turtle.shape()
'turtle'
