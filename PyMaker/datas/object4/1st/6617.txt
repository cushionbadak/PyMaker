urllib.request.build_opener([handler, ...])Â¶
Return an OpenerDirector instance, which chains the handlers in the
order given. handlers can be either instances of BaseHandler, or
subclasses of BaseHandler (in which case it must be possible to call
the constructor without any parameters).  Instances of the following classes
will be in front of the handlers, unless the handlers contain them,
instances of them or subclasses of them: ProxyHandler (if proxy
settings are detected), UnknownHandler, HTTPHandler,
HTTPDefaultErrorHandler, HTTPRedirectHandler,
FTPHandler, FileHandler, HTTPErrorProcessor.
If the Python installation has SSL support (i.e., if the ssl module
can be imported), HTTPSHandler will also be added.
A BaseHandler subclass may also change its handler_order
attribute to modify its position in the handlers list.
