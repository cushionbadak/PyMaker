How can I mimic CGI form submission (METHOD=POST)?¶
I would like to retrieve web pages that are the result of POSTing a form. Is
there existing code that would let me do this easily?
Yes. Here’s a simple example that uses urllib.request:
#!/usr/local/bin/python

import urllib.request

# build the query string
qs = "First=Josephine&MI=Q&Last=Public"

# connect and send the server a path
req = urllib.request.urlopen('http://www.some-server.out-there'
                             '/cgi-bin/some-cgi-script', data=qs)
with req:
    msg, hdrs = req.read(), req.info()


Note that in general for percent-encoded POST operations, query strings must be
quoted using urllib.parse.urlencode().  For example, to send
name=Guy Steele, Jr.:
>>> import urllib.parse
>>> urllib.parse.urlencode({'name': 'Guy Steele, Jr.'})
'name=Guy+Steele%2C+Jr.'
