wShowWindowÂ¶
If dwFlags specifies STARTF_USESHOWWINDOW, this attribute
can be any of the values that can be specified in the nCmdShow
parameter for the
ShowWindow
function, except for SW_SHOWDEFAULT. Otherwise, this attribute is
ignored.
SW_HIDE is provided for this attribute. It is used when
Popen is called with shell=True.
