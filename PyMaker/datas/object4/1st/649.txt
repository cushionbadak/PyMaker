exception NotImplementedError¶
This exception is derived from RuntimeError.  In user defined base
classes, abstract methods should raise this exception when they require
derived classes to override the method, or while the class is being
developed to indicate that the real implementation still needs to be added.

Note
It should not be used to indicate that an operator or method is not
meant to be supported at all – in that case either leave the operator /
method undefined or, if a subclass, set it to None.


Note
NotImplementedError and NotImplemented are not interchangeable,
even though they have similar names and purposes.  See
NotImplemented for details on when to use it.
