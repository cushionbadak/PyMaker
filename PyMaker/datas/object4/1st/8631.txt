unittest.mock.seal(mock)¶
Seal will disable the automatic creation of mocks when accessing an attribute of
the mock being sealed or any of its attributes that are already mocks recursively.
If a mock instance with a name or a spec is assigned to an attribute
it won’t be considered in the sealing chain. This allows one to prevent seal from
fixing part of the mock object.
>>> mock = Mock()
>>> mock.submock.attribute1 = 2
>>> mock.not_submock = mock.Mock(name="sample_name")
>>> seal(mock)
>>> mock.new_attribute  # This will raise AttributeError.
>>> mock.submock.attribute2  # This will raise AttributeError.
>>> mock.not_submock.attribute2  # This won't raise.



New in version 3.7.
