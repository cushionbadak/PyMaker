Parsing Rules¶
When operating in non-POSIX mode, shlex will try to obey to the
following rules.

Quote characters are not recognized within words (Do"Not"Separate is
parsed as the single word Do"Not"Separate);
Escape characters are not recognized;
Enclosing characters in quotes preserve the literal value of all characters
within the quotes;
Closing quotes separate words ("Do"Separate is parsed as "Do" and
Separate);
If whitespace_split is False, any character not
declared to be a word character, whitespace, or a quote will be returned as
a single-character token. If it is True, shlex will only
split words in whitespaces;
EOF is signaled with an empty string ('');
It’s not possible to parse empty strings, even if quoted.

When operating in POSIX mode, shlex will try to obey to the
following parsing rules.

Quotes are stripped out, and do not separate words ("Do"Not"Separate" is
parsed as the single word DoNotSeparate);
Non-quoted escape characters (e.g. '\') preserve the literal value of the
next character that follows;
Enclosing characters in quotes which are not part of
escapedquotes (e.g. "'") preserve the literal value
of all characters within the quotes;
Enclosing characters in quotes which are part of
escapedquotes (e.g. '"') preserves the literal value
of all characters within the quotes, with the exception of the characters
mentioned in escape.  The escape characters retain its
special meaning only when followed by the quote in use, or the escape
character itself. Otherwise the escape character will be considered a
normal character.
EOF is signaled with a None value;
Quoted empty strings ('') are allowed.
