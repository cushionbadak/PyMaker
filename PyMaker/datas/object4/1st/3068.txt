os.lstat(path, *, dir_fd=None)Â¶
Perform the equivalent of an lstat() system call on the given path.
Similar to stat(), but does not follow symbolic links. Return a
stat_result object.
On platforms that do not support symbolic links, this is an alias for
stat().
As of Python 3.3, this is equivalent to os.stat(path, dir_fd=dir_fd,
follow_symlinks=False).
This function can also support paths relative to directory descriptors.
