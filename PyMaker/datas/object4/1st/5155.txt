ssl.get_server_certificate(addr, ssl_version=PROTOCOL_TLS, ca_certs=None)¶
Given the address addr of an SSL-protected server, as a (hostname,
port-number) pair, fetches the server’s certificate, and returns it as a
PEM-encoded string.  If ssl_version is specified, uses that version of
the SSL protocol to attempt to connect to the server.  If ca_certs is
specified, it should be a file containing a list of root certificates, the
same format as used for the same parameter in
SSLContext.wrap_socket().  The call will attempt to validate the
server certificate against that set of root certificates, and will fail
if the validation attempt fails.

Changed in version 3.3: This function is now IPv6-compatible.


Changed in version 3.5: The default ssl_version is changed from PROTOCOL_SSLv3 to
PROTOCOL_TLS for maximum compatibility with modern servers.
