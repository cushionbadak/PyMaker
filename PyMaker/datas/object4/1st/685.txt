exception BlockingIOError¶
Raised when an operation would block on an object (e.g. socket) set
for non-blocking operation.
Corresponds to errno EAGAIN, EALREADY,
EWOULDBLOCK and EINPROGRESS.
In addition to those of OSError, BlockingIOError can have
one more attribute:


characters_written¶
An integer containing the number of characters written to the stream
before it blocked.  This attribute is available when using the
buffered I/O classes from the io module.
