Credits¶
BLAKE2 was designed by Jean-Philippe Aumasson, Samuel Neves, Zooko
Wilcox-O’Hearn, and Christian Winnerlein based on SHA-3 finalist BLAKE
created by Jean-Philippe Aumasson, Luca Henzen, Willi Meier, and
Raphael C.-W. Phan.
It uses core algorithm from ChaCha cipher designed by Daniel J.  Bernstein.
The stdlib implementation is based on pyblake2 module. It was written by
Dmitry Chestnykh based on C implementation written by Samuel Neves. The
documentation was copied from pyblake2 and written by Dmitry Chestnykh.
The C code was partly rewritten for Python by Christian Heimes.

implementation, extension code, and this documentation:
