class xml.sax.xmlreader.IncrementalParser¶
In some cases, it is desirable not to parse an input source at once, but to feed
chunks of the document as they get available. Note that the reader will normally
not read the entire file, but read it in chunks as well; still parse()
won’t return until the entire document is processed. So these interfaces should
be used if the blocking behaviour of parse() is not desirable.
When the parser is instantiated it is ready to begin accepting data from the
feed method immediately. After parsing has been finished with a call to close
the reset method must be called to make the parser ready to accept new data,
either from feed or using the parse method.
Note that these methods must not be called during parsing, that is, after
parse has been called and before it returns.
By default, the class also implements the parse method of the XMLReader
interface using the feed, close and reset methods of the IncrementalParser
interface as a convenience to SAX 2.0 driver writers.
