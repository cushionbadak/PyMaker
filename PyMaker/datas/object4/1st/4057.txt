ArraysÂ¶
Arrays are sequences, containing a fixed number of instances of the same type.
The recommended way to create array types is by multiplying a data type with a
positive integer:
TenPointsArrayType = POINT * 10


Here is an example of a somewhat artificial data type, a structure containing 4
POINTs among other stuff:
>>> from ctypes import *
>>> class POINT(Structure):
...     _fields_ = ("x", c_int), ("y", c_int)
...
>>> class MyStruct(Structure):
...     _fields_ = [("a", c_int),
...                 ("b", c_float),
...                 ("point_array", POINT * 4)]
>>>
>>> print(len(MyStruct().point_array))
4
>>>


Instances are created in the usual way, by calling the class:
arr = TenPointsArrayType()
for pt in arr:
    print(pt.x, pt.y)


The above code print a series of 0 0 lines, because the array contents is
initialized to zeros.
Initializers of the correct type can also be specified:
>>> from ctypes import *
>>> TenIntegers = c_int * 10
>>> ii = TenIntegers(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)
>>> print(ii)
<c_long_Array_10 object at 0x...>
>>> for i in ii: print(i, end=" ")
...
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
>>>
