class urllib.request.HTTPDigestAuthHandler(password_mgr=None)Â¶
Handle authentication with the remote host. password_mgr, if given, should
be something that is compatible with HTTPPasswordMgr; refer to
section HTTPPasswordMgr Objects for information on the interface that must
be supported. When both Digest Authentication Handler and Basic
Authentication Handler are both added, Digest Authentication is always tried
first. If the Digest Authentication returns a 40x response again, it is sent
to Basic Authentication handler to Handle.  This Handler method will raise a
ValueError when presented with an authentication scheme other than
Digest or Basic.

Changed in version 3.3: Raise ValueError on unsupported Authentication Scheme.
