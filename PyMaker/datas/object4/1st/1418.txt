types.GetSetDescriptorTypeÂ¶
The type of objects defined in extension modules with PyGetSetDef, such
as FrameType.f_locals or array.array.typecode.  This type is used as
descriptor for object attributes; it has the same purpose as the
property type, but for classes defined in extension modules.
