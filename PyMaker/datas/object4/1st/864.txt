drop_whitespaceÂ¶
(default: True) If true, whitespace at the beginning and ending of
every line (after wrapping but before indenting) is dropped.
Whitespace at the beginning of the paragraph, however, is not dropped
if non-whitespace follows it.  If whitespace being dropped takes up an
entire line, the whole line is dropped.
