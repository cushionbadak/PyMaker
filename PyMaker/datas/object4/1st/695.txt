exception InterruptedErrorÂ¶
Raised when a system call is interrupted by an incoming signal.
Corresponds to errno EINTR.

Changed in version 3.5: Python now retries system calls when a syscall is interrupted by a
signal, except if the signal handler raises an exception (see PEP 475
for the rationale), instead of raising InterruptedError.
