re.IGNORECASE¶
Perform case-insensitive matching; expressions like [A-Z] will also
match lowercase letters.  Full Unicode matching (such as Ü matching
ü) also works unless the re.ASCII flag is used to disable
non-ASCII matches.  The current locale does not change the effect of this
flag unless the re.LOCALE flag is also used.
Corresponds to the inline flag (?i).
Note that when the Unicode patterns [a-z] or [A-Z] are used in
combination with the IGNORECASE flag, they will match the 52 ASCII
letters and 4 additional non-ASCII letters: ‘İ’ (U+0130, Latin capital
letter I with dot above), ‘ı’ (U+0131, Latin small letter dotless i),
‘ſ’ (U+017F, Latin small letter long s) and ‘K’ (U+212A, Kelvin sign).
If the ASCII flag is used, only letters ‘a’ to ‘z’
and ‘A’ to ‘Z’ are matched.
