ZipFile.extractall(path=None, members=None, pwd=None)Â¶
Extract all members from the archive to the current working directory.  path
specifies a different directory to extract to.  members is optional and must
be a subset of the list returned by namelist().  pwd is the password
used for encrypted files.

Warning
Never extract archives from untrusted sources without prior inspection.
It is possible that files are created outside of path, e.g. members
that have absolute filenames starting with "/" or filenames with two
dots "..".  This module attempts to prevent that.
See extract() note.


Changed in version 3.6: Calling extractall() on a closed ZipFile will raise a
ValueError.  Previously, a RuntimeError was raised.


Changed in version 3.6.2: The path parameter accepts a path-like object.
