mimetypes.read_mime_types(filename)Â¶
Load the type map given in the file filename, if it exists.  The type map is
returned as a dictionary mapping filename extensions, including the leading dot
('.'), to strings of the form 'type/subtype'.  If the file filename
does not exist or cannot be read, None is returned.
