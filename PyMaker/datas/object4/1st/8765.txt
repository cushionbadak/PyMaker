test.support.run_unittest(*classes)Â¶
Execute unittest.TestCase subclasses passed to the function. The
function scans the classes for methods starting with the prefix test_
and executes the tests individually.
It is also legal to pass strings as parameters; these should be keys in
sys.modules. Each associated module will be scanned by
unittest.TestLoader.loadTestsFromModule(). This is usually seen in the
following test_main() function:
def test_main():
    support.run_unittest(__name__)


This will run all tests defined in the named module.
