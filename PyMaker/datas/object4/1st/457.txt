str.translate(table)Â¶
Return a copy of the string in which each character has been mapped through
the given translation table.  The table must be an object that implements
indexing via __getitem__(), typically a mapping or
sequence.  When indexed by a Unicode ordinal (an integer), the
table object can do any of the following: return a Unicode ordinal or a
string, to map the character to one or more other characters; return
None, to delete the character from the return string; or raise a
LookupError exception, to map the character to itself.
You can use str.maketrans() to create a translation map from
character-to-character mappings in different formats.
See also the codecs module for a more flexible approach to custom
character mappings.
