unittest.registerResult(result)¶
Register a TestResult object for control-c handling. Registering a
result stores a weak reference to it, so it doesn’t prevent the result from
being garbage collected.
Registering a TestResult object has no side-effects if control-c
handling is not enabled, so test frameworks can unconditionally register
all results they create independently of whether or not handling is enabled.
