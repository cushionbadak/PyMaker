loop.add_signal_handler(signum, callback, *args)Â¶
Set callback as the handler for the signum signal.
The callback will be invoked by loop, along with other queued callbacks
and runnable coroutines of that event loop. Unlike signal handlers
registered using signal.signal(), a callback registered with this
function is allowed to interact with the event loop.
Raise ValueError if the signal number is invalid or uncatchable.
Raise RuntimeError if there is a problem setting up the handler.
Use functools.partial() to pass keyword arguments to callback.
Like signal.signal(), this function must be invoked in the main
thread.
