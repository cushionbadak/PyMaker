crypt.mksalt(method=None, *, rounds=None)Â¶
Return a randomly generated salt of the specified method.  If no
method is given, the strongest method available as returned by
methods() is used.
The return value is a string suitable for passing as the salt argument
to crypt().
rounds specifies the number of rounds for METHOD_SHA256,
METHOD_SHA512 and METHOD_BLOWFISH.
For METHOD_SHA256 and METHOD_SHA512 it must be an integer between
1000 and 999_999_999, the default is 5000.  For
METHOD_BLOWFISH it must be a power of two between 16 (24)
and 2_147_483_648 (231), the default is 4096
(212).

New in version 3.3.
