wait(timeout=None)Â¶
Block until the internal flag is true.  If the internal flag is true on
entry, return immediately.  Otherwise, block until another thread calls
set() to set the flag to true, or until the optional timeout occurs.
When the timeout argument is present and not None, it should be a
floating point number specifying a timeout for the operation in seconds
(or fractions thereof).
This method returns true if and only if the internal flag has been set to
true, either before the wait call or after the wait starts, so it will
always return True except if a timeout is given and the operation
times out.

Changed in version 3.1: Previously, the method always returned None.
