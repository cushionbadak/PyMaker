IntroductionÂ¶
SQLite natively supports the following types: NULL, INTEGER,
REAL, TEXT, BLOB.
The following Python types can thus be sent to SQLite without any problem:






Python type
SQLite type



None
NULL

int
INTEGER

float
REAL

str
TEXT

bytes
BLOB



This is how SQLite types are converted to Python types by default:






SQLite type
Python type



NULL
None

INTEGER
int

REAL
float

TEXT
depends on text_factory,
str by default

BLOB
bytes



The type system of the sqlite3 module is extensible in two ways: you can
store additional Python types in a SQLite database via object adaptation, and
you can let the sqlite3 module convert SQLite types to different Python
types via converters.
