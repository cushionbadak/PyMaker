Base classes¶
The following exceptions are used mostly as base classes for other exceptions.


exception BaseException¶
The base class for all built-in exceptions.  It is not meant to be directly
inherited by user-defined classes (for that, use Exception).  If
str() is called on an instance of this class, the representation of
the argument(s) to the instance are returned, or the empty string when
there were no arguments.


args¶
The tuple of arguments given to the exception constructor.  Some built-in
exceptions (like OSError) expect a certain number of arguments and
assign a special meaning to the elements of this tuple, while others are
usually called only with a single string giving an error message.



with_traceback(tb)¶
This method sets tb as the new traceback for the exception and returns
the exception object.  It is usually used in exception handling code like
this:
try:
    ...
except SomeException:
    tb = sys.exc_info()[2]
    raise OtherException(...).with_traceback(tb)






exception Exception¶
All built-in, non-system-exiting exceptions are derived from this class.  All
user-defined exceptions should also be derived from this class.



exception ArithmeticError¶
The base class for those built-in exceptions that are raised for various
arithmetic errors: OverflowError, ZeroDivisionError,
FloatingPointError.



exception BufferError¶
Raised when a buffer related operation cannot be
performed.



exception LookupError¶
The base class for the exceptions that are raised when a key or index used on
a mapping or sequence is invalid: IndexError, KeyError.  This
can be raised directly by codecs.lookup().
