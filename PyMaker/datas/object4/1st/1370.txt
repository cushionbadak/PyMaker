class weakref.WeakKeyDictionary([dict])¶
Mapping class that references keys weakly.  Entries in the dictionary will be
discarded when there is no longer a strong reference to the key.  This can be
used to associate additional data with an object owned by other parts of an
application without adding attributes to those objects.  This can be especially
useful with objects that override attribute accesses.

Note
Caution: Because a WeakKeyDictionary is built on top of a Python
dictionary, it must not change size when iterating over it.  This can be
difficult to ensure for a WeakKeyDictionary because actions
performed by the program during iteration may cause items in the
dictionary to vanish “by magic” (as a side effect of garbage collection).
