inspect.stack(context=1)¶
Return a list of frame records for the caller’s stack.  The first entry in the
returned list represents the caller; the last entry represents the outermost
call on the stack.

Changed in version 3.5: A list of named tuples
FrameInfo(frame, filename, lineno, function, code_context, index)
is returned.
