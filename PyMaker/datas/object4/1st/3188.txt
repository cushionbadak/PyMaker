os.P_DETACH¶

os.P_OVERLAY¶
Possible values for the mode parameter to the spawn* family of
functions.  These are less portable than those listed above. P_DETACH
is similar to P_NOWAIT, but the new process is detached from the
console of the calling process. If P_OVERLAY is used, the current
process will be replaced; the spawn* function will not return.
Availability: Windows.
