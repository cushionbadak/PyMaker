docs:


set_payload(payload, charset=None)¶
Set the entire message object’s payload to payload.  It is the client’s
responsibility to ensure the payload invariants.  Optional charset sets
the message’s default character set; see set_charset() for details.
This is a legacy method.  On the
EmailMessage class its functionality is
replaced by set_content().
