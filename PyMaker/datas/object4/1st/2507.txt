One-shot (de)compression¶


bz2.compress(data, compresslevel=9)¶
Compress data.
compresslevel, if given, must be a number between 1 and 9. The
default is 9.
For incremental compression, use a BZ2Compressor instead.



bz2.decompress(data)¶
Decompress data.
If data is the concatenation of multiple compressed streams, decompress
all of the streams.
For incremental decompression, use a BZ2Decompressor instead.

Changed in version 3.3: Support for multi-stream inputs was added.
