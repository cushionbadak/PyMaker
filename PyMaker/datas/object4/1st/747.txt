string.capwords(s, sep=None)Â¶
Split the argument into words using str.split(), capitalize each word
using str.capitalize(), and join the capitalized words using
str.join().  If the optional second argument sep is absent
or None, runs of whitespace characters are replaced by a single space
and leading and trailing whitespace are removed, otherwise sep is used to
split and join the words.
