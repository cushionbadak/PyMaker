curses.use_env(flag)Â¶
If used, this function should be called before initscr() or newterm are
called.  When flag is False, the values of lines and columns specified in the
terminfo database will be used, even if environment variables LINES
and COLUMNS (used by default) are set, or if curses is running in a
window (in which case default behavior would be to use the window size if
LINES and COLUMNS are not set).
