assertLogs(logger=None, level=None)¶
A context manager to test that at least one message is logged on
the logger or one of its children, with at least the given
level.
If given, logger should be a logging.Logger object or a
str giving the name of a logger.  The default is the root
logger, which will catch all messages.
If given, level should be either a numeric logging level or
its string equivalent (for example either "ERROR" or
logging.ERROR).  The default is logging.INFO.
The test passes if at least one message emitted inside the with
block matches the logger and level conditions, otherwise it fails.
The object returned by the context manager is a recording helper
which keeps tracks of the matching log messages.  It has two
attributes:


records¶
A list of logging.LogRecord objects of the matching
log messages.



output¶
A list of str objects with the formatted output of
matching messages.

Example:
with self.assertLogs('foo', level='INFO') as cm:
   logging.getLogger('foo').info('first message')
   logging.getLogger('foo.bar').error('second message')
self.assertEqual(cm.output, ['INFO:foo:first message',
                             'ERROR:foo.bar:second message'])



New in version 3.4.
