oss_mixer_device.controls()¶
This method returns a bitmask specifying the available mixer controls (“Control”
being a specific mixable “channel”, such as SOUND_MIXER_PCM or
SOUND_MIXER_SYNTH).  This bitmask indicates a subset of all available
mixer controls—the SOUND_MIXER_* constants defined at module level.
To determine if, for example, the current mixer object supports a PCM mixer, use
the following Python code:
mixer=ossaudiodev.openmixer()
if mixer.controls() & (1 << ossaudiodev.SOUND_MIXER_PCM):
    # PCM is supported
    ... code ...


For most purposes, the SOUND_MIXER_VOLUME (master volume) and
SOUND_MIXER_PCM controls should suffice—but code that uses the mixer
should be flexible when it comes to choosing mixer controls.  On the Gravis
Ultrasound, for example, SOUND_MIXER_VOLUME does not exist.
