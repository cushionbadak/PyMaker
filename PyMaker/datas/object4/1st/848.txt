Differ Objects¶
Note that Differ-generated deltas make no claim to be minimal
diffs. To the contrary, minimal diffs are often counter-intuitive, because they
synch up anywhere possible, sometimes accidental matches 100 pages apart.
Restricting synch points to contiguous matches preserves some notion of
locality, at the occasional cost of producing a longer diff.
The Differ class has this constructor:


class difflib.Differ(linejunk=None, charjunk=None)
Optional keyword parameters linejunk and charjunk are for filter functions
(or None):
linejunk: A function that accepts a single string argument, and returns true
if the string is junk.  The default is None, meaning that no line is
considered junk.
charjunk: A function that accepts a single character argument (a string of
length 1), and returns true if the character is junk. The default is None,
meaning that no character is considered junk.
These junk-filtering functions speed up matching to find
differences and do not cause any differing lines or characters to
be ignored.  Read the description of the
find_longest_match() method’s isjunk
parameter for an explanation.
Differ objects are used (deltas generated) via a single method:


compare(a, b)¶
Compare two sequences of lines, and generate the delta (a sequence of lines).
Each sequence must contain individual single-line strings ending with
newlines.  Such sequences can be obtained from the
readlines() method of file-like objects.  The delta
generated also consists of newline-terminated strings, ready to be
printed as-is via the writelines() method of a
file-like object.
