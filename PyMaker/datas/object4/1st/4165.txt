class ctypes.Array(*args)¶
Abstract base class for arrays.
The recommended way to create concrete array types is by multiplying any
ctypes data type with a positive integer.  Alternatively, you can subclass
this type and define _length_ and _type_ class variables.
Array elements can be read and written using standard
subscript and slice accesses; for slice reads, the resulting object is
not itself an Array.


_length_¶
A positive integer specifying the number of elements in the array.
Out-of-range subscripts result in an IndexError. Will be
returned by len().



_type_¶
Specifies the type of each element in the array.

Array subclass constructors accept positional arguments, used to
initialize the elements in order.
