Codec.decode(input[, errors])¶
Decodes the object input and returns a tuple (output object, length
consumed).  For instance, for a text encoding, decoding converts
a bytes object encoded using a particular
character set encoding to a string object.
For text encodings and bytes-to-bytes codecs,
input must be a bytes object or one which provides the read-only
buffer interface – for example, buffer objects and memory mapped files.
The errors argument defines the error handling to apply.
It defaults to 'strict' handling.
The method may not store state in the Codec instance. Use
StreamReader for codecs which have to keep state in order to make
decoding efficient.
The decoder must be able to handle zero length input and return an empty object
of the output object type in this situation.
