SSLContext.set_ciphers(ciphers)Â¶
Set the available ciphers for sockets created with this context.
It should be a string in the OpenSSL cipher list format.
If no cipher can be selected (because compile-time options or other
configuration forbids use of all the specified ciphers), an
SSLError will be raised.

Note
when connected, the SSLSocket.cipher() method of SSL sockets will
give the currently selected cipher.
OpenSSL 1.1.1 has TLS 1.3 cipher suites enabled by default. The suites
cannot be disabled with set_ciphers().
