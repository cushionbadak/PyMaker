Boolean value of Enum classes and members¶
Enum members that are mixed with non-Enum types (such as
int, str, etc.) are evaluated according to the mixed-in
type’s rules; otherwise, all members evaluate as True.  To make your
own Enum’s boolean evaluation depend on the member’s value add the following to
your class:
def __bool__(self):
    return bool(self.value)


Enum classes always evaluate as True.
