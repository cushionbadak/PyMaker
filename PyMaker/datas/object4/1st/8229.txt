Editor windows¶
IDLE may open editor windows when it starts, depending on settings
and how you start IDLE.  Thereafter, use the File menu.  There can be only
one open editor window for a given file.
The title bar contains the name of the file, the full path, and the version
of Python and IDLE running the window.  The status bar contains the line
number (‘Ln’) and column number (‘Col’).  Line numbers start with 1;
column numbers with 0.
IDLE assumes that files with a known .py* extension contain Python code
and that other files do not.  Run Python code with the Run menu.
