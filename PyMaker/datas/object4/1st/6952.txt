IMAP4.sort(sort_criteria, charset, search_criterion[, ...])Â¶
The sort command is a variant of search with sorting semantics for the
results.  Returned data contains a space separated list of matching message
numbers.
Sort has two arguments before the search_criterion argument(s); a
parenthesized list of sort_criteria, and the searching charset.  Note that
unlike search, the searching charset argument is mandatory.  There is also
a uid sort command which corresponds to sort the way that uid search
corresponds to search.  The sort command first searches the mailbox for
messages that match the given searching criteria using the charset argument for
the interpretation of strings in the searching criteria.  It then returns the
numbers of matching messages.
This is an IMAP4rev1 extension command.
