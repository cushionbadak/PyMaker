sys.base_prefixÂ¶
Set during Python startup, before site.py is run, to the same value as
prefix. If not running in a virtual environment, the values
will stay the same; if site.py finds that a virtual environment is in
use, the values of prefix and exec_prefix will be changed to
point to the virtual environment, whereas base_prefix and
base_exec_prefix will remain pointing to the base Python
installation (the one which the virtual environment was created from).

New in version 3.3.
