class email.headerregistry.Group(display_name=None, addresses=None)¶
The class used to represent an address group.  The general form of an
address group is:
display_name: [address-list];


As a convenience for processing lists of addresses that consist of a mixture
of groups and single addresses, a Group may also be used to represent
single addresses that are not part of a group by setting display_name to
None and providing a list of the single address as addresses.


display_name¶
The display_name of the group.  If it is None and there is
exactly one Address in addresses, then the Group represents a
single address that is not in a group.



addresses¶
A possibly empty tuple of Address objects representing the
addresses in the group.



__str__()¶
The str value of a Group is formatted according to RFC 5322,
but with no Content Transfer Encoding of any non-ASCII characters.  If
display_name is none and there is a single Address in the
addresses list, the str value will be the same as the str of
that single Address.
