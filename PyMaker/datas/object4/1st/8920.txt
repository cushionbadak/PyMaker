<dd><p>Check whether we should break here, depending on the way the breakpoint <em>b</em>
was set.</p>
<p>If it was set via line number, it checks if <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">b.line</span></code> is the same as the one
in the frame also passed as argument.  If the breakpoint was set via function
name, we have to check we are in the right frame (the right function) and if
we are in its first executable line.</p>
