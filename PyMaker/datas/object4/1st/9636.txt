abstractmethod find_module(fullname, path=None)Â¶
An abstract method for finding a loader for the specified
module.  Originally specified in PEP 302, this method was meant
for use in sys.meta_path and in the path-based import subsystem.

Changed in version 3.4: Returns None when called instead of raising
NotImplementedError.
