3.3.3.3. Determining the appropriate metaclassÂ¶
The appropriate metaclass for a class definition is determined as follows:

if no bases and no explicit metaclass are given, then type() is used;
if an explicit metaclass is given and it is not an instance of
type(), then it is used directly as the metaclass;
if an instance of type() is given as the explicit metaclass, or
bases are defined, then the most derived metaclass is used.

The most derived metaclass is selected from the explicitly specified
metaclass (if any) and the metaclasses (i.e. type(cls)) of all specified
base classes. The most derived metaclass is one which is a subtype of all
of these candidate metaclasses. If none of the candidate metaclasses meets
that criterion, then the class definition will fail with TypeError.
