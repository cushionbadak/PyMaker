binascii.rledecode_hqx(data)Â¶
Perform RLE-decompression on the data, as per the binhex4 standard. The
algorithm uses 0x90 after a byte as a repeat indicator, followed by a count.
A count of 0 specifies a byte value of 0x90. The routine returns the
decompressed data, unless data input data ends in an orphaned repeat indicator,
in which case the Incomplete exception is raised.

Changed in version 3.2: Accept only bytestring or bytearray objects as input.
