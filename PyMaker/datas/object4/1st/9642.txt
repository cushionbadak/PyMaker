find_spec(fullname, target=None)Â¶
An abstract method for finding a spec for
the specified module.  The finder will search for the module only
within the path entry to which it is assigned.  If a spec
cannot be found, None is returned.  When passed in, target
is a module object that the finder may use to make a more educated
guess about what spec to return.

New in version 3.4.
