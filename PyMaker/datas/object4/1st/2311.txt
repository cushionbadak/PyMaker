pickle.loads(bytes_object, *, fix_imports=True, encoding="ASCII", errors="strict")¶
Read a pickled object hierarchy from a bytes object and return the
reconstituted object hierarchy specified therein.
The protocol version of the pickle is detected automatically, so no
protocol argument is needed.  Bytes past the pickled object’s
representation are ignored.
Optional keyword arguments are fix_imports, encoding and errors,
which are used to control compatibility support for pickle stream generated
by Python 2.  If fix_imports is true, pickle will try to map the old
Python 2 names to the new names used in Python 3.  The encoding and
errors tell pickle how to decode 8-bit string instances pickled by Python
2; these default to ‘ASCII’ and ‘strict’, respectively.  The encoding can
be ‘bytes’ to read these 8-bit string instances as bytes objects.
Using encoding='latin1' is required for unpickling NumPy arrays and
instances of datetime, date and
time pickled by Python 2.
