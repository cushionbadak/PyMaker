ZipFile.writestr(zinfo_or_arcname, data, compress_type=None, compresslevel=None)¶
Write a file into the archive.  The contents is data, which may be either
a str or a bytes instance; if it is a str,
it is encoded as UTF-8 first.  zinfo_or_arcname is either the file
name it will be given in the archive, or a ZipInfo instance.  If it’s
an instance, at least the filename, date, and time must be given.  If it’s a
name, the date and time is set to the current date and time.
The archive must be opened with mode 'w', 'x' or 'a'.
If given, compress_type overrides the value given for the compression
parameter to the constructor for the new entry, or in the zinfo_or_arcname
(if that is a ZipInfo instance). Similarly, compresslevel will
override the constructor if given.

Note
When passing a ZipInfo instance as the zinfo_or_arcname parameter,
the compression method used will be that specified in the compress_type
member of the given ZipInfo instance.  By default, the
ZipInfo constructor sets this member to ZIP_STORED.


Changed in version 3.2: The compress_type argument.


Changed in version 3.6: Calling writestr() on a ZipFile created with mode 'r' or
a closed ZipFile will raise a ValueError.  Previously,
a RuntimeError was raised.
