difflib.ndiff(a, b, linejunk=None, charjunk=IS_CHARACTER_JUNK)¶
Compare a and b (lists of strings); return a Differ-style
delta (a generator generating the delta lines).
Optional keyword parameters linejunk and charjunk are filtering functions
(or None):
linejunk: A function that accepts a single string argument, and returns
true if the string is junk, or false if not. The default is None. There
is also a module-level function IS_LINE_JUNK(), which filters out lines
without visible characters, except for at most one pound character ('#')
– however the underlying SequenceMatcher class does a dynamic
analysis of which lines are so frequent as to constitute noise, and this
usually works better than using this function.
charjunk: A function that accepts a character (a string of length 1), and
returns if the character is junk, or false if not. The default is module-level
function IS_CHARACTER_JUNK(), which filters out whitespace characters (a
blank or tab; it’s a bad idea to include newline in this!).
Tools/scripts/ndiff.py is a command-line front-end to this function.
