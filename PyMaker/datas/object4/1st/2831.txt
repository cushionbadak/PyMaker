hashlib.algorithms_availableÂ¶
A set containing the names of the hash algorithms that are available in the
running Python interpreter.  These names will be recognized when passed to
new().  algorithms_guaranteed will always be a subset.  The
same algorithm may appear multiple times in this set under different names
(thanks to OpenSSL).

New in version 3.2.
