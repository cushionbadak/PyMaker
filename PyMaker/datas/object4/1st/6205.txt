NodeList Objects¶
A NodeList represents a sequence of nodes.  These objects are used in
two ways in the DOM Core recommendation:  an Element object provides
one as its list of child nodes, and the getElementsByTagName() and
getElementsByTagNameNS() methods of Node return objects with this
interface to represent query results.
The DOM Level 2 recommendation defines one method and one attribute for these
objects:


NodeList.item(i)¶
Return the i’th item from the sequence, if there is one, or None.  The
index i is not allowed to be less than zero or greater than or equal to the
length of the sequence.



NodeList.length¶
The number of nodes in the sequence.

In addition, the Python DOM interface requires that some additional support is
provided to allow NodeList objects to be used as Python sequences.  All
NodeList implementations must include support for
__len__() and
__getitem__(); this allows iteration over the NodeList in
for statements and proper support for the len() built-in
function.
If a DOM implementation supports modification of the document, the
NodeList implementation must also support the
__setitem__() and __delitem__() methods.
