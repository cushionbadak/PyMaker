pdb.set_trace(*, header=None)Â¶
Enter the debugger at the calling stack frame.  This is useful to hard-code
a breakpoint at a given point in a program, even if the code is not
otherwise being debugged (e.g. when an assertion fails).  If given,
header is printed to the console just before debugging begins.

Changed in version 3.7: The keyword-only argument header.
