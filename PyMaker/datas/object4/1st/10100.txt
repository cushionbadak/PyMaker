BUILD_MAP(count)Â¶
Pushes a new dictionary object onto the stack.  Pops 2 * count items
so that the dictionary holds count entries:
{..., TOS3: TOS2, TOS1: TOS}.

Changed in version 3.5: The dictionary is created from stack items instead of creating an
empty dictionary pre-sized to hold count items.
