Timeouts and the accept methodÂ¶
If getdefaulttimeout() is not None, sockets returned by
the accept() method inherit that timeout.  Otherwise, the
behaviour depends on settings of the listening socket:

if the listening socket is in blocking mode or in timeout mode,
the socket returned by accept() is in blocking mode;
if the listening socket is in non-blocking mode, whether the socket
returned by accept() is in blocking or non-blocking mode
is operating system-dependent.  If you want to ensure cross-platform
behaviour, it is recommended you manually override this setting.
