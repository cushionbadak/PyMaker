tracemalloc.stop()Â¶
Stop tracing Python memory allocations: uninstall hooks on Python memory
allocators. Also clears all previously collected traces of memory blocks
allocated by Python.
Call take_snapshot() function to take a snapshot of traces before
clearing them.
See also start(), is_tracing() and clear_traces()
functions.
