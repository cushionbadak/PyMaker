BaseHandler.default_open(req)Â¶
This method is not defined in BaseHandler, but subclasses should
define it if they want to catch all URLs.
This method, if implemented, will be called by the parent
OpenerDirector.  It should return a file-like object as described in
the return value of the open() of OpenerDirector, or None.
It should raise URLError, unless a truly exceptional
thing happens (for example, MemoryError should not be mapped to
URLError).
This method will be called before any protocol-specific open method.
