docs:


seek(pos, whence=0)¶
Set the chunk’s current position.  The whence argument is optional and
defaults to 0 (absolute file positioning); other values are 1
(seek relative to the current position) and 2 (seek relative to the
file’s end).  There is no return value. If the underlying file does not
allow seek, only forward seeks are allowed.
