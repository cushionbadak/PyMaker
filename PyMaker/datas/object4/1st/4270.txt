multiprocessing.Pipe([duplex])Â¶
Returns a pair (conn1, conn2) of
Connection objects representing the
ends of a pipe.
If duplex is True (the default) then the pipe is bidirectional.  If
duplex is False then the pipe is unidirectional: conn1 can only be
used for receiving messages and conn2 can only be used for sending
messages.
