7.1. Expression statementsÂ¶
Expression statements are used (mostly interactively) to compute and write a
value, or (usually) to call a procedure (a function that returns no meaningful
result; in Python, procedures return the value None).  Other uses of
expression statements are allowed and occasionally useful.  The syntax for an
expression statement is:

expression_stmt ::=  starred_expression

An expression statement evaluates the expression list (which may be a single
expression).
In interactive mode, if the value is not None, it is converted to a string
using the built-in repr() function and the resulting string is written to
standard output on a line by itself (except if the result is None, so that
procedure calls do not cause any output.)
