sys.__stdin__¶

sys.__stdout__¶

sys.__stderr__¶
These objects contain the original values of stdin, stderr and
stdout at the start of the program.  They are used during finalization,
and could be useful to print to the actual standard stream no matter if the
sys.std* object has been redirected.
It can also be used to restore the actual files to known working file objects
in case they have been overwritten with a broken object.  However, the
preferred way to do this is to explicitly save the previous stream before
replacing it, and restore the saved object.

Note
Under some conditions stdin, stdout and stderr as well as the
original values __stdin__, __stdout__ and __stderr__ can be
None. It is usually the case for Windows GUI apps that aren’t connected
to a console and Python apps started with pythonw.
