importlib.invalidate_caches()¶
Invalidate the internal caches of finders stored at
sys.meta_path. If a finder implements invalidate_caches() then it
will be called to perform the invalidation.  This function should be called
if any modules are created/installed while your program is running to
guarantee all finders will notice the new module’s existence.

New in version 3.3.
