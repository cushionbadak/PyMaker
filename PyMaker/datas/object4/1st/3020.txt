os.preadv(fd, buffers, offset, flags=0)Â¶
Read from a file descriptor fd at a position of offset into mutable
bytes-like objects buffers, leaving the file
offset unchanged.  Transfer data into each buffer until it is full and then
move on to the next buffer in the sequence to hold the rest of the data.
The flags argument contains a bitwise OR of zero or more of the following
flags:

RWF_HIPRI
RWF_NOWAIT

Return the total number of bytes actually read which can be less than the
total capacity of all the objects.
The operating system may set a limit (sysconf() value
'SC_IOV_MAX') on the number of buffers that can be used.
Combine the functionality of os.readv() and os.pread().
Availability: Linux 2.6.30 and newer, FreeBSD 6.0 and newer,
OpenBSD 2.7 and newer. Using flags requires Linux 4.6 or newer.

New in version 3.7.
