object.__setitem__(self, key, value)Â¶
Called to implement assignment to self[key].  Same note as for
__getitem__().  This should only be implemented for mappings if the
objects support changes to the values for keys, or if new keys can be added, or
for sequences if elements can be replaced.  The same exceptions should be raised
for improper key values as for the __getitem__() method.
