os.listdir(path='.')Â¶
Return a list containing the names of the entries in the directory given by
path.  The list is in arbitrary order, and does not include the special
entries '.' and '..' even if they are present in the directory.
path may be a path-like object.  If path is of type bytes
(directly or indirectly through the PathLike interface),
the filenames returned will also be of type bytes;
in all other circumstances, they will be of type str.
This function can also support specifying a file descriptor; the file descriptor must refer to a directory.

Note
To encode str filenames to bytes, use fsencode().

The scandir() function returns directory entries along with
file attribute information, giving better performance for many
common use cases.


Changed in version 3.2: The path parameter became optional.


New in version 3.3: Added support for specifying an open file descriptor for path.


Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a path-like object.
