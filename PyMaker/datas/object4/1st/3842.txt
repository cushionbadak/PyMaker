<dd><p>This attribute is a flag which controls the interpretation of blanks in
the window.  When it is on, trailing blanks on each line are ignored; any
cursor motion that would land the cursor on a trailing blank goes to the
end of that line instead, and trailing blanks are stripped when the window
contents are gathered.</p>
