class slice(stop)Â¶

class slice(start, stop[, step])
Return a slice object representing the set of indices specified by
range(start, stop, step).  The start and step arguments default to
None.  Slice objects have read-only data attributes start,
stop and step which merely return the argument
values (or their default).  They have no other explicit functionality;
however they are used by Numerical Python and other third party extensions.
Slice objects are also generated when extended indexing syntax is used.  For
example: a[start:stop:step] or a[start:stop, i].  See
itertools.islice() for an alternate version that returns an iterator.
