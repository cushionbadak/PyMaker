os.path.getctime(path)¶
Return the system’s ctime which, on some systems (like Unix) is the time of the
last metadata change, and, on others (like Windows), is the creation time for path.
The return value is a number giving the number of seconds since the epoch (see
the  time module).  Raise OSError if the file does not exist or
is inaccessible.

Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a path-like object.
