itertools.takewhile(predicate, iterable)Â¶
Make an iterator that returns elements from the iterable as long as the
predicate is true.  Roughly equivalent to:
def takewhile(predicate, iterable):
    # takewhile(lambda x: x<5, [1,4,6,4,1]) --> 1 4
    for x in iterable:
        if predicate(x):
            yield x
        else:
            break
