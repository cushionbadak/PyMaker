struct.unpack(format, buffer)¶
Unpack from the buffer buffer (presumably packed by pack(format, ...))
according to the format string format.  The result is a tuple even if it
contains exactly one item.  The buffer’s size in bytes must match the
size required by the format, as reflected by calcsize().
