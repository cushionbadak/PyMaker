Exceptions¶


exception socket.error¶
A deprecated alias of OSError.

Changed in version 3.3: Following PEP 3151, this class was made an alias of OSError.




exception socket.herror¶
A subclass of OSError, this exception is raised for
address-related errors, i.e. for functions that use h_errno in the POSIX
C API, including gethostbyname_ex() and gethostbyaddr().
The accompanying value is a pair (h_errno, string) representing an
error returned by a library call.  h_errno is a numeric value, while
string represents the description of h_errno, as returned by the
hstrerror() C function.

Changed in version 3.3: This class was made a subclass of OSError.




exception socket.gaierror¶
A subclass of OSError, this exception is raised for
address-related errors by getaddrinfo() and getnameinfo().
The accompanying value is a pair (error, string) representing an error
returned by a library call.  string represents the description of
error, as returned by the gai_strerror() C function.  The
numeric error value will match one of the EAI_* constants
defined in this module.

Changed in version 3.3: This class was made a subclass of OSError.




exception socket.timeout¶
A subclass of OSError, this exception is raised when a timeout
occurs on a socket which has had timeouts enabled via a prior call to
settimeout() (or implicitly through
setdefaulttimeout()).  The accompanying value is a string
whose value is currently always “timed out”.

Changed in version 3.3: This class was made a subclass of OSError.
