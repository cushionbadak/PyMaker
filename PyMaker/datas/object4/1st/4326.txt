multiprocessing.sharedctypes.RawValue(typecode_or_type, *args)¶
Return a ctypes object allocated from shared memory.
typecode_or_type determines the type of the returned object: it is either a
ctypes type or a one character typecode of the kind used by the array
module.  *args is passed on to the constructor for the type.
Note that setting and getting the value is potentially non-atomic – use
Value() instead to make sure that access is automatically synchronized
using a lock.
Note that an array of ctypes.c_char has value and raw
attributes which allow one to use it to store and retrieve strings – see
documentation for ctypes.
