<dd><p>Characters that will be considered punctuation. Runs of punctuation
characters will be returned as a single token. However, note that no
semantic validity checking will be performed: for example, ‘&gt;&gt;&gt;’ could be
returned as a token, even though it may not be recognised as such by shells.</p>
