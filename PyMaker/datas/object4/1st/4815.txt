coroutine loop.connect_read_pipe(protocol_factory, pipe)Â¶
Register the read end of pipe in the event loop.
protocol_factory must be a callable returning an
asyncio protocol implementation.
pipe is a file-like object.
Return pair (transport, protocol), where transport supports
the ReadTransport interface and protocol is an object
instantiated by the protocol_factory.
With SelectorEventLoop event loop, the pipe is set to
non-blocking mode.
