socket.recv(bufsize[, flags])Â¶
Receive data from the socket.  The return value is a bytes object representing the
data received.  The maximum amount of data to be received at once is specified
by bufsize.  See the Unix manual page recv(2) for the meaning of
the optional argument flags; it defaults to zero.

Note
For best match with hardware and network realities, the value of  bufsize
should be a relatively small power of 2, for example, 4096.


Changed in version 3.5: If the system call is interrupted and the signal handler does not raise
an exception, the method now retries the system call instead of raising
an InterruptedError exception (see PEP 475 for the rationale).
