turtle.setworldcoordinates(llx, lly, urx, ury)¶




Parameters:
llx – a number, x-coordinate of lower left corner of canvas
lly – a number, y-coordinate of lower left corner of canvas
urx – a number, x-coordinate of upper right corner of canvas
ury – a number, y-coordinate of upper right corner of canvas





Set up user-defined coordinate system and switch to mode “world” if
necessary.  This performs a screen.reset().  If mode “world” is already
active, all drawings are redrawn according to the new coordinates.
ATTENTION: in user-defined coordinate systems angles may appear
distorted.
>>> screen.reset()
>>> screen.setworldcoordinates(-50,-7.5,50,7.5)
>>> for _ in range(72):
...     left(10)
...
>>> for _ in range(8):
...     left(45); fd(2)   # a regular octagon
