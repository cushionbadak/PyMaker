Data types¶


class ctypes._CData¶
This non-public class is the common base class of all ctypes data types.
Among other things, all ctypes type instances contain a memory block that
hold C compatible data; the address of the memory block is returned by the
addressof() helper function. Another instance variable is exposed as
_objects; this contains other Python objects that need to be kept
alive in case the memory block contains pointers.
Common methods of ctypes data types, these are all class methods (to be
exact, they are methods of the metaclass):


from_buffer(source[, offset])¶
This method returns a ctypes instance that shares the buffer of the
source object.  The source object must support the writeable buffer
interface.  The optional offset parameter specifies an offset into the
source buffer in bytes; the default is zero.  If the source buffer is not
large enough a ValueError is raised.



from_buffer_copy(source[, offset])¶
This method creates a ctypes instance, copying the buffer from the
source object buffer which must be readable.  The optional offset
parameter specifies an offset into the source buffer in bytes; the default
is zero.  If the source buffer is not large enough a ValueError is
raised.



from_address(address)¶
This method returns a ctypes type instance using the memory specified by
address which must be an integer.



from_param(obj)¶
This method adapts obj to a ctypes type.  It is called with the actual
object used in a foreign function call when the type is present in the
foreign function’s argtypes tuple; it must return an object that
can be used as a function call parameter.
All ctypes data types have a default implementation of this classmethod
that normally returns obj if that is an instance of the type.  Some
types accept other objects as well.



in_dll(library, name)¶
This method returns a ctypes type instance exported by a shared
library. name is the name of the symbol that exports the data, library
is the loaded shared library.

Common instance variables of ctypes data types:


_b_base_¶
Sometimes ctypes data instances do not own the memory block they contain,
instead they share part of the memory block of a base object.  The
_b_base_ read-only member is the root ctypes object that owns the
memory block.



_b_needsfree_¶
This read-only variable is true when the ctypes data instance has
allocated the memory block itself, false otherwise.



_objects¶
This member is either None or a dictionary containing Python objects
that need to be kept alive so that the memory block contents is kept
valid.  This object is only exposed for debugging; never modify the
contents of this dictionary.
