Generator Types¶
Python’s generators provide a convenient way to implement the iterator
protocol.  If a container object’s __iter__() method is implemented as a
generator, it will automatically return an iterator object (technically, a
generator object) supplying the __iter__() and __next__()
methods.
More information about generators can be found in the documentation for
the yield expression.
