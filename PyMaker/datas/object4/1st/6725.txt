open(fullurl, data=None)Â¶
Open fullurl using the appropriate protocol.  This method sets up cache and
proxy information, then calls the appropriate open method with its input
arguments.  If the scheme is not recognized, open_unknown() is called.
The data argument has the same meaning as the data argument of
urlopen().
This method always quotes fullurl using quote().
