vars([object])Â¶
Return the __dict__ attribute for a module, class, instance,
or any other object with a __dict__ attribute.
Objects such as modules and instances have an updateable __dict__
attribute; however, other objects may have write restrictions on their
__dict__ attributes (for example, classes use a
types.MappingProxyType to prevent direct dictionary updates).
Without an argument, vars() acts like locals().  Note, the
locals dictionary is only useful for reads since updates to the locals
dictionary are ignored.
