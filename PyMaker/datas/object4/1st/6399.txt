InputSource.setEncoding(encoding)Â¶
Sets the character encoding of this InputSource.
The encoding must be a string acceptable for an XML encoding declaration (see
section 4.3.3 of the XML recommendation).
The encoding attribute of the InputSource is ignored if the
InputSource also contains a character stream.
