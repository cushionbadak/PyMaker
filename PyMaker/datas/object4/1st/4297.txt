multiprocessing.set_executable()Â¶
Sets the path of the Python interpreter to use when starting a child process.
(By default sys.executable is used).  Embedders will probably need to
do some thing like
set_executable(os.path.join(sys.exec_prefix, 'pythonw.exe'))


before they can create child processes.

Changed in version 3.4: Now supported on Unix when the 'spawn' start method is used.
