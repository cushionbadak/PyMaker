importlib.resources.read_text(package, resource, encoding='utf-8', errors='strict')Â¶
Read and return the contents of resource within package as a str.
By default, the contents are read as strict UTF-8.
package is either a name or a module object which conforms to the
Package requirements.  resource is the name of the resource to open
within package; it may not contain path separators and it may not have
sub-resources (i.e. it cannot be a directory).  encoding and errors
have the same meaning as with built-in open().  This function
returns the contents of the resource as str.
