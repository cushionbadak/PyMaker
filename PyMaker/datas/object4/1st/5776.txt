email.utils.formatdate(timeval=None, localtime=False, usegmt=False)Â¶
Returns a date string as per RFC 2822, e.g.:
Fri, 09 Nov 2001 01:08:47 -0000


Optional timeval if given is a floating point time value as accepted by
time.gmtime() and time.localtime(), otherwise the current time is
used.
Optional localtime is a flag that when True, interprets timeval, and
returns a date relative to the local timezone instead of UTC, properly taking
daylight savings time into account. The default is False meaning UTC is
used.
Optional usegmt is a flag that when True, outputs a  date string with the
timezone as an ascii string GMT, rather than a numeric -0000. This is
needed for some protocols (such as HTTP). This only applies when localtime is
False.  The default is False.
