check_unused_args(used_args, args, kwargs)Â¶
Implement checking for unused arguments if desired.  The arguments to this
function is the set of all argument keys that were actually referred to in
the format string (integers for positional arguments, and strings for
named arguments), and a reference to the args and kwargs that was
passed to vformat.  The set of unused args can be calculated from these
parameters.  check_unused_args() is assumed to raise an exception if
the check fails.
