class importlib.machinery.PathFinder¶
A Finder for sys.path and package __path__ attributes.
This class implements the importlib.abc.MetaPathFinder ABC.
Only class methods are defined by this class to alleviate the need for
instantiation.


classmethod find_spec(fullname, path=None, target=None)¶
Class method that attempts to find a spec
for the module specified by fullname on sys.path or, if
defined, on path. For each path entry that is searched,
sys.path_importer_cache is checked. If a non-false object
is found then it is used as the path entry finder to look
for the module being searched for. If no entry is found in
sys.path_importer_cache, then sys.path_hooks is
searched for a finder for the path entry and, if found, is stored
in sys.path_importer_cache along with being queried about
the module. If no finder is ever found then None is both
stored in the cache and returned.

New in version 3.4.


Changed in version 3.5: If the current working directory – represented by an empty string –
is no longer valid then None is returned but no value is cached
in sys.path_importer_cache.




classmethod find_module(fullname, path=None)¶
A legacy wrapper around find_spec().

Deprecated since version 3.4: Use find_spec() instead.




classmethod invalidate_caches()¶
Calls importlib.abc.PathEntryFinder.invalidate_caches() on all
finders stored in sys.path_importer_cache that define the method.
Otherwise entries in sys.path_importer_cache set to None are
deleted.

Changed in version 3.7: Entries of None in sys.path_importer_cache are deleted.



Changed in version 3.4: Calls objects in sys.path_hooks with the current working
directory for '' (i.e. the empty string).
