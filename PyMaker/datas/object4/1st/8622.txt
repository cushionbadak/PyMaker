unittest.mock.create_autospec(spec, spec_set=False, instance=False, **kwargs)¶
Create a mock object using another object as a spec. Attributes on the
mock will use the corresponding attribute on the spec object as their
spec.
Functions or methods being mocked will have their arguments checked to
ensure that they are called with the correct signature.
If spec_set is True then attempting to set attributes that don’t exist
on the spec object will raise an AttributeError.
If a class is used as a spec then the return value of the mock (the
instance of the class) will have the same spec. You can use a class as the
spec for an instance object by passing instance=True. The returned mock
will only be callable if instances of the mock are callable.
create_autospec() also takes arbitrary keyword arguments that are passed to
the constructor of the created mock.
