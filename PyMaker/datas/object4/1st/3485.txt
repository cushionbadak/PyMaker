<dd><p>If this attribute evaluates to true, events logged to this logger will be
passed to the handlers of higher level (ancestor) loggers, in addition to
any handlers attached to this logger. Messages are passed directly to the
ancestor loggers’ handlers - neither the level nor filters of the ancestor
loggers in question are considered.</p>
<p>If this evaluates to false, logging messages are not passed to the handlers
of ancestor loggers.</p>
<p>The constructor sets this attribute to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">True</span></code>.</p>

<p class="last">If you attach a handler to a logger <em>and</em> one or more of its
ancestors, it may emit the same record multiple times. In general, you
should not need to attach a handler to more than one logger - if you just
attach it to the appropriate logger which is highest in the logger
hierarchy, then it will see all events logged by all descendant loggers,
provided that their propagate setting is left set to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">True</span></code>. A common
scenario is to attach handlers only to the root logger, and to let
propagation take care of the rest.</p>
