struct.unpack_from(format, buffer, offset=0)¶
Unpack from buffer starting at position offset, according to the format
string format.  The result is a tuple even if it contains exactly one
item.  The buffer’s size in bytes, minus offset, must be at least
the size required by the format, as reflected by calcsize().
