task_done()Â¶
Indicate that a formerly enqueued task is complete.
Used by queue consumers. For each get() used to
fetch a task, a subsequent call to task_done() tells the
queue that the processing on the task is complete.
If a join() is currently blocking, it will resume when all
items have been processed (meaning that a task_done()
call was received for every item that had been put()
into the queue).
Raises ValueError if called more times than there were
items placed in the queue.
