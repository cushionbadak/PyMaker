docs:


getbuffer()Â¶
Return a readable and writable view over the contents of the buffer
without copying them.  Also, mutating the view will transparently
update the contents of the buffer:
>>> b = io.BytesIO(b"abcdef")
>>> view = b.getbuffer()
>>> view[2:4] = b"56"
>>> b.getvalue()
b'ab56ef'



Note
As long as the view exists, the BytesIO object cannot be
resized or closed.


New in version 3.2.
