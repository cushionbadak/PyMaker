7.6. The return statement¶

return_stmt ::=  "return" [expression_list]

return may only occur syntactically nested in a function definition,
not within a nested class definition.
If an expression list is present, it is evaluated, else None is substituted.
return leaves the current function call with the expression list (or
None) as return value.
When return passes control out of a try statement with a
finally clause, that finally clause is executed before
really leaving the function.
In a generator function, the return statement indicates that the
generator is done and will cause StopIteration to be raised. The returned
value (if any) is used as an argument to construct StopIteration and
becomes the StopIteration.value attribute.
In an asynchronous generator function, an empty return statement
indicates that the asynchronous generator is done and will cause
StopAsyncIteration to be raised.  A non-empty return
statement is a syntax error in an asynchronous generator function.
