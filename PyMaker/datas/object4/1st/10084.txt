SETUP_WITH(delta)Â¶
This opcode performs several operations before a with block starts.  First,
it loads __exit__() from the context manager and pushes it onto
the stack for later use by WITH_CLEANUP.  Then,
__enter__() is called, and a finally block pointing to delta
is pushed.  Finally, the result of calling the enter method is pushed onto
the stack.  The next opcode will either ignore it (POP_TOP), or
store it in (a) variable(s) (STORE_FAST, STORE_NAME, or
UNPACK_SEQUENCE).

New in version 3.2.
