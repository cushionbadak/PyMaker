class logging.handlers.BufferingHandler(capacity)¶
Initializes the handler with a buffer of the specified capacity.


emit(record)¶
Appends the record to the buffer. If shouldFlush() returns true,
calls flush() to process the buffer.



flush()¶
You can override this to implement custom flushing behavior. This version
just zaps the buffer to empty.



shouldFlush(record)¶
Returns true if the buffer is up to capacity. This method can be
overridden to implement custom flushing strategies.
