SMTP.docmd(cmd, args='')Â¶
Send a command cmd to the server.  The optional argument args is simply
concatenated to the command, separated by a space.
This returns a 2-tuple composed of a numeric response code and the actual
response line (multiline responses are joined into one long line.)
In normal operation it should not be necessary to call this method explicitly.
It is used to implement other methods and may be useful for testing private
extensions.
If the connection to the server is lost while waiting for the reply,
SMTPServerDisconnected will be raised.
