coroutine wait()Â¶
Wait for the child process to terminate.
Set and return the returncode attribute.

Note
This method can deadlock when using stdout=PIPE or
stderr=PIPE and the child process generates so much output
that it blocks waiting for the OS pipe buffer to accept
more data. Use the communicate() method when using pipes
to avoid this condition.
