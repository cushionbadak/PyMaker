wrap(text)Â¶
Wraps the single paragraph in text (a string) so every line is at most
width characters long.  All wrapping options are taken from
instance attributes of the TextWrapper instance.  Returns a list
of output lines, without final newlines.  If the wrapped output has no
content, the returned list is empty.
