ssl.RAND_bytes(num)Â¶
Return num cryptographically strong pseudo-random bytes. Raises an
SSLError if the PRNG has not been seeded with enough data or if the
operation is not supported by the current RAND method. RAND_status()
can be used to check the status of the PRNG and RAND_add() can be used
to seed the PRNG.
For almost all applications os.urandom() is preferable.
Read the Wikipedia article, Cryptographically secure pseudorandom number
generator (CSPRNG),
to get the requirements of a cryptographically generator.

New in version 3.3.
