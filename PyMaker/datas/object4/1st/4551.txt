Queue.task_done()Â¶
Indicate that a formerly enqueued task is complete.  Used by queue consumer
threads.  For each get() used to fetch a task, a subsequent call to
task_done() tells the queue that the processing on the task is complete.
If a join() is currently blocking, it will resume when all items have been
processed (meaning that a task_done() call was received for every item
that had been put() into the queue).
Raises a ValueError if called more times than there were items placed in
the queue.
