Request.methodÂ¶
The HTTP request method to use.  By default its value is None,
which means that get_method() will do its normal computation
of the method to be used.  Its value can be set (thus overriding the default
computation in get_method()) either by providing a default
value by setting it at the class level in a Request subclass, or by
passing a value in to the Request constructor via the method
argument.

New in version 3.3.


Changed in version 3.4: A default value can now be set in subclasses; previously it could only
be set via the constructor argument.
