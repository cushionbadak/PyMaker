Developing tkinter applicationsÂ¶
IDLE is intentionally different from standard Python in order to
facilitate development of tkinter programs.  Enter import tkinter as tk;
root = tk.Tk() in standard Python and nothing appears.  Enter the same
in IDLE and a tk window appears.  In standard Python, one must also enter
root.update() to see the window.  IDLE does the equivalent in the
background, about 20 times a second, which is about every 50 milleseconds.
Next enter b = tk.Button(root, text='button'); b.pack().  Again,
nothing visibly changes in standard Python until one enters root.update().
Most tkinter programs run root.mainloop(), which usually does not
return until the tk app is destroyed.  If the program is run with
python -i or from an IDLE editor, a >>> shell prompt does not
appear until mainloop() returns, at which time there is nothing left
to interact with.
When running a tkinter program from an IDLE editor, one can comment out
the mainloop call.  One then gets a shell prompt immediately and can
interact with the live application.  One just has to remember to
re-enable the mainloop call when running in standard Python.
