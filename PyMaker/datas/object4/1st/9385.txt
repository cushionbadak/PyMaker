traceback.extract_tb(tb, limit=None)¶
Return a StackSummary object representing a list of “pre-processed”
stack trace entries extracted from the traceback object tb.  It is useful
for alternate formatting of stack traces.  The optional limit argument has
the same meaning as for print_tb().  A “pre-processed” stack trace
entry is a FrameSummary object containing attributes
filename, lineno,
name, and line representing the
information that is usually printed for a stack trace.  The
line is a string with leading and trailing
whitespace stripped; if the source is not available it is None.
