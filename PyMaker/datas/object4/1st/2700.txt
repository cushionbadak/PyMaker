Reader Objects¶
Reader objects (DictReader instances and objects returned by the
reader() function) have the following public methods:


csvreader.__next__()¶
Return the next row of the reader’s iterable object as a list (if the object
was returned from reader()) or a dict (if it is a DictReader
instance), parsed according to the current dialect.  Usually you should call
this as next(reader).

Reader objects have the following public attributes:


csvreader.dialect¶
A read-only description of the dialect in use by the parser.



csvreader.line_num¶
The number of lines read from the source iterator. This is not the same as the
number of records returned, as records can span multiple lines.

DictReader objects have the following public attribute:


csvreader.fieldnames¶
If not passed as a parameter when creating the object, this attribute is
initialized upon first access or when the first record is read from the
file.
