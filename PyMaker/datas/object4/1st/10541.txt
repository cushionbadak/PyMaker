Populating the parserÂ¶
There are several ways to populate the parser with options.  The preferred way
is by using OptionParser.add_option(), as shown in section
Tutorial.  add_option() can be called in one of two ways:

pass it an Option instance (as returned by make_option())
pass it any combination of positional and keyword arguments that are
acceptable to make_option() (i.e., to the Option constructor), and it
will create the Option instance for you

The other alternative is to pass a list of pre-constructed Option instances to
the OptionParser constructor, as in:
option_list = [
    make_option("-f", "--filename",
                action="store", type="string", dest="filename"),
    make_option("-q", "--quiet",
                action="store_false", dest="verbose"),
    ]
parser = OptionParser(option_list=option_list)


(make_option() is a factory function for creating Option instances;
currently it is an alias for the Option constructor.  A future version of
optparse may split Option into several classes, and make_option()
will pick the right class to instantiate.  Do not instantiate Option directly.)
