class urllib.request.HTTPPasswordMgrWithPriorAuthÂ¶
A variant of HTTPPasswordMgrWithDefaultRealm that also has a
database of uri -> is_authenticated mappings.  Can be used by a
BasicAuth handler to determine when to send authentication credentials
immediately instead of waiting for a 401 response first.

New in version 3.5.
