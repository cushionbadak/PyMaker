Binary I/O¶
By reading and writing only large chunks of data even when the user asks for a
single byte, buffered I/O hides any inefficiency in calling and executing the
operating system’s unbuffered I/O routines.  The gain depends on the OS and the
kind of I/O which is performed.  For example, on some modern OSes such as Linux,
unbuffered disk I/O can be as fast as buffered I/O.  The bottom line, however,
is that buffered I/O offers predictable performance regardless of the platform
and the backing device.  Therefore, it is almost always preferable to use
buffered I/O rather than unbuffered I/O for binary data.
