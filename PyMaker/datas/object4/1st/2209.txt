The dircmp class¶


class filecmp.dircmp(a, b, ignore=None, hide=None)¶
Construct a new directory comparison object, to compare the directories a
and b.  ignore is a list of names to ignore, and defaults to
filecmp.DEFAULT_IGNORES.  hide is a list of names to hide, and
defaults to [os.curdir, os.pardir].
The dircmp class compares files by doing shallow comparisons
as described for filecmp.cmp().
The dircmp class provides the following methods:


report()¶
Print (to sys.stdout) a comparison between a and b.



report_partial_closure()¶
Print a comparison between a and b and common immediate
subdirectories.



report_full_closure()¶
Print a comparison between a and b and common subdirectories
(recursively).

The dircmp class offers a number of interesting attributes that may be
used to get various bits of information about the directory trees being
compared.
Note that via __getattr__() hooks, all attributes are computed lazily,
so there is no speed penalty if only those attributes which are lightweight
to compute are used.


left¶
The directory a.



right¶
The directory b.



left_list¶
Files and subdirectories in a, filtered by hide and ignore.



right_list¶
Files and subdirectories in b, filtered by hide and ignore.



common¶
Files and subdirectories in both a and b.



left_only¶
Files and subdirectories only in a.



right_only¶
Files and subdirectories only in b.



common_dirs¶
Subdirectories in both a and b.



common_files¶
Files in both a and b.



common_funny¶
Names in both a and b, such that the type differs between the
directories, or names for which os.stat() reports an error.



same_files¶
Files which are identical in both a and b, using the class’s
file comparison operator.



diff_files¶
Files which are in both a and b, whose contents differ according
to the class’s file comparison operator.



funny_files¶
Files which are in both a and b, but could not be compared.



subdirs¶
A dictionary mapping names in common_dirs to dircmp
objects.




filecmp.DEFAULT_IGNORES¶

New in version 3.4.

List of directories ignored by dircmp by default.

Here is a simplified example of using the subdirs attribute to search
recursively through two directories to show common different files:
>>> from filecmp import dircmp
>>> def print_diff_files(dcmp):
...     for name in dcmp.diff_files:
...         print("diff_file %s found in %s and %s" % (name, dcmp.left,
...               dcmp.right))
...     for sub_dcmp in dcmp.subdirs.values():
...         print_diff_files(sub_dcmp)
...
>>> dcmp = dircmp('dir1', 'dir2') 
>>> print_diff_files(dcmp)
