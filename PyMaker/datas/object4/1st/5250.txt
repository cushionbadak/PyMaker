<dd><p>Load a private key and the corresponding certificate.  The <em>certfile</em>
string must be the path to a single file in PEM format containing the
certificate as well as any number of CA certificates needed to establish
the certificate’s authenticity.  The <em>keyfile</em> string, if present, must
point to a file containing the private key in.  Otherwise the private
key will be taken from <em>certfile</em> as well.  See the discussion of
<a class="reference internal" href="#ssl-certificates"><span class="std std-ref">Certificates</span></a> for more information on how the certificate
is stored in the <em>certfile</em>.</p>
<p>The <em>password</em> argument may be a function to call to get the password for
decrypting the private key.  It will only be called if the private key is
encrypted and a password is necessary.  It will be called with no arguments,
and it should return a string, bytes, or bytearray.  If the return value is
a string it will be encoded as UTF-8 before using it to decrypt the key.
Alternatively a string, bytes, or bytearray value may be supplied directly
as the <em>password</em> argument.  It will be ignored if the private key is not
encrypted and no password is needed.</p>
<p>If the <em>password</em> argument is not specified and a password is required,
OpenSSL’s built-in password prompting mechanism will be used to
interactively prompt the user for a password.</p>
<p>An <a class="reference internal" href="#ssl.SSLError" title="ssl.SSLError"><code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SSLError</span></code></a> is raised if the private key doesn’t
match with the certificate.</p>
