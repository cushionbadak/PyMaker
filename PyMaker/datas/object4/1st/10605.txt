imp.release_lock()¶
Release the interpreter’s global import lock. On platforms without
threads, this function does nothing.

Changed in version 3.3: The locking scheme has changed to per-module locks for
the most part.  A global import lock is kept for some critical tasks,
such as initializing the per-module locks.


Deprecated since version 3.4.
