2.6. DelimitersÂ¶
The following tokens serve as delimiters in the grammar:
(       )       [       ]       {       }
,       :       .       ;       @       =       ->
+=      -=      *=      /=      //=     %=      @=
&=      |=      ^=      >>=     <<=     **=


The period can also occur in floating-point and imaginary literals.  A sequence
of three periods has a special meaning as an ellipsis literal. The second half
of the list, the augmented assignment operators, serve lexically as delimiters,
but also perform an operation.
The following printing ASCII characters have special meaning as part of other
tokens or are otherwise significant to the lexical analyzer:
'       "       #       \


The following printing ASCII characters are not used in Python.  Their
occurrence outside string literals and comments is an unconditional error:
$       ?       `
