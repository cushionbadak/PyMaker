subprocess.getstatusoutput(cmd)Â¶
Return (exitcode, output) of executing cmd in a shell.
Execute the string cmd in a shell with Popen.check_output() and
return a 2-tuple (exitcode, output). The locale encoding is used;
see the notes on Frequently Used Arguments for more details.
A trailing newline is stripped from the output.
The exit code for the command can be interpreted as the return code
of subprocess.  Example:
>>> subprocess.getstatusoutput('ls /bin/ls')
(0, '/bin/ls')
>>> subprocess.getstatusoutput('cat /bin/junk')
(1, 'cat: /bin/junk: No such file or directory')
>>> subprocess.getstatusoutput('/bin/junk')
(127, 'sh: /bin/junk: not found')
>>> subprocess.getstatusoutput('/bin/kill $$')
(-15, '')


Availability: POSIX & Windows.

Changed in version 3.3.4: Windows support was added.
The function now returns (exitcode, output) instead of (status, output)
as it did in Python 3.3.3 and earlier.  exitcode has the same value as
returncode.
