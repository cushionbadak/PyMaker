wish to set the various import-controlled attributes.



__doc__¶
The docstring of the module. Defaults to None.



__loader__¶

__name__¶
The name of the module.



__package__¶
Which package a module belongs to. If the module is top-level
(i.e. not a part of any specific package) then the attribute should be set
to '', else it should be set to the name of the package (which can be
__name__ if the module is a package itself). Defaults to None.
