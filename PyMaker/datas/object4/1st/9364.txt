class abc.ABCÂ¶
A helper class that has ABCMeta as its metaclass.  With this class,
an abstract base class can be created by simply deriving from ABC
avoiding sometimes confusing metaclass usage, for example:
from abc import ABC

class MyABC(ABC):
    pass


Note that the type of ABC is still ABCMeta, therefore
inheriting from ABC requires the usual precautions regarding
metaclass usage, as multiple inheritance may lead to metaclass conflicts.
One may also define an abstract base class by passing the metaclass
keyword and using ABCMeta directly, for example:
from abc import ABCMeta

class MyABC(metaclass=ABCMeta):
    pass
