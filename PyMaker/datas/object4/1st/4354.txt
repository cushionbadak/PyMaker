class multiprocessing.managers.NamespaceÂ¶
A type that can register with SyncManager.
A namespace object has no public methods, but does have writable attributes.
Its representation shows the values of its attributes.
However, when using a proxy for a namespace object, an attribute beginning
with '_' will be an attribute of the proxy and not an attribute of the
referent:
>>> manager = multiprocessing.Manager()
>>> Global = manager.Namespace()
>>> Global.x = 10
>>> Global.y = 'hello'
>>> Global._z = 12.3    # this is an attribute of the proxy
>>> print(Global)
Namespace(x=10, y='hello')
