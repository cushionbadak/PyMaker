atexit.register(func, *args, **kwargs)¶
Register func as a function to be executed at termination.  Any optional
arguments that are to be passed to func must be passed as arguments to
register().  It is possible to register the same function and arguments
more than once.
At normal program termination (for instance, if sys.exit() is called or
the main module’s execution completes), all functions registered are called in
last in, first out order.  The assumption is that lower level modules will
normally be imported before higher level modules and thus must be cleaned up
later.
If an exception is raised during execution of the exit handlers, a traceback is
printed (unless SystemExit is raised) and the exception information is
saved.  After all exit handlers have had a chance to run the last exception to
be raised is re-raised.
This function returns func, which makes it possible to use it as a
decorator.
