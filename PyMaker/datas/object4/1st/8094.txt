Options¶
This widget accepts the following specific options:







Option
Description



orient
One of “horizontal” or “vertical”. Specifies the orientation
of the progress bar.

length
Specifies the length of the long axis of the progress bar
(width if horizontal, height if vertical).

mode
One of “determinate” or “indeterminate”.

maximum
A number specifying the maximum value. Defaults to 100.

value
The current value of the progress bar. In “determinate” mode,
this represents the amount of work completed. In
“indeterminate” mode, it is interpreted as modulo maximum;
that is, the progress bar completes one “cycle” when its value
increases by maximum.

variable
A name which is linked to the option value. If specified, the
value of the progress bar is automatically set to the value of
this name whenever the latter is modified.

phase
Read-only option. The widget periodically increments the value
of this option whenever its value is greater than 0 and, in
determinate mode, less than maximum. This option may be used
by the current theme to provide additional animation effects.
