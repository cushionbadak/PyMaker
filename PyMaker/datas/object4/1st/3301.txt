<dd><p>Write the given <a class="reference internal" href="../glossary.html#term-bytes-like-object"><span class="xref std std-term">bytes-like object</span></a>, <em>b</em>, to the
underlying raw stream, and return the number of
bytes written.  This can be less than the length of <em>b</em> in
bytes, depending on specifics of the underlying raw
stream, and especially if it is in non-blocking mode.  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">None</span></code> is
returned if the raw stream is set not to block and no single byte could
be readily written to it.  The caller may release or mutate <em>b</em> after
this method returns, so the implementation should only access <em>b</em>
during the method call.</p>
