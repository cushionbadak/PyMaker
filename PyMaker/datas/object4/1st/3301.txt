write(b)Â¶
Write the given bytes-like object, b, to the
underlying raw stream, and return the number of
bytes written.  This can be less than the length of b in
bytes, depending on specifics of the underlying raw
stream, and especially if it is in non-blocking mode.  None is
returned if the raw stream is set not to block and no single byte could
be readily written to it.  The caller may release or mutate b after
this method returns, so the implementation should only access b
during the method call.
