warnings.filterwarnings(action, message='', category=Warning, module='', lineno=0, append=False)Â¶
Insert an entry into the list of warnings filter specifications.  The entry is inserted at the front by default; if
append is true, it is inserted at the end.  This checks the types of the
arguments, compiles the message and module regular expressions, and
inserts them as a tuple in the list of warnings filters.  Entries closer to
the front of the list override entries later in the list, if both match a
particular warning.  Omitted arguments default to a value that matches
everything.
