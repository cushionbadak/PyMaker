itertools.filterfalse(predicate, iterable)Â¶
Make an iterator that filters elements from iterable returning only those for
which the predicate is False. If predicate is None, return the items
that are false. Roughly equivalent to:
def filterfalse(predicate, iterable):
    # filterfalse(lambda x: x%2, range(10)) --> 0 2 4 6 8
    if predicate is None:
        predicate = bool
    for x in iterable:
        if not predicate(x):
            yield x
