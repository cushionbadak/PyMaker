class http.cookies.Morsel¶
Abstract a key/value pair, which has some RFC 2109 attributes.
Morsels are dictionary-like objects, whose set of keys is constant — the valid
RFC 2109 attributes, which are

expires
path
comment
domain
max-age
secure
version
httponly

The attribute httponly specifies that the cookie is only transferred
in HTTP requests, and is not accessible through JavaScript. This is intended
to mitigate some forms of cross-site scripting.
The keys are case-insensitive and their default value is ''.

Changed in version 3.5: __eq__() now takes key and value
into account.


Changed in version 3.7: Attributes key, value and
coded_value are read-only.  Use set() for
setting them.
