HTTPConnection.putrequest(method, url, skip_host=False, skip_accept_encoding=False)Â¶
This should be the first call after the connection to the server has been
made. It sends a line to the server consisting of the method string,
the url string, and the HTTP version (HTTP/1.1).  To disable automatic
sending of Host: or Accept-Encoding: headers (for example to accept
additional content encodings), specify skip_host or skip_accept_encoding
with non-False values.
