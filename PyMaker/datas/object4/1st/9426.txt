gc.collect(generation=2)¶
With no arguments, run a full collection.  The optional argument generation
may be an integer specifying which generation to collect (from 0 to 2).  A
ValueError is raised if the generation number  is invalid. The number of
unreachable objects found is returned.
The free lists maintained for a number of built-in types are cleared
whenever a full collection or collection of the highest generation (2)
is run.  Not all items in some free lists may be freed due to the
particular implementation, in particular float.
