inspect.getcomments(object)¶
Return in a single string any lines of comments immediately preceding the
object’s source code (for a class, function, or method), or at the top of the
Python source file (if the object is a module).  If the object’s source code
is unavailable, return None.  This could happen if the object has been
defined in C or the interactive shell.
