ContentHandler.startPrefixMapping(prefix, uri)Â¶
Begin the scope of a prefix-URI Namespace mapping.
The information from this event is not necessary for normal Namespace
processing: the SAX XML reader will automatically replace prefixes for element
and attribute names when the feature_namespaces feature is enabled (the
default).
There are cases, however, when applications need to use prefixes in character
data or in attribute values, where they cannot safely be expanded automatically;
the startPrefixMapping() and endPrefixMapping() events supply the
information to the application to expand prefixes in those contexts itself, if
necessary.
Note that startPrefixMapping() and endPrefixMapping() events are not
guaranteed to be properly nested relative to each-other: all
startPrefixMapping() events will occur before the corresponding
startElement() event, and all endPrefixMapping() events will occur
after the corresponding endElement() event, but their order is not
guaranteed.
