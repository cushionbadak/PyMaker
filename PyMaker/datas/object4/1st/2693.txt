Dialect.doublequoteÂ¶
Controls how instances of quotechar appearing inside a field should
themselves be quoted.  When True, the character is doubled. When
False, the escapechar is used as a prefix to the quotechar.  It
defaults to True.
On output, if doublequote is False and no escapechar is set,
Error is raised if a quotechar is found in a field.
