9.3. Interactive inputÂ¶
Input in interactive mode is parsed using the following grammar:

interactive_input ::=  [stmt_list] NEWLINE | compound_stmt NEWLINE

Note that a (top-level) compound statement must be followed by a blank line in
interactive mode; this is needed to help the parser detect the end of the input.
