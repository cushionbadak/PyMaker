object.__getnewargs__()Â¶
This method serves a similar purpose as __getnewargs_ex__(), but
supports only positional arguments.  It must return a tuple of arguments
args which will be passed to the __new__() method upon unpickling.
__getnewargs__() will not be called if __getnewargs_ex__() is
defined.

Changed in version 3.6: Before Python 3.6, __getnewargs__() was called instead of
__getnewargs_ex__() in protocols 2 and 3.
