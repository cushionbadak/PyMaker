sunau.open(file, mode)Â¶
If file is a string, open the file by that name, otherwise treat it as a
seekable file-like object. mode can be any of

'r'
Read only mode.
'w'
Write only mode.

Note that it does not allow read/write files.
A mode of 'r' returns an AU_read object, while a mode of 'w'
or 'wb' returns an AU_write object.
