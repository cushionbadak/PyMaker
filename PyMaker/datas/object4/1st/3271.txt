Binary I/OÂ¶
Binary I/O (also called buffered I/O) expects
bytes-like objects and produces bytes
objects.  No encoding, decoding, or newline translation is performed.  This
category of streams can be used for all kinds of non-text data, and also when
manual control over the handling of text data is desired.
The easiest way to create a binary stream is with open() with 'b' in
the mode string:
f = open("myfile.jpg", "rb")


In-memory binary streams are also available as BytesIO objects:
f = io.BytesIO(b"some initial binary data: \x00\x01")


The binary stream API is described in detail in the docs of
BufferedIOBase.
Other library modules may provide additional ways to create text or binary
streams.  See socket.socket.makefile() for example.
