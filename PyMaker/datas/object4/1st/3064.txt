docs:


os.lchmod(path, mode)Â¶
Change the mode of path to the numeric mode. If path is a symlink, this
affects the symlink rather than the target.  See the docs for chmod()
for possible values of mode.  As of Python 3.3, this is equivalent to
os.chmod(path, mode, follow_symlinks=False).
Availability: Unix.

Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a path-like object.
