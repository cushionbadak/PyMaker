oss_audio_device.setparameters(format, nchannels, samplerate[, strict=False])¶
Set the key audio sampling parameters—sample format, number of channels, and
sampling rate—in one method call.  format,  nchannels, and samplerate
should be as specified in the setfmt(), channels(), and
speed()  methods.  If strict is true, setparameters() checks to
see if each parameter was actually set to the requested value, and raises
OSSAudioError if not.  Returns a tuple (format, nchannels,
samplerate) indicating the parameter values that were actually set by the
device driver (i.e., the same as the return values of setfmt(),
channels(), and speed()).
For example,
(fmt, channels, rate) = dsp.setparameters(fmt, channels, rate)


is equivalent to
fmt = dsp.setfmt(fmt)
channels = dsp.channels(channels)
rate = dsp.rate(rate)
