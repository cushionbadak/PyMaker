audioop.findfactor(fragment, reference)Â¶
Return a factor F such that rms(add(fragment, mul(reference, -F))) is
minimal, i.e., return the factor with which you should multiply reference to
make it match as well as possible to fragment.  The fragments should both
contain 2-byte samples.
The time taken by this routine is proportional to len(fragment).
