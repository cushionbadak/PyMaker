class http.client.HTTPSConnection(host, port=None, key_file=None, cert_file=None, [timeout, ]source_address=None, *, context=None, check_hostname=None, blocksize=8192)¶
A subclass of HTTPConnection that uses SSL for communication with
secure servers.  Default port is 443.  If context is specified, it
must be a ssl.SSLContext instance describing the various SSL
options.
Please read Security considerations for more information on best practices.

Changed in version 3.2: source_address, context and check_hostname were added.


Changed in version 3.2: This class now supports HTTPS virtual hosts if possible (that is,
if ssl.HAS_SNI is true).


Changed in version 3.4: The strict parameter was removed. HTTP 0.9-style “Simple Responses” are
no longer supported.


Changed in version 3.4.3: This class now performs all the necessary certificate and hostname checks
by default. To revert to the previous, unverified, behavior
ssl._create_unverified_context() can be passed to the context
parameter.


Deprecated since version 3.6: key_file and cert_file are deprecated in favor of context.
Please use ssl.SSLContext.load_cert_chain() instead, or let
ssl.create_default_context() select the system’s trusted CA
certificates for you.
The check_hostname parameter is also deprecated; the
ssl.SSLContext.check_hostname attribute of context should
be used instead.
