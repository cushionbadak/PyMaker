Kqueue Objects¶


kqueue.close()¶
Close the control file descriptor of the kqueue object.



kqueue.closed¶
True if the kqueue object is closed.



kqueue.fileno()¶
Return the file descriptor number of the control fd.



kqueue.fromfd(fd)¶
Create a kqueue object from a given file descriptor.



kqueue.control(changelist, max_events[, timeout=None]) → eventlist¶
Low level interface to kevent

changelist must be an iterable of kevent object or None
max_events must be 0 or a positive integer
timeout in seconds (floats possible)


Changed in version 3.5: The function is now retried with a recomputed timeout when interrupted by
a signal, except if the signal handler raises an exception (see
PEP 475 for the rationale), instead of raising
InterruptedError.
