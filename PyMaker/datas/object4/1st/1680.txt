remainder_near(other, context=None)Â¶
Return the remainder from dividing self by other.  This differs from
self % other in that the sign of the remainder is chosen so as to
minimize its absolute value.  More precisely, the return value is
self - n * other where n is the integer nearest to the exact
value of self / other, and if two integers are equally near then the
even one is chosen.
If the result is zero then its sign will be the sign of self.
