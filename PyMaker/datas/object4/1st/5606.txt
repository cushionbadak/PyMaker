fold_binary(name, value)Â¶
Headers are folded using the Header folding
algorithm, which preserves existing line breaks in the value, and wraps
each resulting line to the max_line_length.  If cte_type is
7bit, non-ascii binary data is CTE encoded using the unknown-8bit
charset.  Otherwise the original source header is used, with its existing
line breaks and any (RFC invalid) binary data it may contain.
