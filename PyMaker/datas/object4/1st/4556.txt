SimpleQueue.put(item, block=True, timeout=None)Â¶
Put item into the queue.  The method never blocks and always succeeds
(except for potential low-level errors such as failure to allocate memory).
The optional args block and timeout are ignored and only provided
for compatibility with Queue.put().

CPython implementation detail: This method has a C implementation which is reentrant.  That is, a
put() or get() call can be interrupted by another put()
call in the same thread without deadlocking or corrupting internal
state inside the queue.  This makes it appropriate for use in
destructors such as __del__ methods or weakref callbacks.
