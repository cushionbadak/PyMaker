class doctest.DebugRunner(checker=None, verbose=None, optionflags=0)¶
A subclass of DocTestRunner that raises an exception as soon as a
failure is encountered.  If an unexpected exception occurs, an
UnexpectedException exception is raised, containing the test, the
example, and the original exception.  If the output doesn’t match, then a
DocTestFailure exception is raised, containing the test, the example, and
the actual output.
For information about the constructor parameters and methods, see the
documentation for DocTestRunner in section Advanced API.
