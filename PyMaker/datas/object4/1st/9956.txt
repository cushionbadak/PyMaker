Class Objects¶
Class Class instances describe classes defined by class
statements.  They have the same attributes as Functions and two more.


Class.file¶
Name of the file in which the class is defined.



Class.module¶
The name of the module defining the class described.



Class.name¶
The name of the class.



Class.lineno¶
The line number in the file where the definition starts.



Class.parent¶
For top-level classes, None.  For nested classes, the parent.

New in version 3.7.




Class.children¶
A dictionary mapping names to descriptors for nested functions and
classes.

New in version 3.7.




Class.super¶
A list of Class objects which describe the immediate base
classes of the class being described.  Classes which are named as
superclasses but which are not discoverable by readmodule_ex()
are listed as a string with the class name instead of as
Class objects.



Class.methods¶
A dictionary mapping method names to line numbers.  This can be
derived from the newer children dictionary, but remains for
back-compatibility.
