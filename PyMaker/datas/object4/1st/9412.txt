class traceback.StackSummary¶


classmethod extract(frame_gen, *, limit=None, lookup_lines=True, capture_locals=False)¶
Construct a StackSummary object from a frame generator (such as
is returned by walk_stack() or
walk_tb()).
If limit is supplied, only this many frames are taken from frame_gen.
If lookup_lines is False, the returned FrameSummary
objects will not have read their lines in yet, making the cost of
creating the StackSummary cheaper (which may be valuable if it
may not actually get formatted). If capture_locals is True the
local variables in each FrameSummary are captured as object
representations.



classmethod from_list(a_list)¶
Construct a StackSummary object from a supplied list of
FrameSummary objects or old-style list of tuples.  Each tuple
should be a 4-tuple with filename, lineno, name, line as the elements.



format()¶
Returns a list of strings ready for printing.  Each string in the
resulting list corresponds to a single frame from the stack.
Each string ends in a newline; the strings may contain internal
newlines as well, for those items with source text lines.
For long sequences of the same frame and line, the first few
repetitions are shown, followed by a summary line stating the exact
number of further repetitions.

Changed in version 3.6: Long sequences of repeated frames are now abbreviated.
