constÂ¶
The const argument of add_argument() is used to hold
constant values that are not read from the command line but are required for
the various ArgumentParser actions.  The two most common uses of it are:

When add_argument() is called with
action='store_const' or action='append_const'.  These actions add the
const value to one of the attributes of the object returned by
parse_args(). See the action description for examples.
When add_argument() is called with option strings
(like -f or --foo) and nargs='?'.  This creates an optional
argument that can be followed by zero or one command-line arguments.
When parsing the command line, if the option string is encountered with no
command-line argument following it, the value of const will be assumed instead.
See the nargs description for examples.

With the 'store_const' and 'append_const' actions, the const
keyword argument must be given.  For other actions, it defaults to None.
