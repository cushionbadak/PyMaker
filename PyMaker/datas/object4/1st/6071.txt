html.entities.html5Â¶
A dictionary that maps HTML5 named character references [1] to the
equivalent Unicode character(s), e.g. html5['gt;'] == '>'.
Note that the trailing semicolon is included in the name (e.g. 'gt;'),
however some of the names are accepted by the standard even without the
semicolon: in this case the name is present with and without the ';'.
See also html.unescape().

New in version 3.3.
