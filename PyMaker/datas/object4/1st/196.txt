__spec__Â¶
The __spec__ attribute must be set to the module spec that was
used when importing the module. Setting __spec__
appropriately applies equally to modules initialized during
interpreter startup.  The one exception is __main__,
where __spec__ is set to None in some cases.
When __package__ is not defined, __spec__.parent is used as
a fallback.

New in version 3.4.


Changed in version 3.6: __spec__.parent is used as a fallback when __package__ is
not defined.
