Example Objects¶


class doctest.Example(source, want, exc_msg=None, lineno=0, indent=0, options=None)¶
A single interactive example, consisting of a Python statement and its expected
output.  The constructor arguments are used to initialize the attributes of
the same names.
Example defines the following attributes.  They are initialized by
the constructor, and should not be modified directly.


source¶
A string containing the example’s source code.  This source code consists of a
single Python statement, and always ends with a newline; the constructor adds
a newline when necessary.



want¶
The expected output from running the example’s source code (either from
stdout, or a traceback in case of exception).  want ends with a
newline unless no output is expected, in which case it’s an empty string.  The
constructor adds a newline when necessary.



exc_msg¶
The exception message generated by the example, if the example is expected to
generate an exception; or None if it is not expected to generate an
exception.  This exception message is compared against the return value of
traceback.format_exception_only().  exc_msg ends with a newline
unless it’s None.  The constructor adds a newline if needed.



lineno¶
The line number within the string containing this example where the example
begins.  This line number is zero-based with respect to the beginning of the
containing string.



indent¶
The example’s indentation in the containing string, i.e., the number of space
characters that precede the example’s first prompt.



options¶
A dictionary mapping from option flags to True or False, which is used
to override default options for this example.  Any option flags not contained
in this dictionary are left at their default value (as specified by the
DocTestRunner’s optionflags). By default, no options are set.
