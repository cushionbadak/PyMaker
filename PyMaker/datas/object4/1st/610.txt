Code Objects¶
Code objects are used by the implementation to represent “pseudo-compiled”
executable Python code such as a function body. They differ from function
objects because they don’t contain a reference to their global execution
environment.  Code objects are returned by the built-in compile() function
and can be extracted from function objects through their __code__
attribute. See also the code module.
A code object can be executed or evaluated by passing it (instead of a source
string) to the exec() or eval()  built-in functions.
See The standard type hierarchy for more information.
