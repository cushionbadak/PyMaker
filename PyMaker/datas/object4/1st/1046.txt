readlines([sizehint[, keepends]])¶
Read all lines available on the input stream and return them as a list of
lines.
Line-endings are implemented using the codec’s decoder method and are
included in the list entries if keepends is true.
sizehint, if given, is passed as the size argument to the stream’s
read() method.
