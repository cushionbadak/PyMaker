os.sep¶
The character used by the operating system to separate pathname components.
This is '/' for POSIX and '\\' for Windows.  Note that knowing this
is not sufficient to be able to parse or concatenate pathnames — use
os.path.split() and os.path.join() — but it is occasionally
useful. Also available via os.path.
