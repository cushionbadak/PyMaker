handleError(record)Â¶
This method should be called from handlers when an exception is encountered
during an emit() call. If the module-level attribute
raiseExceptions is False, exceptions get silently ignored. This is
what is mostly wanted for a logging system - most users will not care about
errors in the logging system, they are more interested in application
errors. You could, however, replace this with a custom handler if you wish.
The specified record is the one which was being processed when the exception
occurred. (The default value of raiseExceptions is True, as that is
more useful during development).
