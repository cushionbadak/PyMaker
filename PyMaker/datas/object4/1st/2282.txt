rmtree exampleÂ¶
This example shows how to remove a directory tree on Windows where some
of the files have their read-only bit set. It uses the onerror callback
to clear the readonly bit and reattempt the remove. Any subsequent failure
will propagate.
import os, stat
import shutil

def remove_readonly(func, path, _):
    "Clear the readonly bit and reattempt the removal"
    os.chmod(path, stat.S_IWRITE)
    func(path)

shutil.rmtree(directory, onerror=remove_readonly)
