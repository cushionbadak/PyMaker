inspect.getdoc(object)Â¶
Get the documentation string for an object, cleaned up with cleandoc().
If the documentation string for an object is not provided and the object is
a class, a method, a property or a descriptor, retrieve the documentation
string from the inheritance hierarchy.

Changed in version 3.5: Documentation strings are now inherited if not overridden.
