asyncio.run(coro, *, debug=False)¶
This function runs the passed coroutine, taking care of
managing the asyncio event loop and finalizing asynchronous
generators.
This function cannot be called when another asyncio event loop is
running in the same thread.
If debug is True, the event loop will be run in debug mode.
This function always creates a new event loop and closes it at
the end.  It should be used as a main entry point for asyncio
programs, and should ideally only be called once.

New in version 3.7: Important: this function has been added to asyncio in
Python 3.7 on a provisional basis.
