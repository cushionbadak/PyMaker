3.3.3.4. Preparing the class namespaceÂ¶
Once the appropriate metaclass has been identified, then the class namespace
is prepared. If the metaclass has a __prepare__ attribute, it is called
as namespace = metaclass.__prepare__(name, bases, **kwds) (where the
additional keyword arguments, if any, come from the class definition).
If the metaclass has no __prepare__ attribute, then the class namespace
is initialised as an empty ordered mapping.
