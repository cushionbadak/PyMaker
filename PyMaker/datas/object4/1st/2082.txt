os.path.exists(path)Â¶
Return True if path refers to an existing path or an open
file descriptor.  Returns False for broken symbolic links.  On
some platforms, this function may return False if permission is
not granted to execute os.stat() on the requested file, even
if the path physically exists.

Changed in version 3.3: path can now be an integer: True is returned if it is an
 open file descriptor, False otherwise.


Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a path-like object.
