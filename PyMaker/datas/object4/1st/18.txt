2.2. Other tokensÂ¶
Besides NEWLINE, INDENT and DEDENT, the following categories of tokens exist:
identifiers, keywords, literals, operators, and delimiters. Whitespace
characters (other than line terminators, discussed earlier) are not tokens, but
serve to delimit tokens. Where ambiguity exists, a token comprises the longest
possible string that forms a legal token, when read from left to right.
