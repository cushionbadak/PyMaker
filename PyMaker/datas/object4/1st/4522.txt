subprocess.getoutput(cmd)¶
Return output (stdout and stderr) of executing cmd in a shell.
Like getstatusoutput(), except the exit code is ignored and the return
value is a string containing the command’s output.  Example:
>>> subprocess.getoutput('ls /bin/ls')
'/bin/ls'


Availability: POSIX & Windows.
