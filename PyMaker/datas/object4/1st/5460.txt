class mmap.mmap(fileno, length, tagname=None, access=ACCESS_DEFAULT[, offset])Â¶
(Windows version) Maps length bytes from the file specified by the
file handle fileno, and creates a mmap object.  If length is larger
than the current size of the file, the file is extended to contain length
bytes.  If length is 0, the maximum length of the map is the current
size of the file, except that if the file is empty Windows raises an
exception (you cannot create an empty mapping on Windows).
tagname, if specified and not None, is a string giving a tag name for
the mapping.  Windows allows you to have many different mappings against
the same file.  If you specify the name of an existing tag, that tag is
opened, otherwise a new tag of this name is created.  If this parameter is
omitted or None, the mapping is created without a name.  Avoiding the
use of the tag parameter will assist in keeping your code portable between
Unix and Windows.
offset may be specified as a non-negative integer offset. mmap references
will be relative to the offset from the beginning of the file. offset
defaults to 0.  offset must be a multiple of the ALLOCATIONGRANULARITY.
