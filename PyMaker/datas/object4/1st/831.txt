difflib.restore(sequence, which)Â¶
Return one of the two sequences that generated a delta.
Given a sequence produced by Differ.compare() or ndiff(), extract
lines originating from file 1 or 2 (parameter which), stripping off line
prefixes.
Example:
>>> diff = ndiff('one\ntwo\nthree\n'.splitlines(keepends=True),
...              'ore\ntree\nemu\n'.splitlines(keepends=True))
>>> diff = list(diff) # materialize the generated delta into a list
>>> print(''.join(restore(diff, 1)), end="")
one
two
three
>>> print(''.join(restore(diff, 2)), end="")
ore
tree
emu
