logging.getLogRecordFactory()Â¶
Return a callable which is used to create a LogRecord.

New in version 3.2: This function has been provided, along with setLogRecordFactory(),
to allow developers more control over how the LogRecord
representing a logging event is constructed.

See setLogRecordFactory() for more information about the how the
factory is called.
