cgi.parse_multipart(fp, pdict, encoding="utf-8", errors="replace")¶
Parse input of type multipart/form-data (for  file uploads).
Arguments are fp for the input file, pdict for a dictionary containing
other parameters in the Content-Type header, and encoding,
the request encoding.
Returns a dictionary just like urllib.parse.parse_qs(): keys are the
field names, each value is a list of values for that field. For non-file
fields, the value is a list of strings.
This is easy to use but not much good if you are expecting megabytes to be
uploaded — in that case, use the FieldStorage class instead
which is much more flexible.

Changed in version 3.7: Added the encoding and errors parameters.  For non-file fields, the
value is now a list of strings, not bytes.
