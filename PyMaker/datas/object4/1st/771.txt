re.finditer(pattern, string, flags=0)Â¶
Return an iterator yielding match objects over
all non-overlapping matches for the RE pattern in string.  The string
is scanned left-to-right, and matches are returned in the order found.  Empty
matches are included in the result.

Changed in version 3.7: Non-empty matches can now start just after a previous empty match.
