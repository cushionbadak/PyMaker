SSLContext.set_ecdh_curve(curve_name)¶
Set the curve name for Elliptic Curve-based Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key
exchange.  ECDH is significantly faster than regular DH while arguably
as secure.  The curve_name parameter should be a string describing
a well-known elliptic curve, for example prime256v1 for a widely
supported curve.
This setting doesn’t apply to client sockets.  You can also use the
OP_SINGLE_ECDH_USE option to further improve security.
This method is not available if HAS_ECDH is False.

New in version 3.3.
