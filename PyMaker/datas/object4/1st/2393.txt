sqlite3.register_converter(typename, callable)Â¶
Registers a callable to convert a bytestring from the database into a custom
Python type. The callable will be invoked for all database values that are of
the type typename. Confer the parameter detect_types of the connect()
function for how the type detection works. Note that typename and the name of
the type in your query are matched in case-insensitive manner.
