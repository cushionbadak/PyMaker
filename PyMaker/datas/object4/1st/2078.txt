os.path.basename(path)Â¶
Return the base name of pathname path.  This is the second element of the
pair returned by passing path to the function split().  Note that
the result of this function is different
from the Unix basename program; where basename for
'/foo/bar/' returns 'bar', the basename() function returns an
empty string ('').

Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a path-like object.
