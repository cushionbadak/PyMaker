exec_module(module)Â¶
An abstract method that executes the module in its own namespace
when a module is imported or reloaded.  The module should already
be initialized when exec_module() is called. When this method exists,
create_module() must be defined.

New in version 3.4.


Changed in version 3.6: create_module() must also be defined.
