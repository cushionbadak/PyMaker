docs:


coroutine loop.shutdown_asyncgens()Â¶
Schedule all currently open asynchronous generator objects to
close with an aclose() call.  After calling this method,
the event loop will issue a warning if a new asynchronous generator
is iterated. This should be used to reliably finalize all scheduled
asynchronous generators.
Note that there is no need to call this function when
asyncio.run() is used.
Example:
try:
    loop.run_forever()
finally:
    loop.run_until_complete(loop.shutdown_asyncgens())
    loop.close()



New in version 3.6.
