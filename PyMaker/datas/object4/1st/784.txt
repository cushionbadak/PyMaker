Pattern.match(string[, pos[, endpos]])Â¶
If zero or more characters at the beginning of string match this regular
expression, return a corresponding match object.
Return None if the string does not match the pattern; note that this is
different from a zero-length match.
The optional pos and endpos parameters have the same meaning as for the
search() method.
>>> pattern = re.compile("o")
>>> pattern.match("dog")      # No match as "o" is not at the start of "dog".
>>> pattern.match("dog", 1)   # Match as "o" is the 2nd character of "dog".
<re.Match object; span=(1, 2), match='o'>


If you want to locate a match anywhere in string, use
search() instead (see also search() vs. match()).
