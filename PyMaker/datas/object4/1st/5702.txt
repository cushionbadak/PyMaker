get_params(failobj=None, header='content-type', unquote=True)¶
Return the message’s Content-Type parameters, as a list.
The elements of the returned list are 2-tuples of key/value pairs, as
split on the '=' sign.  The left hand side of the '=' is the key,
while the right hand side is the value.  If there is no '=' sign in
the parameter the value is the empty string, otherwise the value is as
described in get_param() and is unquoted if optional unquote is
True (the default).
Optional failobj is the object to return if there is no
Content-Type header.  Optional header is the header to
search instead of Content-Type.
This is a legacy method.  On the
EmailMessage class its functionality is
replaced by the params property of the individual header objects
returned by the header access methods.
