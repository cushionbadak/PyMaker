os.lchown(path, uid, gid)Â¶
Change the owner and group id of path to the numeric uid and gid.  This
function will not follow symbolic links.  As of Python 3.3, this is equivalent
to os.chown(path, uid, gid, follow_symlinks=False).
Availability: Unix.

Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a path-like object.
