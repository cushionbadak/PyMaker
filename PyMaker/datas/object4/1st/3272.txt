Raw I/OÂ¶
Raw I/O (also called unbuffered I/O) is generally used as a low-level
building-block for binary and text streams; it is rarely useful to directly
manipulate a raw stream from user code.  Nevertheless, you can create a raw
stream by opening a file in binary mode with buffering disabled:
f = open("myfile.jpg", "rb", buffering=0)


The raw stream API is described in detail in the docs of RawIOBase.
