UNCHECKED_HASHÂ¶
Like CHECKED_HASH, the .pyc file includes a hash of the source
file content. However, Python will at runtime assume the .pyc file is
up to date and not validate the .pyc against the source file at all.
This option is useful when the .pycs are kept up to date by some
system external to Python like a build system.
