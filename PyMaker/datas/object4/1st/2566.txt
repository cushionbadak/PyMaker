classmethod ZipInfo.from_file(filename, arcname=None)Â¶
Construct a ZipInfo instance for a file on the filesystem, in
preparation for adding it to a zip file.
filename should be the path to a file or directory on the filesystem.
If arcname is specified, it is used as the name within the archive.
If arcname is not specified, the name will be the same as filename, but
with any drive letter and leading path separators removed.

New in version 3.6.


Changed in version 3.6.2: The filename parameter accepts a path-like object.
