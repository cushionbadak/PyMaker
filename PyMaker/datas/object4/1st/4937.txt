DatagramProtocol.error_received(exc)Â¶
Called when a previous send or receive operation raises an
OSError.  exc is the OSError instance.
This method is called in rare conditions, when the transport (e.g. UDP)
detects that a datagram could not be delivered to its recipient.
In many conditions though, undeliverable datagrams will be silently
dropped.
