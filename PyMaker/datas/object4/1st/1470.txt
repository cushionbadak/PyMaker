Repr.repr1(obj, level)Â¶
Recursive implementation used by repr().  This uses the type of obj to
determine which formatting method to call, passing it obj and level.  The
type-specific methods should call repr1() to perform recursive formatting,
with level - 1 for the value of level in the recursive  call.
