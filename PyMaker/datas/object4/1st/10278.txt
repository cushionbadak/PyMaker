Precomputed tables¶
msilib provides a few subpackages that contain only schema and table
definitions. Currently, these definitions are based on MSI version 2.0.


msilib.schema¶
This is the standard MSI schema for MSI 2.0, with the tables variable
providing a list of table definitions, and _Validation_records providing the
data for MSI validation.



msilib.sequence¶
This module contains table contents for the standard sequence tables:
AdminExecuteSequence, AdminUISequence, AdvtExecuteSequence,
InstallExecuteSequence, and InstallUISequence.



msilib.text¶
This module contains definitions for the UIText and ActionText tables, for the
standard installer actions.
