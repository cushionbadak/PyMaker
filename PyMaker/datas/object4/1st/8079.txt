Tab Identifiers¶
The tab_id present in several methods of ttk.Notebook may take any
of the following forms:

An integer between zero and the number of tabs
The name of a child window
A positional specification of the form “@x,y”, which identifies the tab
The literal string “current”, which identifies the currently-selected tab
The literal string “end”, which returns the number of tabs (only valid for
Notebook.index())
