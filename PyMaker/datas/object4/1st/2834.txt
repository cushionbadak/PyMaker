hash.nameÂ¶
The canonical name of this hash, always lowercase and always suitable as a
parameter to new() to create another hash of this type.

Changed in version 3.4: The name attribute has been present in CPython since its inception, but
until Python 3.4 was not formally specified, so may not exist on some
platforms.
