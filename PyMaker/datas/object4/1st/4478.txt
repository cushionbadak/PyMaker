Popen.stdoutÂ¶
If the stdout argument was PIPE, this attribute is a readable
stream object as returned by open(). Reading from the stream provides
output from the child process. If the encoding or errors arguments were
specified or the universal_newlines argument was True, the stream is a
text stream, otherwise it is a byte stream. If the stdout argument was not
PIPE, this attribute is None.
