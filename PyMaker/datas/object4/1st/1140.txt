datetime.ctime()¶
Return a string representing the date and time, for example datetime(2002, 12,
4, 20, 30, 40).ctime() == 'Wed Dec  4 20:30:40 2002'. d.ctime() is
equivalent to time.ctime(time.mktime(d.timetuple())) on platforms where the
native C ctime() function (which time.ctime() invokes, but which
datetime.ctime() does not invoke) conforms to the C standard.
