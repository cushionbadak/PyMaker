os.wait4(pid, options)¶
Similar to waitpid(), except a 3-element tuple, containing the child’s
process id, exit status indication, and resource usage information is returned.
Refer to resource.getrusage() for details on
resource usage information.  The arguments to wait4() are the same
as those provided to waitpid().
Availability: Unix.
