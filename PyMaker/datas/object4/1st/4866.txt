result()¶
Return the result of the Future.
If the Future is done and has a result set by the
set_result() method, the result value is returned.
If the Future is done and has an exception set by the
set_exception() method, this method raises the exception.
If the Future has been cancelled, this method raises
a CancelledError exception.
If the Future’s result isn’t yet available, this method raises
a InvalidStateError exception.
