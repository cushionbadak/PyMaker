Edge and Level Trigger Polling (epoll) Objects¶

https://linux.die.net/man/4/epoll
eventmask






Constant
Meaning



EPOLLIN
Available for read

EPOLLOUT
Available for write

EPOLLPRI
Urgent data for read

EPOLLERR
Error condition happened on the assoc. fd

EPOLLHUP
Hang up happened on the assoc. fd

EPOLLET
Set Edge Trigger behavior, the default is
Level Trigger behavior

EPOLLONESHOT
Set one-shot behavior. After one event is
pulled out, the fd is internally disabled

EPOLLEXCLUSIVE
Wake only one epoll object when the
associated fd has an event. The default (if
this flag is not set) is to wake all epoll
objects polling on a fd.

EPOLLRDHUP
Stream socket peer closed connection or shut
down writing half of connection.

EPOLLRDNORM
Equivalent to EPOLLIN

EPOLLRDBAND
Priority data band can be read.

EPOLLWRNORM
Equivalent to EPOLLOUT

EPOLLWRBAND
Priority data may be written.

EPOLLMSG
Ignored.




New in version 3.6: EPOLLEXCLUSIVE was added.  It’s only supported by Linux Kernel 4.5
or later.




epoll.close()¶
Close the control file descriptor of the epoll object.



epoll.closed¶
True if the epoll object is closed.



epoll.fileno()¶
Return the file descriptor number of the control fd.



epoll.fromfd(fd)¶
Create an epoll object from a given file descriptor.



epoll.register(fd[, eventmask])¶
Register a fd descriptor with the epoll object.



epoll.modify(fd, eventmask)¶
Modify a registered file descriptor.



epoll.unregister(fd)¶
Remove a registered file descriptor from the epoll object.



epoll.poll(timeout=-1, maxevents=-1)¶
Wait for events. timeout in seconds (float)

Changed in version 3.5: The function is now retried with a recomputed timeout when interrupted by
a signal, except if the signal handler raises an exception (see
PEP 475 for the rationale), instead of raising
InterruptedError.
