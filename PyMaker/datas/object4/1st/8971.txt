l(ist) [first[, last]]Â¶
List source code for the current file.  Without arguments, list 11 lines
around the current line or continue the previous listing.  With . as
argument, list 11 lines around the current line.  With one argument,
list 11 lines around at that line.  With two arguments, list the given range;
if the second argument is less than the first, it is interpreted as a count.
The current line in the current frame is indicated by ->.  If an
exception is being debugged, the line where the exception was originally
raised or propagated is indicated by >>, if it differs from the current
line.

New in version 3.2: The >> marker.
