<dd><p>Attaches the callable <em>fn</em> to the future.  <em>fn</em> will be called, with the
future as its only argument, when the future is cancelled or finishes
running.</p>
<p>Added callables are called in the order that they were added and are
always called in a thread belonging to the process that added them.  If
the callable raises an <a class="reference internal" href="exceptions.html#Exception" title="Exception"><code class="xref py py-exc docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Exception</span></code></a> subclass, it will be logged and
ignored.  If the callable raises a <a class="reference internal" href="exceptions.html#BaseException" title="BaseException"><code class="xref py py-exc docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BaseException</span></code></a> subclass, the
behavior is undefined.</p>
<p>If the future has already completed or been cancelled, <em>fn</em> will be
called immediately.</p>
