str.upper()¶
Return a copy of the string with all the cased characters [4] converted to
uppercase.  Note that s.upper().isupper() might be False if s
contains uncased characters or if the Unicode category of the resulting
character(s) is not “Lu” (Letter, uppercase), but e.g. “Lt” (Letter,
titlecase).
The uppercasing algorithm used is described in section 3.13 of the Unicode
Standard.
