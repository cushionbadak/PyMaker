wsgiref.simple_server.make_server(host, port, app, server_class=WSGIServer, handler_class=WSGIRequestHandler)Â¶
Create a new WSGI server listening on host and port, accepting connections
for app.  The return value is an instance of the supplied server_class, and
will process requests using the specified handler_class.  app must be a WSGI
application object, as defined by PEP 3333.
Example usage:
from wsgiref.simple_server import make_server, demo_app

with make_server('', 8000, demo_app) as httpd:
    print("Serving HTTP on port 8000...")

    # Respond to requests until process is killed
    httpd.serve_forever()

    # Alternative: serve one request, then exit
    httpd.handle_request()
