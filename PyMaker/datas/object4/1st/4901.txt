WriteTransport.set_write_buffer_limits(high=None, low=None)¶
Set the high and low watermarks for write flow control.
These two values (measured in number of
bytes) control when the protocol’s
protocol.pause_writing()
and protocol.resume_writing()
methods are called. If specified, the low watermark must be less
than or equal to the high watermark.  Neither high nor low
can be negative.
pause_writing() is called when the buffer size
becomes greater than or equal to the high value. If writing has
been paused, resume_writing() is called when
the buffer size becomes less than or equal to the low value.
The defaults are implementation-specific.  If only the
high watermark is given, the low watermark defaults to an
implementation-specific value less than or equal to the
high watermark.  Setting high to zero forces low to zero as
well, and causes pause_writing() to be called
whenever the buffer becomes non-empty.  Setting low to zero causes
resume_writing() to be called only once the
buffer is empty. Use of zero for either limit is generally
sub-optimal as it reduces opportunities for doing I/O and
computation concurrently.
Use get_write_buffer_limits()
to get the limits.
