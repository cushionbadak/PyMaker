bytes.rpartition(sep)¶

bytearray.rpartition(sep)¶
Split the sequence at the last occurrence of sep, and return a 3-tuple
containing the part before the separator, the separator itself or its
bytearray copy, and the part after the separator.
If the separator is not found, return a 3-tuple
containing two empty bytes or bytearray objects, followed by a copy of the
original sequence.
The separator to search for may be any bytes-like object.
