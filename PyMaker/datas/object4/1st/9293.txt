Default Warning FilterÂ¶
By default, Python installs several warning filters, which can be overridden by
the -W command-line option, the PYTHONWARNINGS environment
variable and calls to filterwarnings().
In regular release builds, the default warning filter has the following entries
(in order of precedence):
default::DeprecationWarning:__main__
ignore::DeprecationWarning
ignore::PendingDeprecationWarning
ignore::ImportWarning
ignore::ResourceWarning


In debug builds, the list of default warning filters is empty.

Changed in version 3.2: DeprecationWarning is now ignored by default in addition to
PendingDeprecationWarning.


Changed in version 3.7: DeprecationWarning is once again shown by default when triggered
directly by code in __main__.


Changed in version 3.7: BytesWarning no longer appears in the default filter list and is
instead configured via sys.warnoptions when -b is specified
twice.
