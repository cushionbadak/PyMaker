class imp.NullImporter(path_string)¶
The NullImporter type is a PEP 302 import hook that handles
non-directory path strings by failing to find any modules.  Calling this type
with an existing directory or empty string raises ImportError.
Otherwise, a NullImporter instance is returned.
Instances have only one method:


find_module(fullname[, path])¶
This method always returns None, indicating that the requested module could
not be found.


Changed in version 3.3: None is inserted into sys.path_importer_cache instead of an
instance of NullImporter.


Deprecated since version 3.4: Insert None into sys.path_importer_cache instead.
