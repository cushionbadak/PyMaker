pops up over a widget to provide help.  When the user moves the cursor inside a
widget to which a Balloon widget has been bound, a small pop-up window with a
descriptive message will be shown on the screen.

The ButtonBox
widget creates a box of buttons, such as is commonly used for Ok Cancel.

The ComboBox
widget is similar to the combo box control in MS Windows. The user can select a
choice by either typing in the entry subwidget or selecting from the listbox
subwidget.



class tkinter.tix.Control¶
The Control
widget is also known as the SpinBox widget. The user can adjust the
value by pressing the two arrow buttons or by entering the value directly into
the entry. The new value will be checked against the user-defined upper and
lower limits.



class tkinter.tix.LabelEntry¶
The LabelEntry

be used to simplify the creation of “entry-form” type of interface.



class tkinter.tix.LabelFrame¶

widget packages a frame widget and a label into one mega widget.  To create
widgets inside a LabelFrame widget, one creates the new widgets relative to the
frame subwidget and manage them inside the frame subwidget.

The Meter widget
can be used to show the progress of a background job which may take a long time
to execute.



class tkinter.tix.OptionMenu¶
The OptionMenu
creates a menu button of options.

of the Tix PopupMenu widget is it requires less application code
to manipulate.



class tkinter.tix.Select¶
The Select widget
is a container of button subwidgets. It can be used to provide radio-box or
check-box style of selection options for the user.



class tkinter.tix.StdButtonBox¶
The StdButtonBox
widget is a group of standard buttons for Motif-like dialog boxes.

The DirSelectDialog
widget presents the directories in the file system in a dialog window.  The user
can use this dialog window to navigate through the file system to select the
desired directory.



class tkinter.tix.DirSelectBox¶
The DirSelectBox is similar to the standard Motif(TM)
directory-selection box. It is generally used for the user to choose a
directory.  DirSelectBox stores the directories mostly recently selected into
a ComboBox widget so that they can be quickly selected again.



class tkinter.tix.ExFileSelectBox¶
The ExFileSelectBox
widget is usually embedded in a tixExFileSelectDialog widget. It provides a
convenient method for the user to select files. The style of the

can be used to display any data that have a hierarchical structure, for example,
file system directory trees. The list entries are indented and connected by
branch lines according to their places in the hierarchy.



class tkinter.tix.CheckList¶

The TList widget
can be used to display data in a tabular format. The list entries of a
TList widget are similar to the entries in the Tk listbox widget.  The
main differences are (1) the TList widget can display the list entries
in a two dimensional format and (2) you can use graphical images as well as
multiple colors and fonts for the list entries.



Manager Widgets¶

The ListNoteBook
widget is very similar to the TixNoteBook widget: it can be used to
display many windows in a limited space using a notebook metaphor. The notebook
is divided into a stack of pages (windows). At one time only one of these pages
can be shown. The user can navigate through these pages by choosing the name of
the desired page in the hlist subwidget.



class tkinter.tix.NoteBook¶
The NoteBook
widget can be used to display many windows in a limited space using a notebook
metaphor. The notebook is divided into a stack of pages. At one time only one of

the visual “tabs” at the top of the NoteBook widget.



Image Types¶
The tkinter.tix module adds:

pixmap
capabilities to all tkinter.tix and tkinter widgets to create
color images from XPM files.
Compound image
types can be used to create images that consists of multiple horizontal lines;
each line is composed of a series of items (texts, bitmaps, images or spaces)
arranged from left to right. For example, a compound image can be used to
display a bitmap and a text string simultaneously in a Tk Button
widget.



Miscellaneous Widgets¶


class tkinter.tix.InputOnly¶
The InputOnly
widgets are to accept inputs from the user, which can be done with the bind
command (Unix only).
