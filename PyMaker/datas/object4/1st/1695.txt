class decimal.BasicContext¶
This is a standard context defined by the General Decimal Arithmetic
Specification.  Precision is set to nine.  Rounding is set to
ROUND_HALF_UP.  All flags are cleared.  All traps are enabled (treated
as exceptions) except Inexact, Rounded, and
Subnormal.
Because many of the traps are enabled, this context is useful for debugging.
