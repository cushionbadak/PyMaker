email.policy.SMTPUTF8Â¶
The same as SMTP except that utf8 is True.
Useful for serializing messages to a message store without using encoded
words in the headers.  Should only be used for SMTP transmission if the
sender or recipient addresses have non-ASCII characters (the
smtplib.SMTP.send_message() method handles this automatically).
