copyreg.pickle(type, function, constructor=None)¶
Declares that function should be used as a “reduction” function for objects
of type type.  function should return either a string or a tuple
containing two or three elements.
The optional constructor parameter, if provided, is a callable object which
can be used to reconstruct the object when called with the tuple of arguments
returned by function at pickling time.  TypeError will be raised if
object is a class or constructor is not callable.
See the pickle module for more details on the interface
expected of function and constructor.  Note that the
dispatch_table attribute of a pickler
object or subclass of pickle.Pickler can also be used for
declaring reduction functions.
