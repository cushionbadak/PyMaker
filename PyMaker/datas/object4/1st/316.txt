dir([object])¶
Without arguments, return the list of names in the current local scope.  With an
argument, attempt to return a list of valid attributes for that object.
If the object has a method named __dir__(), this method will be called and
must return the list of attributes. This allows objects that implement a custom
__getattr__() or __getattribute__() function to customize the way
dir() reports their attributes.
If the object does not provide __dir__(), the function tries its best to
gather information from the object’s __dict__ attribute, if defined, and
from its type object.  The resulting list is not necessarily complete, and may
be inaccurate when the object has a custom __getattr__().
The default dir() mechanism behaves differently with different types of
objects, as it attempts to produce the most relevant, rather than complete,
information:

If the object is a module object, the list contains the names of the module’s
attributes.
If the object is a type or class object, the list contains the names of its
attributes, and recursively of the attributes of its bases.
Otherwise, the list contains the object’s attributes’ names, the names of its
class’s attributes, and recursively of the attributes of its class’s base
classes.

The resulting list is sorted alphabetically.  For example:
>>> import struct
>>> dir()   # show the names in the module namespace  # doctest: +SKIP
['__builtins__', '__name__', 'struct']
>>> dir(struct)   # show the names in the struct module # doctest: +SKIP
['Struct', '__all__', '__builtins__', '__cached__', '__doc__', '__file__',
 '__initializing__', '__loader__', '__name__', '__package__',
 '_clearcache', 'calcsize', 'error', 'pack', 'pack_into',
 'unpack', 'unpack_from']
>>> class Shape:
...     def __dir__(self):
...         return ['area', 'perimeter', 'location']
>>> s = Shape()
>>> dir(s)
['area', 'location', 'perimeter']



Note
Because dir() is supplied primarily as a convenience for use at an
interactive prompt, it tries to supply an interesting set of names more
than it tries to supply a rigorously or consistently defined set of names,
and its detailed behavior may change across releases.  For example,
metaclass attributes are not in the result list when the argument is a
class.
