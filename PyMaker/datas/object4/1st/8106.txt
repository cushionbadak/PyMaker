This widget accepts the following specific options:







Option
Description



columns
A list of column identifiers, specifying the number of
columns and their names.

displaycolumns
A list of column identifiers (either symbolic or
integer indices) specifying which data columns are
displayed and the order in which they appear, or the
string “#all”.

height
Specifies the number of rows which should be visible.
Note: the requested width is determined from the sum
of the column widths.

padding is a list of up to four length specifications.

selectmode
Controls how the built-in class bindings manage the
selection. One of “extended”, “browse” or “none”.
If set to “extended” (the default), multiple items may
be selected. If “browse”, only a single item will be
selected at a time. If “none”, the selection will not
be changed.
Note that the application code and tag bindings can set
the selection however they wish, regardless of the
value  of this option.


show
A list containing zero or more of the following values,
specifying which elements of the tree to display.

tree: display tree labels in column #0.
headings: display the heading row.

The default is “tree headings”, i.e., show all
elements.
Note: Column #0 always refers to the tree column,
even if show=”tree” is not specified.
