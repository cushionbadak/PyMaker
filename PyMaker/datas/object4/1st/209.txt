5.9. Open issues¶
XXX It would be really nice to have a diagram.
XXX * (import_machinery.rst) how about a section devoted just to the
attributes of modules and packages, perhaps expanding upon or supplanting the
related entries in the data model reference page?
XXX runpy, pkgutil, et al in the library manual should all get “See Also”
links at the top pointing to the new import system section.
XXX Add more explanation regarding the different ways in which
__main__ is initialized?
XXX Add more info on __main__ quirks/pitfalls (i.e. copy from
PEP 395).
