Is there a curses/termcap package for Python?¶
For Unix variants: The standard Python source distribution comes with a curses
module in the Modules subdirectory, though it’s not compiled by default.
(Note that this is not available in the Windows distribution – there is no
curses module for Windows.)
The curses module supports basic curses features as well as many additional
functions from ncurses and SYSV curses such as colour, alternative character set
support, pads, and mouse support. This means the module isn’t compatible with
operating systems that only have BSD curses, but there don’t seem to be any
currently maintained OSes that fall into this category.
For Windows: use the consolelib module.
