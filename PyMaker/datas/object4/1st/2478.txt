Decompress.decompress(data, max_length=0)Â¶
Decompress data, returning a bytes object containing the uncompressed data
corresponding to at least part of the data in string.  This data should be
concatenated to the output produced by any preceding calls to the
decompress() method.  Some of the input data may be preserved in internal
buffers for later processing.
If the optional parameter max_length is non-zero then the return value will be
no longer than max_length. This may mean that not all of the compressed input
can be processed; and unconsumed data will be stored in the attribute
unconsumed_tail. This bytestring must be passed to a subsequent call to
decompress() if decompression is to continue.  If max_length is zero
then the whole input is decompressed, and unconsumed_tail is empty.

Changed in version 3.6: max_length can be used as a keyword argument.
