docs:


handle_error(request, client_address)Â¶
This function is called if the handle()
method of a RequestHandlerClass instance raises
an exception.  The default action is to print the traceback to
standard error and continue handling further requests.

Changed in version 3.6: Now only called for exceptions derived from the Exception
class.
