class xml.sax.xmlreader.AttributesNSImpl(attrs, qnames)Â¶
Namespace-aware variant of AttributesImpl, which will be passed to
startElementNS(). It is derived from AttributesImpl, but
understands attribute names as two-tuples of namespaceURI and
localname. In addition, it provides a number of methods expecting qualified
names as they appear in the original document.  This class implements the
AttributesNS interface (see section The AttributesNS Interface).
