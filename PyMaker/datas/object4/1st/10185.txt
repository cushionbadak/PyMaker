formatter.push_margin(margin)Â¶
Increase the number of left margin indentations by one, associating the logical
tag margin with the new indentation.  The initial margin level is 0.
Changed values of the logical tag must be true values; false values other than
AS_IS are not sufficient to change the margin.
