exception urllib.error.ContentTooShortError(msg, content)Â¶
This exception is raised when the urlretrieve()
function detects that
the amount of the downloaded data is less than the expected amount (given by
the Content-Length header).  The content attribute stores the
downloaded (and supposedly truncated) data.
