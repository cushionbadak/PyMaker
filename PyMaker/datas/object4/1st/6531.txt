Functions¶
These are useful if you want more control, or if you want to employ some of the
algorithms implemented in this module in other circumstances.


cgi.parse(fp=None, environ=os.environ, keep_blank_values=False, strict_parsing=False)¶
Parse a query in the environment or from a file (the file defaults to
sys.stdin).  The keep_blank_values and strict_parsing parameters are
passed to urllib.parse.parse_qs() unchanged.



cgi.parse_qs(qs, keep_blank_values=False, strict_parsing=False)¶
This function is deprecated in this module. Use urllib.parse.parse_qs()
instead. It is maintained here only for backward compatibility.



cgi.parse_qsl(qs, keep_blank_values=False, strict_parsing=False)¶
This function is deprecated in this module. Use urllib.parse.parse_qsl()
instead. It is maintained here only for backward compatibility.



cgi.parse_multipart(fp, pdict, encoding="utf-8", errors="replace")¶
Parse input of type multipart/form-data (for  file uploads).
Arguments are fp for the input file, pdict for a dictionary containing
other parameters in the Content-Type header, and encoding,
the request encoding.
Returns a dictionary just like urllib.parse.parse_qs(): keys are the
field names, each value is a list of values for that field. For non-file
fields, the value is a list of strings.
This is easy to use but not much good if you are expecting megabytes to be
uploaded — in that case, use the FieldStorage class instead
which is much more flexible.

Changed in version 3.7: Added the encoding and errors parameters.  For non-file fields, the
value is now a list of strings, not bytes.




cgi.parse_header(string)¶
Parse a MIME header (such as Content-Type) into a main value and a
dictionary of parameters.



cgi.test()¶
Robust test CGI script, usable as main program. Writes minimal HTTP headers and
formats all information provided to the script in HTML form.



cgi.print_environ()¶
Format the shell environment in HTML.



cgi.print_form(form)¶
Format a form in HTML.



cgi.print_directory()¶
Format the current directory in HTML.



cgi.print_environ_usage()¶
Print a list of useful (used by CGI) environment variables in HTML.



cgi.escape(s, quote=False)¶
Convert the characters '&', '<' and '>' in string s to HTML-safe
sequences.  Use this if you need to display text that might contain such
characters in HTML.  If the optional flag quote is true, the quotation mark
character (") is also translated; this helps for inclusion in an HTML
attribute value delimited by double quotes, as in <a href="...">.  Note
that single quotes are never translated.

Deprecated since version 3.2: This function is unsafe because quote is false by default, and therefore
deprecated.  Use html.escape() instead.
