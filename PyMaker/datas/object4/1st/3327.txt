class io.BufferedRandom(raw, buffer_size=DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE)Â¶
A buffered interface to random access streams.  It inherits
BufferedReader and BufferedWriter, and further supports
seek() and tell() functionality.
The constructor creates a reader and writer for a seekable raw stream, given
in the first argument.  If the buffer_size is omitted it defaults to
DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE.
BufferedRandom is capable of anything BufferedReader or
BufferedWriter can do.
