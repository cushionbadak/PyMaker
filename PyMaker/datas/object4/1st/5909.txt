docs:


get_subdir()¶
Return either “new” (if the message should be stored in the new
subdirectory) or “cur” (if the message should be stored in the cur
subdirectory).

Note
A message is typically moved from new to cur after its
mailbox has been accessed, whether or not the message is has been
read. A message msg has been read if "S" in msg.get_flags() is
True.
