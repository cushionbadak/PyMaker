class datetime.datetime(year, month, day, hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0, tzinfo=None, *, fold=0)Â¶
The year, month and day arguments are required.  tzinfo may be None, or an
instance of a tzinfo subclass.  The remaining arguments may be integers,
in the following ranges:

MINYEAR <= year <= MAXYEAR,
1 <= month <= 12,
1 <= day <= number of days in the given month and year,
0 <= hour < 24,
0 <= minute < 60,
0 <= second < 60,
0 <= microsecond < 1000000,
fold in [0, 1].

If an argument outside those ranges is given, ValueError is raised.

New in version 3.6: Added the fold argument.
