static bytes.maketrans(from, to)¶

static bytearray.maketrans(from, to)¶
This static method returns a translation table usable for
bytes.translate() that will map each character in from into the
character at the same position in to; from and to must both be
bytes-like objects and have the same length.

New in version 3.1.
