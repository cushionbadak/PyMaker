wsgiref.simple_server.demo_app(environ, start_response)¶
This function is a small but complete WSGI application that returns a text page
containing the message “Hello world!” and a list of the key/value pairs provided
in the environ parameter.  It’s useful for verifying that a WSGI server (such
as wsgiref.simple_server) is able to run a simple WSGI application
correctly.
