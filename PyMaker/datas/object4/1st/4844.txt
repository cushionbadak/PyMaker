coroutine start_serving()Â¶
Start accepting connections.
This method is idempotent, so it can be called when
the server is already being serving.
The start_serving keyword-only parameter to
loop.create_server() and
asyncio.start_server() allows creating a Server object
that is not accepting connections initially.  In this case
Server.start_serving(), or Server.serve_forever() can be used
to make the Server start accepting connections.

New in version 3.7.
