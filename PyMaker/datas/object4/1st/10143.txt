Opcode collections¶
These collections are provided for automatic introspection of bytecode
instructions:


dis.opname¶
Sequence of operation names, indexable using the bytecode.



dis.opmap¶
Dictionary mapping operation names to bytecodes.



dis.cmp_op¶
Sequence of all compare operation names.



dis.hasconst¶
Sequence of bytecodes that access a constant.



dis.hasfree¶
Sequence of bytecodes that access a free variable (note that ‘free’ in this
context refers to names in the current scope that are referenced by inner
scopes or names in outer scopes that are referenced from this scope.  It does
not include references to global or builtin scopes).



dis.hasname¶
Sequence of bytecodes that access an attribute by name.



dis.hasjrel¶
Sequence of bytecodes that have a relative jump target.



dis.hasjabs¶
Sequence of bytecodes that have an absolute jump target.



dis.haslocal¶
Sequence of bytecodes that access a local variable.



dis.hascompare¶
Sequence of bytecodes of Boolean operations.
