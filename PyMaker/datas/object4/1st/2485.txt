gzip.open(filename, mode='rb', compresslevel=9, encoding=None, errors=None, newline=None)Â¶
Open a gzip-compressed file in binary or text mode, returning a file
object.
The filename argument can be an actual filename (a str or
bytes object), or an existing file object to read from or write to.
The mode argument can be any of 'r', 'rb', 'a', 'ab',
'w', 'wb', 'x' or 'xb' for binary mode, or 'rt',
'at', 'wt', or 'xt' for text mode. The default is 'rb'.
The compresslevel argument is an integer from 0 to 9, as for the
GzipFile constructor.
For binary mode, this function is equivalent to the GzipFile
constructor: GzipFile(filename, mode, compresslevel). In this case, the
encoding, errors and newline arguments must not be provided.
For text mode, a GzipFile object is created, and wrapped in an
io.TextIOWrapper instance with the specified encoding, error
handling behavior, and line ending(s).

Changed in version 3.3: Added support for filename being a file object, support for text mode,
and the encoding, errors and newline arguments.


Changed in version 3.4: Added support for the 'x', 'xb' and 'xt' modes.


Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a path-like object.
