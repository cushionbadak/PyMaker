Popen.stdinÂ¶
If the stdin argument was PIPE, this attribute is a writeable
stream object as returned by open(). If the encoding or errors
arguments were specified or the universal_newlines argument was True,
the stream is a text stream, otherwise it is a byte stream. If the stdin
argument was not PIPE, this attribute is None.
