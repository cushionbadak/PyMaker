importlib.util.spec_from_file_location(name, location, *, loader=None, submodule_search_locations=None)Â¶
A factory function for creating a ModuleSpec instance based
on the path to a file.  Missing information will be filled in on the
spec by making use of loader APIs and by the implication that the
module will be file-based.

New in version 3.4.


Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a path-like object.
