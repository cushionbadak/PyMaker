os.setpriority(which, who, priority)Â¶
Set program scheduling priority. The value which is one of
PRIO_PROCESS, PRIO_PGRP, or PRIO_USER, and who
is interpreted relative to which (a process identifier for
PRIO_PROCESS, process group identifier for PRIO_PGRP, and a
user ID for PRIO_USER). A zero value for who denotes
(respectively) the calling process, the process group of the calling process,
or the real user ID of the calling process.
priority is a value in the range -20 to 19. The default priority is 0;
lower priorities cause more favorable scheduling.
