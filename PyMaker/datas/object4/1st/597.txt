popitem()Â¶
Remove and return a (key, value) pair from the dictionary.
Pairs are returned in LIFO order.
popitem() is useful to destructively iterate over a dictionary, as
often used in set algorithms.  If the dictionary is empty, calling
popitem() raises a KeyError.

Changed in version 3.7: LIFO order is now guaranteed. In prior versions, popitem() would
return an arbitrary key/value pair.
