valueÂ¶
This attribute contains the actual value of the instance. For integer and
pointer types, it is an integer, for character types, it is a single
character bytes object or string, for character pointer types it is a
Python bytes object or string.
When the value attribute is retrieved from a ctypes instance, usually
a new object is returned each time.  ctypes does not implement
original object return, always a new object is constructed.  The same is
true for all other ctypes object instances.
