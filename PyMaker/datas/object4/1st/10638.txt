How do I delete a file? (And other file questions…)¶
Use os.remove(filename) or os.unlink(filename); for documentation, see
the os module.  The two functions are identical; unlink() is simply
the name of the Unix system call for this function.
To remove a directory, use os.rmdir(); use os.mkdir() to create one.
os.makedirs(path) will create any intermediate directories in path that
don’t exist. os.removedirs(path) will remove intermediate directories as
long as they’re empty; if you want to delete an entire directory tree and its
contents, use shutil.rmtree().
To rename a file, use os.rename(old_path, new_path).
To truncate a file, open it using f = open(filename, "rb+"), and use
f.truncate(offset); offset defaults to the current seek position.  There’s
also os.ftruncate(fd, offset) for files opened with os.open(), where
fd is the file descriptor (a small integer).
The shutil module also contains a number of functions to work on files
including copyfile(), copytree(), and
rmtree().
