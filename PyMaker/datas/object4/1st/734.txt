get_value(key, args, kwargs)¶
Retrieve a given field value.  The key argument will be either an
integer or a string.  If it is an integer, it represents the index of the
positional argument in args; if it is a string, then it represents a
named argument in kwargs.
The args parameter is set to the list of positional arguments to
vformat(), and the kwargs parameter is set to the dictionary of
keyword arguments.
For compound field names, these functions are only called for the first
component of the field name; Subsequent components are handled through
normal attribute and indexing operations.
So for example, the field expression ‘0.name’ would cause
get_value() to be called with a key argument of 0.  The name
attribute will be looked up after get_value() returns by calling the
built-in getattr() function.
If the index or keyword refers to an item that does not exist, then an
IndexError or KeyError should be raised.
