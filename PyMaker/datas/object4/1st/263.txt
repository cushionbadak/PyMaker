7.3. The assert statementÂ¶
Assert statements are a convenient way to insert debugging assertions into a
program:

assert_stmt ::=  "assert" expression ["," expression]

The simple form, assert expression, is equivalent to
if __debug__:
    if not expression: raise AssertionError


The extended form, assert expression1, expression2, is equivalent to
if __debug__:
    if not expression1: raise AssertionError(expression2)


These equivalences assume that __debug__ and AssertionError refer to
the built-in variables with those names.  In the current implementation, the
built-in variable __debug__ is True under normal circumstances,
False when optimization is requested (command line option -O).  The current
code generator emits no code for an assert statement when optimization is
requested at compile time.  Note that it is unnecessary to include the source
code for the expression that failed in the error message; it will be displayed
as part of the stack trace.
Assignments to __debug__ are illegal.  The value for the built-in variable
is determined when the interpreter starts.
