itertools.chain(*iterables)Â¶
Make an iterator that returns elements from the first iterable until it is
exhausted, then proceeds to the next iterable, until all of the iterables are
exhausted.  Used for treating consecutive sequences as a single sequence.
Roughly equivalent to:
def chain(*iterables):
    # chain('ABC', 'DEF') --> A B C D E F
    for it in iterables:
        for element in it:
            yield element
