lineno¶

col_offset¶
Instances of ast.expr and ast.stmt subclasses have
lineno and col_offset attributes.  The lineno is
the line number of source text (1-indexed so the first line is line 1) and
the col_offset is the UTF-8 byte offset of the first token that
generated the node.  The UTF-8 offset is recorded because the parser uses
UTF-8 internally.
