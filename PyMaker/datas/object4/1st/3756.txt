window.addch(ch[, attr])Â¶

window.addch(y, x, ch[, attr])
Paint character ch at (y, x) with attributes attr, overwriting any
character previously painter at that location.  By default, the character
position and attributes are the current settings for the window object.

Note
Writing outside the window, subwindow, or pad raises a curses.error.
Attempting to write to the lower right corner of a window, subwindow,
or pad will cause an exception to be raised after the character is printed.
