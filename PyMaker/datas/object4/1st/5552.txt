email.message_from_string(s, _class=None, *, policy=policy.compat32)Â¶
Return a message object structure from a string.  This is equivalent to
Parser().parsestr(s).  _class and policy are interpreted as
with the Parser class constructor.

Changed in version 3.3: Removed the strict argument.  Added the policy keyword.
