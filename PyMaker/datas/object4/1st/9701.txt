class importlib.machinery.WindowsRegistryFinderÂ¶
Finder for modules declared in the Windows registry.  This class
implements the importlib.abc.MetaPathFinder ABC.
Only class methods are defined by this class to alleviate the need for
instantiation.

New in version 3.3.


Deprecated since version 3.6: Use site configuration instead. Future versions of Python may
not enable this finder by default.
