content_managerÂ¶
An object with at least two methods: get_content and set_content.  When
the get_content() or
set_content() method of an
EmailMessage object is called, it calls the
corresponding method of this object, passing it the message object as its
first argument, and any arguments or keywords that were passed to it as
additional arguments.  By default content_manager is set to
raw_data_manager.

New in version 3.4.
