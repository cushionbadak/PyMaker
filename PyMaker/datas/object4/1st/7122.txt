class socketserver.TCPServer(server_address, RequestHandlerClass, bind_and_activate=True)Â¶
This uses the Internet TCP protocol, which provides for
continuous streams of data between the client and server.
If bind_and_activate is true, the constructor automatically attempts to
invoke server_bind() and
server_activate().  The other parameters are passed to
the BaseServer base class.
