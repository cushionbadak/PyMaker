SSLContext.maximum_versionÂ¶
A TLSVersion enum member representing the highest supported
TLS version. The value defaults to TLSVersion.MAXIMUM_SUPPORTED.
The attribute is read-only for protocols other than PROTOCOL_TLS,
PROTOCOL_TLS_CLIENT, and PROTOCOL_TLS_SERVER.
The attributes maximum_version,
minimum_version and
SSLContext.options all affect the supported SSL
and TLS versions of the context. The implementation does not prevent
invalid combination. For example a context with
OP_NO_TLSv1_2 in options and
maximum_version set to TLSVersion.TLSv1_2
will not be able to establish a TLS 1.2 connection.

Note
This attribute is not available unless the ssl module is compiled
with OpenSSL 1.1.0g or newer.


New in version 3.7.
