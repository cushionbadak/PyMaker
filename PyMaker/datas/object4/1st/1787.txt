class decimal.RoundedÂ¶
Rounding occurred though possibly no information was lost.
Signaled whenever rounding discards digits; even if those digits are zero
(such as rounding 5.00 to 5.0).  If not trapped, returns
the result unchanged.  This signal is used to detect loss of significant
digits.
