class http.cookiejar.DefaultCookiePolicy(blocked_domains=None, allowed_domains=None, netscape=True, rfc2965=False, rfc2109_as_netscape=None, hide_cookie2=False, strict_domain=False, strict_rfc2965_unverifiable=True, strict_ns_unverifiable=False, strict_ns_domain=DefaultCookiePolicy.DomainLiberal, strict_ns_set_initial_dollar=False, strict_ns_set_path=False)¶
Constructor arguments should be passed as keyword arguments only.
blocked_domains is a sequence of domain names that we never accept cookies
from, nor return cookies to. allowed_domains if not None, this is a
sequence of the only domains for which we accept and return cookies.  For all
other arguments, see the documentation for CookiePolicy and
DefaultCookiePolicy objects.
DefaultCookiePolicy implements the standard accept / reject rules for
Netscape and RFC 2965 cookies.  By default, RFC 2109 cookies (ie. cookies
received in a Set-Cookie header with a version cookie-attribute of
1) are treated according to the RFC 2965 rules.  However, if RFC 2965 handling
is turned off or rfc2109_as_netscape is True, RFC 2109 cookies are
‘downgraded’ by the CookieJar instance to Netscape cookies, by
setting the version attribute of the Cookie instance to 0.
DefaultCookiePolicy also provides some parameters to allow some
fine-tuning of policy.
