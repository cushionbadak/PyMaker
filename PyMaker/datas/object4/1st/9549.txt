site.USER_SITE¶
Path to the user site-packages for the running Python.  Can be None if
getusersitepackages() hasn’t been called yet.  Default value is
~/.local/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages for UNIX and non-framework Mac
OS X builds, ~/Library/Python/X.Y/lib/python/site-packages for Mac
framework builds, and %APPDATA%\Python\PythonXY\site-packages
on Windows.  This directory is a site directory, which means that
.pth files in it will be processed.
