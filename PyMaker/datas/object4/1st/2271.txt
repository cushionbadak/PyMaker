shutil.copy2(src, dst, *, follow_symlinks=True)Â¶
Identical to copy() except that copy2()
also attempts to preserve file metadata.
When follow_symlinks is false, and src is a symbolic
link, copy2() attempts to copy all metadata from the
src symbolic link to the newly-created dst symbolic link.
However, this functionality is not available on all platforms.
On platforms where some or all of this functionality is
unavailable, copy2() will preserve all the metadata
it can; copy2() never returns failure.
copy2() uses copystat() to copy the file metadata.
Please see copystat() for more information
about platform support for modifying symbolic link metadata.

Changed in version 3.3: Added follow_symlinks argument, try to copy extended
file system attributes too (currently Linux only).
Now returns path to the newly created file.
