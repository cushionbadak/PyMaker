SSLSocket.shared_ciphers()Â¶
Return the list of ciphers shared by the client during the handshake.  Each
entry of the returned list is a three-value tuple containing the name of the
cipher, the version of the SSL protocol that defines its use, and the number
of secret bits the cipher uses.  shared_ciphers() returns
None if no connection has been established or the socket is a client
socket.

New in version 3.5.
