imaplib.Time2Internaldate(date_time)Â¶
Convert date_time to an IMAP4 INTERNALDATE representation.
The return value is a string in the form: "DD-Mmm-YYYY HH:MM:SS
+HHMM" (including double-quotes).  The date_time argument can
be a number (int or float) representing seconds since epoch (as
returned by time.time()), a 9-tuple representing local time
an instance of time.struct_time (as returned by
time.localtime()), an aware instance of
datetime.datetime, or a double-quoted string.  In the last
case, it is assumed to already be in the correct format.
