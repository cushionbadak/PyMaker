Readline configurationÂ¶
On systems that support readline, this module will also import and
configure the rlcompleter module, if Python is started in
interactive mode and without the -S option.
The default behavior is enable tab-completion and to use
~/.python_history as the history save file.  To disable it, delete (or
override) the sys.__interactivehook__ attribute in your
sitecustomize or usercustomize module or your
PYTHONSTARTUP file.

Changed in version 3.4: Activation of rlcompleter and history was made automatic.
