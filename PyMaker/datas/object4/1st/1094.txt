date.isocalendar()Â¶
Return a 3-tuple, (ISO year, ISO week number, ISO weekday).
The ISO calendar is a widely used variant of the Gregorian calendar. See
https://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~gent0113/calendar/isocalendar.htm for a good
explanation.
The ISO year consists of 52 or 53 full weeks, and where a week starts on a
Monday and ends on a Sunday.  The first week of an ISO year is the first
(Gregorian) calendar week of a year containing a Thursday. This is called week
number 1, and the ISO year of that Thursday is the same as its Gregorian year.
For example, 2004 begins on a Thursday, so the first week of ISO year 2004
begins on Monday, 29 Dec 2003 and ends on Sunday, 4 Jan 2004, so that
date(2003, 12, 29).isocalendar() == (2004, 1, 1) and date(2004, 1,
4).isocalendar() == (2004, 1, 7).
