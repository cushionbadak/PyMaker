HTTPErrorProcessor Objects¶


HTTPErrorProcessor.http_response(request, response)¶
Process HTTP error responses.
For 200 error codes, the response object is returned immediately.
For non-200 error codes, this simply passes the job on to the
http_error_<type>() handler methods, via OpenerDirector.error().
Eventually, HTTPDefaultErrorHandler will raise an
HTTPError if no other handler handles the error.



HTTPErrorProcessor.https_response(request, response)¶
Process HTTPS error responses.
The behavior is same as http_response().
