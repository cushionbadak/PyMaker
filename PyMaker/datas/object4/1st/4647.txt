coroutine asyncio.open_connection(host=None, port=None, *, loop=None, limit=None, ssl=None, family=0, proto=0, flags=0, sock=None, local_addr=None, server_hostname=None, ssl_handshake_timeout=None)Â¶
Establish a network connection and return a pair of
(reader, writer) objects.
The returned reader and writer objects are instances of
StreamReader and StreamWriter classes.
The loop argument is optional and can always be determined
automatically when this function is awaited from a coroutine.
limit determines the buffer size limit used by the
returned StreamReader instance.  By default the limit
is set to 64 KiB.
The rest of the arguments are passed directly to
loop.create_connection().

New in version 3.7: The ssl_handshake_timeout parameter.
