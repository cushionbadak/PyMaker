@importlib.util.set_packageÂ¶
A decorator for importlib.abc.Loader.load_module() to set the
__package__ attribute on the returned module. If __package__
is set and has a value other than None it will not be changed.

Deprecated since version 3.4: The import machinery takes care of this automatically.
