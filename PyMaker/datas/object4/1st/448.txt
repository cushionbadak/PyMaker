str.rpartition(sep)Â¶
Split the string at the last occurrence of sep, and return a 3-tuple
containing the part before the separator, the separator itself, and the part
after the separator.  If the separator is not found, return a 3-tuple containing
two empty strings, followed by the string itself.
