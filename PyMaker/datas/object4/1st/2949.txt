os.unsetenv(key)¶
Unset (delete) the environment variable named key. Such changes to the
environment affect subprocesses started with os.system(), popen() or
fork() and execv().
When unsetenv() is supported, deletion of items in os.environ is
automatically translated into a corresponding call to unsetenv(); however,
calls to unsetenv() don’t update os.environ, so it is actually
preferable to delete items of os.environ.
