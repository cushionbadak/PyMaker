<dd><p>Release a lock, decrementing the recursion level.  If after the decrement it is
zero, reset the lock to unlocked (not owned by any thread), and if any other
threads are blocked waiting for the lock to become unlocked, allow exactly one
of them to proceed.  If after the decrement the recursion level is still
nonzero, the lock remains locked and owned by the calling thread.</p>
<p>Only call this method when the calling thread owns the lock. A
<a class="reference internal" href="exceptions.html#RuntimeError" title="RuntimeError"><code class="xref py py-exc docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">RuntimeError</span></code></a> is raised if this method is called when the lock is
unlocked.</p>
<p>There is no return value.</p>
