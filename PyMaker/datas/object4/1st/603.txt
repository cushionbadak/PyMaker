contextmanager.__enter__()Â¶
Enter the runtime context and return either this object or another object
related to the runtime context. The value returned by this method is bound to
the identifier in the as clause of with statements using
this context manager.
An example of a context manager that returns itself is a file object.
File objects return themselves from __enter__() to allow open() to be
used as the context expression in a with statement.
An example of a context manager that returns a related object is the one
returned by decimal.localcontext(). These managers set the active
decimal context to a copy of the original decimal context and then return the
copy. This allows changes to be made to the current decimal context in the body
of the with statement without affecting code outside the
with statement.
