str.zfill(width)Â¶
Return a copy of the string left filled with ASCII '0' digits to
make a string of length width. A leading sign prefix ('+'/'-')
is handled by inserting the padding after the sign character rather
than before. The original string is returned if width is less than
or equal to len(s).
For example:
>>> "42".zfill(5)
'00042'
>>> "-42".zfill(5)
'-0042'
