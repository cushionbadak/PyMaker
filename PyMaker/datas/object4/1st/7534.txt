audioop.ratecv(fragment, width, nchannels, inrate, outrate, state[, weightA[, weightB]])Â¶
Convert the frame rate of the input fragment.
state is a tuple containing the state of the converter.  The converter returns
a tuple (newfragment, newstate), and newstate should be passed to the next
call of ratecv().  The initial call should pass None as the state.
The weightA and weightB arguments are parameters for a simple digital filter
and default to 1 and 0 respectively.
