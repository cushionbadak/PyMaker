bytes.index(sub[, start[, end]])¶

bytearray.index(sub[, start[, end]])¶
Like find(), but raise ValueError when the
subsequence is not found.
The subsequence to search for may be any bytes-like object or an
integer in the range 0 to 255.

Changed in version 3.3: Also accept an integer in the range 0 to 255 as the subsequence.
