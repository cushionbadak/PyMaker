Dumping the traceback on a user signal¶


faulthandler.register(signum, file=sys.stderr, all_threads=True, chain=False)¶
Register a user signal: install a handler for the signum signal to dump
the traceback of all threads, or of the current thread if all_threads is
False, into file. Call the previous handler if chain is True.
The file must be kept open until the signal is unregistered by
unregister(): see issue with file descriptors.
Not available on Windows.

Changed in version 3.5: Added support for passing file descriptor to this function.




faulthandler.unregister(signum)¶
Unregister a user signal: uninstall the handler of the signum signal
installed by register(). Return True if the signal was registered,
False otherwise.
Not available on Windows.
