QName Objects¶


class xml.etree.ElementTree.QName(text_or_uri, tag=None)¶
QName wrapper.  This can be used to wrap a QName attribute value, in order
to get proper namespace handling on output.  text_or_uri is a string
containing the QName value, in the form {uri}local, or, if the tag argument
is given, the URI part of a QName.  If tag is given, the first argument is
interpreted as a URI, and this argument is interpreted as a local name.
QName instances are opaque.
