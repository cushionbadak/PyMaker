readline.set_completer([function])¶
Set or remove the completer function.  If function is specified, it will be
used as the new completer function; if omitted or None, any completer
function already installed is removed.  The completer function is called as
function(text, state), for state in 0, 1, 2, …, until it
returns a non-string value.  It should return the next possible completion
starting with text.
The installed completer function is invoked by the entry_func callback
passed to rl_completion_matches() in the underlying library.
The text string comes from the first parameter to the
rl_attempted_completion_function callback of the
underlying library.
