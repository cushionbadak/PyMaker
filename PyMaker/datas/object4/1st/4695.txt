coroutine wait()Â¶
Wait until notified.
If the calling task has not acquired the lock when this method is
called, a RuntimeError is raised.
This method releases the underlying lock, and then blocks until
it is awakened by a notify() or notify_all() call.
Once awakened, the Condition re-acquires its lock and this method
returns True.
