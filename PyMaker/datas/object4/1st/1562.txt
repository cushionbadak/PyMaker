math.pow(x, y)¶
Return x raised to the power y.  Exceptional cases follow
Annex ‘F’ of the C99 standard as far as possible.  In particular,
pow(1.0, x) and pow(x, 0.0) always return 1.0, even
when x is a zero or a NaN.  If both x and y are finite,
x is negative, and y is not an integer then pow(x, y)
is undefined, and raises ValueError.
Unlike the built-in ** operator, math.pow() converts both
its arguments to type float.  Use ** or the built-in
pow() function for computing exact integer powers.
