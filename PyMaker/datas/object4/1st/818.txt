Raw String NotationÂ¶
Raw string notation (r"text") keeps regular expressions sane.  Without it,
every backslash ('\') in a regular expression would have to be prefixed with
another one to escape it.  For example, the two following lines of code are
functionally identical:
>>> re.match(r"\W(.)\1\W", " ff ")
<re.Match object; span=(0, 4), match=' ff '>
>>> re.match("\\W(.)\\1\\W", " ff ")
<re.Match object; span=(0, 4), match=' ff '>


When one wants to match a literal backslash, it must be escaped in the regular
expression.  With raw string notation, this means r"\\".  Without raw string
notation, one must use "\\\\", making the following lines of code
functionally identical:
>>> re.match(r"\\", r"\\")
<re.Match object; span=(0, 1), match='\\'>
>>> re.match("\\\\", r"\\")
<re.Match object; span=(0, 1), match='\\'>
