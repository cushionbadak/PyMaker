FTP.mlsd(path="", facts=[])¶
List a directory in a standardized format by using MLSD command
(RFC 3659).  If path is omitted the current directory is assumed.
facts is a list of strings representing the type of information desired
(e.g. ["type", "size", "perm"]).  Return a generator object yielding a
tuple of two elements for every file found in path.  First element is the
file name, the second one is a dictionary containing facts about the file
name.  Content of this dictionary might be limited by the facts argument
but server is not guaranteed to return all requested facts.

New in version 3.3.
