turtle.fillcolor(*args)Â¶
Return or set the fillcolor.
Four input formats are allowed:

fillcolor()
Return the current fillcolor as color specification string, possibly
in tuple format (see example).  May be used as input to another
color/pencolor/fillcolor call.
fillcolor(colorstring)
Set fillcolor to colorstring, which is a Tk color specification string,
such as "red", "yellow", or "#33cc8c".
fillcolor((r, g, b))
Set fillcolor to the RGB color represented by the tuple of r, g, and
b.  Each of r, g, and b must be in the range 0..colormode, where
colormode is either 1.0 or 255 (see colormode()).
fillcolor(r, g, b)

Set fillcolor to the RGB color represented by r, g, and b.  Each of
r, g, and b must be in the range 0..colormode.
If turtleshape is a polygon, the interior of that polygon is drawn
with the newly set fillcolor.
