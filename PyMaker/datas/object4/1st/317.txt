divmod(a, b)Â¶
Take two (non complex) numbers as arguments and return a pair of numbers
consisting of their quotient and remainder when using integer division.  With
mixed operand types, the rules for binary arithmetic operators apply.  For
integers, the result is the same as (a // b, a % b). For floating point
numbers the result is (q, a % b), where q is usually math.floor(a /
b) but may be 1 less than that.  In any case q * b + a % b is very
close to a, if a % b is non-zero it has the same sign as b, and 0
<= abs(a % b) < abs(b).
