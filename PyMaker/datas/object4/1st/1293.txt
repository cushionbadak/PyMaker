class collections.abc.IterableÂ¶
ABC for classes that provide the __iter__() method.
Checking isinstance(obj, Iterable) detects classes that are registered
as Iterable or that have an __iter__() method, but it does
not detect classes that iterate with the __getitem__() method.
The only reliable way to determine whether an object is iterable
is to call iter(obj).
