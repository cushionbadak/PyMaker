Cmd.use_rawinputÂ¶
A flag, defaulting to true.  If true, cmdloop() uses input() to
display a prompt and read the next command; if false, sys.stdout.write()
and sys.stdin.readline() are used. (This means that by importing
readline, on systems that support it, the interpreter will automatically
support Emacs-like line editing  and command-history keystrokes.)
