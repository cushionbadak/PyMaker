TarFile.gettarinfo(name=None, arcname=None, fileobj=None)¶
Create a TarInfo object from the result of os.stat() or
equivalent on an existing file.  The file is either named by name, or
specified as a file object fileobj with a file descriptor.
name may be a path-like object.  If
given, arcname specifies an alternative name for the file in the
archive, otherwise, the name is taken from fileobj’s
name attribute, or the name argument.  The name
should be a text string.
You can modify
some of the TarInfo’s attributes before you add it using addfile().
If the file object is not an ordinary file object positioned at the
beginning of the file, attributes such as size may need
modifying.  This is the case for objects such as GzipFile.
The name may also be modified, in which case arcname
could be a dummy string.

Changed in version 3.6: The name parameter accepts a path-like object.
