email.contentmanager.get_content(msg, errors='replace')Â¶
Return the payload of the part as either a string (for text parts), an
EmailMessage object (for message/rfc822
parts), or a bytes object (for all other non-multipart types).  Raise
a KeyError if called on a multipart.  If the part is a
text part and errors is specified, use it as the error handler when
decoding the payload to unicode.  The default error handler is
replace.
