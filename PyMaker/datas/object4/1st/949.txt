Completer Objects¶
Completer objects have the following method:


Completer.complete(text, state)¶
Return the stateth completion for text.
If called for text that doesn’t include a period character ('.'), it will
complete from names currently defined in __main__, builtins and
keywords (as defined by the keyword module).
If called for a dotted name, it will try to evaluate anything without obvious
side-effects (functions will not be evaluated, but it can generate calls to
__getattr__()) up to the last part, and find matches for the rest via the
dir() function.  Any exception raised during the evaluation of the
expression is caught, silenced and None is returned.
