os.GRND_NONBLOCKÂ¶
By  default, when reading from /dev/random, getrandom() blocks if
no random bytes are available, and when reading from /dev/urandom, it blocks
if the entropy pool has not yet been initialized.
If the GRND_NONBLOCK flag is set, then getrandom() does not
block in these cases, but instead immediately raises BlockingIOError.

New in version 3.6.
