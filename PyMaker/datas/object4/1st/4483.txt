class subprocess.STARTUPINFO(*, dwFlags=0, hStdInput=None, hStdOutput=None, hStdError=None, wShowWindow=0, lpAttributeList=None)¶
Partial support of the Windows
STARTUPINFO
structure is used for Popen creation.  The following attributes can
be set by passing them as keyword-only arguments.

Changed in version 3.7: Keyword-only argument support was added.



dwFlags¶
A bit field that determines whether certain STARTUPINFO
attributes are used when the process creates a window.
si = subprocess.STARTUPINFO()
si.dwFlags = subprocess.STARTF_USESTDHANDLES | subprocess.STARTF_USESHOWWINDOW





hStdInput¶
If dwFlags specifies STARTF_USESTDHANDLES, this attribute
is the standard input handle for the process. If
STARTF_USESTDHANDLES is not specified, the default for standard
input is the keyboard buffer.



hStdOutput¶
If dwFlags specifies STARTF_USESTDHANDLES, this attribute
is the standard output handle for the process. Otherwise, this attribute
is ignored and the default for standard output is the console window’s
buffer.



hStdError¶
If dwFlags specifies STARTF_USESTDHANDLES, this attribute
is the standard error handle for the process. Otherwise, this attribute is
ignored and the default for standard error is the console window’s buffer.



wShowWindow¶
If dwFlags specifies STARTF_USESHOWWINDOW, this attribute
can be any of the values that can be specified in the nCmdShow
parameter for the
ShowWindow
function, except for SW_SHOWDEFAULT. Otherwise, this attribute is
ignored.
SW_HIDE is provided for this attribute. It is used when
Popen is called with shell=True.



lpAttributeList¶
A dictionary of additional attributes for process creation as given in
STARTUPINFOEX, see
UpdateProcThreadAttribute.
Supported attributes:

handle_list
Sequence of handles that will be inherited. close_fds must be true if
non-empty.
The handles must be temporarily made inheritable by
os.set_handle_inheritable() when passed to the Popen
constructor, else OSError will be raised with Windows error
ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER (87).

Warning
In a multithreaded process, use caution to avoid leaking handles
that are marked inheritable when combining this feature with
concurrent calls to other process creation functions that inherit
all handles such as os.system().  This also applies to
standard handle redirection, which temporarily creates inheritable
handles.




New in version 3.7.
