DocXMLRPCServer Objects¶
The DocXMLRPCServer class is derived from SimpleXMLRPCServer
and provides a means of creating self-documenting, stand alone XML-RPC
servers. HTTP POST requests are handled as XML-RPC method calls. HTTP GET
requests are handled by generating pydoc-style HTML documentation. This allows a
server to provide its own web-based documentation.


DocXMLRPCServer.set_server_title(server_title)¶
Set the title used in the generated HTML documentation. This title will be used
inside the HTML “title” element.



DocXMLRPCServer.set_server_name(server_name)¶
Set the name used in the generated HTML documentation. This name will appear at
the top of the generated documentation inside a “h1” element.



DocXMLRPCServer.set_server_documentation(server_documentation)¶
Set the description used in the generated HTML documentation. This description
will appear as a paragraph, below the server name, in the documentation.
