os.rename(src, dst, *, src_dir_fd=None, dst_dir_fd=None)Â¶
Rename the file or directory src to dst.  If dst is a directory,
OSError will be raised.  On Unix, if dst exists and is a file, it will
be replaced silently if the user has permission.  The operation may fail on some
Unix flavors if src and dst are on different filesystems.  If successful,
the renaming will be an atomic operation (this is a POSIX requirement).  On
Windows, if dst already exists, OSError will be raised even if it is a
file.
This function can support specifying src_dir_fd and/or dst_dir_fd to
supply paths relative to directory descriptors.
If you want cross-platform overwriting of the destination, use replace().

New in version 3.3: The src_dir_fd and dst_dir_fd arguments.


Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a path-like object for src and dst.
