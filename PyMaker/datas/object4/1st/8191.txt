class tkinter.tix.TListÂ¶
The TList widget
can be used to display data in a tabular format. The list entries of a
TList widget are similar to the entries in the Tk listbox widget.  The
main differences are (1) the TList widget can display the list entries
in a two dimensional format and (2) you can use graphical images as well as
multiple colors and fonts for the list entries.
