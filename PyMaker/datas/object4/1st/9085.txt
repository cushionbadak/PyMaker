tracemalloc.take_snapshot()Â¶
Take a snapshot of traces of memory blocks allocated by Python. Return a new
Snapshot instance.
The snapshot does not include memory blocks allocated before the
tracemalloc module started to trace memory allocations.
Tracebacks of traces are limited to get_traceback_limit() frames. Use
the nframe parameter of the start() function to store more frames.
The tracemalloc module must be tracing memory allocations to take a
snapshot, see the start() function.
See also the get_object_traceback() function.
