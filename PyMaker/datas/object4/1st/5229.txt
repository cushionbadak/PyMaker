SSLSocket.write(buf)Â¶
Write buf to the SSL socket and return the number of bytes written. The
buf argument must be an object supporting the buffer interface.
Raise SSLWantReadError or SSLWantWriteError if the socket is
non-blocking and the write would block.
As at any time a re-negotiation is possible, a call to write() can
also cause read operations.

Changed in version 3.5: The socket timeout is no more reset each time bytes are received or sent.
The socket timeout is now to maximum total duration to write buf.


Deprecated since version 3.6: Use send() instead of write().
