class array.array(typecode[, initializer])¶
A new array whose items are restricted by typecode, and initialized
from the optional initializer value, which must be a list, a
bytes-like object, or iterable over elements of the
appropriate type.
If given a list or string, the initializer is passed to the new array’s
fromlist(), frombytes(), or fromunicode() method (see below)
to add initial items to the array.  Otherwise, the iterable initializer is
passed to the extend() method.
