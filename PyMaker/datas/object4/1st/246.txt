6.9. Binary bitwise operationsÂ¶
Each of the three bitwise operations has a different priority level:

and_expr ::=  shift_expr | and_expr "&" shift_expr
xor_expr ::=  and_expr | xor_expr "^" and_expr
or_expr  ::=  xor_expr | or_expr "|" xor_expr

The & operator yields the bitwise AND of its arguments, which must be
integers.
The ^ operator yields the bitwise XOR (exclusive OR) of its arguments, which
must be integers.
The | operator yields the bitwise (inclusive) OR of its arguments, which
must be integers.
