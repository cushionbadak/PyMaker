Line buffer¶
The following functions operate on the line buffer:


readline.get_line_buffer()¶
Return the current contents of the line buffer (rl_line_buffer
in the underlying library).



readline.insert_text(string)¶
Insert text into the line buffer at the cursor position.  This calls
rl_insert_text() in the underlying library, but ignores
the return value.



readline.redisplay()¶
Change what’s displayed on the screen to reflect the current contents of the
line buffer.  This calls rl_redisplay() in the underlying library.
