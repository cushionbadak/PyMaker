contextvars.copy_context()Â¶
Returns a copy of the current Context object.
The following snippet gets a copy of the current context and prints
all variables and their values that are set in it:
ctx: Context = copy_context()
print(list(ctx.items()))


The function has an O(1) complexity, i.e. works equally fast for
contexts with a few context variables and for contexts that have
a lot of them.
