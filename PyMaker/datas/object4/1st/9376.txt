atexit.unregister(func)Â¶
Remove func from the list of functions to be run at interpreter
shutdown.  After calling unregister(), func is guaranteed not to be
called when the interpreter shuts down, even if it was registered more than
once.  unregister() silently does nothing if func was not previously
registered.
