ipaddress.ip_address(address)Â¶
Return an IPv4Address or IPv6Address object depending on
the IP address passed as argument.  Either IPv4 or IPv6 addresses may be
supplied; integers less than 2**32 will be considered to be IPv4 by default.
A ValueError is raised if address does not represent a valid IPv4
or IPv6 address.
>>> ipaddress.ip_address('192.168.0.1')
IPv4Address('192.168.0.1')
>>> ipaddress.ip_address('2001:db8::')
IPv6Address('2001:db8::')
