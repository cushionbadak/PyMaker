Unpacker.unpack_list(unpack_item)Â¶
Unpacks and returns a list of homogeneous items.  The list is unpacked one
element at a time by first unpacking an unsigned integer flag.  If the flag is
1, then the item is unpacked and appended to the list.  A flag of 0
indicates the end of the list.  unpack_item is the function that is called to
unpack the items.
