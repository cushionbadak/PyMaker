How do I test a Python program or component?¶
Python comes with two testing frameworks.  The doctest module finds
examples in the docstrings for a module and runs them, comparing the output with
the expected output given in the docstring.
The unittest module is a fancier testing framework modelled on Java and
Smalltalk testing frameworks.
To make testing easier, you should use good modular design in your program.
Your program should have almost all functionality
encapsulated in either functions or class methods – and this sometimes has the
surprising and delightful effect of making the program run faster (because local
variable accesses are faster than global accesses).  Furthermore the program
should avoid depending on mutating global variables, since this makes testing
much more difficult to do.
The “global main logic” of your program may be as simple as
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main_logic()


at the bottom of the main module of your program.
Once your program is organized as a tractable collection of functions and class
behaviours you should write test functions that exercise the behaviours.  A test
suite that automates a sequence of tests can be associated with each module.
This sounds like a lot of work, but since Python is so terse and flexible it’s
surprisingly easy.  You can make coding much more pleasant and fun by writing
your test functions in parallel with the “production code”, since this makes it
easy to find bugs and even design flaws earlier.
“Support modules” that are not intended to be the main module of a program may
include a self-test of the module.
if __name__ == "__main__":
    self_test()


Even programs that interact with complex external interfaces may be tested when
the external interfaces are unavailable by using “fake” interfaces implemented
in Python.
