classmethod datetime.combine(date, time, tzinfo=self.tzinfo)¶
Return a new datetime object whose date components are equal to the
given date object’s, and whose time components
are equal to the given time object’s.  If the tzinfo
argument is provided, its value is used to set the tzinfo attribute
of the result, otherwise the tzinfo attribute of the time argument
is used.
For any datetime object d,
d == datetime.combine(d.date(), d.time(), d.tzinfo).  If date is a
datetime object, its time components and tzinfo attributes
are ignored.

Changed in version 3.6: Added the tzinfo argument.
