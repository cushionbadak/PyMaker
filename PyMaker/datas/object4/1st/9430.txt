gc.get_stats()Â¶
Return a list of three per-generation dictionaries containing collection
statistics since interpreter start.  The number of keys may change
in the future, but currently each dictionary will contain the following
items:

collections is the number of times this generation was collected;
collected is the total number of objects collected inside this
generation;
uncollectable is the total number of objects which were found
to be uncollectable (and were therefore moved to the garbage
list) inside this generation.


New in version 3.4.
