docs:


turtle.onclick(fun, btn=1, add=None)¶




Parameters:
fun – a function with two arguments which will be called with the
coordinates of the clicked point on the canvas
btn – number of the mouse-button, defaults to 1 (left mouse button)
add – True or False – if True, a new binding will be
added, otherwise it will replace a former binding





Bind fun to mouse-click events on this turtle.  If fun is None,
existing bindings are removed.  Example for the anonymous turtle, i.e. the
procedural way:
>>> def turn(x, y):
...     left(180)
...
>>> onclick(turn)  # Now clicking into the turtle will turn it.
>>> onclick(None)  # event-binding will be removed
