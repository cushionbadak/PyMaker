typing.CallableÂ¶
Callable type; Callable[[int], str] is a function of (int) -> str.
The subscription syntax must always be used with exactly two
values: the argument list and the return type.  The argument list
must be a list of types or an ellipsis; the return type must be
a single type.
There is no syntax to indicate optional or keyword arguments;
such function types are rarely used as callback types.
Callable[..., ReturnType] (literal ellipsis) can be used to
type hint a callable taking any number of arguments and returning
ReturnType.  A plain Callable is equivalent to
Callable[..., Any], and in turn to
collections.abc.Callable.
