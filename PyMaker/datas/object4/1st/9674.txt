path_stats(path)Â¶
Optional abstract method which returns a dict containing
metadata about the specified path.  Supported dictionary keys are:

'mtime' (mandatory): an integer or floating-point number
representing the modification time of the source code;
'size' (optional): the size in bytes of the source code.

Any other keys in the dictionary are ignored, to allow for future
extensions. If the path cannot be handled, OSError is raised.

New in version 3.3.


Changed in version 3.4: Raise OSError instead of NotImplementedError.
