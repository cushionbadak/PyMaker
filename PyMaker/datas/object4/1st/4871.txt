docs:


add_done_callback(callback, *, context=None)¶
Add a callback to be run when the Future is done.
The callback is called with the Future object as its only
argument.
If the Future is already done when this method is called,
the callback is scheduled with loop.call_soon().
An optional keyword-only context argument allows specifying a
custom contextvars.Context for the callback to run in.
The current context is used when no context is provided.
functools.partial() can be used to pass parameters
to the callback, e.g.:
# Call 'print("Future:", fut)' when "fut" is done.
fut.add_done_callback(
    functools.partial(print, "Future:"))



Changed in version 3.7: The context keyword-only parameter was added.
See PEP 567 for more details.
