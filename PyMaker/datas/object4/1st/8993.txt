docs:


profile.runctx(command, globals, locals, filename=None, sort=-1)Â¶
This function is similar to run(), with added arguments to supply the
globals and locals dictionaries for the command string. This routine
executes:
exec(command, globals, locals)


and gathers profiling statistics as in the run() function above.
