pdb.run(statement, globals=None, locals=None)Â¶
Execute the statement (given as a string or a code object) under debugger
control.  The debugger prompt appears before any code is executed; you can
set breakpoints and type continue, or you can step through the
statement using step or next (all these commands are
explained below).  The optional globals and locals arguments specify the
environment in which the code is executed; by default the dictionary of the
module __main__ is used.  (See the explanation of the built-in
exec() or eval() functions.)
