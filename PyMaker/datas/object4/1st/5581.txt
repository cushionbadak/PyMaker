<dd><p>The email package calls this method with the <em>name</em> and <em>value</em> currently
stored in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Message</span></code> when that header is requested by the
application program, and whatever the method returns is what is passed
back to the application as the value of the header being retrieved.
Note that there may be more than one header with the same name stored in
the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Message</span></code>; the method is passed the specific name and value of the
header destined to be returned to the application.</p>
<p><em>value</em> may contain surrogateescaped binary data.  There should be no
surrogateescaped binary data in the value returned by the method.</p>
<p>There is no default implementation</p>
