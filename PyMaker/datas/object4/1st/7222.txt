BaseCookie.value_encode(val)¶
Return a tuple (real_value, coded_value). val can be any type, but
coded_value will always be converted to a string.
This method does no encoding in BaseCookie — it exists so it can
be overridden.
In general, it should be the case that value_encode() and
value_decode() are inverses on the range of value_decode.
