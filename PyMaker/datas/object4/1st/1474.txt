Module Contents¶
This module defines four enumeration classes that can be used to define unique
sets of names and values: Enum, IntEnum, Flag, and
IntFlag.  It also defines one decorator, unique(), and one
helper, auto.


class enum.Enum¶
Base class for creating enumerated constants.  See section
Functional API for an alternate construction syntax.



class enum.IntEnum¶
Base class for creating enumerated constants that are also
subclasses of int.



class enum.IntFlag¶
Base class for creating enumerated constants that can be combined using
the bitwise operators without losing their IntFlag membership.
IntFlag members are also subclasses of int.



class enum.Flag¶
Base class for creating enumerated constants that can be combined using
the bitwise operations without losing their Flag membership.



enum.unique()¶
Enum class decorator that ensures only one name is bound to any one value.



class enum.auto¶
Instances are replaced with an appropriate value for Enum members.


New in version 3.6: Flag, IntFlag, auto
