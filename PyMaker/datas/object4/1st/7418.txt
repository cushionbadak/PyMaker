Operators¶
Address objects support some operators.  Unless stated otherwise, operators can
only be applied between compatible objects (i.e. IPv4 with IPv4, IPv6 with
IPv6).

Comparison operators¶
Address objects can be compared with the usual set of comparison operators.  Some
examples:
>>> IPv4Address('127.0.0.2') > IPv4Address('127.0.0.1')
True
>>> IPv4Address('127.0.0.2') == IPv4Address('127.0.0.1')
False
>>> IPv4Address('127.0.0.2') != IPv4Address('127.0.0.1')
True




Arithmetic operators¶
Integers can be added to or subtracted from address objects.  Some examples:
>>> IPv4Address('127.0.0.2') + 3
IPv4Address('127.0.0.5')
>>> IPv4Address('127.0.0.2') - 3
IPv4Address('126.255.255.255')
>>> IPv4Address('255.255.255.255') + 1
