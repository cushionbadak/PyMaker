<dd><p>This is a flexible class for comparing pairs of sequences of any type, so long
as the sequence elements are <a class="reference internal" href="../glossary.html#term-hashable"><span class="xref std std-term">hashable</span></a>.  The basic algorithm predates, and is a
little fancier than, an algorithm published in the late 1980’s by Ratcliff and
Obershelp under the hyperbolic name “gestalt pattern matching.”  The idea is to
find the longest contiguous matching subsequence that contains no “junk”
elements; these “junk” elements are ones that are uninteresting in some
sense, such as blank lines or whitespace.  (Handling junk is an
extension to the Ratcliff and Obershelp algorithm.) The same
idea is then applied recursively to the pieces of the sequences to the left and
to the right of the matching subsequence.  This does not yield minimal edit
sequences, but does tend to yield matches that “look right” to people.</p>
<p><strong>Timing:</strong> The basic Ratcliff-Obershelp algorithm is cubic time in the worst
case and quadratic time in the expected case. <a class="reference internal" href="#difflib.SequenceMatcher" title="difflib.SequenceMatcher"><code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SequenceMatcher</span></code></a> is
quadratic time for the worst case and has expected-case behavior dependent in a
complicated way on how many elements the sequences have in common; best case
time is linear.</p>
<p><strong>Automatic junk heuristic:</strong> <a class="reference internal" href="#difflib.SequenceMatcher" title="difflib.SequenceMatcher"><code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SequenceMatcher</span></code></a> supports a heuristic that
automatically treats certain sequence items as junk. The heuristic counts how many
times each individual item appears in the sequence. If an item’s duplicates (after
the first one) account for more than 1% of the sequence and the sequence is at least
200 items long, this item is marked as “popular” and is treated as junk for
the purpose of sequence matching. This heuristic can be turned off by setting
the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">autojunk</span></code> argument to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">False</span></code> when creating the <a class="reference internal" href="#difflib.SequenceMatcher" title="difflib.SequenceMatcher"><code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SequenceMatcher</span></code></a>.</p>
