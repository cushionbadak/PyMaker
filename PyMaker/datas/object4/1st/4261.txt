sentinel¶
A numeric handle of a system object which will become “ready” when
the process ends.
You can use this value if you want to wait on several events at
once using multiprocessing.connection.wait().  Otherwise
calling join() is simpler.
On Windows, this is an OS handle usable with the WaitForSingleObject
and WaitForMultipleObjects family of API calls.  On Unix, this is
a file descriptor usable with primitives from the select module.

New in version 3.3.
