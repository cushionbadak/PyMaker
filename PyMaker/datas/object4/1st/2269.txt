shutil.copystat(src, dst, *, follow_symlinks=True)¶
Copy the permission bits, last access time, last modification time, and
flags from src to dst.  On Linux, copystat() also copies the
“extended attributes” where possible.  The file contents, owner, and
group are unaffected.  src and dst are path names given as strings.
If follow_symlinks is false, and src and dst both
refer to symbolic links, copystat() will operate on
the symbolic links themselves rather than the files the
symbolic links refer to—reading the information from the
src symbolic link, and writing the information to the
dst symbolic link.

Note
Not all platforms provide the ability to examine and
modify symbolic links.  Python itself can tell you what
functionality is locally available.

If os.chmod in os.supports_follow_symlinks is
True, copystat() can modify the permission
bits of a symbolic link.
If os.utime in os.supports_follow_symlinks is
True, copystat() can modify the last access
and modification times of a symbolic link.
If os.chflags in os.supports_follow_symlinks is
True, copystat() can modify the flags of
a symbolic link.  (os.chflags is not available on
all platforms.)

On platforms where some or all of this functionality
is unavailable, when asked to modify a symbolic link,
copystat() will copy everything it can.
copystat() never returns failure.
Please see os.supports_follow_symlinks
for more information.


Changed in version 3.3: Added follow_symlinks argument and support for Linux extended attributes.
