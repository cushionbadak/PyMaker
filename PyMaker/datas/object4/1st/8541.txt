addExpectedFailure(test, err)¶
Called when the test case test fails, but was marked with the
expectedFailure() decorator.
The default implementation appends a tuple (test, formatted_err) to
the instance’s expectedFailures attribute, where formatted_err
is a formatted traceback derived from err.
