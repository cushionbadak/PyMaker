class telnetlib.Telnet(host=None, port=0[, timeout])Â¶
Telnet represents a connection to a Telnet server. The instance is
initially not connected by default; the open() method must be used to
establish a connection.  Alternatively, the host name and optional port
number can be passed to the constructor too, in which case the connection to
the server will be established before the constructor returns.  The optional
timeout parameter specifies a timeout in seconds for blocking operations
like the connection attempt (if not specified, the global default timeout
setting will be used).
Do not reopen an already connected instance.
This class has many read_*() methods.  Note that some of them  raise
EOFError when the end of the connection is read, because they can return
an empty string for other reasons.  See the individual descriptions below.
A Telnet object is a context manager and can be used in a
with statement.  When the with block ends, the
close() method is called:
>>> from telnetlib import Telnet
>>> with Telnet('localhost', 23) as tn:
...     tn.interact()
...



Changed in version 3.6: Context manager support added
