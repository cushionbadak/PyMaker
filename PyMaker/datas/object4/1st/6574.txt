class wsgiref.simple_server.WSGIRequestHandler(request, client_address, server)¶
Create an HTTP handler for the given request (i.e. a socket), client_address
(a (host,port) tuple), and server (WSGIServer instance).
You do not need to create instances of this class directly; they are
automatically created as needed by WSGIServer objects.  You can,
however, subclass this class and supply it as a handler_class to the
make_server() function.  Some possibly relevant methods for overriding in
subclasses:


get_environ()¶
Returns a dictionary containing the WSGI environment for a request.  The default
implementation copies the contents of the WSGIServer object’s
base_environ dictionary attribute and then adds various headers derived
from the HTTP request.  Each call to this method should return a new dictionary
containing all of the relevant CGI environment variables as specified in
PEP 3333.



get_stderr()¶
Return the object that should be used as the wsgi.errors stream. The default
implementation just returns sys.stderr.



handle()¶
Process the HTTP request.  The default implementation creates a handler instance
using a wsgiref.handlers class to implement the actual WSGI application
interface.
