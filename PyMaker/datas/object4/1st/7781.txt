locale.format_string(format, val, grouping=False, monetary=False)Â¶
Formats a number val according to the current LC_NUMERIC setting.
The format follows the conventions of the % operator.  For floating point
values, the decimal point is modified if appropriate.  If grouping is true,
also takes the grouping into account.
If monetary is true, the conversion uses monetary thousands separator and
grouping strings.
Processes formatting specifiers as in format % val, but takes the current
locale settings into account.

Changed in version 3.7: The monetary keyword parameter was added.
