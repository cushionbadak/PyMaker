Databases¶

Are there any interfaces to database packages in Python?¶
Yes.
Interfaces to disk-based hashes such as DBM and GDBM are also included with standard Python.  There is also the
sqlite3 module, which provides a lightweight disk-based relational
database.
Support for most relational databases is available.  See the
DatabaseProgramming wiki page for details.


How do you implement persistent objects in Python?¶
The pickle library module solves this in a very general way (though you
still can’t store things like open files, sockets or windows), and the
shelve library module uses pickle and (g)dbm to create persistent
mappings containing arbitrary Python objects.
