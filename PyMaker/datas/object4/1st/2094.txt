os.path.ismount(path)¶
Return True if pathname path is a mount point: a point in a
file system where a different file system has been mounted.  On POSIX, the
function checks whether path’s parent, path/.., is on a different
device than path, or whether path/.. and path point to the same
i-node on the same device — this should detect mount points for all Unix
and POSIX variants.  It is not able to reliably detect bind mounts on the
same filesystem.  On Windows, a drive letter root and a share UNC are
always mount points, and for any other path GetVolumePathName is called
to see if it is different from the input path.

New in version 3.4: Support for detecting non-root mount points on Windows.


Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a path-like object.
