static source_to_code(data, path='<string>')¶
Create a code object from Python source.
The data argument can be whatever the compile() function
supports (i.e. string or bytes). The path argument should be
the “path” to where the source code originated from, which can be an
abstract concept (e.g. location in a zip file).
With the subsequent code object one can execute it in a module by
running exec(code, module.__dict__).

New in version 3.4.


Changed in version 3.5: Made the method static.
