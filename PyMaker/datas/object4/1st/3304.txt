detach()Â¶
Separate the underlying raw stream from the buffer and return it.
After the raw stream has been detached, the buffer is in an unusable
state.
Some buffers, like BytesIO, do not have the concept of a single
raw stream to return from this method.  They raise
UnsupportedOperation.

New in version 3.1.
