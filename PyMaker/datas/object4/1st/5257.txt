SSLContext.set_alpn_protocols(protocols)Â¶
Specify which protocols the socket should advertise during the SSL/TLS
handshake. It should be a list of ASCII strings, like ['http/1.1',
'spdy/2'], ordered by preference. The selection of a protocol will happen
during the handshake, and will play out according to RFC 7301. After a
successful handshake, the SSLSocket.selected_alpn_protocol() method will
return the agreed-upon protocol.
This method will raise NotImplementedError if HAS_ALPN is
False.
OpenSSL 1.1.0 to 1.1.0e will abort the handshake and raise SSLError
when both sides support ALPN but cannot agree on a protocol. 1.1.0f+
behaves like 1.0.2, SSLSocket.selected_alpn_protocol() returns None.

New in version 3.5.
