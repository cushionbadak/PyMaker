ssl.get_default_verify_paths()¶
Returns a named tuple with paths to OpenSSL’s default cafile and capath.
The paths are the same as used by
SSLContext.set_default_verify_paths(). The return value is a
named tuple DefaultVerifyPaths:

cafile - resolved path to cafile or None if the file doesn’t exist,
capath - resolved path to capath or None if the directory doesn’t exist,
openssl_cafile_env - OpenSSL’s environment key that points to a cafile,
openssl_cafile - hard coded path to a cafile,
openssl_capath_env - OpenSSL’s environment key that points to a capath,
openssl_capath - hard coded path to a capath directory

Availability: LibreSSL ignores the environment vars
openssl_cafile_env and openssl_capath_env.

New in version 3.4.
