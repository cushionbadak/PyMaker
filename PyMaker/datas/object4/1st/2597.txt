tarfile.open(name=None, mode='r', fileobj=None, bufsize=10240, **kwargs)Â¶
Return a TarFile object for the pathname name. For detailed
information on TarFile objects and the keyword arguments that are
allowed, see TarFile Objects.
mode has to be a string of the form 'filemode[:compression]', it defaults
to 'r'. Here is a full list of mode combinations:






mode
action



'r' or 'r:*'
Open for reading with transparent
compression (recommended).

'r:'
Open for reading exclusively without
compression.

'r:gz'
Open for reading with gzip compression.

'r:bz2'
Open for reading with bzip2 compression.

'r:xz'
Open for reading with lzma compression.

'x' or
'x:'
Create a tarfile exclusively without
compression.
Raise an FileExistsError exception
if it already exists.

'x:gz'
Create a tarfile with gzip compression.
Raise an FileExistsError exception
if it already exists.

'x:bz2'
Create a tarfile with bzip2 compression.
Raise an FileExistsError exception
if it already exists.

'x:xz'
Create a tarfile with lzma compression.
Raise an FileExistsError exception
if it already exists.

'a' or 'a:'
Open for appending with no compression. The
file is created if it does not exist.

'w' or 'w:'
Open for uncompressed writing.

'w:gz'
Open for gzip compressed writing.

'w:bz2'
Open for bzip2 compressed writing.

'w:xz'
Open for lzma compressed writing.



Note that 'a:gz', 'a:bz2' or 'a:xz' is not possible. If mode
is not suitable to open a certain (compressed) file for reading,
ReadError is raised. Use mode 'r' to avoid this.  If a
compression method is not supported, CompressionError is raised.
If fileobj is specified, it is used as an alternative to a file object
opened in binary mode for name. It is supposed to be at position 0.
For modes 'w:gz', 'r:gz', 'w:bz2', 'r:bz2', 'x:gz',
'x:bz2', tarfile.open() accepts the keyword argument
compresslevel (default 9) to specify the compression level of the file.
For special purposes, there is a second format for mode:
'filemode|[compression]'.  tarfile.open() will return a TarFile
object that processes its data as a stream of blocks.  No random seeking will
be done on the file. If given, fileobj may be any object that has a
read() or write() method (depending on the mode). bufsize
specifies the blocksize and defaults to 20 * 512 bytes. Use this variant
in combination with e.g. sys.stdin, a socket file object or a tape
device. However, such a TarFile object is limited in that it does
not allow random access, see Examples.  The currently
possible modes:






Mode
Action



'r|*'
Open a stream of tar blocks for reading
with transparent compression.

'r|'
Open a stream of uncompressed tar blocks
for reading.

'r|gz'
Open a gzip compressed stream for
reading.

'r|bz2'
Open a bzip2 compressed stream for
reading.

'r|xz'
Open an lzma compressed stream for
reading.

'w|'
Open an uncompressed stream for writing.

'w|gz'
Open a gzip compressed stream for
writing.

'w|bz2'
Open a bzip2 compressed stream for
writing.

'w|xz'
Open an lzma compressed stream for
writing.




Changed in version 3.5: The 'x' (exclusive creation) mode was added.


Changed in version 3.6: The name parameter accepts a path-like object.
