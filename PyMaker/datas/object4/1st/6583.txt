class wsgiref.handlers.BaseCGIHandler(stdin, stdout, stderr, environ, multithread=True, multiprocess=False)¶
Similar to CGIHandler, but instead of using the sys and
os modules, the CGI environment and I/O streams are specified explicitly.
The multithread and multiprocess values are used to set the
wsgi.multithread and wsgi.multiprocess flags for any applications run by
the handler instance.
This class is a subclass of SimpleHandler intended for use with
software other than HTTP “origin servers”.  If you are writing a gateway
protocol implementation (such as CGI, FastCGI, SCGI, etc.) that uses a
Status: header to send an HTTP status, you probably want to subclass this
instead of SimpleHandler.
