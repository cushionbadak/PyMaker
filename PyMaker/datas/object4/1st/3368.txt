time.mktime(t)Â¶
This is the inverse function of localtime().  Its argument is the
struct_time or full 9-tuple (since the dst flag is needed; use -1
as the dst flag if it is unknown) which expresses the time in local time, not
UTC.  It returns a floating point number, for compatibility with time().
If the input value cannot be represented as a valid time, either
OverflowError or ValueError will be raised (which depends on
whether the invalid value is caught by Python or the underlying C libraries).
The earliest date for which it can generate a time is platform-dependent.
