exception PendingDeprecationWarningÂ¶
Base class for warnings about features which are obsolete and
expected to be deprecated in the future, but are not deprecated
at the moment.
This class is rarely used as emitting a warning about a possible
upcoming deprecation is unusual, and DeprecationWarning
is preferred for already active deprecations.
