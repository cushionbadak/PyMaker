class bz2.BZ2Compressor(compresslevel=9)¶
Create a new compressor object. This object may be used to compress data
incrementally. For one-shot compression, use the compress() function
instead.
compresslevel, if given, must be an integer between 1 and 9. The
default is 9.


compress(data)¶
Provide data to the compressor object. Returns a chunk of compressed data
if possible, or an empty byte string otherwise.
When you have finished providing data to the compressor, call the
flush() method to finish the compression process.



flush()¶
Finish the compression process. Returns the compressed data left in
internal buffers.
The compressor object may not be used after this method has been called.
