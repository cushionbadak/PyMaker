<dd><p>Raised when the interpreter finds an internal error, but the situation does not
look so serious to cause it to abandon all hope. The associated value is a
string indicating what went wrong (in low-level terms).</p>
<p>You should report this to the author or maintainer of your Python interpreter.
Be sure to report the version of the Python interpreter (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sys.version</span></code>; it is
also printed at the start of an interactive Python session), the exact error
message (the exception’s associated value) and if possible the source of the
program that triggered the error.</p>
