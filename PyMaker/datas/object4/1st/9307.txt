class warnings.catch_warnings(*, record=False, module=None)¶
A context manager that copies and, upon exit, restores the warnings filter
and the showwarning() function.
If the record argument is False (the default) the context manager
returns None on entry. If record is True, a list is
returned that is progressively populated with objects as seen by a custom
showwarning() function (which also suppresses output to sys.stdout).
Each object in the list has attributes with the same names as the arguments to
showwarning().
The module argument takes a module that will be used instead of the
module returned when you import warnings whose filter will be
protected. This argument exists primarily for testing the warnings
module itself.

Note
The catch_warnings manager works by replacing and
then later restoring the module’s
showwarning() function and internal list of filter
specifications.  This means the context manager is modifying
global state and therefore is not thread-safe.
