ssl.cert_time_to_seconds(cert_time)¶
Return the time in seconds since the Epoch, given the cert_time
string representing the “notBefore” or “notAfter” date from a
certificate in "%b %d %H:%M:%S %Y %Z" strptime format (C
locale).
Here’s an example:
>>> import ssl
>>> timestamp = ssl.cert_time_to_seconds("Jan  5 09:34:43 2018 GMT")
>>> timestamp  
1515144883
>>> from datetime import datetime
>>> print(datetime.utcfromtimestamp(timestamp))  
2018-01-05 09:34:43


“notBefore” or “notAfter” dates must use GMT (RFC 5280).

Changed in version 3.5: Interpret the input time as a time in UTC as specified by ‘GMT’
timezone in the input string. Local timezone was used
previously. Return an integer (no fractions of a second in the
input format)
