Protocol versionsÂ¶
SSL versions 2 and 3 are considered insecure and are therefore dangerous to
use.  If you want maximum compatibility between clients and servers, it is
recommended to use PROTOCOL_TLS_CLIENT or
PROTOCOL_TLS_SERVER as the protocol version. SSLv2 and SSLv3 are
disabled by default.
>>> client_context = ssl.SSLContext(ssl.PROTOCOL_TLS_CLIENT)
>>> client_context.options |= ssl.OP_NO_TLSv1
>>> client_context.options |= ssl.OP_NO_TLSv1_1


The SSL context created above will only allow TLSv1.2 and later (if
supported by your system) connections to a server. PROTOCOL_TLS_CLIENT
implies certificate validation and hostname checks by default. You have to
load certificates into the context.
