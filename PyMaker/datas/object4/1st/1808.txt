fractions.gcd(a, b)Â¶
Return the greatest common divisor of the integers a and b.  If either
a or b is nonzero, then the absolute value of gcd(a, b) is the
largest integer that divides both a and b.  gcd(a,b) has the same
sign as b if b is nonzero; otherwise it takes the sign of a.  gcd(0,
0) returns 0.

Deprecated since version 3.5: Use math.gcd() instead.
