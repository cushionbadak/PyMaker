class smtplib.SMTP_SSL(host='', port=0, local_hostname=None, keyfile=None, certfile=None, [timeout, ]context=None, source_address=None)¶
An SMTP_SSL instance behaves exactly the same as instances of
SMTP. SMTP_SSL should be used for situations where SSL is
required from the beginning of the connection and using starttls() is
not appropriate. If host is not specified, the local host is used. If
port is zero, the standard SMTP-over-SSL port (465) is used.  The optional
arguments local_hostname, timeout and source_address have the same
meaning as they do in the SMTP class.  context, also optional,
can contain a SSLContext and allows configuring various
aspects of the secure connection.  Please read Security considerations for
best practices.
keyfile and certfile are a legacy alternative to context, and can
point to a PEM formatted private key and certificate chain file for the
SSL connection.

Changed in version 3.3: context was added.


Changed in version 3.3: source_address argument was added.


Changed in version 3.4: The class now supports hostname check with
ssl.SSLContext.check_hostname and Server Name Indication (see
ssl.HAS_SNI).


Deprecated since version 3.6: keyfile and certfile are deprecated in favor of context.
Please use ssl.SSLContext.load_cert_chain() instead, or let
ssl.create_default_context() select the system’s trusted CA
certificates for you.
