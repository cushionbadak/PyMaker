xml.etree.ElementTree.Comment(text=None)Â¶
Comment element factory.  This factory function creates a special element
that will be serialized as an XML comment by the standard serializer.  The
comment string can be either a bytestring or a Unicode string.  text is a
string containing the comment string.  Returns an element instance
representing a comment.
Note that XMLParser skips over comments in the input
instead of creating comment objects for them. An ElementTree will
only contain comment nodes if they have been inserted into to
the tree using one of the Element methods.
