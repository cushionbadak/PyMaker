coroutine loop.start_tls(transport, protocol, sslcontext, *, server_side=False, server_hostname=None, ssl_handshake_timeout=None)¶
Upgrade an existing transport-based connection to TLS.
Return a new transport instance, that the protocol must start using
immediately after the await.  The transport instance passed to
the start_tls method should never be used again.
Parameters:

transport and protocol instances that methods like
create_server() and
create_connection() return.
sslcontext: a configured instance of SSLContext.
server_side pass True when a server-side connection is being
upgraded (like the one created by create_server()).
server_hostname: sets or overrides the host name that the target
server’s certificate will be matched against.
ssl_handshake_timeout is (for a TLS connection) the time in seconds to
wait for the TLS handshake to complete before aborting the connection.
60.0 seconds if None (default).


New in version 3.7.
