Operators¶
Interface objects support some operators.  Unless stated otherwise, operators
can only be applied between compatible objects (i.e. IPv4 with IPv4, IPv6 with
IPv6).

Logical operators¶
Interface objects can be compared with the usual set of logical operators.
For equality comparison (== and !=), both the IP address and network
must be the same for the objects to be equal.  An interface will not compare
equal to any address or network object.
For ordering (<, >, etc) the rules are different.  Interface and
address objects with the same IP version can be compared, and the address
objects will always sort before the interface objects.  Two interface objects
are first compared by their networks and, if those are the same, then by their
IP addresses.
