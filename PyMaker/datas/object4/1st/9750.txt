importlib.util.find_spec(name, package=None)Â¶
Find the spec for a module, optionally relative to
the specified package name. If the module is in sys.modules,
then sys.modules[name].__spec__ is returned (unless the spec would be
None or is not set, in which case ValueError is raised).
Otherwise a search using sys.meta_path is done. None is
returned if no spec is found.
If name is for a submodule (contains a dot), the parent module is
automatically imported.
name and package work the same as for import_module().

New in version 3.4.


Changed in version 3.7: Raises ModuleNotFoundError instead of AttributeError if
package is in fact not a package (i.e. lacks a __path__
attribute).
