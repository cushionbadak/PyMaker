zlib.compress(data, level=-1)Â¶
Compresses the bytes in data, returning a bytes object containing compressed data.
level is an integer from 0 to 9 or -1 controlling the level of compression;
1 (Z_BEST_SPEED) is fastest and produces the least compression, 9 (Z_BEST_COMPRESSION)
is slowest and produces the most.  0 (Z_NO_COMPRESSION) is no compression.
The default value is -1 (Z_DEFAULT_COMPRESSION).  Z_DEFAULT_COMPRESSION represents a default
compromise between speed and compression (currently equivalent to level 6).
Raises the error exception if any error occurs.

Changed in version 3.6: level can now be used as a keyword parameter.
