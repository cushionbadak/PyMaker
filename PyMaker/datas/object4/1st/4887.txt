BaseTransport.close()¶
Close the transport.
If the transport has a buffer for outgoing
data, buffered data will be flushed asynchronously.  No more data
will be received.  After all buffered data is flushed, the
protocol’s protocol.connection_lost() method will be called with
None as its argument.
