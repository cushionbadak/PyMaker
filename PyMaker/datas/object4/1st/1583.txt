Special functions¶


math.erf(x)¶
Return the error function at
x.
The erf() function can be used to compute traditional statistical
functions such as the cumulative standard normal distribution:
def phi(x):
    'Cumulative distribution function for the standard normal distribution'
    return (1.0 + erf(x / sqrt(2.0))) / 2.0



New in version 3.2.




math.erfc(x)¶
Return the complementary error function at x.  The complementary error
function is defined as
1.0 - erf(x).  It is used for large values of x where a subtraction
from one would cause a loss of significance.

New in version 3.2.




math.gamma(x)¶
Return the Gamma function at
x.

New in version 3.2.




math.lgamma(x)¶
Return the natural logarithm of the absolute value of the Gamma
function at x.

New in version 3.2.
