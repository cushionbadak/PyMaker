Manager Widgets¶


class tkinter.tix.PanedWindow¶
The PanedWindow
widget allows the user to interactively manipulate the sizes of several panes.
The panes can be arranged either vertically or horizontally.  The user changes
the sizes of the panes by dragging the resize handle between two panes.



class tkinter.tix.ListNoteBook¶
The ListNoteBook
widget is very similar to the TixNoteBook widget: it can be used to
display many windows in a limited space using a notebook metaphor. The notebook
is divided into a stack of pages (windows). At one time only one of these pages
can be shown. The user can navigate through these pages by choosing the name of
the desired page in the hlist subwidget.
