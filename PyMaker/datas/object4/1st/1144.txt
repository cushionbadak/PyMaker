class datetime.time(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0, tzinfo=None, *, fold=0)Â¶
All arguments are optional.  tzinfo may be None, or an instance of a
tzinfo subclass.  The remaining arguments may be integers, in the
following ranges:

0 <= hour < 24,
0 <= minute < 60,
0 <= second < 60,
0 <= microsecond < 1000000,
fold in [0, 1].

If an argument outside those ranges is given, ValueError is raised.  All
default to 0 except tzinfo, which defaults to None.
