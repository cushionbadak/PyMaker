linecache.getline(filename, lineno, module_globals=None)¶
Get line lineno from file named filename. This function will never raise an
exception — it will return '' on errors (the terminating newline character
will be included for lines that are found).
If a file named filename is not found, the function will look for it in the
module search path, sys.path, after first checking for a PEP 302
__loader__ in module_globals, in case the module was imported from a
zipfile or other non-filesystem import source.
