sys.getfilesystemencoding()¶
Return the name of the encoding used to convert between Unicode
filenames and bytes filenames. For best compatibility, str should be
used for filenames in all cases, although representing filenames as bytes
is also supported. Functions accepting or returning filenames should support
either str or bytes and internally convert to the system’s preferred
representation.
This encoding is always ASCII-compatible.
os.fsencode() and os.fsdecode() should be used to ensure that
the correct encoding and errors mode are used.

In the UTF-8 mode, the encoding is utf-8 on any platform.
On Mac OS X, the encoding is 'utf-8'.
On Unix, the encoding is the locale encoding.
On Windows, the encoding may be 'utf-8' or 'mbcs', depending
on user configuration.


Changed in version 3.2: getfilesystemencoding() result cannot be None anymore.


Changed in version 3.6: Windows is no longer guaranteed to return 'mbcs'. See PEP 529
and _enablelegacywindowsfsencoding() for more information.


Changed in version 3.7: Return ‘utf-8’ in the UTF-8 mode.
