responsesÂ¶
This attribute contains a mapping of error code integers to two-element tuples
containing a short and long message. For example, {code: (shortmessage,
longmessage)}. The shortmessage is usually used as the message key in an
error response, and longmessage as the explain key.  It is used by
send_response_only() and send_error() methods.
