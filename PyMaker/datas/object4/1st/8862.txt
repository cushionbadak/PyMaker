test.support.script_helper.assert_python_ok(*args, **env_vars)Â¶
Assert that running the interpreter with args and optional environment
variables env_vars succeeds (rc == 0) and return a (return code,
stdout, stderr) tuple.
If the __cleanenv keyword is set, env_vars is used as a fresh
environment.
Python is started in isolated mode (command line option -I),
except if the __isolated keyword is set to False.
