json.dumps(obj, *, skipkeys=False, ensure_ascii=True, check_circular=True, allow_nan=True, cls=None, indent=None, separators=None, default=None, sort_keys=False, **kw)Â¶
Serialize obj to a JSON formatted str using this conversion
table.  The arguments have the same meaning as in
dump().

Note
Keys in key/value pairs of JSON are always of the type str. When
a dictionary is converted into JSON, all the keys of the dictionary are
coerced to strings. As a result of this, if a dictionary is converted
into JSON and then back into a dictionary, the dictionary may not equal
the original one. That is, loads(dumps(x)) != x if x has non-string
keys.
