codecs.encode(obj, encoding='utf-8', errors='strict')Â¶
Encodes obj using the codec registered for encoding.
Errors may be given to set the desired error handling scheme. The
default error handler is 'strict' meaning that encoding errors raise
ValueError (or a more codec specific subclass, such as
UnicodeEncodeError). Refer to Codec Base Classes for more
information on codec error handling.
