object.__reversed__(self)Â¶
Called (if present) by the reversed() built-in to implement
reverse iteration.  It should return a new iterator object that iterates
over all the objects in the container in reverse order.
If the __reversed__() method is not provided, the reversed()
built-in will fall back to using the sequence protocol (__len__() and
__getitem__()).  Objects that support the sequence protocol should
only provide __reversed__() if they can provide an implementation
that is more efficient than the one provided by reversed().
