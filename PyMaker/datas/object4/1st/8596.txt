patch.object(target, attribute, new=DEFAULT, spec=None, create=False, spec_set=None, autospec=None, new_callable=None, **kwargs)Â¶
patch the named member (attribute) on an object (target) with a mock
object.
patch.object() can be used as a decorator, class decorator or a context
manager. Arguments new, spec, create, spec_set, autospec and
new_callable have the same meaning as for patch(). Like patch(),
patch.object() takes arbitrary keyword arguments for configuring the mock
object it creates.
When used as a class decorator patch.object() honours patch.TEST_PREFIX
for choosing which methods to wrap.
