turtle.shapetransform(t11=None, t12=None, t21=None, t22=None)¶




Parameters:
t11 – a number (optional)
t12 – a number (optional)
t21 – a number (optional)
t12 – a number (optional)





Set or return the current transformation matrix of the turtle shape.
If none of the matrix elements are given, return the transformation
matrix as a tuple of 4 elements.
Otherwise set the given elements and transform the turtleshape
according to the matrix consisting of first row t11, t12 and
second row t21, 22. The determinant t11 * t22 - t12 * t21 must not be
zero, otherwise an error is raised.
Modify stretchfactor, shearfactor and tiltangle according to the
given matrix.
>>> turtle = Turtle()
>>> turtle.shape("square")
>>> turtle.shapesize(4,2)
>>> turtle.shearfactor(-0.5)
>>> turtle.shapetransform()
(4.0, -1.0, -0.0, 2.0)
