get_grouped_opcodes(n=3)Â¶
Return a generator of groups with up to n lines of context.
Starting with the groups returned by get_opcodes(), this method
splits out smaller change clusters and eliminates intervening ranges which
have no changes.
The groups are returned in the same format as get_opcodes().
