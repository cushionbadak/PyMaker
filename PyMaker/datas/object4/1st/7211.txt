do_GET()¶
The request is mapped to a local file by interpreting the request as a
path relative to the current working directory.
If the request was mapped to a directory, the directory is checked for a
file named index.html or index.htm (in that order). If found, the
file’s contents are returned; otherwise a directory listing is generated
by calling the list_directory() method. This method uses
os.listdir() to scan the directory, and returns a 404 error
response if the listdir() fails.
If the request was mapped to a file, it is opened. Any OSError
exception in opening the requested file is mapped to a 404,
'File not found' error. If there was a 'If-Modified-Since'
header in the request, and the file was not modified after this time,
a 304, 'Not Modified' response is sent. Otherwise, the content
type is guessed by calling the guess_type() method, which in turn
uses the extensions_map variable, and the file contents are returned.
A 'Content-type:' header with the guessed content type is output,
followed by a 'Content-Length:' header with the file’s size and a
'Last-Modified:' header with the file’s modification time.
Then follows a blank line signifying the end of the headers, and then the
contents of the file are output. If the file’s MIME type starts with
text/ the file is opened in text mode; otherwise binary mode is used.
For example usage, see the implementation of the test() function
invocation in the http.server module.

Changed in version 3.7: Support of the 'If-Modified-Since' header.
