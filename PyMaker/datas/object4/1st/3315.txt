class io.BytesIO([initial_bytes])¶
A stream implementation using an in-memory bytes buffer.  It inherits
BufferedIOBase.  The buffer is discarded when the
close() method is called.
The optional argument initial_bytes is a bytes-like object that
contains initial data.
BytesIO provides or overrides these methods in addition to those
from BufferedIOBase and IOBase:


getbuffer()¶
Return a readable and writable view over the contents of the buffer
without copying them.  Also, mutating the view will transparently
update the contents of the buffer:
>>> b = io.BytesIO(b"abcdef")
>>> view = b.getbuffer()
>>> view[2:4] = b"56"
>>> b.getvalue()
b'ab56ef'



Note
As long as the view exists, the BytesIO object cannot be
resized or closed.


New in version 3.2.




getvalue()¶
Return bytes containing the entire contents of the buffer.



read1([size])¶
In BytesIO, this is the same as read().

Changed in version 3.7: The size argument is now optional.




readinto1(b)¶
In BytesIO, this is the same as readinto().

New in version 3.5.
