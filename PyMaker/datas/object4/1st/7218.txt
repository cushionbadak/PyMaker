class http.cookies.BaseCookie([input])Â¶
This class is a dictionary-like object whose keys are strings and whose values
are Morsel instances. Note that upon setting a key to a value, the
value is first converted to a Morsel containing the key and the value.
If input is given, it is passed to the load() method.
