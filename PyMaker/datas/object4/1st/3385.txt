time.CLOCK_BOOTTIMEÂ¶
Identical to CLOCK_MONOTONIC, except it also includes any time that
the system is suspended.
This allows applications to get a suspend-aware monotonic  clock  without
having to deal with the complications of CLOCK_REALTIME, which may
have  discontinuities if the time is changed using settimeofday() or
similar.
Availability: Linux 2.6.39 or later.

New in version 3.7.
