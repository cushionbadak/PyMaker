set_boundary(boundary)Â¶
Set the boundary parameter of the Content-Type header to
boundary.  set_boundary() will always quote boundary if
necessary.  A HeaderParseError is raised if the
message object has no Content-Type header.
Note that using this method is subtly different from deleting the old
Content-Type header and adding a new one with the new
boundary via add_header(), because set_boundary() preserves
the order of the Content-Type header in the list of
headers.
