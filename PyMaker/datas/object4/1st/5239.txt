SSLSocket.verify_client_post_handshake()¶
Requests post-handshake authentication (PHA) from a TLS 1.3 client. PHA
can only be initiated for a TLS 1.3 connection from a server-side socket,
after the initial TLS handshake and with PHA enabled on both sides, see
SSLContext.post_handshake_auth.
The method does not perform a cert exchange immediately. The server-side
sends a CertificateRequest during the next write event and expects the
client to respond with a certificate on the next read event.
If any precondition isn’t met (e.g. not TLS 1.3, PHA not enabled), an
SSLError is raised.

Note
Only available with OpenSSL 1.1.1 and TLS 1.3 enabled. Without TLS 1.3
support, the method raises NotImplementedError.


New in version 3.7.1.
