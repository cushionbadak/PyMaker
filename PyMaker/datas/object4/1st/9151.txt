install_scripts(context, path)¶
path is the path to a directory that should contain subdirectories
“common”, “posix”, “nt”, each containing scripts destined for the bin
directory in the environment.  The contents of “common” and the
directory corresponding to os.name are copied after some text
replacement of placeholders:

__VENV_DIR__ is replaced with the absolute path of the environment
directory.
__VENV_NAME__ is replaced with the environment name (final path
segment of environment directory).
__VENV_PROMPT__ is replaced with the prompt (the environment
name surrounded by parentheses and with a following space)
__VENV_BIN_NAME__ is replaced with the name of the bin directory
(either bin or Scripts).
__VENV_PYTHON__ is replaced with the absolute path of the
environment’s executable.

The directories are allowed to exist (for when an existing environment
is being upgraded).
