signal.sigtimedwait(sigset, timeout)Â¶
Like sigwaitinfo(), but takes an additional timeout argument
specifying a timeout. If timeout is specified as 0, a poll is
performed. Returns None if a timeout occurs.
Availability: Unix (see the man page sigtimedwait(2) for further
information).
See also pause(), sigwait() and sigwaitinfo().

New in version 3.3.


Changed in version 3.5: The function is now retried with the recomputed timeout if interrupted
by a signal not in sigset and the signal handler does not raise an
exception (see PEP 475 for the rationale).
