AU_read Objects¶
AU_read objects, as returned by open() above, have the following methods:


AU_read.close()¶
Close the stream, and make the instance unusable. (This is  called automatically
on deletion.)



AU_read.getnchannels()¶
Returns number of audio channels (1 for mono, 2 for stereo).



AU_read.getsampwidth()¶
Returns sample width in bytes.



AU_read.getframerate()¶
Returns sampling frequency.



AU_read.getnframes()¶
Returns number of audio frames.



AU_read.getcomptype()¶
Returns compression type. Supported compression types are 'ULAW', 'ALAW'
and 'NONE'.



AU_read.getcompname()¶
Human-readable version of getcomptype().  The supported types have the
respective names 'CCITT G.711 u-law', 'CCITT G.711 A-law' and 'not
compressed'.



AU_read.getparams()¶
Returns a namedtuple() (nchannels, sampwidth,
framerate, nframes, comptype, compname), equivalent to output of the
get*() methods.



AU_read.readframes(n)¶
Reads and returns at most n frames of audio, as a bytes object.  The data
will be returned in linear format.  If the original data is in u-LAW format, it
will be converted.



AU_read.rewind()¶
Rewind the file pointer to the beginning of the audio stream.

The following two methods define a term “position” which is compatible between
them, and is otherwise implementation dependent.


AU_read.setpos(pos)¶
Set the file pointer to the specified position.  Only values returned from
tell() should be used for pos.



AU_read.tell()¶
Return current file pointer position.  Note that the returned value has nothing
to do with the actual position in the file.

The following two functions are defined for compatibility with the  aifc,
and don’t do anything interesting.


AU_read.getmarkers()¶
Returns None.



AU_read.getmark(id)¶
Raise an error.
