getChild(suffix)Â¶
Returns a logger which is a descendant to this logger, as determined by the suffix.
Thus, logging.getLogger('abc').getChild('def.ghi') would return the same
logger as would be returned by logging.getLogger('abc.def.ghi'). This is a
convenience method, useful when the parent logger is named using e.g. __name__
rather than a literal string.

New in version 3.2.
