posix.environÂ¶
A dictionary representing the string environment at the time the interpreter
was started. Keys and values are bytes on Unix and str on Windows. For
example, environ[b'HOME'] (environ['HOME'] on Windows) is the
pathname of your home directory, equivalent to getenv("HOME") in C.
Modifying this dictionary does not affect the string environment passed on by
execv(), popen() or system(); if you need to
change the environment, pass environ to execve() or add
variable assignments and export statements to the command string for
system() or popen().

Changed in version 3.2: On Unix, keys and values are bytes.


Note
The os module provides an alternate implementation of environ
which updates the environment on modification. Note also that updating
os.environ will render this dictionary obsolete. Use of the
os module version of this is recommended over direct access to the
posix module.
