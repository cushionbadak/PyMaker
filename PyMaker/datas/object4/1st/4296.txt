multiprocessing.get_start_method(allow_none=False)Â¶
Return the name of start method used for starting processes.
If the start method has not been fixed and allow_none is false,
then the start method is fixed to the default and the name is
returned.  If the start method has not been fixed and allow_none
is true then None is returned.
The return value can be 'fork', 'spawn', 'forkserver'
or None.  'fork' is the default on Unix, while 'spawn' is
the default on Windows.

New in version 3.4.
