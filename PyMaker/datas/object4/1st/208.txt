5.8.1. __main__.__spec__¶
Depending on how __main__ is initialized, __main__.__spec__
gets set appropriately or to None.
When Python is started with the -m option, __spec__ is set
to the module spec of the corresponding module or package. __spec__ is
also populated when the __main__ module is loaded as part of executing a
directory, zipfile or other sys.path entry.
In the remaining cases
__main__.__spec__ is set to None, as the code used to populate the
__main__ does not correspond directly with an importable module:

interactive prompt
-c option
running from stdin
running directly from a source or bytecode file

Note that __main__.__spec__ is always None in the last case,
even if the file could technically be imported directly as a module
instead. Use the -m switch if valid module metadata is desired
in __main__.
Note also that even when __main__ corresponds with an importable module
and __main__.__spec__ is set accordingly, they’re still considered
distinct modules. This is due to the fact that blocks guarded by
if __name__ == "__main__": checks only execute when the module is used
to populate the __main__ namespace, and not during normal import.
