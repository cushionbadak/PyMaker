<dd><p>The string representation in dotted decimal notation. Leading zeroes
are never included in the representation.</p>
<p>As IPv4 does not define a shorthand notation for addresses with octets
set to zero, these two attributes are always the same as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">str(addr)</span></code>
for IPv4 addresses. Exposing these attributes makes it easier to
write display code that can handle both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.</p>
