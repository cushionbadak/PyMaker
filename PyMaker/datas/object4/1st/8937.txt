Issue with file descriptorsÂ¶
enable(), dump_traceback_later() and register() keep the
file descriptor of their file argument. If the file is closed and its file
descriptor is reused by a new file, or if os.dup2() is used to replace
the file descriptor, the traceback will be written into a different file. Call
these functions again each time that the file is replaced.
