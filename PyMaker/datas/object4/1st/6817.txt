HTTPConnection.endheaders(message_body=None, *, encode_chunked=False)Â¶
Send a blank line to the server, signalling the end of the headers. The
optional message_body argument can be used to pass a message body
associated with the request.
If encode_chunked is True, the result of each iteration of
message_body will be chunk-encoded as specified in RFC 7230,
Section 3.3.1.  How the data is encoded is dependent on the type of
message_body.  If message_body implements the buffer interface the encoding will result in a single chunk.
If message_body is a collections.abc.Iterable, each iteration
of message_body will result in a chunk.  If message_body is a
file object, each call to .read() will result in a chunk.
The method automatically signals the end of the chunk-encoded data
immediately after message_body.

Note
Due to the chunked encoding specification, empty chunks
yielded by an iterator body will be ignored by the chunk-encoder.
This is to avoid premature termination of the read of the request by
the target server due to malformed encoding.


New in version 3.6: Chunked encoding support.  The encode_chunked parameter was
added.
