log_message(format, ...)Â¶
Logs an arbitrary message to sys.stderr. This is typically overridden
to create custom error logging mechanisms. The format argument is a
standard printf-style format string, where the additional arguments to
log_message() are applied as inputs to the formatting. The client
ip address and current date and time are prefixed to every message logged.
