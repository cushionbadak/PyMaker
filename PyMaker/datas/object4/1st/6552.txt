cgitb.html(info, context=5)Â¶
This function handles the exception described by info (a 3-tuple containing
the result of sys.exc_info()), formatting its traceback as HTML and
returning the result as a string. The optional argument context is the
number of lines of context to display around the current line of source code
in the traceback; this defaults to 5.
