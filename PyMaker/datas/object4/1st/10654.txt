How do I generate random numbers in Python?¶
The standard module random implements a random number generator.  Usage
is simple:
import random
random.random()


This returns a random floating point number in the range [0, 1).
There are also many other specialized generators in this module, such as:

randrange(a, b) chooses an integer in the range [a, b).
uniform(a, b) chooses a floating point number in the range [a, b).
normalvariate(mean, sdev) samples the normal (Gaussian) distribution.

Some higher-level functions operate on sequences directly, such as:

choice(S) chooses random element from a given sequence
shuffle(L) shuffles a list in-place, i.e. permutes it randomly

There’s also a Random class you can instantiate to create independent
multiple random number generators.
