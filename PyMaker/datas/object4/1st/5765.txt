email.utils.localtime(dt=None)Â¶
Return local time as an aware datetime object.  If called without
arguments, return current time.  Otherwise dt argument should be a
datetime instance, and it is converted to the local time
zone according to the system time zone database.  If dt is naive (that
is, dt.tzinfo is None), it is assumed to be in local time.  In this
case, a positive or zero value for isdst causes localtime to presume
initially that summer time (for example, Daylight Saving Time) is or is not
(respectively) in effect for the specified time.  A negative value for
isdst causes the localtime to attempt to divine whether summer time
is in effect for the specified time.

New in version 3.3.
