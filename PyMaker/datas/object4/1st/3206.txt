os.wait3(options)¶
Similar to waitpid(), except no process id argument is given and a
3-element tuple containing the child’s process id, exit status indication,
and resource usage information is returned.  Refer to
resource.getrusage() for details on resource usage
information.  The option argument is the same as that provided to
waitpid() and wait4().
Availability: Unix.
