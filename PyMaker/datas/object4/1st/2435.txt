connectionÂ¶
This read-only attribute provides the SQLite database Connection
used by the Cursor object.  A Cursor object created by
calling con.cursor() will have a
connection attribute that refers to con:
>>> con = sqlite3.connect(":memory:")
>>> cur = con.cursor()
>>> cur.connection == con
True
