add_header(_name, _value, **_params)¶
Extended header setting.  This method is similar to __setitem__()
except that additional header parameters can be provided as keyword
arguments.  _name is the header field to add and _value is the
primary value for the header.
For each item in the keyword argument dictionary _params, the key is
taken as the parameter name, with underscores converted to dashes (since
dashes are illegal in Python identifiers).  Normally, the parameter will
be added as key="value" unless the value is None, in which case
only the key will be added.  If the value contains non-ASCII characters,
it can be specified as a three tuple in the format
(CHARSET, LANGUAGE, VALUE), where CHARSET is a string naming the
charset to be used to encode the value, LANGUAGE can usually be set
to None or the empty string (see RFC 2231 for other possibilities),
and VALUE is the string value containing non-ASCII code points.  If
a three tuple is not passed and the value contains non-ASCII characters,
it is automatically encoded in RFC 2231 format using a CHARSET
of utf-8 and a LANGUAGE of None.
Here’s an example:
msg.add_header('Content-Disposition', 'attachment', filename='bud.gif')


This will add a header that looks like
Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="bud.gif"


An example with non-ASCII characters:
msg.add_header('Content-Disposition', 'attachment',
               filename=('iso-8859-1', '', 'Fußballer.ppt'))


Which produces
Content-Disposition: attachment; filename*="iso-8859-1''Fu%DFballer.ppt"
