SSLSocket.selected_npn_protocol()Â¶
Return the higher-level protocol that was selected during the TLS/SSL
handshake. If SSLContext.set_npn_protocols() was not called, or
if the other party does not support NPN, or if the handshake has not yet
happened, this will return None.

New in version 3.3.
