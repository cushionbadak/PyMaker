os.readv(fd, buffers)Â¶
Read from a file descriptor fd into a number of mutable bytes-like
objects buffers. Transfer data into each buffer until
it is full and then move on to the next buffer in the sequence to hold the
rest of the data.
Return the total number of bytes actually read which can be less than the
total capacity of all the objects.
The operating system may set a limit (sysconf() value
'SC_IOV_MAX') on the number of buffers that can be used.
Availability: Unix.

New in version 3.3.
