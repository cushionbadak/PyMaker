ipaddress.ip_interface(address)Â¶
Return an IPv4Interface or IPv6Interface object depending
on the IP address passed as argument.  address is a string or integer
representing the IP address.  Either IPv4 or IPv6 addresses may be supplied;
integers less than 2**32 will be considered to be IPv4 by default.  A
ValueError is raised if address does not represent a valid IPv4 or
IPv6 address.
