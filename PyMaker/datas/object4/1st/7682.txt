of the formats supported by OSS are:






Format
Description



AFMT_MU_LAW
a logarithmic encoding (used by Sun .au

a 4:1 compressed format defined by the
Interactive Multimedia Association

AFMT_U8
Unsigned, 8-bit audio

AFMT_S16_LE
Signed, 16-bit audio, little-endian byte
order (as used by Intel processors)

AFMT_S16_BE
Signed, 16-bit audio, big-endian byte order
(as used by 68k, PowerPC, Sparc)

AFMT_S8
Signed, 8 bit audio

AFMT_U16_LE
Unsigned, 16-bit little-endian audio

AFMT_U16_BE
Unsigned, 16-bit big-endian audio



Consult the OSS documentation for a full list of audio formats, and note that
most devices support only a subset of these formats.  Some older devices only
support AFMT_U8; the most common format used today is
AFMT_S16_LE.
