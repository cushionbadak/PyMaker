importlib.machinery.all_suffixes()¶
Returns a combined list of strings representing all file suffixes for
modules recognized by the standard import machinery. This is a
helper for code which simply needs to know if a filesystem path
potentially refers to a module without needing any details on the kind
of module (for example, inspect.getmodulename()).

New in version 3.3.
