loop.set_default_executor(executor)Â¶
Set executor as the default executor used by run_in_executor().
executor should be an instance of
ThreadPoolExecutor.

Deprecated since version 3.7: Using an executor that is not an instance of
ThreadPoolExecutor is deprecated and
will trigger an error in Python 3.9.

executor must be an instance of
concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor.
