os.path.normpath(path)Â¶
Normalize a pathname by collapsing redundant separators and up-level
references so that A//B, A/B/, A/./B and A/foo/../B all
become A/B.  This string manipulation may change the meaning of a path
that contains symbolic links.  On Windows, it converts forward slashes to
backward slashes. To normalize case, use normcase().

Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a path-like object.
