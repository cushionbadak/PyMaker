IterationÂ¶
Iterating over the members of an enum does not provide the aliases:
>>> list(Shape)
[<Shape.SQUARE: 2>, <Shape.DIAMOND: 1>, <Shape.CIRCLE: 3>]


The special attribute __members__ is an ordered dictionary mapping names
to members.  It includes all names defined in the enumeration, including the
aliases:
>>> for name, member in Shape.__members__.items():
...     name, member
...
('SQUARE', <Shape.SQUARE: 2>)
('DIAMOND', <Shape.DIAMOND: 1>)
('CIRCLE', <Shape.CIRCLE: 3>)
('ALIAS_FOR_SQUARE', <Shape.SQUARE: 2>)


The __members__ attribute can be used for detailed programmatic access to
the enumeration members.  For example, finding all the aliases:
>>> [name for name, member in Shape.__members__.items() if member.name != name]
['ALIAS_FOR_SQUARE']
