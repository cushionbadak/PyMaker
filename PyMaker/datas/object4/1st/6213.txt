DocumentType.entitiesÂ¶
This is a NamedNodeMap giving the definitions of external entities.
For entity names defined more than once, only the first definition is provided
(others are ignored as required by the XML recommendation).  This may be
None if the information is not provided by the parser, or if no entities are
defined.
