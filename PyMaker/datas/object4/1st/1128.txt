datetime.utcoffset()¶
If tzinfo is None, returns None, else returns
self.tzinfo.utcoffset(self), and raises an exception if the latter doesn’t
return None or a timedelta object with magnitude less than one day.

Changed in version 3.7: The UTC offset is not restricted to a whole number of minutes.
