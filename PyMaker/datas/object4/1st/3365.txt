time.get_clock_info(name)Â¶
Get information on the specified clock as a namespace object.
Supported clock names and the corresponding functions to read their value
are:

'clock': time.clock()
'monotonic': time.monotonic()
'perf_counter': time.perf_counter()
'process_time': time.process_time()
'thread_time': time.thread_time()
'time': time.time()

The result has the following attributes:

adjustable: True if the clock can be changed automatically (e.g. by
a NTP daemon) or manually by the system administrator, False otherwise
implementation: The name of the underlying C function used to get
the clock value.  Refer to Clock ID Constants for possible values.
monotonic: True if the clock cannot go backward,
False otherwise
resolution: The resolution of the clock in seconds (float)


New in version 3.3.
