exception KeyboardInterruptÂ¶
Raised when the user hits the interrupt key (normally Control-C or
Delete).  During execution, a check for interrupts is made
regularly. The exception inherits from BaseException so as to not be
accidentally caught by code that catches Exception and thus prevent
the interpreter from exiting.
