class code.InteractiveInterpreter(locals=None)¶
This class deals with parsing and interpreter state (the user’s namespace); it
does not deal with input buffering or prompting or input file naming (the
filename is always passed in explicitly). The optional locals argument
specifies the dictionary in which code will be executed; it defaults to a newly
created dictionary with key '__name__' set to '__console__' and key
'__doc__' set to None.
