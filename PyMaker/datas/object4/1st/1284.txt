class collections.UserString(seq)¶
Class that simulates a string object.  The instance’s
content is kept in a regular string object, which is accessible via the
data attribute of UserString instances.  The instance’s
contents are initially set to a copy of seq.  The seq argument can
be any object which can be converted into a string using the built-in
str() function.
In addition to supporting the methods and operations of strings,
UserString instances provide the following attribute:

format_map, isprintable, and maketrans.
