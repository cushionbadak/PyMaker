ctypes.WINFUNCTYPE(restype, *argtypes, use_errno=False, use_last_error=False)Â¶
Windows only: The returned function prototype creates functions that use the
stdcall calling convention, except on Windows CE where
WINFUNCTYPE() is the same as CFUNCTYPE().  The function will
release the GIL during the call.  use_errno and use_last_error have the
same meaning as above.
