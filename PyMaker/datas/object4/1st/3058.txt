os.chown(path, uid, gid, *, dir_fd=None, follow_symlinks=True)Â¶
Change the owner and group id of path to the numeric uid and gid.  To
leave one of the ids unchanged, set it to -1.
This function can support specifying a file descriptor,
paths relative to directory descriptors and not
following symlinks.
See shutil.chown() for a higher-level function that accepts names in
addition to numeric ids.
Availability: Unix.

New in version 3.3: Added support for specifying an open file descriptor for path,
and the dir_fd and follow_symlinks arguments.


Changed in version 3.6: Supports a path-like object.
