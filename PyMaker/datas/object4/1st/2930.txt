os.putenv(key, value)¶
Set the environment variable named key to the string value.  Such
changes to the environment affect subprocesses started with os.system(),
popen() or fork() and execv().
Availability: most flavors of Unix, Windows.

Note
On some platforms, including FreeBSD and Mac OS X, setting environ may
cause memory leaks. Refer to the system documentation for putenv.

When putenv() is supported, assignments to items in os.environ are
automatically translated into corresponding calls to putenv(); however,
calls to putenv() don’t update os.environ, so it is actually
preferable to assign to items of os.environ.
