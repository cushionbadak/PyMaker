random.triangular(low, high, mode)Â¶
Return a random floating point number N such that low <= N <= high and
with the specified mode between those bounds.  The low and high bounds
default to zero and one.  The mode argument defaults to the midpoint
between the bounds, giving a symmetric distribution.
