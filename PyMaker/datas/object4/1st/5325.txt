devpoll.register(fd[, eventmask])¶
Register a file descriptor with the polling object.  Future calls to the
poll() method will then check whether the file descriptor has any
pending I/O events.  fd can be either an integer, or an object with a
fileno() method that returns an integer.  File objects
implement fileno(), so they can also be used as the argument.
eventmask is an optional bitmask describing the type of events you want to
check for. The constants are the same that with poll()
object. The default value is a combination of the constants POLLIN,
POLLPRI, and POLLOUT.

Warning
Registering a file descriptor that’s already registered is not an
error, but the result is undefined. The appropriate action is to
unregister or modify it first. This is an important difference
compared with poll().
