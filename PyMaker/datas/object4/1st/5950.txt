Exceptions¶
The following exception classes are defined in the mailbox module:


exception mailbox.Error¶
The based class for all other module-specific exceptions.



exception mailbox.NoSuchMailboxError¶
Raised when a mailbox is expected but is not found, such as when instantiating a
Mailbox subclass with a path that does not exist (and with the create
parameter set to False), or when opening a folder that does not exist.



exception mailbox.NotEmptyError¶
Raised when a mailbox is not empty but is expected to be, such as when deleting
a folder that contains messages.



exception mailbox.ExternalClashError¶
Raised when some mailbox-related condition beyond the control of the program
causes it to be unable to proceed, such as when failing to acquire a lock that
another program already holds a lock, or when a uniquely-generated file name
already exists.



exception mailbox.FormatError¶
Raised when the data in a file cannot be parsed, such as when an MH
instance attempts to read a corrupted .mh_sequences file.
