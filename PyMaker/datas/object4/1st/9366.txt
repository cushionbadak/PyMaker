register(subclass)¶
Register subclass as a “virtual subclass” of this ABC. For
example:
from abc import ABC

class MyABC(ABC):
    pass

MyABC.register(tuple)

assert issubclass(tuple, MyABC)
assert isinstance((), MyABC)



Changed in version 3.3: Returns the registered subclass, to allow usage as a class decorator.


Changed in version 3.4: To detect calls to register(), you can use the
get_cache_token() function.
