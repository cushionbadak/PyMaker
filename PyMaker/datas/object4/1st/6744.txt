Parsing ASCII Encoded BytesÂ¶
The URL parsing functions were originally designed to operate on character
strings only. In practice, it is useful to be able to manipulate properly
quoted and encoded URLs as sequences of ASCII bytes. Accordingly, the
URL parsing functions in this module all operate on bytes and
bytearray objects in addition to str objects.
If str data is passed in, the result will also contain only
str data. If bytes or bytearray data is
passed in, the result will contain only bytes data.
Attempting to mix str data with bytes or
bytearray in a single function call will result in a
TypeError being raised, while attempting to pass in non-ASCII
byte values will trigger UnicodeDecodeError.
To support easier conversion of result objects between str and
bytes, all return values from URL parsing functions provide
either an encode() method (when the result contains str
data) or a decode() method (when the result contains bytes
data). The signatures of these methods match those of the corresponding
str and bytes methods (except that the default encoding
is 'ascii' rather than 'utf-8'). Each produces a value of a
corresponding type that contains either bytes data (for
encode() methods) or str data (for
decode() methods).
Applications that need to operate on potentially improperly quoted URLs
that may contain non-ASCII data will need to do their own decoding from
bytes to characters before invoking the URL parsing methods.
The behaviour described in this section applies only to the URL parsing
functions. The URL quoting functions use their own rules when producing
or consuming byte sequences as detailed in the documentation of the
individual URL quoting functions.

Changed in version 3.2: URL parsing functions now accept ASCII encoded byte sequences
