Converting an argument sequence to a string on Windows¶
On Windows, an args sequence is converted to a string that can be parsed
using the following rules (which correspond to the rules used by the MS C
runtime):

Arguments are delimited by white space, which is either a
space or a tab.
A string surrounded by double quotation marks is
interpreted as a single argument, regardless of white space
contained within.  A quoted string can be embedded in an
argument.
A double quotation mark preceded by a backslash is
interpreted as a literal double quotation mark.
Backslashes are interpreted literally, unless they
immediately precede a double quotation mark.
If backslashes immediately precede a double quotation mark,
every pair of backslashes is interpreted as a literal
backslash.  If the number of backslashes is odd, the last
backslash escapes the next double quotation mark as
described in rule 3.
