test.support.detect_api_mismatch(ref_api, other_api, *, ignore=())¶
Returns the set of attributes, functions or methods of ref_api not
found on other_api, except for a defined list of items to be
ignored in this check specified in ignore.
By default this skips private attributes beginning with ‘_’ but
includes all magic methods, i.e. those starting and ending in ‘__’.

New in version 3.5.
