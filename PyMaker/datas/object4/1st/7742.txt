ngettext(singular, plural, n)¶
Do a plural-forms lookup of a message id.  singular is used as the message id
for purposes of lookup in the catalog, while n is used to determine which
plural form to use.  The returned message string is a Unicode string.
If the message id is not found in the catalog, and a fallback is specified,
the request is forwarded to the fallback’s ngettext()
method.  Otherwise, when n is 1 singular is returned, and plural is
returned in all other cases.
Here is an example:
n = len(os.listdir('.'))
cat = GNUTranslations(somefile)
message = cat.ngettext(
    'There is %(num)d file in this directory',
    'There are %(num)d files in this directory',
    n) % {'num': n}
