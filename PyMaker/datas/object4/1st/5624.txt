datetimeÂ¶
If the header value can be recognized as a valid date of one form or
another, this attribute will contain a datetime
instance representing that date.  If the timezone of the input date is
specified as -0000 (indicating it is in UTC but contains no
information about the source timezone), then datetime will be a
naive datetime.  If a specific timezone offset is
found (including +0000), then datetime will contain an aware
datetime that uses datetime.timezone to record the timezone
offset.
