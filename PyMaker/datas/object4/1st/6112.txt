text¶

tail¶
These attributes can be used to hold additional data associated with
the element.  Their values are usually strings but may be any
application-specific object.  If the element is created from
an XML file, the text attribute holds either the text between
the element’s start tag and its first child or end tag, or None, and
the tail attribute holds either the text between the element’s
end tag and the next tag, or None.  For the XML data
<a><b>1<c>2<d/>3</c></b>4</a>


the a element has None for both text and tail attributes,
the b element has text "1" and tail "4",
the c element has text "2" and tail None,
and the d element has text None and tail "3".
To collect the inner text of an element, see itertext(), for
example "".join(element.itertext()).
Applications may store arbitrary objects in these attributes.
