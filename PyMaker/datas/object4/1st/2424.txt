execute(sql[, parameters])¶
Executes an SQL statement. The SQL statement may be parameterized (i. e.
placeholders instead of SQL literals). The sqlite3 module supports two
kinds of placeholders: question marks (qmark style) and named placeholders
(named style).
Here’s an example of both styles:
import sqlite3

con = sqlite3.connect(":memory:")
cur = con.cursor()
cur.execute("create table people (name_last, age)")

who = "Yeltsin"
age = 72

# This is the qmark style:
cur.execute("insert into people values (?, ?)", (who, age))

# And this is the named style:
cur.execute("select * from people where name_last=:who and age=:age", {"who": who, "age": age})

print(cur.fetchone())

con.close()


execute() will only execute a single SQL statement. If you try to execute
more than one statement with it, it will raise a Warning. Use
executescript() if you want to execute multiple SQL statements with one
call.
