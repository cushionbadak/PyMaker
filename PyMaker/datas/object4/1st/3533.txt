LogRecord Objects¶
LogRecord instances are created automatically by the Logger
every time something is logged, and can be created manually via
makeLogRecord() (for example, from a pickled event received over the
wire).


class logging.LogRecord(name, level, pathname, lineno, msg, args, exc_info, func=None, sinfo=None)¶
Contains all the information pertinent to the event being logged.
The primary information is passed in msg and args, which
are combined using msg % args to create the message field of the
record.




Parameters:
name – The name of the logger used to log the event represented by
this LogRecord. Note that this name will always have this
value, even though it may be emitted by a handler attached to
a different (ancestor) logger.
level – The numeric level of the logging event (one of DEBUG, INFO etc.)
Note that this is converted to two attributes of the LogRecord:
levelno for the numeric value and levelname for the
corresponding level name.
pathname – The full pathname of the source file where the logging call
was made.
lineno – The line number in the source file where the logging call was
made.
msg – The event description message, possibly a format string with
placeholders for variable data.
args – Variable data to merge into the msg argument to obtain the
event description.
exc_info – An exception tuple with the current exception information,
or None if no exception information is available.
func – The name of the function or method from which the logging call
was invoked.
sinfo – A text string representing stack information from the base of
the stack in the current thread, up to the logging call.







getMessage()¶
Returns the message for this LogRecord instance after merging any
user-supplied arguments with the message. If the user-supplied message
argument to the logging call is not a string, str() is called on it to
convert it to a string. This allows use of user-defined classes as
messages, whose __str__ method can return the actual format string to
be used.


Changed in version 3.2: The creation of a LogRecord has been made more configurable by
providing a factory which is used to create the record. The factory can be
set using getLogRecordFactory() and setLogRecordFactory()
(see this for the factory’s signature).

This functionality can be used to inject your own values into a
LogRecord at creation time. You can use the following pattern:
old_factory = logging.getLogRecordFactory()

def record_factory(*args, **kwargs):
    record = old_factory(*args, **kwargs)
    record.custom_attribute = 0xdecafbad
    return record

logging.setLogRecordFactory(record_factory)


With this pattern, multiple factories could be chained, and as long
as they don’t overwrite each other’s attributes or unintentionally
overwrite the standard attributes listed above, there should be no
surprises.
