docs:


lngettext(singular, plural, n)Â¶
Equivalent to gettext() and ngettext(), but the translation
is returned as a byte string encoded in the preferred system encoding
if no encoding was explicitly set with set_output_charset().
Overridden in derived classes.

Warning
These methods should be avoided in Python 3.  See the warning for the
lgettext() function.
