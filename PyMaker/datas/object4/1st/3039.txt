Querying the size of a terminal¶

New in version 3.3.



os.get_terminal_size(fd=STDOUT_FILENO)¶
Return the size of the terminal window as (columns, lines),
tuple of type terminal_size.
The optional argument fd (default STDOUT_FILENO, or standard
output) specifies which file descriptor should be queried.
If the file descriptor is not connected to a terminal, an OSError
is raised.
shutil.get_terminal_size() is the high-level function which
should normally be used, os.get_terminal_size is the low-level
implementation.
Availability: Unix, Windows.



class os.terminal_size¶
A subclass of tuple, holding (columns, lines) of the terminal window size.


columns¶
Width of the terminal window in characters.



lines¶
Height of the terminal window in characters.
