The Catalog constructor¶
GNOME uses a version of the gettext module by James Henstridge, but this
version has a slightly different API.  Its documented usage was:
import gettext
cat = gettext.Catalog(domain, localedir)
_ = cat.gettext
print(_('hello world'))


For compatibility with this older module, the function Catalog() is an
alias for the translation() function described above.
One difference between this module and Henstridge’s: his catalog objects
supported access through a mapping API, but this appears to be unused and so is
not currently supported.
