Multi-processing¶
If using this module as part of a multi-processed application (using,
for example the multiprocessing or concurrent.futures modules),
be aware that OpenSSL’s internal random number generator does not properly
handle forked processes.  Applications must change the PRNG state of the
parent process if they use any SSL feature with os.fork().  Any
successful call of RAND_add(), RAND_bytes() or
RAND_pseudo_bytes() is sufficient.
