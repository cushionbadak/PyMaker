formatter.add_flowing_data(data)Â¶
Provide data which should be formatted with collapsed whitespace. Whitespace
from preceding and successive calls to add_flowing_data() is considered as
well when the whitespace collapse is performed.  The data which is passed to
this method is expected to be word-wrapped by the output device.  Note that any
word-wrapping still must be performed by the writer object due to the need to
rely on device and font information.
