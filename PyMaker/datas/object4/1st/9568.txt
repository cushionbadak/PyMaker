InteractiveInterpreter.runcode(code)Â¶
Execute a code object. When an exception occurs, showtraceback() is called
to display a traceback.  All exceptions are caught except SystemExit,
which is allowed to propagate.
A note about KeyboardInterrupt: this exception may occur elsewhere in
this code, and may not always be caught.  The caller should be prepared to deal
with it.
