docs:


setLevel(level)¶
Sets the threshold for this handler to level. Logging messages which are
less severe than level will be ignored. When a handler is created, the
level is set to NOTSET (which causes all messages to be
processed).
See Logging Levels for a list of levels.

Changed in version 3.2: The level parameter now accepts a string representation of the
level such as ‘INFO’ as an alternative to the integer constants
such as INFO.
