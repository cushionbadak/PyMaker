getMessageID(record)Â¶
Returns the message ID for the record. If you are using your own messages,
you could do this by having the msg passed to the logger being an ID
rather than a format string. Then, in here, you could use a dictionary
lookup to get the message ID. This version returns 1, which is the base
message ID in win32service.pyd.
