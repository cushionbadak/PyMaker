Classes and functions¶
This section describes in depth the API of unittest.

Test cases¶


class unittest.TestCase(methodName='runTest')¶
Instances of the TestCase class represent the logical test units
in the unittest universe.  This class is intended to be used as a base
class, with specific tests being implemented by concrete subclasses.  This class
implements the interface needed by the test runner to allow it to drive the
tests, and methods that the test code can use to check for and report various
kinds of failure.
Each instance of TestCase will run a single base method: the method
named methodName.
In most uses of TestCase, you will neither change
the methodName nor reimplement the default runTest() method.

Changed in version 3.2: TestCase can be instantiated successfully without providing a
methodName. This makes it easier to experiment with TestCase
from the interactive interpreter.

TestCase instances provide three groups of methods: one group used
to run the test, another used by the test implementation to check conditions
and report failures, and some inquiry methods allowing information about the
test itself to be gathered.
Methods in the first group (running the test) are:


setUp()¶
Method called to prepare the test fixture.  This is called immediately
before calling the test method; other than AssertionError or SkipTest,
any exception raised by this method will be considered an error rather than
a test failure. The default implementation does nothing.



tearDown()¶
Method called immediately after the test method has been called and the
result recorded.  This is called even if the test method raised an
exception, so the implementation in subclasses may need to be particularly
careful about checking internal state.  Any exception, other than
AssertionError or SkipTest, raised by this method will be
considered an additional error rather than a test failure (thus increasing
the total number of reported errors). This method will only be called if
the setUp() succeeds, regardless of the outcome of the test method.
The default implementation does nothing.



setUpClass()¶
A class method called before tests in an individual class are run.
setUpClass is called with the class as the only argument
and must be decorated as a classmethod():
@classmethod
def setUpClass(cls):
    ...


See Class and Module Fixtures for more details.

New in version 3.2.




tearDownClass()¶
A class method called after tests in an individual class have run.
tearDownClass is called with the class as the only argument
and must be decorated as a classmethod():
@classmethod
def tearDownClass(cls):
    ...


See Class and Module Fixtures for more details.

New in version 3.2.




run(result=None)¶
Run the test, collecting the result into the TestResult object
passed as result.  If result is omitted or None, a temporary
result object is created (by calling the defaultTestResult()
method) and used. The result object is returned to run()’s
caller.
The same effect may be had by simply calling the TestCase
instance.

Changed in version 3.3: Previous versions of run did not return the result. Neither did
calling an instance.




skipTest(reason)¶
Calling this during a test method or setUp() skips the current
test.  See Skipping tests and expected failures for more information.

New in version 3.1.




subTest(msg=None, **params)¶
Return a context manager which executes the enclosed code block as a
subtest.  msg and params are optional, arbitrary values which are
displayed whenever a subtest fails, allowing you to identify them
clearly.
A test case can contain any number of subtest declarations, and
they can be arbitrarily nested.
See Distinguishing test iterations using subtests for more information.

New in version 3.4.




debug()¶
Run the test without collecting the result.  This allows exceptions raised
by the test to be propagated to the caller, and can be used to support
running tests under a debugger.

The TestCase class provides several assert methods to check for and
report failures.  The following table lists the most commonly used methods
(see the tables below for more assert methods):







Method
Checks that
New in



assertEqual(a, b)
a == b
 

assertNotEqual(a, b)
a != b
 

assertTrue(x)
bool(x) is True
 

assertFalse(x)
bool(x) is False
 

assertIs(a, b)
a is b
3.1

assertIsNot(a, b)
a is not b
3.1

assertIsNone(x)
x is None
3.1

assertIsNotNone(x)
x is not None
3.1

assertIn(a, b)
a in b
3.1

assertNotIn(a, b)
a not in b
3.1

assertIsInstance(a, b)
isinstance(a, b)
3.2

assertNotIsInstance(a, b)
not isinstance(a, b)
3.2



All the assert methods accept a msg argument that, if specified, is used
as the error message on failure (see also longMessage).
Note that the msg keyword argument can be passed to assertRaises(),
assertRaisesRegex(), assertWarns(), assertWarnsRegex()
only when they are used as a context manager.


assertEqual(first, second, msg=None)¶
Test that first and second are equal.  If the values do not
compare equal, the test will fail.
In addition, if first and second are the exact same type and one of
list, tuple, dict, set, frozenset or str or any type that a subclass
registers with addTypeEqualityFunc() the type-specific equality
function will be called in order to generate a more useful default
error message (see also the list of type-specific methods).

Changed in version 3.1: Added the automatic calling of type-specific equality function.


Changed in version 3.2: assertMultiLineEqual() added as the default type equality
function for comparing strings.




assertNotEqual(first, second, msg=None)¶
Test that first and second are not equal.  If the values do
compare equal, the test will fail.



assertTrue(expr, msg=None)¶

assertFalse(expr, msg=None)¶
Test that expr is true (or false).
Note that this is equivalent to bool(expr) is True and not to expr
is True (use assertIs(expr, True) for the latter).  This method
should also be avoided when more specific methods are available (e.g.
assertEqual(a, b) instead of assertTrue(a == b)), because they
provide a better error message in case of failure.



assertIs(first, second, msg=None)¶

assertIsNot(first, second, msg=None)¶
Test that first and second evaluate (or don’t evaluate) to the
same object.

New in version 3.1.




assertIsNone(expr, msg=None)¶

assertIsNotNone(expr, msg=None)¶
Test that expr is (or is not) None.

New in version 3.1.




assertIn(first, second, msg=None)¶

assertNotIn(first, second, msg=None)¶
Test that first is (or is not) in second.

New in version 3.1.




assertIsInstance(obj, cls, msg=None)¶

assertNotIsInstance(obj, cls, msg=None)¶
Test that obj is (or is not) an instance of cls (which can be a
class or a tuple of classes, as supported by isinstance()).
To check for the exact type, use assertIs(type(obj), cls).

New in version 3.2.


It is also possible to check the production of exceptions, warnings, and
log messages using the following methods:







Method
Checks that
New in



assertRaises(exc, fun, *args, **kwds)
fun(*args, **kwds) raises exc
 

assertRaisesRegex(exc, r, fun, *args, **kwds)
fun(*args, **kwds) raises exc
and the message matches regex r
3.1

assertWarns(warn, fun, *args, **kwds)
fun(*args, **kwds) raises warn
3.2

assertWarnsRegex(warn, r, fun, *args, **kwds)
fun(*args, **kwds) raises warn
and the message matches regex r
3.2

assertLogs(logger, level)
The with block logs on logger
with minimum level
3.4





assertRaises(exception, callable, *args, **kwds)¶

assertRaises(exception, *, msg=None)
Test that an exception is raised when callable is called with any
positional or keyword arguments that are also passed to
assertRaises().  The test passes if exception is raised, is an
error if another exception is raised, or fails if no exception is raised.
To catch any of a group of exceptions, a tuple containing the exception
classes may be passed as exception.
If only the exception and possibly the msg arguments are given,
return a context manager so that the code under test can be written
inline rather than as a function:
with self.assertRaises(SomeException):
    do_something()


When used as a context manager, assertRaises() accepts the
additional keyword argument msg.
The context manager will store the caught exception object in its
exception attribute.  This can be useful if the intention
is to perform additional checks on the exception raised:
with self.assertRaises(SomeException) as cm:
    do_something()

the_exception = cm.exception
self.assertEqual(the_exception.error_code, 3)



Changed in version 3.1: Added the ability to use assertRaises() as a context manager.


Changed in version 3.2: Added the exception attribute.


Changed in version 3.3: Added the msg keyword argument when used as a context manager.




assertRaisesRegex(exception, regex, callable, *args, **kwds)¶

assertRaisesRegex(exception, regex, *, msg=None)
Like assertRaises() but also tests that regex matches
on the string representation of the raised exception.  regex may be
a regular expression object or a string containing a regular expression
suitable for use by re.search().  Examples:
self.assertRaisesRegex(ValueError, "invalid literal for.*XYZ'$",
                       int, 'XYZ')


or:
with self.assertRaisesRegex(ValueError, 'literal'):
   int('XYZ')



New in version 3.1: Added under the name assertRaisesRegexp.


Changed in version 3.2: Renamed to assertRaisesRegex().


Changed in version 3.3: Added the msg keyword argument when used as a context manager.




assertWarns(warning, callable, *args, **kwds)¶

assertWarns(warning, *, msg=None)
Test that a warning is triggered when callable is called with any
positional or keyword arguments that are also passed to
assertWarns().  The test passes if warning is triggered and
fails if it isn’t.  Any exception is an error.
To catch any of a group of warnings, a tuple containing the warning
classes may be passed as warnings.
If only the warning and possibly the msg arguments are given,
return a context manager so that the code under test can be written
inline rather than as a function:
with self.assertWarns(SomeWarning):
    do_something()


When used as a context manager, assertWarns() accepts the
additional keyword argument msg.
The context manager will store the caught warning object in its
warning attribute, and the source line which triggered the
warnings in the filename and lineno attributes.
This can be useful if the intention is to perform additional checks
on the warning caught:
with self.assertWarns(SomeWarning) as cm:
    do_something()

self.assertIn('myfile.py', cm.filename)
self.assertEqual(320, cm.lineno)


This method works regardless of the warning filters in place when it
is called.

New in version 3.2.


Changed in version 3.3: Added the msg keyword argument when used as a context manager.




assertWarnsRegex(warning, regex, callable, *args, **kwds)¶

assertWarnsRegex(warning, regex, *, msg=None)
Like assertWarns() but also tests that regex matches on the
message of the triggered warning.  regex may be a regular expression
object or a string containing a regular expression suitable for use
by re.search().  Example:
self.assertWarnsRegex(DeprecationWarning,
                      r'legacy_function\(\) is deprecated',
                      legacy_function, 'XYZ')


or:
with self.assertWarnsRegex(RuntimeWarning, 'unsafe frobnicating'):
    frobnicate('/etc/passwd')



New in version 3.2.


Changed in version 3.3: Added the msg keyword argument when used as a context manager.




assertLogs(logger=None, level=None)¶
A context manager to test that at least one message is logged on
the logger or one of its children, with at least the given
level.
If given, logger should be a logging.Logger object or a
str giving the name of a logger.  The default is the root
logger, which will catch all messages.
If given, level should be either a numeric logging level or
its string equivalent (for example either "ERROR" or
logging.ERROR).  The default is logging.INFO.
The test passes if at least one message emitted inside the with
block matches the logger and level conditions, otherwise it fails.
The object returned by the context manager is a recording helper
which keeps tracks of the matching log messages.  It has two
attributes:


records¶
A list of logging.LogRecord objects of the matching
log messages.



output¶
A list of str objects with the formatted output of
matching messages.

Example:
with self.assertLogs('foo', level='INFO') as cm:
   logging.getLogger('foo').info('first message')
   logging.getLogger('foo.bar').error('second message')
self.assertEqual(cm.output, ['INFO:foo:first message',
                             'ERROR:foo.bar:second message'])



New in version 3.4.


There are also other methods used to perform more specific checks, such as:







Method
Checks that
New in



assertAlmostEqual(a, b)
round(a-b, 7) == 0
 

assertNotAlmostEqual(a, b)
round(a-b, 7) != 0
 

assertGreater(a, b)
a > b
3.1

assertGreaterEqual(a, b)
a >= b
3.1

assertLess(a, b)
a < b
3.1

assertLessEqual(a, b)
a <= b
3.1

assertRegex(s, r)
r.search(s)
3.1

assertNotRegex(s, r)
not r.search(s)
3.2

assertCountEqual(a, b)
a and b have the same
elements in the same number,
regardless of their order.
3.2





assertAlmostEqual(first, second, places=7, msg=None, delta=None)¶

assertNotAlmostEqual(first, second, places=7, msg=None, delta=None)¶
Test that first and second are approximately (or not approximately)
equal by computing the difference, rounding to the given number of
decimal places (default 7), and comparing to zero.  Note that these
methods round the values to the given number of decimal places (i.e.
like the round() function) and not significant digits.
If delta is supplied instead of places then the difference
between first and second must be less or equal to (or greater than) delta.
Supplying both delta and places raises a TypeError.

Changed in version 3.2: assertAlmostEqual() automatically considers almost equal objects
that compare equal.  assertNotAlmostEqual() automatically fails
if the objects compare equal.  Added the delta keyword argument.




assertGreater(first, second, msg=None)¶

assertGreaterEqual(first, second, msg=None)¶

assertLess(first, second, msg=None)¶

assertLessEqual(first, second, msg=None)¶
Test that first is respectively >, >=, < or <= than second depending
on the method name.  If not, the test will fail:
>>> self.assertGreaterEqual(3, 4)
AssertionError: "3" unexpectedly not greater than or equal to "4"



New in version 3.1.




assertRegex(text, regex, msg=None)¶

assertNotRegex(text, regex, msg=None)¶
Test that a regex search matches (or does not match) text.  In case
of failure, the error message will include the pattern and the text (or
the pattern and the part of text that unexpectedly matched).  regex
may be a regular expression object or a string containing a regular
expression suitable for use by re.search().

New in version 3.1: Added under the name assertRegexpMatches.


Changed in version 3.2: The method assertRegexpMatches() has been renamed to
assertRegex().


New in version 3.2: assertNotRegex().


New in version 3.5: The name assertNotRegexpMatches is a deprecated alias
for assertNotRegex().




assertCountEqual(first, second, msg=None)¶
Test that sequence first contains the same elements as second,
regardless of their order. When they don’t, an error message listing the
differences between the sequences will be generated.
Duplicate elements are not ignored when comparing first and
second. It verifies whether each element has the same count in both
sequences. Equivalent to:
assertEqual(Counter(list(first)), Counter(list(second)))
but works with sequences of unhashable objects as well.

New in version 3.2.


The assertEqual() method dispatches the equality check for objects of
the same type to different type-specific methods.  These methods are already
implemented for most of the built-in types, but it’s also possible to
register new methods using addTypeEqualityFunc():


addTypeEqualityFunc(typeobj, function)¶
Registers a type-specific method called by assertEqual() to check
if two objects of exactly the same typeobj (not subclasses) compare
equal.  function must take two positional arguments and a third msg=None
keyword argument just as assertEqual() does.  It must raise
self.failureException(msg) when inequality
between the first two parameters is detected – possibly providing useful
information and explaining the inequalities in details in the error
message.

New in version 3.1.


The list of type-specific methods automatically used by
assertEqual() are summarized in the following table.  Note
that it’s usually not necessary to invoke these methods directly.







Method
Used to compare
New in



assertMultiLineEqual(a, b)
strings
3.1

assertSequenceEqual(a, b)
sequences
3.1

assertListEqual(a, b)

3.1

assertTupleEqual(a, b)

assertSetEqual(a, b)
sets or frozensets
3.1

assertDictEqual(a, b)
dicts
3.1





assertMultiLineEqual(first, second, msg=None)¶
Test that the multiline string first is equal to the string second.
When not equal a diff of the two strings highlighting the differences
will be included in the error message. This method is used by default
when comparing strings with assertEqual().

New in version 3.1.




assertSequenceEqual(first, second, msg=None, seq_type=None)¶
Tests that two sequences are equal.  If a seq_type is supplied, both
first and second must be instances of seq_type or a failure will
be raised.  If the sequences are different an error message is
constructed that shows the difference between the two.
This method is not called directly by assertEqual(), but
it’s used to implement assertListEqual() and
assertTupleEqual().

New in version 3.1.




assertListEqual(first, second, msg=None)¶

assertTupleEqual(first, second, msg=None)¶
Tests that two lists or tuples are equal.  If not, an error message is
constructed that shows only the differences between the two.  An error
is also raised if either of the parameters are of the wrong type.
These methods are used by default when comparing lists or tuples with
assertEqual().

New in version 3.1.




assertSetEqual(first, second, msg=None)¶
Tests that two sets are equal.  If not, an error message is constructed
that lists the differences between the sets.  This method is used by
default when comparing sets or frozensets with assertEqual().
Fails if either of first or second does not have a set.difference()
method.

New in version 3.1.




assertDictEqual(first, second, msg=None)¶
Test that two dictionaries are equal.  If not, an error message is
constructed that shows the differences in the dictionaries. This
method will be used by default to compare dictionaries in
calls to assertEqual().

New in version 3.1.


Finally the TestCase provides the following methods and attributes:


fail(msg=None)¶
Signals a test failure unconditionally, with msg or None for
the error message.



failureException¶
This class attribute gives the exception raised by the test method.  If a
test framework needs to use a specialized exception, possibly to carry
additional information, it must subclass this exception in order to “play
fair” with the framework.  The initial value of this attribute is
AssertionError.



longMessage¶
This class attribute determines what happens when a custom failure message
is passed as the msg argument to an assertXYY call that fails.
True is the default value. In this case, the custom message is appended
to the end of the standard failure message.
When set to False, the custom message replaces the standard message.
The class setting can be overridden in individual test methods by assigning
an instance attribute, self.longMessage, to True or False before
calling the assert methods.
The class setting gets reset before each test call.

New in version 3.1.




maxDiff¶
This attribute controls the maximum length of diffs output by assert
methods that report diffs on failure. It defaults to 80*8 characters.
Assert methods affected by this attribute are
assertSequenceEqual() (including all the sequence comparison
methods that delegate to it), assertDictEqual() and
assertMultiLineEqual().
Setting maxDiff to None means that there is no maximum length of
diffs.

New in version 3.2.


Testing frameworks can use the following methods to collect information on
the test:


countTestCases()¶
Return the number of tests represented by this test object.  For
TestCase instances, this will always be 1.



defaultTestResult()¶
Return an instance of the test result class that should be used for this
test case class (if no other result instance is provided to the
run() method).
For TestCase instances, this will always be an instance of
TestResult; subclasses of TestCase should override this
as necessary.



id()¶
Return a string identifying the specific test case.  This is usually the
full name of the test method, including the module and class name.



shortDescription()¶
Returns a description of the test, or None if no description
has been provided.  The default implementation of this method
returns the first line of the test method’s docstring, if available,
or None.

Changed in version 3.1: In 3.1 this was changed to add the test name to the short description
even in the presence of a docstring.  This caused compatibility issues
with unittest extensions and adding the test name was moved to the
TextTestResult in Python 3.2.




addCleanup(function, *args, **kwargs)¶
Add a function to be called after tearDown() to cleanup resources
used during the test. Functions will be called in reverse order to the
order they are added (LIFO).  They
are called with any arguments and keyword arguments passed into
addCleanup() when they are added.
If setUp() fails, meaning that tearDown() is not called,
then any cleanup functions added will still be called.

New in version 3.1.




doCleanups()¶
This method is called unconditionally after tearDown(), or
after setUp() if setUp() raises an exception.
It is responsible for calling all the cleanup functions added by
addCleanup(). If you need cleanup functions to be called
prior to tearDown() then you can call doCleanups()
yourself.
doCleanups() pops methods off the stack of cleanup
functions one at a time, so it can be called at any time.

New in version 3.1.





class unittest.FunctionTestCase(testFunc, setUp=None, tearDown=None, description=None)¶
This class implements the portion of the TestCase interface which
allows the test runner to drive the test, but does not provide the methods
which test code can use to check and report errors.  This is used to create
test cases using legacy test code, allowing it to be integrated into a
unittest-based test framework.


Deprecated aliases¶
For historical reasons, some of the TestCase methods had one or more
aliases that are now deprecated.  The following table lists the correct names
along with their deprecated aliases:

Deprecated since version 3.1: The fail* aliases listed in the second column have been deprecated.


Deprecated since version 3.2: The assert* aliases listed in the third column have been deprecated.


Deprecated since version 3.2: assertRegexpMatches and assertRaisesRegexp have been renamed to
assertRegex() and assertRaisesRegex().


Deprecated since version 3.5: The assertNotRegexpMatches name is deprecated in favor of assertNotRegex().





Grouping tests¶


class unittest.TestSuite(tests=())¶
This class represents an aggregation of individual test cases and test suites.
The class presents the interface needed by the test runner to allow it to be run
as any other test case.  Running a TestSuite instance is the same as
iterating over the suite, running each test individually.
If tests is given, it must be an iterable of individual test cases or other
test suites that will be used to build the suite initially. Additional methods
are provided to add test cases and suites to the collection later on.
TestSuite objects behave much like TestCase objects, except
they do not actually implement a test.  Instead, they are used to aggregate
tests into groups of tests that should be run together. Some additional
methods are available to add tests to TestSuite instances:


addTest(test)¶
Add a TestCase or TestSuite to the suite.



addTests(tests)¶
Add all the tests from an iterable of TestCase and TestSuite
instances to this test suite.
This is equivalent to iterating over tests, calling addTest() for
each element.

TestSuite shares the following methods with TestCase:


run(result)¶
Run the tests associated with this suite, collecting the result into the
test result object passed as result.  Note that unlike
TestCase.run(), TestSuite.run() requires the result object to
be passed in.



debug()¶
Run the tests associated with this suite without collecting the
result. This allows exceptions raised by the test to be propagated to the
caller and can be used to support running tests under a debugger.



countTestCases()¶
Return the number of tests represented by this test object, including all
individual tests and sub-suites.



__iter__()¶
Tests grouped by a TestSuite are always accessed by iteration.
Subclasses can lazily provide tests by overriding __iter__(). Note
that this method may be called several times on a single suite (for
example when counting tests or comparing for equality) so the tests
returned by repeated iterations before TestSuite.run() must be the
same for each call iteration. After TestSuite.run(), callers should
not rely on the tests returned by this method unless the caller uses a
subclass that overrides TestSuite._removeTestAtIndex() to preserve
test references.

Changed in version 3.2: In earlier versions the TestSuite accessed tests directly rather
than through iteration, so overriding __iter__() wasn’t sufficient
for providing tests.


Changed in version 3.4: In earlier versions the TestSuite held references to each
TestCase after TestSuite.run(). Subclasses can restore
that behavior by overriding TestSuite._removeTestAtIndex().


In the typical usage of a TestSuite object, the run() method
is invoked by a TestRunner rather than by the end-user test harness.



Loading and running tests¶


class unittest.TestLoader¶
The TestLoader class is used to create test suites from classes and
modules.  Normally, there is no need to create an instance of this class; the
unittest module provides an instance that can be shared as
unittest.defaultTestLoader.  Using a subclass or instance, however,
allows customization of some configurable properties.
TestLoader objects have the following attributes:


errors¶
A list of the non-fatal errors encountered while loading tests. Not reset
by the loader at any point. Fatal errors are signalled by the relevant
a method raising an exception to the caller. Non-fatal errors are also
indicated by a synthetic test that will raise the original error when
run.

New in version 3.5.


TestLoader objects have the following methods:


loadTestsFromTestCase(testCaseClass)¶
Return a suite of all test cases contained in the TestCase-derived
testCaseClass.
A test case instance is created for each method named by
getTestCaseNames(). By default these are the method names
beginning with test. If getTestCaseNames() returns no
methods, but the runTest() method is implemented, a single test
case is created for that method instead.



loadTestsFromModule(module, pattern=None)¶
Return a suite of all test cases contained in the given module. This
method searches module for classes derived from TestCase and
creates an instance of the class for each test method defined for the
class.

Note
While using a hierarchy of TestCase-derived classes can be
convenient in sharing fixtures and helper functions, defining test
methods on base classes that are not intended to be instantiated
directly does not play well with this method.  Doing so, however, can
be useful when the fixtures are different and defined in subclasses.

If a module provides a load_tests function it will be called to
load the tests. This allows modules to customize test loading.
This is the load_tests protocol.  The pattern argument is passed as
the third argument to load_tests.

Changed in version 3.2: Support for load_tests added.


Changed in version 3.5: The undocumented and unofficial use_load_tests default argument is
deprecated and ignored, although it is still accepted for backward
compatibility.  The method also now accepts a keyword-only argument
pattern which is passed to load_tests as the third argument.




loadTestsFromName(name, module=None)¶
Return a suite of all test cases given a string specifier.
The specifier name is a “dotted name” that may resolve either to a
module, a test case class, a test method within a test case class, a
TestSuite instance, or a callable object which returns a
TestCase or TestSuite instance.  These checks are
applied in the order listed here; that is, a method on a possible test
case class will be picked up as “a test method within a test case class”,
rather than “a callable object”.
For example, if you have a module SampleTests containing a
TestCase-derived class SampleTestCase with three test
methods (test_one(), test_two(), and test_three()), the
specifier 'SampleTests.SampleTestCase' would cause this method to
return a suite which will run all three test methods. Using the specifier
'SampleTests.SampleTestCase.test_two' would cause it to return a test
suite which will run only the test_two() test method. The specifier
can refer to modules and packages which have not been imported; they will
be imported as a side-effect.
The method optionally resolves name relative to the given module.

Changed in version 3.5: If an ImportError or AttributeError occurs while traversing
name then a synthetic test that raises that error when run will be
returned. These errors are included in the errors accumulated by
self.errors.




loadTestsFromNames(names, module=None)¶
Similar to loadTestsFromName(), but takes a sequence of names rather
than a single name.  The return value is a test suite which supports all
the tests defined for each name.



getTestCaseNames(testCaseClass)¶
Return a sorted sequence of method names found within testCaseClass;
this should be a subclass of TestCase.



discover(start_dir, pattern='test*.py', top_level_dir=None)¶
Find all the test modules by recursing into subdirectories from the
specified start directory, and return a TestSuite object containing them.
Only test files that match pattern will be loaded. (Using shell style
pattern matching.) Only module names that are importable (i.e. are valid
Python identifiers) will be loaded.
All test modules must be importable from the top level of the project. If
the start directory is not the top level directory then the top level
directory must be specified separately.
If importing a module fails, for example due to a syntax error, then
this will be recorded as a single error and discovery will continue.  If
the import failure is due to SkipTest being raised, it will be
recorded as a skip instead of an error.
If a package (a directory containing a file named __init__.py) is
found, the package will be checked for a load_tests function. If this
exists then it will be called
package.load_tests(loader, tests, pattern). Test discovery takes care
to ensure that a package is only checked for tests once during an
invocation, even if the load_tests function itself calls
loader.discover.
If load_tests exists then discovery does not recurse into the
package, load_tests is responsible for loading all tests in the
package.
The pattern is deliberately not stored as a loader attribute so that
packages can continue discovery themselves. top_level_dir is stored so
load_tests does not need to pass this argument in to
loader.discover().
start_dir can be a dotted module name as well as a directory.

New in version 3.2.


Changed in version 3.4: Modules that raise SkipTest on import are recorded as skips,
  not errors.
Discovery works for namespace packages.
Paths are sorted before being imported so that execution order is
  the same even if the underlying file system’s ordering is not
  dependent on file name.


Changed in version 3.5: Found packages are now checked for load_tests regardless of
whether their path matches pattern, because it is impossible for
a package name to match the default pattern.


The following attributes of a TestLoader can be configured either by
subclassing or assignment on an instance:


testMethodPrefix¶
String giving the prefix of method names which will be interpreted as test
methods.  The default value is 'test'.
This affects getTestCaseNames() and all the loadTestsFrom*()
methods.



sortTestMethodsUsing¶
Function to be used to compare method names when sorting them in
getTestCaseNames() and all the loadTestsFrom*() methods.



suiteClass¶
Callable object that constructs a test suite from a list of tests. No
methods on the resulting object are needed.  The default value is the
TestSuite class.
This affects all the loadTestsFrom*() methods.



testNamePatterns¶
List of Unix shell-style wildcard test name patterns that test methods
have to match to be included in test suites (see -v option).
If this attribute is not None (the default), all test methods to be
included in test suites must match one of the patterns in this list.
Note that matches are always performed using fnmatch.fnmatchcase(),
so unlike patterns passed to the -v option, simple substring patterns
will have to be converted using * wildcards.
This affects all the loadTestsFrom*() methods.

New in version 3.7.





class unittest.TestResult¶
This class is used to compile information about which tests have succeeded
and which have failed.
A TestResult object stores the results of a set of tests.  The
TestCase and TestSuite classes ensure that results are
properly recorded; test authors do not need to worry about recording the
outcome of tests.
Testing frameworks built on top of unittest may want access to the
TestResult object generated by running a set of tests for reporting
purposes; a TestResult instance is returned by the
TestRunner.run() method for this purpose.
TestResult instances have the following attributes that will be of
interest when inspecting the results of running a set of tests:


errors¶
A list containing 2-tuples of TestCase instances and strings
holding formatted tracebacks. Each tuple represents a test which raised an
unexpected exception.



failures¶
A list containing 2-tuples of TestCase instances and strings
holding formatted tracebacks. Each tuple represents a test where a failure
was explicitly signalled using the TestCase.assert*() methods.



skipped¶
A list containing 2-tuples of TestCase instances and strings
holding the reason for skipping the test.

New in version 3.1.




expectedFailures¶
A list containing 2-tuples of TestCase instances and strings
holding formatted tracebacks.  Each tuple represents an expected failure
of the test case.



unexpectedSuccesses¶
A list containing TestCase instances that were marked as expected
failures, but succeeded.



shouldStop¶
Set to True when the execution of tests should stop by stop().



testsRun¶
The total number of tests run so far.



buffer¶
If set to true, sys.stdout and sys.stderr will be buffered in between
startTest() and stopTest() being called. Collected output will
only be echoed onto the real sys.stdout and sys.stderr if the test
fails or errors. Any output is also attached to the failure / error message.

New in version 3.2.




failfast¶
If set to true stop() will be called on the first failure or error,
halting the test run.

New in version 3.2.




tb_locals¶
If set to true then local variables will be shown in tracebacks.

New in version 3.5.




wasSuccessful()¶
Return True if all tests run so far have passed, otherwise returns
False.

Changed in version 3.4: Returns False if there were any unexpectedSuccesses
from tests marked with the expectedFailure() decorator.




stop()¶
This method can be called to signal that the set of tests being run should
be aborted by setting the shouldStop attribute to True.
TestRunner objects should respect this flag and return without
running any additional tests.
For example, this feature is used by the TextTestRunner class to
stop the test framework when the user signals an interrupt from the
keyboard.  Interactive tools which provide TestRunner
implementations can use this in a similar manner.

The following methods of the TestResult class are used to maintain
the internal data structures, and may be extended in subclasses to support
additional reporting requirements.  This is particularly useful in building
tools which support interactive reporting while tests are being run.


startTest(test)¶
Called when the test case test is about to be run.



stopTest(test)¶
Called after the test case test has been executed, regardless of the
outcome.



startTestRun()¶
Called once before any tests are executed.

New in version 3.1.




stopTestRun()¶
Called once after all tests are executed.

New in version 3.1.




addError(test, err)¶
Called when the test case test raises an unexpected exception. err is a
tuple of the form returned by sys.exc_info(): (type, value,
traceback).
The default implementation appends a tuple (test, formatted_err) to
the instance’s errors attribute, where formatted_err is a
formatted traceback derived from err.



addFailure(test, err)¶
Called when the test case test signals a failure. err is a tuple of
the form returned by sys.exc_info(): (type, value, traceback).
The default implementation appends a tuple (test, formatted_err) to
the instance’s failures attribute, where formatted_err is a
formatted traceback derived from err.



addSuccess(test)¶
Called when the test case test succeeds.
The default implementation does nothing.



addSkip(test, reason)¶
Called when the test case test is skipped.  reason is the reason the
test gave for skipping.
The default implementation appends a tuple (test, reason) to the
instance’s skipped attribute.



addExpectedFailure(test, err)¶
Called when the test case test fails, but was marked with the
expectedFailure() decorator.
The default implementation appends a tuple (test, formatted_err) to
the instance’s expectedFailures attribute, where formatted_err
is a formatted traceback derived from err.



addUnexpectedSuccess(test)¶
Called when the test case test was marked with the
expectedFailure() decorator, but succeeded.
The default implementation appends the test to the instance’s
unexpectedSuccesses attribute.



addSubTest(test, subtest, outcome)¶
Called when a subtest finishes.  test is the test case
corresponding to the test method.  subtest is a custom
TestCase instance describing the subtest.
If outcome is None, the subtest succeeded.  Otherwise,
it failed with an exception where outcome is a tuple of the form
returned by sys.exc_info(): (type, value, traceback).
The default implementation does nothing when the outcome is a
success, and records subtest failures as normal failures.

New in version 3.4.





class unittest.TextTestResult(stream, descriptions, verbosity)¶
A concrete implementation of TestResult used by the
TextTestRunner.

New in version 3.2: This class was previously named _TextTestResult. The old name still
exists as an alias but is deprecated.




unittest.defaultTestLoader¶
Instance of the TestLoader class intended to be shared.  If no
customization of the TestLoader is needed, this instance can be used
instead of repeatedly creating new instances.



class unittest.TextTestRunner(stream=None, descriptions=True, verbosity=1, failfast=False, buffer=False, resultclass=None, warnings=None, *, tb_locals=False)¶
A basic test runner implementation that outputs results to a stream. If stream
is None, the default, sys.stderr is used as the output stream. This class
has a few configurable parameters, but is essentially very simple.  Graphical
applications which run test suites should provide alternate implementations. Such
implementations should accept **kwargs as the interface to construct runners
changes when features are added to unittest.
By default this runner shows DeprecationWarning,
PendingDeprecationWarning, ResourceWarning and
ImportWarning even if they are ignored by default. Deprecation warnings caused by deprecated unittest
methods are also special-cased and, when the warning
filters are 'default' or 'always', they will appear only once
per-module, in order to avoid too many warning messages.  This behavior can
be overridden using Python’s -Wd or -Wa options
(see Warning control) and leaving
warnings to None.

Changed in version 3.2: Added the warnings argument.


Changed in version 3.2: The default stream is set to sys.stderr at instantiation time rather
than import time.


Changed in version 3.5: Added the tb_locals parameter.



_makeResult()¶
This method returns the instance of TestResult used by run().
It is not intended to be called directly, but can be overridden in
subclasses to provide a custom TestResult.
_makeResult() instantiates the class or callable passed in the
TextTestRunner constructor as the resultclass argument. It
defaults to TextTestResult if no resultclass is provided.
The result class is instantiated with the following arguments:
stream, descriptions, verbosity





run(test)¶
This method is the main public interface to the TextTestRunner. This
method takes a TestSuite or TestCase instance. A
TestResult is created by calling
_makeResult() and the test(s) are run and the
results printed to stdout.




unittest.main(module='__main__', defaultTest=None, argv=None, testRunner=None, testLoader=unittest.defaultTestLoader, exit=True, verbosity=1, failfast=None, catchbreak=None, buffer=None, warnings=None)¶
A command-line program that loads a set of tests from module and runs them;
this is primarily for making test modules conveniently executable.
The simplest use for this function is to include the following line at the
end of a test script:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()


You can run tests with more detailed information by passing in the verbosity
argument:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main(verbosity=2)


The defaultTest argument is either the name of a single test or an
iterable of test names to run if no test names are specified via argv.  If
not specified or None and no test names are provided via argv, all
tests found in module are run.
The argv argument can be a list of options passed to the program, with the
first element being the program name.  If not specified or None,
the values of sys.argv are used.
The testRunner argument can either be a test runner class or an already
created instance of it. By default main calls sys.exit() with
an exit code indicating success or failure of the tests run.
The testLoader argument has to be a TestLoader instance,
and defaults to defaultTestLoader.
main supports being used from the interactive interpreter by passing in the
argument exit=False. This displays the result on standard output without
calling sys.exit():
>>> from unittest import main
>>> main(module='test_module', exit=False)


The failfast, catchbreak and buffer parameters have the same
effect as the same-name command-line options.
The warnings argument specifies the warning filter
that should be used while running the tests.  If it’s not specified, it will
remain None if a -W option is passed to python
(see Warning control),
otherwise it will be set to 'default'.
Calling main actually returns an instance of the TestProgram class.
This stores the result of the tests run as the result attribute.

Changed in version 3.1: The exit parameter was added.


Changed in version 3.2: The verbosity, failfast, catchbreak, buffer
and warnings parameters were added.


Changed in version 3.4: The defaultTest parameter was changed to also accept an iterable of
test names.



load_tests Protocol¶

New in version 3.2.

Modules or packages can customize how tests are loaded from them during normal
test runs or test discovery by implementing a function called load_tests.
If a test module defines load_tests it will be called by
TestLoader.loadTestsFromModule() with the following arguments:
load_tests(loader, standard_tests, pattern)


where pattern is passed straight through from loadTestsFromModule.  It
defaults to None.
It should return a TestSuite.
loader is the instance of TestLoader doing the loading.
standard_tests are the tests that would be loaded by default from the
module. It is common for test modules to only want to add or remove tests
from the standard set of tests.
The third argument is used when loading packages as part of test discovery.
A typical load_tests function that loads tests from a specific set of
TestCase classes may look like:
test_cases = (TestCase1, TestCase2, TestCase3)

def load_tests(loader, tests, pattern):
    suite = TestSuite()
    for test_class in test_cases:
        tests = loader.loadTestsFromTestCase(test_class)
        suite.addTests(tests)
    return suite


If discovery is started in a directory containing a package, either from the
command line or by calling TestLoader.discover(), then the package
__init__.py will be checked for load_tests.  If that function does
not exist, discovery will recurse into the package as though it were just
another directory.  Otherwise, discovery of the package’s tests will be left up
to load_tests which is called with the following arguments:
load_tests(loader, standard_tests, pattern)


This should return a TestSuite representing all the tests
from the package. (standard_tests will only contain tests
collected from __init__.py.)
Because the pattern is passed into load_tests the package is free to
continue (and potentially modify) test discovery. A ‘do nothing’
load_tests function for a test package would look like:
def load_tests(loader, standard_tests, pattern):
    # top level directory cached on loader instance
    this_dir = os.path.dirname(__file__)
    package_tests = loader.discover(start_dir=this_dir, pattern=pattern)
    standard_tests.addTests(package_tests)
    return standard_tests



Changed in version 3.5: Discovery no longer checks package names for matching pattern due to the
impossibility of package names matching the default pattern.
