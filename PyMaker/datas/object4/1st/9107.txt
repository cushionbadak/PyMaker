statistics(key_type: str, cumulative: bool=False)Â¶
Get statistics as a sorted list of Statistic instances grouped
by key_type:






key_type
description



'filename'
filename

'lineno'
filename and line number

'traceback'
traceback



If cumulative is True, cumulate size and count of memory blocks of
all frames of the traceback of a trace, not only the most recent frame.
The cumulative mode can only be used with key_type equals to
'filename' and 'lineno'.
The result is sorted from the biggest to the smallest by:
Statistic.size, Statistic.count and then by
Statistic.traceback.
