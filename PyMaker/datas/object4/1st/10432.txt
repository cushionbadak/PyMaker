termios.tcsetattr(fd, when, attributes)Â¶
Set the tty attributes for file descriptor fd from the attributes, which is
a list like the one returned by tcgetattr().  The when argument
determines when the attributes are changed: TCSANOW to change
immediately, TCSADRAIN to change after transmitting all queued output,
or TCSAFLUSH to change after transmitting all queued output and
discarding all queued input.
