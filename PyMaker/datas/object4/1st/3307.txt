readinto(b)Â¶
Read bytes into a pre-allocated, writable
bytes-like object b and return the number of bytes read.
For example, b might be a bytearray.
Like read(), multiple reads may be issued to the underlying raw
stream, unless the latter is interactive.
A BlockingIOError is raised if the underlying raw stream is in non
blocking-mode, and has no data available at the moment.
