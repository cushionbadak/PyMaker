safe_substitute(mapping, **kwds)¶
Like substitute(), except that if placeholders are missing from
mapping and kwds, instead of raising a KeyError exception, the
original placeholder will appear in the resulting string intact.  Also,
unlike with substitute(), any other appearances of the $ will
simply return $ instead of raising ValueError.
While other exceptions may still occur, this method is called “safe”
because it always tries to return a usable string instead of
raising an exception.  In another sense, safe_substitute() may be
anything other than safe, since it will silently ignore malformed
templates containing dangling delimiters, unmatched braces, or
placeholders that are not valid Python identifiers.
