handle_expect_100()Â¶
When a HTTP/1.1 compliant server receives an Expect: 100-continue
request header it responds back with a 100 Continue followed by 200
OK headers.
This method can be overridden to raise an error if the server does not
want the client to continue.  For e.g. server can chose to send 417
Expectation Failed as a response header and return False.

New in version 3.2.
