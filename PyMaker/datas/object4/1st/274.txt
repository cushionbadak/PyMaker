7.13. The nonlocal statementÂ¶

nonlocal_stmt ::=  "nonlocal" identifier ("," identifier)*

The nonlocal statement causes the listed identifiers to refer to
previously bound variables in the nearest enclosing scope excluding globals.
This is important because the default behavior for binding is to search the
local namespace first.  The statement allows encapsulated code to rebind
variables outside of the local scope besides the global (module) scope.
Names listed in a nonlocal statement, unlike those listed in a
global statement, must refer to pre-existing bindings in an
enclosing scope (the scope in which a new binding should be created cannot
be determined unambiguously).
Names listed in a nonlocal statement must not collide with
pre-existing bindings in the local scope.
