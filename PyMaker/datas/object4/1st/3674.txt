getpass.getpass(prompt='Password: ', stream=None)Â¶
Prompt the user for a password without echoing.  The user is prompted using
the string prompt, which defaults to 'Password: '.  On Unix, the
prompt is written to the file-like object stream using the replace error
handler if needed.  stream defaults to the controlling terminal
(/dev/tty) or if that is unavailable to sys.stderr (this
argument is ignored on Windows).
If echo free input is unavailable getpass() falls back to printing
a warning message to stream and reading from sys.stdin and
issuing a GetPassWarning.

Note
If you call getpass from within IDLE, the input may be done in the
terminal you launched IDLE from rather than the idle window itself.
