class email.mime.nonmultipart.MIMENonMultipartÂ¶
Module: email.mime.nonmultipart
A subclass of MIMEBase, this is an intermediate base
class for MIME messages that are not multipart.  The primary
purpose of this class is to prevent the use of the
attach() method, which only makes sense for
multipart messages.  If attach()
is called, a MultipartConversionError exception is raised.
