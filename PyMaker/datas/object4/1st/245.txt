6.8. Shifting operationsÂ¶
The shifting operations have lower priority than the arithmetic operations:

shift_expr ::=  a_expr | shift_expr ("<<" | ">>") a_expr

These operators accept integers as arguments.  They shift the first argument to
the left or right by the number of bits given by the second argument.
A right shift by n bits is defined as floor division by pow(2,n).  A left
shift by n bits is defined as multiplication with pow(2,n).
