struct.iter_unpack(format, buffer)¶
Iteratively unpack from the buffer buffer according to the format
string format.  This function returns an iterator which will read
equally-sized chunks from the buffer until all its contents have been
consumed.  The buffer’s size in bytes must be a multiple of the size
required by the format, as reflected by calcsize().
Each iteration yields a tuple as specified by the format string.

New in version 3.4.
