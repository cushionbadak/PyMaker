SSLSocket.server_hostname¶
Hostname of the server: str type, or None for server-side
socket or if the hostname was not specified in the constructor.

New in version 3.2.


Changed in version 3.7: The attribute is now always ASCII text. When server_hostname is
an internationalized domain name (IDN), this attribute now stores the
A-label form ("xn--pythn-mua.org"), rather than the U-label form
("pythön.org").
