Multithreading¶
Older SQLite versions had issues with sharing connections between threads.
That’s why the Python module disallows sharing connections and cursors between
threads. If you still try to do so, you will get an exception at runtime.
The only exception is calling the interrupt() method, which
only makes sense to call from a different thread.

[1](1, 2) The sqlite3 module is not built with loadable extension support by
default, because some platforms (notably Mac OS X) have SQLite
libraries which are compiled without this feature. To get loadable
extension support, you must pass –enable-loadable-sqlite-extensions to
configure.
