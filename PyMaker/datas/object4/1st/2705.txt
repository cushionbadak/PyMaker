Writer Objects¶
Writer objects (DictWriter instances and objects returned by
the writer() function) have the following public methods.  A row must be
an iterable of strings or numbers for Writer objects and a dictionary
mapping fieldnames to strings or numbers (by passing them through str()
first) for DictWriter objects.  Note that complex numbers are written
out surrounded by parens. This may cause some problems for other programs which
read CSV files (assuming they support complex numbers at all).


csvwriter.writerow(row)¶
Write the row parameter to the writer’s file object, formatted according to
the current dialect.

Changed in version 3.5: Added support of arbitrary iterables.




csvwriter.writerows(rows)¶
Write all elements in rows (an iterable of row objects as described
above) to the writer’s file object, formatted according to the current
dialect.

Writer objects have the following public attribute:


csvwriter.dialect¶
A read-only description of the dialect in use by the writer.

DictWriter objects have the following public method:


DictWriter.writeheader()¶
Write a row with the field names (as specified in the constructor).

New in version 3.2.
