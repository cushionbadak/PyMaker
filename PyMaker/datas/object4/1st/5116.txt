socket.settimeout(value)Â¶
Set a timeout on blocking socket operations.  The value argument can be a
nonnegative floating point number expressing seconds, or None.
If a non-zero value is given, subsequent socket operations will raise a
timeout exception if the timeout period value has elapsed before
the operation has completed.  If zero is given, the socket is put in
non-blocking mode. If None is given, the socket is put in blocking mode.
For further information, please consult the notes on socket timeouts.

Changed in version 3.7: The method no longer toggles SOCK_NONBLOCK flag on
socket.type.
