HTMLParser.handle_comment(data)Â¶
This method is called when a comment is encountered (e.g. <!--comment-->).
For example, the comment <!-- comment --> will cause this method to be
called with the argument ' comment '.
The content of Internet Explorer conditional comments (condcoms) will also be
sent to this method, so, for <!--[if IE 9]>IE9-specific content<![endif]-->,
this method will receive '[if IE 9]>IE9-specific content<![endif]'.
