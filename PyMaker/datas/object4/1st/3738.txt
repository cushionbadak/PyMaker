curses.setupterm(term=None, fd=-1)Â¶
Initialize the terminal.  term is a string giving
the terminal name, or None; if omitted or None, the value of the
TERM environment variable will be used.  fd is the
file descriptor to which any initialization sequences will be sent; if not
supplied or -1, the file descriptor for sys.stdout will be used.
