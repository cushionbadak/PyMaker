audioop.findfit(fragment, reference)¶
Try to match reference as well as possible to a portion of fragment (which
should be the longer fragment).  This is (conceptually) done by taking slices
out of fragment, using findfactor() to compute the best match, and
minimizing the result.  The fragments should both contain 2-byte samples.
Return a tuple (offset, factor) where offset is the (integer) offset into
fragment where the optimal match started and factor is the (floating-point)
factor as per findfactor().
