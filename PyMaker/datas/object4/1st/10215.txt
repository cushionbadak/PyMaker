<dd><p>Create a new CAB file named <em>cabname</em>. <em>files</em> must be a list of tuples, each
containing the name of the file on disk, and the name of the file inside the CAB
file.</p>
<p>The files are added to the CAB file in the order they appear in the list. All
files are added into a single CAB file, using the MSZIP compression algorithm.</p>
<p>Callbacks to Python for the various steps of MSI creation are currently not
exposed.</p>
