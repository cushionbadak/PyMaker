msilib.FCICreate(cabname, files)Â¶
Create a new CAB file named cabname. files must be a list of tuples, each
containing the name of the file on disk, and the name of the file inside the CAB
file.
The files are added to the CAB file in the order they appear in the list. All
files are added into a single CAB file, using the MSZIP compression algorithm.
Callbacks to Python for the various steps of MSI creation are currently not
exposed.
