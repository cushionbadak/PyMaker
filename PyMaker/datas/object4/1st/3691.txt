curses.doupdate()Â¶
Update the physical screen.  The curses library keeps two data structures, one
representing the current physical screen contents and a virtual screen
representing the desired next state.  The doupdate() ground updates the
physical screen to match the virtual screen.
The virtual screen may be updated by a noutrefresh() call after write
operations such as addstr() have been performed on a window.  The normal
refresh() call is simply noutrefresh() followed by doupdate();
if you have to update multiple windows, you can speed performance and perhaps
reduce screen flicker by issuing noutrefresh() calls on all windows,
followed by a single doupdate().
