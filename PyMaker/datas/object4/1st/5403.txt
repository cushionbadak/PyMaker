<dd><p>Accept a connection.  The socket must be bound to an address and listening
for connections.  The return value can be either <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">None</span></code> or a pair
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">(conn,</span> <span class="pre">address)</span></code> where <em>conn</em> is a <em>new</em> socket object usable to send
and receive data on the connection, and <em>address</em> is the address bound to
the socket on the other end of the connection.
When <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">None</span></code> is returned it means the connection didn’t take place, in
which case the server should just ignore this event and keep listening
for further incoming connections.</p>
