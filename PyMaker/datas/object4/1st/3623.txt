DatagramHandler¶
The DatagramHandler class, located in the logging.handlers
module, inherits from SocketHandler to support sending logging messages
over UDP sockets.


class logging.handlers.DatagramHandler(host, port)¶
Returns a new instance of the DatagramHandler class intended to
communicate with a remote machine whose address is given by host and port.

Changed in version 3.4: If port is specified as None, a Unix domain socket is created
using the value in host - otherwise, a UDP socket is created.



emit()¶
Pickles the record’s attribute dictionary and writes it to the socket in
binary format. If there is an error with the socket, silently drops the
packet. To unpickle the record at the receiving end into a
LogRecord, use the makeLogRecord()
function.



makeSocket()¶
The factory method of SocketHandler is here overridden to create
a UDP socket (socket.SOCK_DGRAM).



send(s)¶
Send a pickled string to a socket.
