Base Protocol¶
All asyncio protocols can implement Base Protocol callbacks.
Connection Callbacks
Connection callbacks are called on all protocols, exactly once per
a successful connection.  All other protocol callbacks can only be
called between those two methods.


BaseProtocol.connection_made(transport)¶
Called when a connection is made.
The transport argument is the transport representing the
connection.  The protocol is responsible for storing the reference
to its transport.



BaseProtocol.connection_lost(exc)¶
Called when the connection is lost or closed.
The argument is either an exception object or None.
The latter means a regular EOF is received, or the connection was
aborted or closed by this side of the connection.

Flow Control Callbacks
Flow control callbacks can be called by transports to pause or
resume writing performed by the protocol.
See the documentation of the set_write_buffer_limits()
method for more details.


BaseProtocol.pause_writing()¶
Called when the transport’s buffer goes over the high watermark.



BaseProtocol.resume_writing()¶
Called when the transport’s buffer drains below the low watermark.

If the buffer size equals the high watermark,
pause_writing() is not called: the buffer size must
go strictly over.
Conversely, resume_writing() is called when the
buffer size is equal or lower than the low watermark.  These end
conditions are important to ensure that things go as expected when
either mark is zero.
