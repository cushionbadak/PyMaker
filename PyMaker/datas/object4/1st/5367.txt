abstractmethod unregister(fileobj)Â¶
Unregister a file object from selection, removing it from monitoring. A
file object shall be unregistered prior to being closed.
fileobj must be a file object previously registered.
This returns the associated SelectorKey instance, or raises a
KeyError if fileobj is not registered.  It will raise
ValueError if fileobj is invalid (e.g. it has no fileno()
method or its fileno() method has an invalid return value).
