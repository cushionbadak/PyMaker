winreg.EnumValue(key, index)Â¶
Enumerates values of an open registry key, returning a tuple.
key is an already open key, or one of the predefined
HKEY_* constants.
index is an integer that identifies the index of the value to retrieve.
The function retrieves the name of one subkey each time it is called. It is
typically called repeatedly, until an OSError exception is
raised, indicating no more values.
The result is a tuple of 3 items:






Index
Meaning



0
A string that identifies the value name

1
An object that holds the value data, and
whose type depends on the underlying
registry type

2
An integer that identifies the type of the
value data (see table in docs for
SetValueEx())




Changed in version 3.3: See above.
