same_quantum(other, context=None)Â¶
Test whether self and other have the same exponent or whether both are
NaN.
This operation is unaffected by context and is quiet: no flags are changed
and no rounding is performed.  As an exception, the C version may raise
InvalidOperation if the second operand cannot be converted exactly.
