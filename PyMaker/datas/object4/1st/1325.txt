Priority Queue Implementation NotesÂ¶
A priority queue is common use
for a heap, and it presents several implementation challenges:

Sort stability:  how do you get two tasks with equal priorities to be returned
in the order they were originally added?
Tuple comparison breaks for (priority, task) pairs if the priorities are equal
and the tasks do not have a default comparison order.
If the priority of a task changes, how do you move it to a new position in
the heap?
Or if a pending task needs to be deleted, how do you find it and remove it
from the queue?

A solution to the first two challenges is to store entries as 3-element list
including the priority, an entry count, and the task.  The entry count serves as
a tie-breaker so that two tasks with the same priority are returned in the order
they were added. And since no two entry counts are the same, the tuple
comparison will never attempt to directly compare two tasks.
Another solution to the problem of non-comparable tasks is to create a wrapper
class that ignores the task item and only compares the priority field:
from dataclasses import dataclass, field
from typing import Any

@dataclass(order=True)
class PrioritizedItem:
    priority: int
    item: Any=field(compare=False)


The remaining challenges revolve around finding a pending task and making
changes to its priority or removing it entirely.  Finding a task can be done
with a dictionary pointing to an entry in the queue.
Removing the entry or changing its priority is more difficult because it would
break the heap structure invariants.  So, a possible solution is to mark the
entry as removed and add a new entry with the revised priority:
pq = []                         # list of entries arranged in a heap
entry_finder = {}               # mapping of tasks to entries
REMOVED = '<removed-task>'      # placeholder for a removed task
counter = itertools.count()     # unique sequence count

def add_task(task, priority=0):
    'Add a new task or update the priority of an existing task'
    if task in entry_finder:
        remove_task(task)
    count = next(counter)
    entry = [priority, count, task]
    entry_finder[task] = entry
    heappush(pq, entry)

def remove_task(task):
    'Mark an existing task as REMOVED.  Raise KeyError if not found.'
    entry = entry_finder.pop(task)
    entry[-1] = REMOVED

def pop_task():
    'Remove and return the lowest priority task. Raise KeyError if empty.'
    while pq:
        priority, count, task = heappop(pq)
        if task is not REMOVED:
            del entry_finder[task]
            return task
    raise KeyError('pop from an empty priority queue')
