heapq.heapreplace(heap, item)¶
Pop and return the smallest item from the heap, and also push the new item.
The heap size doesn’t change. If the heap is empty, IndexError is raised.
This one step operation is more efficient than a heappop() followed by
heappush() and can be more appropriate when using a fixed-size heap.
The pop/push combination always returns an element from the heap and replaces
it with item.
The value returned may be larger than the item added.  If that isn’t
desired, consider using heappushpop() instead.  Its push/pop
combination returns the smaller of the two values, leaving the larger value
on the heap.
