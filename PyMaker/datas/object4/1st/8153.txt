element_create(elementname, etype, *args, **kw)¶
Create a new element in the current theme, of the given etype which is
expected to be either “image”, “from” or “vsapi”. The latter is only
available in Tk 8.6a for Windows XP and Vista and is not described here.
If “image” is used, args should contain the default image name followed
by statespec/value pairs (this is the imagespec), and kw may have the
following options:



border=padding
padding is a list of up to four integers, specifying the left, top,
right, and bottom borders, respectively.



height=height
Specifies a minimum height for the element. If less than zero, the
base image’s height is used as a default.



padding=padding
Specifies the element’s interior padding. Defaults to border’s value
if not specified.



sticky=spec
Specifies how the image is placed within the final parcel. spec
contains zero or more characters “n”, “s”, “w”, or “e”.



width=width
Specifies a minimum width for the element. If less than zero, the
base image’s width is used as a default.




If “from” is used as the value of etype,
element_create() will clone an existing
element. args is expected to contain a themename, from which
the element will be cloned, and optionally an element to clone from.
If this element to clone from is not specified, an empty element will
be used. kw is discarded.
