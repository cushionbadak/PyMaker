turtle.resizemode(rmode=None)¶




Parameters:rmode – one of the strings “auto”, “user”, “noresize”



Set resizemode to one of the values: “auto”, “user”, “noresize”.  If rmode
is not given, return current resizemode.  Different resizemodes have the
following effects:

“auto”: adapts the appearance of the turtle corresponding to the value of pensize.
“user”: adapts the appearance of the turtle according to the values of
stretchfactor and outlinewidth (outline), which are set by
shapesize().
“noresize”: no adaption of the turtle’s appearance takes place.

resizemode(“user”) is called by shapesize() when used with arguments.
>>> turtle.resizemode()

>>> turtle.resizemode("auto")
