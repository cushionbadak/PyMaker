exception parser.ParserErrorÂ¶
Exception raised when a failure occurs within the parser module.  This is
generally produced for validation failures rather than the built-in
SyntaxError raised during normal parsing. The exception argument is
either a string describing the reason of the failure or a tuple containing a
sequence causing the failure from a parse tree passed to sequence2st()
and an explanatory string.  Calls to sequence2st() need to be able to
handle either type of exception, while calls to other functions in the module
will only need to be aware of the simple string values.
