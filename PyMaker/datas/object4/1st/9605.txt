pkgutil.find_loader(fullname)Â¶
Retrieve a module loader for the given fullname.
This is a backwards compatibility wrapper around
importlib.util.find_spec() that converts most failures to
ImportError and only returns the loader rather than the full
ModuleSpec.

Changed in version 3.3: Updated to be based directly on importlib rather than relying
on the package internal PEP 302 import emulation.


Changed in version 3.4: Updated to be based on PEP 451
