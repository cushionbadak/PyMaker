input([prompt])Â¶
If the prompt argument is present, it is written to standard output without
a trailing newline.  The function then reads a line from input, converts it
to a string (stripping a trailing newline), and returns that.  When EOF is
read, EOFError is raised.  Example:
>>> s = input('--> ')  
--> Monty Python's Flying Circus
>>> s  
"Monty Python's Flying Circus"


If the readline module was loaded, then input() will use it
to provide elaborate line editing and history features.
