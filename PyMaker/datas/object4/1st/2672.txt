csv.register_dialect(name[, dialect[, **fmtparams]])Â¶
Associate dialect with name.  name must be a string. The
dialect can be specified either by passing a sub-class of Dialect, or
by fmtparams keyword arguments, or both, with keyword arguments overriding
parameters of the dialect. For full details about the dialect and formatting
parameters, see section Dialects and Formatting Parameters.
