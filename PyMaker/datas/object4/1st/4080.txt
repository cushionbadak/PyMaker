errcheckÂ¶
Assign a Python function or another callable to this attribute. The
callable will be called with three or more arguments:


callable(result, func, arguments)
result is what the foreign function returns, as specified by the
restype attribute.
func is the foreign function object itself, this allows reusing the
same callable object to check or post process the results of several
functions.
arguments is a tuple containing the parameters originally passed to
the function call, this allows specializing the behavior on the
arguments used.

The object that this function returns will be returned from the
foreign function call, but it can also check the result value
and raise an exception if the foreign function call failed.
