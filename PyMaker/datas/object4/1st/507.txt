bytes.rsplit(sep=None, maxsplit=-1)¶

bytearray.rsplit(sep=None, maxsplit=-1)¶
Split the binary sequence into subsequences of the same type, using sep
as the delimiter string. If maxsplit is given, at most maxsplit splits
are done, the rightmost ones.  If sep is not specified or None,
any subsequence consisting solely of ASCII whitespace is a separator.
Except for splitting from the right, rsplit() behaves like
split() which is described in detail below.
