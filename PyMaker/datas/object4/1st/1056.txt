Binary TransformsÂ¶
The following codecs provide binary transforms: bytes-like object
to bytes mappings.  They are not supported by bytes.decode()
(which only produces str output).








Codec
Aliases
Purpose
Encoder / decoder



base64_codec [1]
base64, base_64
Convert operand to multiline
MIME base64 (the result
always includes a trailing
'\n')

Changed in version 3.4: accepts any
bytes-like object
as input for encoding and
decoding


base64.encodebytes() /
base64.decodebytes()

bz2_codec
bz2
Compress the operand
using bz2
bz2.compress() /
bz2.decompress()

hex_codec
hex
Convert operand to
hexadecimal
representation, with two
digits per byte
binascii.b2a_hex() /
binascii.a2b_hex()

quopri_codec
quopri,
quotedprintable,
quoted_printable
Convert operand to MIME
quoted printable
quopri.encode() with
quotetabs=True /
quopri.decode()

uu_codec
uu
Convert the operand using
uuencode
uu.encode() /
uu.decode()

zlib_codec
zip, zlib
Compress the operand
using gzip
zlib.compress() /
zlib.decompress()






[1]In addition to bytes-like objects,
'base64_codec' also accepts ASCII-only instances of str for
decoding



New in version 3.2: Restoration of the binary transforms.


Changed in version 3.4: Restoration of the aliases for the binary transforms.
