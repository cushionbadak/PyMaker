send_error(code, message=None, explain=None)Â¶
Sends and logs a complete error reply to the client. The numeric code
specifies the HTTP error code, with message as an optional, short, human
readable description of the error.  The explain argument can be used to
provide more detailed information about the error; it will be formatted
using the error_message_format attribute and emitted, after
a complete set of headers, as the response body.  The responses
attribute holds the default values for message and explain that
will be used if no value is provided; for unknown codes the default value
for both is the string ???. The body will be empty if the method is
HEAD or the response code is one of the following: 1xx,
204 No Content, 205 Reset Content, 304 Not Modified.

Changed in version 3.4: The error response includes a Content-Length header.
Added the explain argument.
