object.__delitem__(self, key)Â¶
Called to implement deletion of self[key].  Same note as for
__getitem__().  This should only be implemented for mappings if the
objects support removal of keys, or for sequences if elements can be removed
from the sequence.  The same exceptions should be raised for improper key
values as for the __getitem__() method.
