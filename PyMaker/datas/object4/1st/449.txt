str.rsplit(sep=None, maxsplit=-1)Â¶
Return a list of the words in the string, using sep as the delimiter string.
If maxsplit is given, at most maxsplit splits are done, the rightmost
ones.  If sep is not specified or None, any whitespace string is a
separator.  Except for splitting from the right, rsplit() behaves like
split() which is described in detail below.
