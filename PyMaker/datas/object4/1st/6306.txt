exception xml.sax.SAXException(msg, exception=None)¶
Encapsulate an XML error or warning.  This class can contain basic error or
warning information from either the XML parser or the application: it can be
subclassed to provide additional functionality or to add localization.  Note
that although the handlers defined in the
ErrorHandler interface
receive instances of this exception, it is not required to actually raise the
exception — it is also useful as a container for information.
When instantiated, msg should be a human-readable description of the error.
The optional exception parameter, if given, should be None or an exception
that was caught by the parsing code and is being passed along as information.
This is the base class for the other SAX exception classes.
