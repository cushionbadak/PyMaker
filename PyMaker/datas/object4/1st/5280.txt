Combined key and certificateÂ¶
Often the private key is stored in the same file as the certificate; in this
case, only the certfile parameter to SSLContext.load_cert_chain()
and wrap_socket() needs to be passed.  If the private key is stored
with the certificate, it should come before the first certificate in
the certificate chain:
-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
... (private key in base64 encoding) ...
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
... (certificate in base64 PEM encoding) ...
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
