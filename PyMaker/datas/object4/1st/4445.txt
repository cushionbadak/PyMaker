stdoutÂ¶
Captured stdout from the child process. A bytes sequence, or a string if
run() was called with an encoding, errors, or text=True.
None if stdout was not captured.
If you ran the process with stderr=subprocess.STDOUT, stdout and
stderr will be combined in this attribute, and stderr will be
None.
