class logging.FileHandler(filename, mode='a', encoding=None, delay=False)¶
Returns a new instance of the FileHandler class. The specified file is
opened and used as the stream for logging. If mode is not specified,
'a' is used.  If encoding is not None, it is used to open the file
with that encoding.  If delay is true, then file opening is deferred until the
first call to emit(). By default, the file grows indefinitely.

Changed in version 3.6: As well as string values, Path objects are also accepted
for the filename argument.



close()¶
Closes the file.



emit(record)¶
Outputs the record to the file.
