strftime() and strptime() Behavior¶
date, datetime, and time objects all support a
strftime(format) method, to create a string representing the time under the
control of an explicit format string.  Broadly speaking, d.strftime(fmt)
acts like the time module’s time.strftime(fmt, d.timetuple())
although not all objects support a timetuple() method.
Conversely, the datetime.strptime() class method creates a
datetime object from a string representing a date and time and a
corresponding format string. datetime.strptime(date_string, format) is
equivalent to datetime(*(time.strptime(date_string, format)[0:6])), except
when the format includes sub-second components or timezone offset information,
which are supported in datetime.strptime but are discarded by time.strptime.
For time objects, the format codes for year, month, and day should not
be used, as time objects have no such values.  If they’re used anyway, 1900
is substituted for the year, and 1 for the month and day.
For date objects, the format codes for hours, minutes, seconds, and
microseconds should not be used, as date objects have no such
values.  If they’re used anyway, 0 is substituted for them.
The full set of format codes supported varies across platforms, because Python
calls the platform C library’s strftime() function, and platform
variations are common.  To see the full set of format codes supported on your
platform, consult the strftime(3) documentation.
For the same reason, handling of format strings containing Unicode code points
that can’t be represented in the charset of the current locale is also
platform-dependent. On some platforms such code points are preserved intact in
the output, while on others strftime may raise UnicodeError or return
an empty string instead.
The following is a list of all the format codes that the C standard (1989
version) requires, and these work on all platforms with a standard C
implementation.  Note that the 1999 version of the C standard added additional
format codes.

Several additional directives not required by the C89 standard are included for
convenience. These parameters all correspond to ISO 8601 date values. These
may not be available on all platforms when used with the strftime()
method. The ISO 8601 year and ISO 8601 week directives are not interchangeable
with the year and week number directives above. Calling strptime() with
incomplete or ambiguous ISO 8601 directives will raise a ValueError.

New in version 3.6: %G, %u and %V were added.

Notes:

Because the format depends on the current locale, care should be taken when
making assumptions about the output value. Field orderings will vary (for
example, “month/day/year” versus “day/month/year”), and the output may
contain Unicode characters encoded using the locale’s default encoding (for
example, if the current locale is ja_JP, the default encoding could be
any one of eucJP, SJIS, or utf-8; use locale.getlocale()
to determine the current locale’s encoding).

The strptime() method can parse years in the full [1, 9999] range, but
years < 1000 must be zero-filled to 4-digit width.

Changed in version 3.2: In previous versions, strftime() method was restricted to
years >= 1900.


Changed in version 3.3: In version 3.2, strftime() method was restricted to
years >= 1000.


When used with the strptime() method, the %p directive only affects
the output hour field if the %I directive is used to parse the hour.

Unlike the time module, the datetime module does not support
leap seconds.

When used with the strptime() method, the %f directive
accepts from one to six digits and zero pads on the right.  %f is
an extension to the set of format characters in the C standard (but
implemented separately in datetime objects, and therefore always
available).

For a naive object, the %z and %Z format codes are replaced by empty
strings.
For an aware object:

%z
utcoffset() is transformed into a string of the form
±HHMM[SS[.ffffff]], where HH is a 2-digit string giving the number of UTC
offset hours, MM is a 2-digit string giving the number of UTC offset
minutes, SS is a 2-digit string giving the number of UTC offset
seconds and ffffff is a 6-digit string giving the number of UTC
offset microseconds.  The ffffff part is omitted when the offset is a
whole number of seconds and both the ffffff and the SS part is omitted
when the offset is a whole number of minutes.  For example, if
utcoffset() returns timedelta(hours=-3, minutes=-30), %z is
replaced with the string '-0330'.



Changed in version 3.7: The UTC offset is not restricted to a whole number of minutes.


Changed in version 3.7: When the %z directive is provided to the  strptime() method,
the UTC offsets can have a colon as a separator between hours, minutes
and seconds.
For example, '+01:00:00' will be parsed as an offset of one hour.
In addition, providing 'Z' is identical to '+00:00'.


%Z
If tzname() returns None, %Z is replaced by an empty
string.  Otherwise %Z is replaced by the returned value, which must
be a string.



Changed in version 3.2: When the %z directive is provided to the strptime() method, an
aware datetime object will be produced.  The tzinfo of the
result will be set to a timezone instance.


When used with the strptime() method, %U and %W are only used
in calculations when the day of the week and the calendar year (%Y)
are specified.

Similar to %U and %W, %V is only used in calculations when the
day of the week and the ISO year (%G) are specified in a
strptime() format string. Also note that %G and %Y are not
interchangeable.
