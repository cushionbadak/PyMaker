curses.init_color(color_number, r, g, b)¶
Change the definition of a color, taking the number of the color to be changed
followed by three RGB values (for the amounts of red, green, and blue
components).  The value of color_number must be between 0 and
COLORS.  Each of r, g, b, must be a value between 0 and
1000.  When init_color() is used, all occurrences of that color on the
screen immediately change to the new definition.  This function is a no-op on
most terminals; it is active only if can_change_color() returns True.
