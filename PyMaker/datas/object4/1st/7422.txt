Prefix, net mask and host maskÂ¶
There are several equivalent ways to specify IP network masks.  A prefix
/<nbits> is a notation that denotes how many high-order bits are set in
the network mask.  A net mask is an IP address with some number of
high-order bits set.  Thus the prefix /24 is equivalent to the net mask
255.255.255.0 in IPv4, or ffff:ff00:: in IPv6.  In addition, a
host mask is the logical inverse of a net mask, and is sometimes used
(for example in Cisco access control lists) to denote a network mask.  The
host mask equivalent to /24 in IPv4 is 0.0.0.255.
