coroutine.send(value)Â¶
Starts or resumes execution of the coroutine.  If value is None,
this is equivalent to advancing the iterator returned by
__await__().  If value is not None, this method delegates
to the send() method of the iterator that caused
the coroutine to suspend.  The result (return value,
StopIteration, or other exception) is the same as when
iterating over the __await__() return value, described above.
