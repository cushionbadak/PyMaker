os.path.splitdrive(path)¶
Split the pathname path into a pair (drive, tail) where drive is either
a mount point or the empty string.  On systems which do not use drive
specifications, drive will always be the empty string.  In all cases, drive
+ tail will be the same as path.
On Windows, splits a pathname into drive/UNC sharepoint and relative path.
If the path contains a drive letter, drive will contain everything
up to and including the colon.
e.g. splitdrive("c:/dir") returns ("c:", "/dir")
If the path contains a UNC path, drive will contain the host name
and share, up to but not including the fourth separator.
e.g. splitdrive("//host/computer/dir") returns ("//host/computer", "/dir")

Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a path-like object.
