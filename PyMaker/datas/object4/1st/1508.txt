Enum ClassesÂ¶
The EnumMeta metaclass is responsible for providing the
__contains__(), __dir__(), __iter__() and other methods that
allow one to do things with an Enum class that fail on a typical
class, such as list(Color) or some_enum_var in Color.  EnumMeta is
responsible for ensuring that various other methods on the final Enum
class are correct (such as __new__(), __getnewargs__(),
__str__() and __repr__()).
