doctest.DONT_ACCEPT_BLANKLINEÂ¶
By default, if an expected output block contains a line containing only the
string <BLANKLINE>, then that line will match a blank line in the actual
output.  Because a genuinely blank line delimits the expected output, this is
the only way to communicate that a blank line is expected.  When
DONT_ACCEPT_BLANKLINE is specified, this substitution is not allowed.
