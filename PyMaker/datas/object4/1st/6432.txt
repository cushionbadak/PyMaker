xmlparser.buffer_textÂ¶
Setting this to true causes the xmlparser object to buffer textual
content returned by Expat to avoid multiple calls to the
CharacterDataHandler() callback whenever possible.  This can improve
performance substantially since Expat normally breaks character data into chunks
at every line ending.  This attribute is false by default, and may be changed at
any time.
