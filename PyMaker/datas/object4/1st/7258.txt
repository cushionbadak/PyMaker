FileCookieJar.load(filename=None, ignore_discard=False, ignore_expires=False)Â¶
Load cookies from a file.
Old cookies are kept unless overwritten by newly loaded ones.
Arguments are as for save().
The named file must be in the format understood by the class, or
LoadError will be raised.  Also, OSError may be raised, for
example if the file does not exist.

Changed in version 3.3: IOError used to be raised, it is now an alias of OSError.
