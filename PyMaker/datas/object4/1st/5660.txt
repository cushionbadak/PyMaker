get_content(msg, *args, **kw)Â¶
Look up a handler function based on the mimetype of msg (see next
paragraph), call it, passing through all arguments, and return the result
of the call.  The expectation is that the handler will extract the
payload from msg and return an object that encodes information about
the extracted data.
To find the handler, look for the following keys in the registry,
stopping with the first one found:


the string representing the full MIME type (maintype/subtype)
the string representing the maintype
the empty string


If none of these keys produce a handler, raise a KeyError for the
full MIME type.
