Key bindings¶
In this section, ‘C’ refers to the Control key on Windows and Unix and
the Command key on macOS.

Backspace deletes to the left; Del deletes to the right

C-Backspace delete word left; C-Del delete word to the right

Arrow keys and Page Up/Page Down to move around

C-LeftArrow and C-RightArrow moves by words

Home/End go to begin/end of line

C-Home/C-End go to begin/end of file

Some useful Emacs bindings are inherited from Tcl/Tk:


C-a beginning of line
C-e end of line
C-k kill line (but doesn’t put it in clipboard)
C-l center window around the insertion point
C-b go backward one character without deleting (usually you can
also use the cursor key for this)
C-f go forward one character without deleting (usually you can
also use the cursor key for this)
C-p go up one line (usually you can also use the cursor key for
this)
C-d delete next character




Standard keybindings (like C-c to copy and C-v to paste)
may work.  Keybindings are selected in the Configure IDLE dialog.
