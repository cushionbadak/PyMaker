address_exclude(network)Â¶
Computes the network definitions resulting from removing the given
network from this one.  Returns an iterator of network objects.
Raises ValueError if network is not completely contained in
this network.
>>> n1 = ip_network('192.0.2.0/28')
>>> n2 = ip_network('192.0.2.1/32')
>>> list(n1.address_exclude(n2))  #doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
[IPv4Network('192.0.2.8/29'), IPv4Network('192.0.2.4/30'),
 IPv4Network('192.0.2.2/31'), IPv4Network('192.0.2.0/32')]
