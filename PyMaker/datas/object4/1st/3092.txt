docs:


is_file(*, follow_symlinks=True)¶
Return True if this entry is a file or a symbolic link pointing to a
file; return False if the entry is or points to a directory or other
non-file entry, or if it doesn’t exist anymore.
If follow_symlinks is False, return True only if this entry
is a file (without following symlinks); return False if the entry is
a directory or other non-file entry, or if it doesn’t exist anymore.
The result is cached on the os.DirEntry object. Caching, system calls
made, and exceptions raised are as per is_dir().
