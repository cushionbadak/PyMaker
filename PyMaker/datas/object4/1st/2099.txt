os.path.relpath(path, start=os.curdir)Â¶
Return a relative filepath to path either from the current directory or
from an optional start directory.  This is a path computation:  the
filesystem is not accessed to confirm the existence or nature of path or
start.
start defaults to os.curdir.
Availability: Unix, Windows.

Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a path-like object.
