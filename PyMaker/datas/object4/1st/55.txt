3.3.2. Customizing attribute access¶
The following methods can be defined to customize the meaning of attribute
access (use of, assignment to, or deletion of x.name) for class instances.


object.__getattr__(self, name)¶
Called when the default attribute access fails with an AttributeError
(either __getattribute__() raises an AttributeError because
name is not an instance attribute or an attribute in the class tree
for self; or __get__() of a name property raises
AttributeError).  This method should either return the (computed)
attribute value or raise an AttributeError exception.
Note that if the attribute is found through the normal mechanism,
__getattr__() is not called.  (This is an intentional asymmetry between
__getattr__() and __setattr__().) This is done both for efficiency
reasons and because otherwise __getattr__() would have no way to access
other attributes of the instance.  Note that at least for instance variables,
you can fake total control by not inserting any values in the instance attribute
dictionary (but instead inserting them in another object).  See the
__getattribute__() method below for a way to actually get total control
over attribute access.



object.__getattribute__(self, name)¶
Called unconditionally to implement attribute accesses for instances of the
class. If the class also defines __getattr__(), the latter will not be
called unless __getattribute__() either calls it explicitly or raises an
AttributeError. This method should return the (computed) attribute value
or raise an AttributeError exception. In order to avoid infinite
recursion in this method, its implementation should always call the base class
method with the same name to access any attributes it needs, for example,
object.__getattribute__(self, name).

Note
This method may still be bypassed when looking up special methods as the
result of implicit invocation via language syntax or built-in functions.
See Special method lookup.




object.__setattr__(self, name, value)¶
Called when an attribute assignment is attempted.  This is called instead of
the normal mechanism (i.e. store the value in the instance dictionary).
name is the attribute name, value is the value to be assigned to it.
If __setattr__() wants to assign to an instance attribute, it should
call the base class method with the same name, for example,
object.__setattr__(self, name, value).



object.__delattr__(self, name)¶
Like __setattr__() but for attribute deletion instead of assignment.  This
should only be implemented if del obj.name is meaningful for the object.



object.__dir__(self)¶
Called when dir() is called on the object. A sequence must be
returned. dir() converts the returned sequence to a list and sorts it.


3.3.2.1. Customizing module attribute access¶
Special names __getattr__ and __dir__ can be also used to customize
access to module attributes. The __getattr__ function at the module level
should accept one argument which is the name of an attribute and return the
computed value or raise an AttributeError. If an attribute is
not found on a module object through the normal lookup, i.e.
object.__getattribute__(), then __getattr__ is searched in
the module __dict__ before raising an AttributeError. If found,
it is called with the attribute name and the result is returned.
The __dir__ function should accept no arguments, and return a list of
strings that represents the names accessible on module. If present, this
function overrides the standard dir() search on a module.
For a more fine grained customization of the module behavior (setting
attributes, properties, etc.), one can set the __class__ attribute of
a module object to a subclass of types.ModuleType. For example:
import sys
from types import ModuleType

class VerboseModule(ModuleType):
    def __repr__(self):
        return f'Verbose {self.__name__}'

    def __setattr__(self, attr, value):
        print(f'Setting {attr}...')
        super().__setattr__(attr, value)

sys.modules[__name__].__class__ = VerboseModule



Note
Defining module __getattr__ and setting module __class__ only
affect lookups made using the attribute access syntax – directly accessing
the module globals (whether by code within the module, or via a reference
to the module’s globals dictionary) is unaffected.


Changed in version 3.5: __class__ module attribute is now writable.


New in version 3.7: __getattr__ and __dir__ module attributes.

3.3.2.2. Implementing Descriptors¶
The following methods only apply when an instance of the class containing the
method (a so-called descriptor class) appears in an owner class (the
descriptor must be in either the owner’s class dictionary or in the class
dictionary for one of its parents).  In the examples below, “the attribute”
refers to the attribute whose name is the key of the property in the owner
class’ __dict__.


object.__get__(self, instance, owner)¶
Called to get the attribute of the owner class (class attribute access) or of an
instance of that class (instance attribute access). owner is always the owner
class, while instance is the instance that the attribute was accessed through,
or None when the attribute is accessed through the owner.  This method
should return the (computed) attribute value or raise an AttributeError
exception.



object.__set__(self, instance, value)¶
Called to set the attribute on an instance instance of the owner class to a
new value, value.



object.__delete__(self, instance)¶
Called to delete the attribute on an instance instance of the owner class.



object.__set_name__(self, owner, name)¶
Called at the time the owning class owner is created. The
descriptor has been assigned to name.

New in version 3.6.


The attribute __objclass__ is interpreted by the inspect module
as specifying the class where this object was defined (setting this
appropriately can assist in runtime introspection of dynamic class attributes).
For callables, it may indicate that an instance of the given type (or a
subclass) is expected or required as the first positional argument (for example,
CPython sets this attribute for unbound methods that are implemented in C).


3.3.2.3. Invoking Descriptors¶
In general, a descriptor is an object attribute with “binding behavior”, one
whose attribute access has been overridden by methods in the descriptor
protocol:  __get__(), __set__(), and __delete__(). If any of
those methods are defined for an object, it is said to be a descriptor.
The default behavior for attribute access is to get, set, or delete the
attribute from an object’s dictionary. For instance, a.x has a lookup chain
starting with a.__dict__['x'], then type(a).__dict__['x'], and
continuing through the base classes of type(a) excluding metaclasses.
However, if the looked-up value is an object defining one of the descriptor
methods, then Python may override the default behavior and invoke the descriptor
method instead.  Where this occurs in the precedence chain depends on which
descriptor methods were defined and how they were called.
The starting point for descriptor invocation is a binding, a.x. How the
arguments are assembled depends on a:

Direct Call
The simplest and least common call is when user code directly invokes a
descriptor method:    x.__get__(a).
Instance Binding
If binding to an object instance, a.x is transformed into the call:
type(a).__dict__['x'].__get__(a, type(a)).
Class Binding
If binding to a class, A.x is transformed into the call:
A.__dict__['x'].__get__(None, A).
Super Binding
If a is an instance of super, then the binding super(B, obj).m()
searches obj.__class__.__mro__ for the base class A
immediately preceding B and then invokes the descriptor with the call:
A.__dict__['m'].__get__(obj, obj.__class__).

For instance bindings, the precedence of descriptor invocation depends on the
which descriptor methods are defined.  A descriptor can define any combination
of __get__(), __set__() and __delete__().  If it does not
define __get__(), then accessing the attribute will return the descriptor
object itself unless there is a value in the object’s instance dictionary.  If
the descriptor defines __set__() and/or __delete__(), it is a data
descriptor; if it defines neither, it is a non-data descriptor.  Normally, data
descriptors define both __get__() and __set__(), while non-data
descriptors have just the __get__() method.  Data descriptors with
__set__() and __get__() defined always override a redefinition in an
instance dictionary.  In contrast, non-data descriptors can be overridden by
instances.
Python methods (including staticmethod() and classmethod()) are
implemented as non-data descriptors.  Accordingly, instances can redefine and
override methods.  This allows individual instances to acquire behaviors that
differ from other instances of the same class.
The property() function is implemented as a data descriptor. Accordingly,
instances cannot override the behavior of a property.


3.3.2.4. __slots__¶
__slots__ allow us to explicitly declare data members (like
properties) and deny the creation of __dict__ and __weakref__
(unless explicitly declared in __slots__ or available in a parent.)
The space saved over using __dict__ can be significant.
Attribute lookup speed can be significantly improved as well.


object.__slots__¶
This class variable can be assigned a string, iterable, or sequence of
strings with variable names used by instances.  __slots__ reserves space
for the declared variables and prevents the automatic creation of __dict__
and __weakref__ for each instance.


3.3.2.4.1. Notes on using __slots__¶

When inheriting from a class without __slots__, the __dict__ and
__weakref__ attribute of the instances will always be accessible.
Without a __dict__ variable, instances cannot be assigned new variables not
listed in the __slots__ definition.  Attempts to assign to an unlisted
variable name raises AttributeError. If dynamic assignment of new
variables is desired, then add '__dict__' to the sequence of strings in
the __slots__ declaration.
Without a __weakref__ variable for each instance, classes defining
__slots__ do not support weak references to its instances. If weak reference
support is needed, then add '__weakref__' to the sequence of strings in the
__slots__ declaration.
__slots__ are implemented at the class level by creating descriptors
(Implementing Descriptors) for each variable name.  As a result, class attributes
cannot be used to set default values for instance variables defined by
__slots__; otherwise, the class attribute would overwrite the descriptor
assignment.
The action of a __slots__ declaration is not limited to the class
where it is defined.  __slots__ declared in parents are available in
child classes. However, child subclasses will get a __dict__  and
__weakref__ unless they also define __slots__ (which should only
contain names of any additional slots).
If a class defines a slot also defined in a base class, the instance variable
defined by the base class slot is inaccessible (except by retrieving its
descriptor directly from the base class). This renders the meaning of the
program undefined.  In the future, a check may be added to prevent this.
Nonempty __slots__ does not work for classes derived from “variable-length”
built-in types such as int, bytes and tuple.
Any non-string iterable may be assigned to __slots__. Mappings may also be
used; however, in the future, special meaning may be assigned to the values
corresponding to each key.
__class__ assignment works only if both classes have the same __slots__.
Multiple inheritance with multiple slotted parent classes can be used,
but only one parent is allowed to have attributes created by slots
(the other bases must have empty slot layouts) - violations raise
TypeError.
