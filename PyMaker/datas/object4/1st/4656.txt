coroutine readuntil(separator=b'\n')Â¶
Read data from the stream until separator is found.
On success, the data and separator will be removed from the
internal buffer (consumed). Returned data will include the
separator at the end.
If the amount of data read exceeds the configured stream limit, a
LimitOverrunError exception is raised, and the data
is left in the internal buffer and can be read again.
If EOF is reached before the complete separator is found,
an IncompleteReadError exception is raised, and the internal
buffer is reset.  The IncompleteReadError.partial attribute
may contain a portion of the separator.

New in version 3.5.2.
