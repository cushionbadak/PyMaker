syslog.syslog(message)Â¶

syslog.syslog(priority, message)
Send the string message to the system logger.  A trailing newline is added
if necessary.  Each message is tagged with a priority composed of a
facility and a level.  The optional priority argument, which defaults
to LOG_INFO, determines the message priority.  If the facility is
not encoded in priority using logical-or (LOG_INFO | LOG_USER), the
value given in the openlog() call is used.
If openlog() has not been called prior to the call to syslog(),
openlog() will be called with no arguments.
