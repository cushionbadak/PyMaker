ensure_directories(env_dir)Â¶
Creates the environment directory and all necessary directories, and
returns a context object.  This is just a holder for attributes (such as
paths), for use by the other methods. The directories are allowed to
exist already, as long as either clear or upgrade were
specified to allow operating on an existing environment directory.
