sysconfig.get_paths([scheme[, vars[, expand]]])Â¶
Return a dictionary containing all installation paths corresponding to an
installation scheme. See get_path() for more information.
If scheme is not provided, will use the default scheme for the current
platform.
If vars is provided, it must be a dictionary of variables that will
update the dictionary used to expand the paths.
If expand is set to false, the paths will not be expanded.
If scheme is not an existing scheme, get_paths() will raise a
KeyError.
