stat.S_ISGIDÂ¶
Set-group-ID bit.  This bit has several special uses.  For a directory
it indicates that BSD semantics is to be used for that directory:
files created there inherit their group ID from the directory, not
from the effective group ID of the creating process, and directories
created there will also get the S_ISGID bit set.  For a
file that does not have the group execution bit (S_IXGRP)
set, the set-group-ID bit indicates mandatory file/record locking
(see also S_ENFMT).
