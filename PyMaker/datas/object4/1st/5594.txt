fold_binary(name, value)Â¶
The same as fold() if cte_type is 7bit, except
that the returned value is bytes.
If cte_type is 8bit, non-ASCII binary data is
converted back
into bytes.  Headers with binary data are not refolded, regardless of the
refold_header setting, since there is no way to know whether the
binary data consists of single byte characters or multibyte characters.
