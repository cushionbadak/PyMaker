Module Functions¶
The crypt module defines the following functions:


crypt.crypt(word, salt=None)¶
word will usually be a user’s password as typed at a prompt or  in a graphical
interface.  The optional salt is either a string as returned from
mksalt(), one of the crypt.METHOD_* values (though not all
may be available on all platforms), or a full encrypted password
including salt, as returned by this function.  If salt is not
provided, the strongest method will be used (as returned by
methods()).
Checking a password is usually done by passing the plain-text password
as word and the full results of a previous crypt() call,
which should be the same as the results of this call.
salt (either a random 2 or 16 character string, possibly prefixed with
$digit$ to indicate the method) which will be used to perturb the
encryption algorithm.  The characters in salt must be in the set
[./a-zA-Z0-9], with the exception of Modular Crypt Format which
prefixes a $digit$.
Returns the hashed password as a string, which will be composed of
characters from the same alphabet as the salt.
Since a few crypt(3) extensions allow different values, with
different sizes in the salt, it is recommended to use  the full crypted
password as salt when checking for a password.

Changed in version 3.3: Accept crypt.METHOD_* values in addition to strings for salt.




crypt.mksalt(method=None, *, rounds=None)¶
Return a randomly generated salt of the specified method.  If no
method is given, the strongest method available as returned by
methods() is used.
The return value is a string suitable for passing as the salt argument
to crypt().
rounds specifies the number of rounds for METHOD_SHA256,
METHOD_SHA512 and METHOD_BLOWFISH.
For METHOD_SHA256 and METHOD_SHA512 it must be an integer between
1000 and 999_999_999, the default is 5000.  For
METHOD_BLOWFISH it must be a power of two between 16 (24)
and 2_147_483_648 (231), the default is 4096
(212).

New in version 3.3.


Changed in version 3.7: Added the rounds parameter.
