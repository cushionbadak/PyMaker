class tkinter.tix.tixCommand¶
The tix commands provide
access to miscellaneous elements of Tix’s internal state and the
Tix application context.  Most of the information manipulated by these
methods pertains to the application as a whole, or to a screen or display,
rather than to a particular window.
To view the current settings, the common usage is:
from tkinter import tix
root = tix.Tk()
print(root.tix_configure())
