turtle.clear()

turtle.clearscreen()Â¶
Delete all drawings and all turtles from the TurtleScreen.  Reset the now
empty TurtleScreen to its initial state: white background, no background
image, no event bindings and tracing on.

Note
This TurtleScreen method is available as a global function only under the
name clearscreen.  The global function clear is a different one
derived from the Turtle method clear.
