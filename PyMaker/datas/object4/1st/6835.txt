class ftplib.FTP(host='', user='', passwd='', acct='', timeout=None, source_address=None)Â¶
Return a new instance of the FTP class.  When host is given, the
method call connect(host) is made.  When user is given, additionally
the method call login(user, passwd, acct) is made (where passwd and
acct default to the empty string when not given).  The optional timeout
parameter specifies a timeout in seconds for blocking operations like the
connection attempt (if is not specified, the global default timeout setting
will be used). source_address is a 2-tuple (host, port) for the socket
to bind to as its source address before connecting.
The FTP class supports the with statement, e.g.:
>>> from ftplib import FTP
>>> with FTP("ftp1.at.proftpd.org") as ftp:
...     ftp.login()
...     ftp.dir()
... # doctest: +SKIP
'230 Anonymous login ok, restrictions apply.'
