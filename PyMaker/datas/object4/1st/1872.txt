itertools.dropwhile(predicate, iterable)Â¶
Make an iterator that drops elements from the iterable as long as the predicate
is true; afterwards, returns every element.  Note, the iterator does not produce
any output until the predicate first becomes false, so it may have a lengthy
start-up time.  Roughly equivalent to:
def dropwhile(predicate, iterable):
    # dropwhile(lambda x: x<5, [1,4,6,4,1]) --> 6 4 1
    iterable = iter(iterable)
    for x in iterable:
        if not predicate(x):
            yield x
            break
    for x in iterable:
        yield x
