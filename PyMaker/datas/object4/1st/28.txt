2.4.6. Floating point literalsÂ¶
Floating point literals are described by the following lexical definitions:

floatnumber   ::=  pointfloat | exponentfloat
pointfloat    ::=  [digitpart] fraction | digitpart "."
exponentfloat ::=  (digitpart | pointfloat) exponent
digitpart     ::=  digit (["_"] digit)*
fraction      ::=  "." digitpart
exponent      ::=  ("e" | "E") ["+" | "-"] digitpart

Note that the integer and exponent parts are always interpreted using radix 10.
For example, 077e010 is legal, and denotes the same number as 77e10. The
allowed range of floating point literals is implementation-dependent.  As in
integer literals, underscores are supported for digit grouping.
Some examples of floating point literals:
3.14    10.    .001    1e100    3.14e-10    0e0    3.14_15_93



Changed in version 3.6: Underscores are now allowed for grouping purposes in literals.
