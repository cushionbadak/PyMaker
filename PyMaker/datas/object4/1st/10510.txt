syslog.openlog([ident[, logoption[, facility]]])¶
Logging options of subsequent syslog() calls can be set by calling
openlog().  syslog() will call openlog() with no arguments
if the log is not currently open.
The optional ident keyword argument is a string which is prepended to every
message, and defaults to sys.argv[0] with leading path components
stripped.  The optional logoption keyword argument (default is 0) is a bit
field – see below for possible values to combine.  The optional facility
keyword argument (default is LOG_USER) sets the default facility for
messages which do not have a facility explicitly encoded.

Changed in version 3.2: In previous versions, keyword arguments were not allowed, and ident was
required.  The default for ident was dependent on the system libraries,
and often was python instead of the name of the Python program file.
