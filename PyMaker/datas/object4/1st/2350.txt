class shelve.BsdDbShelf(dict, protocol=None, writeback=False, keyencoding='utf-8')Â¶
A subclass of Shelf which exposes first(), next(),
previous(), last() and set_location() which are available
in the third-party bsddb module from pybsddb but not in other database
modules.  The dict object passed to the constructor must support those
methods.  This is generally accomplished by calling one of
bsddb.hashopen(), bsddb.btopen() or bsddb.rnopen().  The
optional protocol, writeback, and keyencoding parameters have the same
interpretation as for the Shelf class.
