os.removexattr(path, attribute, *, follow_symlinks=True)Â¶
Removes the extended filesystem attribute attribute from path.
attribute should be bytes or str (directly or indirectly through the
PathLike interface). If it is a string, it is encoded
with the filesystem encoding.
This function can support specifying a file descriptor and
not following symlinks.

Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a path-like object for path and attribute.
