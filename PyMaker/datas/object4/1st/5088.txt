socket.connect(address)¶
Connect to a remote socket at address. (The format of address depends on the
address family — see above.)
If the connection is interrupted by a signal, the method waits until the
connection completes, or raise a socket.timeout on timeout, if the
signal handler doesn’t raise an exception and the socket is blocking or has
a timeout. For non-blocking sockets, the method raises an
InterruptedError exception if the connection is interrupted by a
signal (or the exception raised by the signal handler).

Changed in version 3.5: The method now waits until the connection completes instead of raising an
InterruptedError exception if the connection is interrupted by a
signal, the signal handler doesn’t raise an exception and the socket is
blocking or has a timeout (see the PEP 475 for the rationale).
