sys.dont_write_bytecode¶
If this is true, Python won’t try to write .pyc files on the
import of source modules.  This value is initially set to True or
False depending on the -B command line option and the
PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE environment variable, but you can set it
yourself to control bytecode file generation.
