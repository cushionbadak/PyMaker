<dd><p>Returns a list of strings ready for printing.  Each string in the
resulting list corresponds to a single frame from the stack.
Each string ends in a newline; the strings may contain internal
newlines as well, for those items with source text lines.</p>
<p>For long sequences of the same frame and line, the first few
repetitions are shown, followed by a summary line stating the exact
number of further repetitions.</p>
