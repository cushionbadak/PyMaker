window.derwin(begin_y, begin_x)¶

window.derwin(nlines, ncols, begin_y, begin_x)
An abbreviation for “derive window”, derwin() is the same as calling
subwin(), except that begin_y and begin_x are relative to the origin
of the window, rather than relative to the entire screen.  Return a window
object for the derived window.
