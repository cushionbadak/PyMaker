class asyncio.AbstractChildWatcher¶


add_child_handler(pid, callback, *args)¶
Register a new child handler.
Arrange for callback(pid, returncode, *args) to be called
when a process with PID equal to pid terminates.  Specifying
another callback for the same process replaces the previous
handler.
The callback callable must be thread-safe.



remove_child_handler(pid)¶
Removes the handler for process with PID equal to pid.
The function returns True if the handler was successfully
removed, False if there was nothing to remove.



attach_loop(loop)¶
Attach the watcher to an event loop.
If the watcher was previously attached to an event loop, then
it is first detached before attaching to the new loop.
Note: loop may be None.



close()¶
Close the watcher.
This method has to be called to ensure that underlying
resources are cleaned-up.
