get_matching_blocks()Â¶
Return list of triples describing non-overlapping matching subsequences.
Each triple is of the form (i, j, n),
and means that a[i:i+n] == b[j:j+n].  The
triples are monotonically increasing in i and j.
The last triple is a dummy, and has the value (len(a), len(b), 0).  It
is the only triple with n == 0.  If (i, j, n) and (i', j', n')
are adjacent triples in the list, and the second is not the last triple in
the list, then i+n < i' or j+n < j'; in other words, adjacent
triples always describe non-adjacent equal blocks.
