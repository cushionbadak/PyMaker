window.chgat(y, x, num, attr)
Set the attributes of num characters at the current cursor position, or at
position (y, x) if supplied. If num is not given or is -1,
the attribute will be set on all the characters to the end of the line.  This
function moves cursor to position (y, x) if supplied. The changed line
will be touched using the touchline() method so that the contents will
be redisplayed by the next window refresh.
