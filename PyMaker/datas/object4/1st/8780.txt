test.support.temp_dir(path=None, quiet=False)Â¶
A context manager that creates a temporary directory at path and
yields the directory.
If path is None, the temporary directory is created using
tempfile.mkdtemp().  If quiet is False, the context manager
raises an exception on error.  Otherwise, if path is specified and
cannot be created, only a warning is issued.
