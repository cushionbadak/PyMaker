class xmlrpc.client.MultiCall(server)Â¶
Create an object used to boxcar method calls. server is the eventual target of
the call. Calls can be made to the result object, but they will immediately
return None, and only store the call name and parameters in the
MultiCall object. Calling the object itself causes all stored calls to
be transmitted as a single system.multicall request. The result of this call
is a generator; iterating over this generator yields the individual
results.
