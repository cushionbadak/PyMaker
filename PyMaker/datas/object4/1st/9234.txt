<dd><p>This is a dictionary that maps module names to modules which have already been
loaded.  This can be manipulated to force reloading of modules and other tricks.
However, replacing the dictionary will not necessarily work as expected and
deleting essential items from the dictionary may cause Python to fail.</p>
