ssl.PROTOCOL_TLSv1_2Â¶
Selects TLS version 1.2 as the channel encryption protocol. This is the
most modern version, and probably the best choice for maximum protection,
if both sides can speak it.  Available only with openssl version 1.0.1+.

New in version 3.4.


Deprecated since version 3.6: OpenSSL has deprecated all version specific protocols. Use the default
protocol PROTOCOL_TLS with flags like OP_NO_SSLv3 instead.
