Cmd.postcmd(stop, line)Â¶
Hook method executed just after a command dispatch is finished.  This method is
a stub in Cmd; it exists to be overridden by subclasses.  line is the
command line which was executed, and stop is a flag which indicates whether
execution will be terminated after the call to postcmd(); this will be the
return value of the onecmd() method.  The return value of this method will
be used as the new value for the internal flag which corresponds to stop;
returning false will cause interpretation to continue.
