backup(target, *, pages=0, progress=None, name="main", sleep=0.250)¶
This method makes a backup of a SQLite database even while it’s being accessed
by other clients, or concurrently by the same connection.  The copy will be
written into the mandatory argument target, that must be another
Connection instance.
By default, or when pages is either 0 or a negative integer, the entire
database is copied in a single step; otherwise the method performs a loop
copying up to pages pages at a time.
If progress is specified, it must either be None or a callable object that
will be executed at each iteration with three integer arguments, respectively
the status of the last iteration, the remaining number of pages still to be
copied and the total number of pages.
The name argument specifies the database name that will be copied: it must be
a string containing either "main", the default, to indicate the main
database, "temp" to indicate the temporary database or the name specified
after the AS keyword in an ATTACH DATABASE statement for an attached
database.
The sleep argument specifies the number of seconds to sleep by between
successive attempts to backup remaining pages, can be specified either as an
integer or a floating point value.
Example 1, copy an existing database into another:
import sqlite3

def progress(status, remaining, total):
    print(f'Copied {total-remaining} of {total} pages...')

con = sqlite3.connect('existing_db.db')
bck = sqlite3.connect('backup.db')
with bck:
    con.backup(bck, pages=1, progress=progress)
bck.close()
con.close()


Example 2, copy an existing database into a transient copy:
import sqlite3

source = sqlite3.connect('existing_db.db')
dest = sqlite3.connect(':memory:')
source.backup(dest)


Availability: SQLite 3.6.11 or higher

New in version 3.7.
