multiprocessing.freeze_support()¶
Add support for when a program which uses multiprocessing has been
frozen to produce a Windows executable.  (Has been tested with py2exe,
PyInstaller and cx_Freeze.)
One needs to call this function straight after the if __name__ ==
'__main__' line of the main module.  For example:
from multiprocessing import Process, freeze_support

def f():
    print('hello world!')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    freeze_support()
    Process(target=f).start()


If the freeze_support() line is omitted then trying to run the frozen
executable will raise RuntimeError.
Calling freeze_support() has no effect when invoked on any operating
system other than Windows.  In addition, if the module is being run
normally by the Python interpreter on Windows (the program has not been
frozen), then freeze_support() has no effect.
