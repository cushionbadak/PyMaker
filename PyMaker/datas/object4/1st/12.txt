2.1.4. Encoding declarations¶
If a comment in the first or second line of the Python script matches the
regular expression coding[=:]\s*([-\w.]+), this comment is processed as an
encoding declaration; the first group of this expression names the encoding of
the source code file. The encoding declaration must appear on a line of its
own. If it is the second line, the first line must also be a comment-only line.
The recommended forms of an encoding expression are
# -*- coding: <encoding-name> -*-


which is recognized also by GNU Emacs, and
# vim:fileencoding=<encoding-name>


which is recognized by Bram Moolenaar’s VIM.
If no encoding declaration is found, the default encoding is UTF-8.  In
addition, if the first bytes of the file are the UTF-8 byte-order mark
(b'\xef\xbb\xbf'), the declared file encoding is UTF-8 (this is supported,
among others, by Microsoft’s notepad).
If an encoding is declared, the encoding name must be recognized by Python. The
encoding is used for all lexical analysis, including string literals, comments
and identifiers.
