<dd><p>Set the garbage collection thresholds (the collection frequency). Setting
<em>threshold0</em> to zero disables collection.</p>
<p>The GC classifies objects into three generations depending on how many
collection sweeps they have survived.  New objects are placed in the youngest
generation (generation <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">0</span></code>).  If an object survives a collection it is moved
into the next older generation.  Since generation <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">2</span></code> is the oldest
generation, objects in that generation remain there after a collection.  In
order to decide when to run, the collector keeps track of the number object
allocations and deallocations since the last collection.  When the number of
allocations minus the number of deallocations exceeds <em>threshold0</em>, collection
starts.  Initially only generation <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">0</span></code> is examined.  If generation <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">0</span></code> has
been examined more than <em>threshold1</em> times since generation <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">1</span></code> has been
examined, then generation <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">1</span></code> is examined as well.  Similarly, <em>threshold2</em>
controls the number of collections of generation <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">1</span></code> before collecting
generation <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">2</span></code>.</p>
