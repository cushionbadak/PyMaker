gc.freeze()¶
Freeze all the objects tracked by gc - move them to a permanent generation
and ignore all the future collections. This can be used before a POSIX
fork() call to make the gc copy-on-write friendly or to speed up collection.
Also collection before a POSIX fork() call may free pages for future
allocation which can cause copy-on-write too so it’s advised to disable gc
in master process and freeze before fork and enable gc in child process.

New in version 3.7.
