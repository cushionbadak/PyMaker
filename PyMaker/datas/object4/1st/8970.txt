j(ump) lineno¶
Set the next line that will be executed.  Only available in the bottom-most
frame.  This lets you jump back and execute code again, or jump forward to
skip code that you don’t want to run.
It should be noted that not all jumps are allowed – for instance it is not
possible to jump into the middle of a for loop or out of a
finally clause.
