statistics.harmonic_mean(data)¶
Return the harmonic mean of data, a sequence or iterator of
real-valued numbers.
The harmonic mean, sometimes called the subcontrary mean, is the
reciprocal of the arithmetic mean() of the reciprocals of the
data. For example, the harmonic mean of three values a, b and c
will be equivalent to 3/(1/a + 1/b + 1/c).
The harmonic mean is a type of average, a measure of the central
location of the data.  It is often appropriate when averaging quantities
which are rates or ratios, for example speeds. For example:
Suppose an investor purchases an equal value of shares in each of
three companies, with P/E (price/earning) ratios of 2.5, 3 and 10.
What is the average P/E ratio for the investor’s portfolio?
>>> harmonic_mean([2.5, 3, 10])  # For an equal investment portfolio.
3.6


Using the arithmetic mean would give an average of about 5.167, which
is too high.
StatisticsError is raised if data is empty, or any element
is less than zero.
