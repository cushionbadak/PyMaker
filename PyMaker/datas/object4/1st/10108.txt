BUILD_MAP_UNPACK_WITH_CALL(count)Â¶
This is similar to BUILD_MAP_UNPACK,
but is used for f(**x, **y, **z) call syntax.  The stack item at
position count + 2 should be the corresponding callable f.

New in version 3.5.


Changed in version 3.6: The position of the callable is determined by adding 2 to the opcode
argument instead of encoding it in the second byte of the argument.
