timedelta.total_seconds()¶
Return the total number of seconds contained in the duration. Equivalent to
td / timedelta(seconds=1). For interval units other than seconds, use the
division form directly (e.g. td / timedelta(microseconds=1)).
Note that for very large time intervals (greater than 270 years on
most platforms) this method will lose microsecond accuracy.

New in version 3.2.
