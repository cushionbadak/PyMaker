join_thread()¶
Join the background thread.  This can only be used after close() has
been called.  It blocks until the background thread exits, ensuring that
all data in the buffer has been flushed to the pipe.
By default if a process is not the creator of the queue then on exit it
will attempt to join the queue’s background thread.  The process can call
cancel_join_thread() to make join_thread() do nothing.
