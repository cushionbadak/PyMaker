class tracemalloc.Traceback¶
Sequence of Frame instances sorted from the oldest frame to the
most recent frame.
A traceback contains at least 1 frame. If the tracemalloc module
failed to get a frame, the filename "<unknown>" at line number 0 is
used.
When a snapshot is taken, tracebacks of traces are limited to
get_traceback_limit() frames. See the take_snapshot() function.
The Trace.traceback attribute is an instance of Traceback
instance.

Changed in version 3.7: Frames are now sorted from the oldest to the most recent, instead of most recent to oldest.



format(limit=None, most_recent_first=False)¶
Format the traceback as a list of lines with newlines. Use the
linecache module to retrieve lines from the source code.
If limit is set, format the limit most recent frames if limit
is positive. Otherwise, format the abs(limit) oldest frames.
If most_recent_first is True, the order of the formatted frames
is reversed, returning the most recent frame first instead of last.
Similar to the traceback.format_tb() function, except that
format() does not include newlines.
Example:
print("Traceback (most recent call first):")
for line in traceback:
    print(line)


Output:
Traceback (most recent call first):
  File "test.py", line 9
    obj = Object()
  File "test.py", line 12
    tb = tracemalloc.get_object_traceback(f())
