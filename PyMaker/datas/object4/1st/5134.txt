exception ssl.SSLError¶
Raised to signal an error from the underlying SSL implementation
(currently provided by the OpenSSL library).  This signifies some
problem in the higher-level encryption and authentication layer that’s
superimposed on the underlying network connection.  This error
is a subtype of OSError.  The error code and message of
SSLError instances are provided by the OpenSSL library.

Changed in version 3.3: SSLError used to be a subtype of socket.error.
