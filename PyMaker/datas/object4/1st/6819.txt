HTTPResponse Objects¶
An HTTPResponse instance wraps the HTTP response from the
server.  It provides access to the request headers and the entity
body.  The response is an iterable object and can be used in a with
statement.

Changed in version 3.5: The io.BufferedIOBase interface is now implemented and
all of its reader operations are supported.



HTTPResponse.read([amt])¶
Reads and returns the response body, or up to the next amt bytes.



HTTPResponse.readinto(b)¶
Reads up to the next len(b) bytes of the response body into the buffer b.
Returns the number of bytes read.

New in version 3.3.




HTTPResponse.getheader(name, default=None)¶
Return the value of the header name, or default if there is no header
matching name.  If there is more than one  header with the name name,
return all of the values joined by ‘, ‘.  If ‘default’ is any iterable other
than a single string, its elements are similarly returned joined by commas.



HTTPResponse.getheaders()¶
Return a list of (header, value) tuples.



HTTPResponse.fileno()¶
Return the fileno of the underlying socket.



HTTPResponse.msg¶
A http.client.HTTPMessage instance containing the response
headers.  http.client.HTTPMessage is a subclass of
email.message.Message.



HTTPResponse.version¶
HTTP protocol version used by server.  10 for HTTP/1.0, 11 for HTTP/1.1.



HTTPResponse.status¶
Status code returned by server.



HTTPResponse.reason¶
Reason phrase returned by server.



HTTPResponse.debuglevel¶
A debugging hook.  If debuglevel is greater than zero, messages
will be printed to stdout as the response is read and parsed.



HTTPResponse.closed¶
Is True if the stream is closed.
