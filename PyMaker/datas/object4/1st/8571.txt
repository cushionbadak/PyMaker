reset_mock(*, return_value=False, side_effect=False)¶
The reset_mock method resets all the call attributes on a mock object:
>>> mock = Mock(return_value=None)
>>> mock('hello')
>>> mock.called
True
>>> mock.reset_mock()
>>> mock.called
False



Changed in version 3.6: Added two keyword only argument to the reset_mock function.

This can be useful where you want to make a series of assertions that
reuse the same object. Note that reset_mock() doesn’t clear the
return value, side_effect or any child attributes you have
set using normal assignment by default. In case you want to reset
return_value or side_effect, then pass the corresponding
parameter as True. Child mocks and the return value mock
(if any) are reset as well.

Note
return_value, and side_effect are keyword only
argument.
