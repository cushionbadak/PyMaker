bisect.bisect_right(a, x, lo=0, hi=len(a))¶

bisect.bisect(a, x, lo=0, hi=len(a))¶
Similar to bisect_left(), but returns an insertion point which comes
after (to the right of) any existing entries of x in a.
The returned insertion point i partitions the array a into two halves so
that all(val <= x for val in a[lo:i]) for the left side and
all(val > x for val in a[i:hi]) for the right side.
