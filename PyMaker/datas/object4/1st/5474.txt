write(bytes)Â¶
Write the bytes in bytes into memory at the current position of the
file pointer and return the number of bytes written (never less than
len(bytes), since if the write fails, a ValueError will be
raised).  The file position is updated to point after the bytes that
were written.  If the mmap was created with ACCESS_READ, then
writing to it will raise a TypeError exception.

Changed in version 3.5: Writable bytes-like object is now accepted.


Changed in version 3.6: The number of bytes written is now returned.
