os.supports_fd¶
A Set object indicating which functions in the
os module permit specifying their path parameter as an open file
descriptor.  Different platforms provide different functionality, and an
option that might work on one might be unsupported on another.  For
consistency’s sakes, functions that support fd always allow specifying
the parameter, but will raise an exception if the functionality is not
actually available.
To check whether a particular function permits specifying an open file
descriptor for its path parameter, use the in operator on
supports_fd. As an example, this expression determines whether
os.chdir() accepts open file descriptors when called on your local
platform:
os.chdir in os.supports_fd



New in version 3.3.
