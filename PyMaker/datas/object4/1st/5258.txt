SSLContext.set_npn_protocols(protocols)Â¶
Specify which protocols the socket should advertise during the SSL/TLS
handshake. It should be a list of strings, like ['http/1.1', 'spdy/2'],
ordered by preference. The selection of a protocol will happen during the
handshake, and will play out according to the Application Layer Protocol Negotiation. After a
successful handshake, the SSLSocket.selected_npn_protocol() method will
return the agreed-upon protocol.
This method will raise NotImplementedError if HAS_NPN is
False.

New in version 3.3.
