exception BaseException¶
The base class for all built-in exceptions.  It is not meant to be directly
inherited by user-defined classes (for that, use Exception).  If
str() is called on an instance of this class, the representation of
the argument(s) to the instance are returned, or the empty string when
there were no arguments.


args¶
The tuple of arguments given to the exception constructor.  Some built-in
exceptions (like OSError) expect a certain number of arguments and
assign a special meaning to the elements of this tuple, while others are
usually called only with a single string giving an error message.



with_traceback(tb)¶
This method sets tb as the new traceback for the exception and returns
the exception object.  It is usually used in exception handling code like
this:
try:
    ...
except SomeException:
    tb = sys.exc_info()[2]
    raise OtherException(...).with_traceback(tb)
