itertools.starmap(function, iterable)¶
Make an iterator that computes the function using arguments obtained from
the iterable.  Used instead of map() when argument parameters are already
grouped in tuples from a single iterable (the data has been “pre-zipped”).  The
difference between map() and starmap() parallels the distinction
between function(a,b) and function(*c). Roughly equivalent to:
def starmap(function, iterable):
    # starmap(pow, [(2,5), (3,2), (10,3)]) --> 32 9 1000
    for args in iterable:
        yield function(*args)
