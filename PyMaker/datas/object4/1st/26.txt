2.4.4. Numeric literals¶
There are three types of numeric literals: integers, floating point numbers, and
imaginary numbers.  There are no complex literals (complex numbers can be formed
by adding a real number and an imaginary number).
Note that numeric literals do not include a sign; a phrase like -1 is
actually an expression composed of the unary operator ‘-‘ and the literal
1.
