locale.normalize(localename)Â¶
Returns a normalized locale code for the given locale name.  The returned locale
code is formatted for use with setlocale().  If normalization fails, the
original name is returned unchanged.
If the given encoding is not known, the function defaults to the default
encoding for the locale code just like setlocale().
