exception socket.timeout¶
A subclass of OSError, this exception is raised when a timeout
occurs on a socket which has had timeouts enabled via a prior call to
settimeout() (or implicitly through
setdefaulttimeout()).  The accompanying value is a string
whose value is currently always “timed out”.

Changed in version 3.3: This class was made a subclass of OSError.
