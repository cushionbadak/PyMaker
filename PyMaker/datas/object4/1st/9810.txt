class ast.NodeVisitor¶
A node visitor base class that walks the abstract syntax tree and calls a
visitor function for every node found.  This function may return a value
which is forwarded by the visit() method.
This class is meant to be subclassed, with the subclass adding visitor
methods.


visit(node)¶
Visit a node.  The default implementation calls the method called
self.visit_classname where classname is the name of the node
class, or generic_visit() if that method doesn’t exist.



generic_visit(node)¶
This visitor calls visit() on all children of the node.
Note that child nodes of nodes that have a custom visitor method won’t be
visited unless the visitor calls generic_visit() or visits them
itself.

Don’t use the NodeVisitor if you want to apply changes to nodes
during traversal.  For this a special visitor exists
(NodeTransformer) that allows modifications.
