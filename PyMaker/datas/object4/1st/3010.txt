os.pipe2(flags)Â¶
Create a pipe with flags set atomically.
flags can be constructed by ORing together one or more of these values:
O_NONBLOCK, O_CLOEXEC.
Return a pair of file descriptors (r, w) usable for reading and writing,
respectively.
Availability: some flavors of Unix.

New in version 3.3.
