--invalidation-mode [timestamp|checked-hash|unchecked-hash]Â¶
Control how the generated byte-code files are invalidated at runtime.
The timestamp value, means that .pyc files with the source timestamp
and size embedded will be generated. The checked-hash and
unchecked-hash values cause hash-based pycs to be generated. Hash-based
pycs embed a hash of the source file contents rather than a timestamp. See
Cached bytecode invalidation for more information on how Python validates
bytecode cache files at runtime.
The default is timestamp if the SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH environment
variable is not set, and checked-hash if the SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH
environment variable is set.
