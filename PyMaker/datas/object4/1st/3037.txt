os.write(fd, str)¶
Write the bytestring in str to file descriptor fd.
Return the number of bytes actually written.

Note
This function is intended for low-level I/O and must be applied to a file
descriptor as returned by os.open() or pipe().  To write a “file
object” returned by the built-in function open() or by popen() or
fdopen(), or sys.stdout or sys.stderr, use its
write() method.


Changed in version 3.5: If the system call is interrupted and the signal handler does not raise an
exception, the function now retries the system call instead of raising an
InterruptedError exception (see PEP 475 for the rationale).
