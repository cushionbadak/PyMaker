Inheritance¶
When the dataclass is being created by the dataclass() decorator,
it looks through all of the class’s base classes in reverse MRO (that
is, starting at object) and, for each dataclass that it finds,
adds the fields from that base class to an ordered mapping of fields.
After all of the base class fields are added, it adds its own fields
to the ordered mapping.  All of the generated methods will use this
combined, calculated ordered mapping of fields.  Because the fields
are in insertion order, derived classes override base classes.  An
example:
@dataclass
class Base:
    x: Any = 15.0
    y: int = 0

@dataclass
class C(Base):
    z: int = 10
    x: int = 15


The final list of fields is, in order, x, y, z.  The final
type of x is int, as specified in class C.
The generated __init__() method for C will look like:
def __init__(self, x: int = 15, y: int = 0, z: int = 10):
