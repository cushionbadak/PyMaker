is_package(fullname)Â¶
Concrete implementation of InspectLoader.is_package(). A module
is determined to be a package if its file path (as provided by
ExecutionLoader.get_filename()) is a file named
__init__ when the file extension is removed and the module name
itself does not end in __init__.
