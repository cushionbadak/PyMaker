FORMAT_VALUE(flags)Â¶
Used for implementing formatted literal strings (f-strings).  Pops
an optional fmt_spec from the stack, then a required value.
flags is interpreted as follows:

(flags & 0x03) == 0x00: value is formatted as-is.
(flags & 0x03) == 0x01: call str() on value before
formatting it.
(flags & 0x03) == 0x02: call repr() on value before
formatting it.
(flags & 0x03) == 0x03: call ascii() on value before
formatting it.
(flags & 0x04) == 0x04: pop fmt_spec from the stack and use
it, else use an empty fmt_spec.

Formatting is performed using PyObject_Format().  The
result is pushed on the stack.

New in version 3.6.
