hash.update(data)Â¶
Update the hash object with the bytes-like object.
Repeated calls are equivalent to a single call with the
concatenation of all the arguments: m.update(a); m.update(b) is
equivalent to m.update(a+b).

Changed in version 3.1: The Python GIL is released to allow other threads to run while hash
updates on data larger than 2047 bytes is taking place when using hash
algorithms supplied by OpenSSL.
