class typing.TextÂ¶
Text is an alias for str. It is provided to supply a forward
compatible path for Python 2 code: in Python 2, Text is an alias for
unicode.
Use Text to indicate that a value must contain a unicode string in
a manner that is compatible with both Python 2 and Python 3:
def add_unicode_checkmark(text: Text) -> Text:
    return text + u' \u2713'



New in version 3.5.2.
