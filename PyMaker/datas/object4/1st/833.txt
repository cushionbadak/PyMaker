difflib.diff_bytes(dfunc, a, b, fromfile=b'', tofile=b'', fromfiledate=b'', tofiledate=b'', n=3, lineterm=b'\n')Â¶
Compare a and b (lists of bytes objects) using dfunc; yield a
sequence of delta lines (also bytes) in the format returned by dfunc.
dfunc must be a callable, typically either unified_diff() or
context_diff().
Allows you to compare data with unknown or inconsistent encoding. All
inputs except n must be bytes objects, not str. Works by losslessly
converting all inputs (except n) to str, and calling dfunc(a, b,
fromfile, tofile, fromfiledate, tofiledate, n, lineterm). The output of
dfunc is then converted back to bytes, so the delta lines that you
receive have the same unknown/inconsistent encodings as a and b.

New in version 3.5.
