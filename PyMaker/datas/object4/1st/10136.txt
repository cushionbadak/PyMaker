LOAD_METHOD(namei)Â¶
Loads a method named co_names[namei] from TOS object. TOS is popped and
method and TOS are pushed when interpreter can call unbound method directly.
TOS will be used as the first argument (self) by CALL_METHOD.
Otherwise, NULL and  method is pushed (method is bound method or
something else).

New in version 3.7.
