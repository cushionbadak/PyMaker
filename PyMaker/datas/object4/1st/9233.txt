sys.meta_path¶
A list of meta path finder objects that have their
find_spec() methods called to see if one
of the objects can find the module to be imported. The
find_spec() method is called with at
least the absolute name of the module being imported. If the module to be
imported is contained in a package, then the parent package’s __path__
attribute is passed in as a second argument. The method returns a
module spec, or None if the module cannot be found.

importlib.abc.MetaPathFinder
The abstract base class defining the interface of finder objects on
meta_path.
importlib.machinery.ModuleSpec
The concrete class which
find_spec() should return
instances of.



Changed in version 3.4: Module specs were introduced in Python 3.4, by
PEP 451. Earlier versions of Python looked for a method called
find_module().
This is still called as a fallback if a meta_path entry doesn’t
have a find_spec() method.
