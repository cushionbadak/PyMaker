decompress(data, max_length=-1)Â¶
Decompress data (a bytes-like object), returning
uncompressed data as bytes. Some of data may be buffered
internally, for use in later calls to decompress(). The
returned data should be concatenated with the output of any
previous calls to decompress().
If max_length is nonnegative, returns at most max_length
bytes of decompressed data. If this limit is reached and further
output can be produced, the needs_input attribute will
be set to False. In this case, the next call to
decompress() may provide data as b'' to obtain
more of the output.
If all of the input data was decompressed and returned (either
because this was less than max_length bytes, or because
max_length was negative), the needs_input attribute
will be set to True.
Attempting to decompress data after the end of stream is reached
raises an EOFError.  Any data found after the end of the
stream is ignored and saved in the unused_data attribute.

Changed in version 3.5: Added the max_length parameter.
