class importlib.machinery.BuiltinImporterÂ¶
An importer for built-in modules. All known built-in modules are
listed in sys.builtin_module_names. This class implements the
importlib.abc.MetaPathFinder and
importlib.abc.InspectLoader ABCs.
Only class methods are defined by this class to alleviate the need for
instantiation.

Changed in version 3.5: As part of PEP 489, the builtin importer now implements
Loader.create_module() and Loader.exec_module()
