Multi-threadingÂ¶
FileIO objects are thread-safe to the extent that the operating system
calls (such as read(2) under Unix) they wrap are thread-safe too.
Binary buffered objects (instances of BufferedReader,
BufferedWriter, BufferedRandom and BufferedRWPair)
protect their internal structures using a lock; it is therefore safe to call
them from multiple threads at once.
TextIOWrapper objects are not thread-safe.
