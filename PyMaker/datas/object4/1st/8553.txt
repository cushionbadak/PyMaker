setUpModule and tearDownModuleÂ¶
These should be implemented as functions:
def setUpModule():
    createConnection()

def tearDownModule():
    closeConnection()


If an exception is raised in a setUpModule then none of the tests in the
module will be run and the tearDownModule will not be run. If the exception is a
SkipTest exception then the module will be reported as having been skipped
instead of as an error.
