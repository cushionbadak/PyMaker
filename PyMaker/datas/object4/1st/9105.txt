filter_traces(filters)Â¶
Create a new Snapshot instance with a filtered traces
sequence, filters is a list of DomainFilter and
Filter instances.  If filters is an empty list, return a new
Snapshot instance with a copy of the traces.
All inclusive filters are applied at once, a trace is ignored if no
inclusive filters match it. A trace is ignored if at least one exclusive
filter matches it.

Changed in version 3.6: DomainFilter instances are now also accepted in filters.
