__round__()Â¶

__round__(ndigits)
The first version returns the nearest int to self,
rounding half to even. The second version rounds self to the
nearest multiple of Fraction(1, 10**ndigits) (logically, if
ndigits is negative), again rounding half toward even.  This
method can also be accessed through the round() function.
