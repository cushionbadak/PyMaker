oss_audio_device.setfmt(format)¶
Try to set the current audio format to format—see getfmts() for a
list.  Returns the audio format that the device was set to, which may not be the
requested format.  May also be used to return the current audio format—do this
by passing an “audio format” of AFMT_QUERY.
