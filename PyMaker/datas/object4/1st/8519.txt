testNamePatternsÂ¶
List of Unix shell-style wildcard test name patterns that test methods
have to match to be included in test suites (see -v option).
If this attribute is not None (the default), all test methods to be
included in test suites must match one of the patterns in this list.
Note that matches are always performed using fnmatch.fnmatchcase(),
so unlike patterns passed to the -v option, simple substring patterns
will have to be converted using * wildcards.
This affects all the loadTestsFrom*() methods.

New in version 3.7.
