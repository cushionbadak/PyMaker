@asyncio.coroutineÂ¶
Decorator to mark generator-based coroutines.
This decorator enables legacy generator-based coroutines to be
compatible with async/await code:
@asyncio.coroutine
def old_style_coroutine():
    yield from asyncio.sleep(1)

async def main():
    await old_style_coroutine()


This decorator is deprecated and is scheduled for removal in
Python 3.10.
This decorator should not be used for async def
coroutines.
