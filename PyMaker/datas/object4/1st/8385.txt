class doctest.DocTestParser¶
A processing class used to extract interactive examples from a string, and use
them to create a DocTest object.
DocTestParser defines the following methods:


get_doctest(string, globs, name, filename, lineno)¶
Extract all doctest examples from the given string, and collect them into a
DocTest object.
globs, name, filename, and lineno are attributes for the new
DocTest object.  See the documentation for DocTest for more
information.



get_examples(string, name='<string>')¶
Extract all doctest examples from the given string, and return them as a list
of Example objects.  Line numbers are 0-based.  The optional argument
name is a name identifying this string, and is only used for error messages.



parse(string, name='<string>')¶
Divide the given string into examples and intervening text, and return them as
a list of alternating Examples and strings. Line numbers for the
Examples are 0-based.  The optional argument name is a name
identifying this string, and is only used for error messages.
