tempfile.mktemp(suffix='', prefix='tmp', dir=None)Â¶

Deprecated since version 2.3: Use mkstemp() instead.

Return an absolute pathname of a file that did not exist at the time the
call is made.  The prefix, suffix, and dir arguments are similar
to those of mkstemp(), except that bytes file names, suffix=None
and prefix=None are not supported.

Warning
Use of this function may introduce a security hole in your program.  By
the time you get around to doing anything with the file name it returns,
someone else may have beaten you to the punch.  mktemp() usage can
be replaced easily with NamedTemporaryFile(), passing it the
delete=False parameter:
>>> f = NamedTemporaryFile(delete=False)
>>> f.name
'/tmp/tmptjujjt'
>>> f.write(b"Hello World!\n")
13
>>> f.close()
>>> os.unlink(f.name)
>>> os.path.exists(f.name)
False
