os.path.join(path, *paths)Â¶
Join one or more path components intelligently.  The return value is the
concatenation of path and any members of *paths with exactly one
directory separator (os.sep) following each non-empty part except the
last, meaning that the result will only end in a separator if the last
part is empty.  If a component is an absolute path, all previous
components are thrown away and joining continues from the absolute path
component.
On Windows, the drive letter is not reset when an absolute path component
(e.g., r'\foo') is encountered.  If a component contains a drive
letter, all previous components are thrown away and the drive letter is
reset.  Note that since there is a current directory for each drive,
os.path.join("c:", "foo") represents a path relative to the current
directory on drive C: (c:foo), not c:\foo.

Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a path-like object for path and paths.
