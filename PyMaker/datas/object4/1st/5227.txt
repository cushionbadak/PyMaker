class ssl.SSLSocket(socket.socket)Â¶
SSL sockets provide the following methods of Socket Objects:

accept()
bind()
close()
connect()
detach()
fileno()
getpeername(), getsockname()
getsockopt(), setsockopt()
gettimeout(), settimeout(),
setblocking()
listen()
makefile()
recv(), recv_into()
(but passing a non-zero flags argument is not allowed)
send(), sendall() (with
the same limitation)
sendfile() (but os.sendfile will be used
for plain-text sockets only, else send() will be used)
shutdown()

However, since the SSL (and TLS) protocol has its own framing atop
of TCP, the SSL sockets abstraction can, in certain respects, diverge from
the specification of normal, OS-level sockets.  See especially the
notes on non-blocking sockets.
Instances of SSLSocket must be created using the
SSLContext.wrap_socket() method.

Changed in version 3.5: The sendfile() method was added.


Changed in version 3.5: The shutdown() does not reset the socket timeout each time bytes
are received or sent. The socket timeout is now to maximum total duration
of the shutdown.


Deprecated since version 3.6: It is deprecated to create a SSLSocket instance directly, use
SSLContext.wrap_socket() to wrap a socket.


Changed in version 3.7: SSLSocket instances must to created with
wrap_socket(). In earlier versions, it was possible
to create instances directly. This was never documented or officially
supported.
