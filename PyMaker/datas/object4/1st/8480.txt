addTypeEqualityFunc(typeobj, function)¶
Registers a type-specific method called by assertEqual() to check
if two objects of exactly the same typeobj (not subclasses) compare
equal.  function must take two positional arguments and a third msg=None
keyword argument just as assertEqual() does.  It must raise
self.failureException(msg) when inequality
between the first two parameters is detected – possibly providing useful
information and explaining the inequalities in details in the error
message.

New in version 3.1.
