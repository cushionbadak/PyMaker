Cmd ExampleÂ¶
The cmd module is mainly useful for building custom shells that let a
user work with a program interactively.
This section presents a simple example of how to build a shell around a few of
the commands in the turtle module.
Basic turtle commands such as forward() are added to a
Cmd subclass with method named do_forward().  The argument is
converted to a number and dispatched to the turtle module.  The docstring is
used in the help utility provided by the shell.
The example also includes a basic record and playback facility implemented with
the precmd() method which is responsible for converting the input to
lowercase and writing the commands to a file.  The do_playback() method
reads the file and adds the recorded commands to the cmdqueue for
immediate playback:
import cmd, sys
from turtle import *

class TurtleShell(cmd.Cmd):
    intro = 'Welcome to the turtle shell.   Type help or ? to list commands.\n'
    prompt = '(turtle) '
    file = None

    # ----- basic turtle commands -----

        'Move the turtle forward by the specified distance:  FORWARD 10'
        forward(*parse(arg))
    def do_right(self, arg):
        'Turn turtle right by given number of degrees:  RIGHT 20'
        right(*parse(arg))
    def do_left(self, arg):
        'Turn turtle left by given number of degrees:  LEFT 90'
        left(*parse(arg))
    def do_goto(self, arg):
        'Move turtle to an absolute position with changing orientation.  GOTO 100 200'
        goto(*parse(arg))

        home()

        print('Current heading is %d\n' % (heading(),))

        print('Thank you for using Turtle')
        self.close()
        bye()
        return True

    # ----- record and playback -----
    def do_record(self, arg):
        'Save future commands to filename:  RECORD rose.cmd'
        self.file = open(arg, 'w')
    def do_playback(self, arg):
        'Playback commands from a file:  PLAYBACK rose.cmd'
        self.close()
        with open(arg) as f:
            self.cmdqueue.extend(f.read().splitlines())
    def precmd(self, line):
        line = line.lower()
        if self.file and 'playback' not in line:

    return tuple(map(int, arg.split()))

Here is a sample session with the turtle shell showing the help functions, using
blank lines to repeat commands, and the simple record and playback facility:
Welcome to the turtle shell.   Type help or ? to list commands.

(turtle) ?
