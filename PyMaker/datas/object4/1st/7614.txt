wave.open(file, mode=None)¶
If file is a string, open the file by that name, otherwise treat it as a
file-like object.  mode can be:

'rb'
Read only mode.
'wb'
Write only mode.

Note that it does not allow read/write WAV files.
A mode of 'rb' returns a Wave_read object, while a mode of
'wb' returns a Wave_write object.  If mode is omitted and a
file-like object is passed as file, file.mode is used as the default
value for mode.
If you pass in a file-like object, the wave object will not close it when its
close() method is called; it is the caller’s responsibility to close
the file object.
The open() function may be used in a with statement.  When
the with block completes, the Wave_read.close() or Wave_write.close() method is called.

Changed in version 3.4: Added support for unseekable files.
