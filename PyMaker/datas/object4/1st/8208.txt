tixCommand.tix_getimage(self, name)Â¶
Locates an image file of the name name.xpm, name.xbm or
name.ppm in one of the bitmap directories (see the
tix_addbitmapdir() method above). If more than one file with the same name
(but different extensions) exist, then the image type is chosen according to the
depth of the X display: xbm images are chosen on monochrome displays and color
images are chosen on color displays. By using tix_getimage(), you can
avoid hard coding the pathnames of the image files in your application. When
successful, this method returns the name of the newly created image, which can
be used to configure the image option of the Tk and Tix widgets.
