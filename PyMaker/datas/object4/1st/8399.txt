class doctest.OutputChecker¶
A class used to check the whether the actual output from a doctest example
matches the expected output.  OutputChecker defines two methods:
check_output(), which compares a given pair of outputs, and returns true
if they match; and output_difference(), which returns a string describing
the differences between two outputs.
OutputChecker defines the following methods:


check_output(want, got, optionflags)¶
Return True iff the actual output from an example (got) matches the
expected output (want).  These strings are always considered to match if
they are identical; but depending on what option flags the test runner is
using, several non-exact match types are also possible.  See section
Option Flags for more information about option flags.



output_difference(example, got, optionflags)¶
Return a string describing the differences between the expected output for a
given example (example) and the actual output (got).  optionflags is the
set of option flags used to compare want and got.
