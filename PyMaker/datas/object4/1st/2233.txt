tempfile.SpooledTemporaryFile(max_size=0, mode='w+b', buffering=None, encoding=None, newline=None, suffix=None, prefix=None, dir=None)¶
This function operates exactly as TemporaryFile() does, except that
data is spooled in memory until the file size exceeds max_size, or
until the file’s fileno() method is called, at which point the
contents are written to disk and operation proceeds as with
TemporaryFile().
The resulting file has one additional method, rollover(), which
causes the file to roll over to an on-disk file regardless of its size.
The returned object is a file-like object whose _file attribute
is either an io.BytesIO or io.StringIO object (depending on
whether binary or text mode was specified) or a true file
object, depending on whether rollover() has been called.  This
file-like object can be used in a with statement, just like
a normal file.

Changed in version 3.3: the truncate method now accepts a size argument.
