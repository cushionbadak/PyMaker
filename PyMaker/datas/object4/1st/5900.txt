MMDF¶


class mailbox.MMDF(path, factory=None, create=True)¶
A subclass of Mailbox for mailboxes in MMDF format. Parameter factory
is a callable object that accepts a file-like message representation (which
behaves as if opened in binary mode) and returns a custom representation. If
factory is None, MMDFMessage is used as the default message
representation. If create is True, the mailbox is created if it does not
exist.
MMDF is a single-file mailbox format invented for the Multichannel Memorandum
Distribution Facility, a mail transfer agent. Each message is in the same
form as an mbox message but is bracketed before and after by lines containing
four Control-A ('\001') characters. As with the mbox format, the
beginning of each message is indicated by a line whose first five characters
are “From “, but additional occurrences of “From ” are not transformed to
“>From ” when storing messages because the extra message separator lines
prevent mistaking such occurrences for the starts of subsequent messages.
Some Mailbox methods implemented by MMDF deserve special
remarks:


get_file(key)¶
Using the file after calling flush() or close() on the
MMDF instance may yield unpredictable results or raise an
exception.



lock()¶

unlock()¶
Three locking mechanisms are used—dot locking and, if available, the
flock() and lockf() system calls.
