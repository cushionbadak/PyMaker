socket.connect_ex(address)¶
Like connect(address), but return an error indicator instead of raising an
exception for errors returned by the C-level connect() call (other
problems, such as “host not found,” can still raise exceptions).  The error
indicator is 0 if the operation succeeded, otherwise the value of the
errno variable.  This is useful to support, for example, asynchronous
connects.
