Expat error constants¶
The following constants are provided in the xml.parsers.expat.errors
module.  These constants are useful in interpreting some of the attributes of
the ExpatError exception objects raised when an error has occurred.
Since for backwards compatibility reasons, the constants’ value is the error
message and not the numeric error code, you do this by comparing its
code attribute with
errors.codes[errors.XML_ERROR_CONSTANT_NAME].
The errors module has the following attributes:


xml.parsers.expat.errors.codes¶
A dictionary mapping numeric error codes to their string descriptions.

New in version 3.2.




xml.parsers.expat.errors.messages¶
A dictionary mapping string descriptions to their error codes.

New in version 3.2.

xml.parsers.expat.errors.XML_ERROR_ATTRIBUTE_EXTERNAL_ENTITY_REF¶
An entity reference in an attribute value referred to an external entity instead
of an internal entity.



xml.parsers.expat.errors.XML_ERROR_BAD_CHAR_REF¶
A character reference referred to a character which is illegal in XML (for
example, character 0, or ‘&#0;’).



xml.parsers.expat.errors.XML_ERROR_BINARY_ENTITY_REF¶
An entity reference referred to an entity which was declared with a notation, so
cannot be parsed.



xml.parsers.expat.errors.XML_ERROR_DUPLICATE_ATTRIBUTE¶
An attribute was used more than once in a start tag.



xml.parsers.expat.errors.XML_ERROR_INCORRECT_ENCODING¶



xml.parsers.expat.errors.XML_ERROR_INVALID_TOKEN¶
Raised when an input byte could not properly be assigned to a character; for
example, a NUL byte (value 0) in a UTF-8 input stream.



xml.parsers.expat.errors.XML_ERROR_JUNK_AFTER_DOC_ELEMENT¶
Something other than whitespace occurred after the document element.



xml.parsers.expat.errors.XML_ERROR_MISPLACED_XML_PI¶
An XML declaration was found somewhere other than the start of the input data.



xml.parsers.expat.errors.XML_ERROR_NO_ELEMENTS¶
The document contains no elements (XML requires all documents to contain exactly
one top-level element)..



xml.parsers.expat.errors.XML_ERROR_NO_MEMORY¶
Expat was not able to allocate memory internally.



xml.parsers.expat.errors.XML_ERROR_PARAM_ENTITY_REF¶
A parameter entity reference was found where it was not allowed.



xml.parsers.expat.errors.XML_ERROR_PARTIAL_CHAR¶
An incomplete character was found in the input.



xml.parsers.expat.errors.XML_ERROR_RECURSIVE_ENTITY_REF¶
An entity reference contained another reference to the same entity; possibly via
a different name, and possibly indirectly.



xml.parsers.expat.errors.XML_ERROR_SYNTAX¶
Some unspecified syntax error was encountered.



xml.parsers.expat.errors.XML_ERROR_TAG_MISMATCH¶
An end tag did not match the innermost open start tag.



xml.parsers.expat.errors.XML_ERROR_UNCLOSED_TOKEN¶
Some token (such as a start tag) was not closed before the end of the stream or
the next token was encountered.



xml.parsers.expat.errors.XML_ERROR_UNDEFINED_ENTITY¶
A reference was made to an entity which was not defined.



xml.parsers.expat.errors.XML_ERROR_UNKNOWN_ENCODING¶
The document encoding is not supported by Expat.



xml.parsers.expat.errors.XML_ERROR_UNCLOSED_CDATA_SECTION¶
A CDATA marked section was not closed.



xml.parsers.expat.errors.XML_ERROR_EXTERNAL_ENTITY_HANDLING¶



xml.parsers.expat.errors.XML_ERROR_NOT_STANDALONE¶
The parser determined that the document was not “standalone” though it declared
itself to be in the XML declaration, and the NotStandaloneHandler was
set and returned 0.



xml.parsers.expat.errors.XML_ERROR_UNEXPECTED_STATE¶



xml.parsers.expat.errors.XML_ERROR_ENTITY_DECLARED_IN_PE¶



xml.parsers.expat.errors.XML_ERROR_FEATURE_REQUIRES_XML_DTD¶
An operation was requested that requires DTD support to be compiled in, but
Expat was configured without DTD support.  This should never be reported by a
standard build of the xml.parsers.expat module.



xml.parsers.expat.errors.XML_ERROR_CANT_CHANGE_FEATURE_ONCE_PARSING¶
A behavioral change was requested after parsing started that can only be changed
before parsing has started.  This is (currently) only raised by
UseForeignDTD().



xml.parsers.expat.errors.XML_ERROR_UNBOUND_PREFIX¶
An undeclared prefix was found when namespace processing was enabled.



xml.parsers.expat.errors.XML_ERROR_UNDECLARING_PREFIX¶
The document attempted to remove the namespace declaration associated with a
prefix.



xml.parsers.expat.errors.XML_ERROR_INCOMPLETE_PE¶
A parameter entity contained incomplete markup.



xml.parsers.expat.errors.XML_ERROR_XML_DECL¶
The document contained no document element at all.



xml.parsers.expat.errors.XML_ERROR_TEXT_DECL¶
There was an error parsing a text declaration in an external entity.



xml.parsers.expat.errors.XML_ERROR_PUBLICID¶
Characters were found in the public id that are not allowed.



xml.parsers.expat.errors.XML_ERROR_SUSPENDED¶
The requested operation was made on a suspended parser, but isn’t allowed.  This
includes attempts to provide additional input or to stop the parser.



xml.parsers.expat.errors.XML_ERROR_NOT_SUSPENDED¶
An attempt to resume the parser was made when the parser had not been suspended.



xml.parsers.expat.errors.XML_ERROR_ABORTED¶
This should not be reported to Python applications.



xml.parsers.expat.errors.XML_ERROR_FINISHED¶
The requested operation was made on a parser which was finished parsing input,
but isn’t allowed.  This includes attempts to provide additional input or to
stop the parser.



xml.parsers.expat.errors.XML_ERROR_SUSPEND_PE¶

[1]The encoding string included in XML output should conform to the
appropriate standards. For example, “UTF-8” is valid, but “UTF8” is
not. See https://www.w3.org/TR/2006/REC-xml11-20060816/#NT-EncodingDecl
and https://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets/character-sets.xhtml.
