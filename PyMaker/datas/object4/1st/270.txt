7.10. The continue statementÂ¶

continue_stmt ::=  "continue"

continue may only occur syntactically nested in a for or
while loop, but not nested in a function or class definition or
finally clause within that loop.  It continues with the next
cycle of the nearest enclosing loop.
When continue passes control out of a try statement with a
finally clause, that finally clause is executed before
really starting the next loop cycle.
