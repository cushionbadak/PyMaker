Exceptions¶


exception ssl.SSLError¶
Raised to signal an error from the underlying SSL implementation
(currently provided by the OpenSSL library).  This signifies some
problem in the higher-level encryption and authentication layer that’s
superimposed on the underlying network connection.  This error
is a subtype of OSError.  The error code and message of
SSLError instances are provided by the OpenSSL library.

Changed in version 3.3: SSLError used to be a subtype of socket.error.



library¶
A string mnemonic designating the OpenSSL submodule in which the error
occurred, such as SSL, PEM or X509.  The range of possible
values depends on the OpenSSL version.

New in version 3.3.




reason¶
A string mnemonic designating the reason this error occurred, for
example CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED.  The range of possible
values depends on the OpenSSL version.

New in version 3.3.





exception ssl.SSLZeroReturnError¶
A subclass of SSLError raised when trying to read or write and
the SSL connection has been closed cleanly.  Note that this doesn’t
mean that the underlying transport (read TCP) has been closed.

New in version 3.3.




exception ssl.SSLWantReadError¶
A subclass of SSLError raised by a non-blocking SSL socket when trying to read or write data, but more data needs
to be received on the underlying TCP transport before the request can be
fulfilled.

New in version 3.3.




exception ssl.SSLWantWriteError¶
A subclass of SSLError raised by a non-blocking SSL socket when trying to read or write data, but more data needs
to be sent on the underlying TCP transport before the request can be
fulfilled.

New in version 3.3.




exception ssl.SSLSyscallError¶
A subclass of SSLError raised when a system error was encountered
while trying to fulfill an operation on a SSL socket.  Unfortunately,
there is no easy way to inspect the original errno number.

New in version 3.3.




exception ssl.SSLEOFError¶
A subclass of SSLError raised when the SSL connection has been
terminated abruptly.  Generally, you shouldn’t try to reuse the underlying
transport when this error is encountered.

New in version 3.3.




exception ssl.SSLCertVerificationError¶
A subclass of SSLError raised when certificate validation has
failed.

New in version 3.7.



verify_code¶
A numeric error number that denotes the verification error.



verify_message¶
A human readable string of the verification error.




exception ssl.CertificateError¶
An alias for SSLCertVerificationError.

Changed in version 3.7: The exception is now an alias for SSLCertVerificationError.
