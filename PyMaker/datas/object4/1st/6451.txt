xmlparser.CharacterDataHandler(data)Â¶
Called for character data.  This will be called for normal character data, CDATA
marked content, and ignorable whitespace.  Applications which must distinguish
these cases can use the StartCdataSectionHandler,
EndCdataSectionHandler, and ElementDeclHandler callbacks to
collect the required information.
