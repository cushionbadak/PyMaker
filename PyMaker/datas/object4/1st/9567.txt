InteractiveInterpreter.runsource(source, filename="<input>", symbol="single")Â¶
Compile and run some source in the interpreter. Arguments are the same as for
compile_command(); the default for filename is '<input>', and for
symbol is 'single'.  One several things can happen:

The input is incorrect; compile_command() raised an exception
(SyntaxError or OverflowError).  A syntax traceback will be
printed by calling the showsyntaxerror() method.  runsource()
returns False.
The input is incomplete, and more input is required; compile_command()
returned None. runsource() returns True.
The input is complete; compile_command() returned a code object.  The
code is executed by calling the runcode() (which also handles run-time
exceptions, except for SystemExit). runsource() returns False.

The return value can be used to decide whether to use sys.ps1 or sys.ps2
to prompt the next line.
