test.support.check_impl_detail(**guards)¶
Use this check to guard CPython’s implementation-specific tests or to
run them only on the implementations guarded by the arguments:
check_impl_detail()               # Only on CPython (default).
check_impl_detail(jython=True)    # Only on Jython.
check_impl_detail(cpython=False)  # Everywhere except CPython.
