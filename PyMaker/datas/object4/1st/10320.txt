winreg.LoadKey(key, sub_key, file_name)¶
Creates a subkey under the specified key and stores registration information
from a specified file into that subkey.
key is a handle returned by ConnectRegistry() or one of the constants
HKEY_USERS or HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE.
sub_key is a string that identifies the subkey to load.
file_name is the name of the file to load registry data from. This file must
have been created with the SaveKey() function. Under the file allocation
table (FAT) file system, the filename may not have an extension.
A call to LoadKey() fails if the calling process does not have the
SE_RESTORE_PRIVILEGE privilege.  Note that privileges are different
from permissions – see the RegLoadKey documentation for
more details.
If key is a handle returned by ConnectRegistry(), then the path
specified in file_name is relative to the remote computer.
