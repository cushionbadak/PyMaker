winsound.SND_ALIASÂ¶
The sound parameter is a sound association name from the registry.  If the
registry contains no such name, play the system default sound unless
SND_NODEFAULT is also specified. If no default sound is registered,
raise RuntimeError. Do not use with SND_FILENAME.
All Win32 systems support at least the following; most systems support many
more:






PlaySound() name
Corresponding Control Panel Sound name



'SystemAsterisk'
Asterisk

'SystemExclamation'
Exclamation

'SystemExit'
Exit Windows

'SystemHand'
Critical Stop

'SystemQuestion'
Question



For example:
import winsound
# Play Windows exit sound.
winsound.PlaySound("SystemExit", winsound.SND_ALIAS)

# Probably play Windows default sound, if any is registered (because
# "*" probably isn't the registered name of any sound).
winsound.PlaySound("*", winsound.SND_ALIAS)
