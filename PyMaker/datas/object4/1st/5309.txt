TLS 1.3Â¶

New in version 3.7.

Python has provisional and experimental support for TLS 1.3 with OpenSSL
1.1.1.  The new protocol behaves slightly differently than previous version
of TLS/SSL.  Some new TLS 1.3 features are not yet available.

TLS 1.3 uses a disjunct set of cipher suites. All AES-GCM and
ChaCha20 cipher suites are enabled by default.  The method
SSLContext.set_ciphers() cannot enable or disable any TLS 1.3
ciphers yet, but SSLContext.get_ciphers() returns them.
Session tickets are no longer sent as part of the initial handshake and
are handled differently.  SSLSocket.session and SSLSession
are not compatible with TLS 1.3.
Client-side certificates are also no longer verified during the initial
handshake.  A server can request a certificate at any time.  Clients
process certificate requests while they send or receive application data
from the server.
TLS 1.3 features like early data, deferred TLS client cert request,
signature algorithm configuration, and rekeying are not supported yet.
