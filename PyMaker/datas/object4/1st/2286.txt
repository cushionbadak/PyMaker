shutil.register_archive_format(name, function[, extra_args[, description]])Â¶
Register an archiver for the format name.
function is the callable that will be used to unpack archives. The callable
will receive the base_name of the file to create, followed by the
base_dir (which defaults to os.curdir) to start archiving from.
Further arguments are passed as keyword arguments: owner, group,
dry_run and logger (as passed in make_archive()).
If given, extra_args is a sequence of (name, value) pairs that will be
used as extra keywords arguments when the archiver callable is used.
description is used by get_archive_formats() which returns the
list of archivers.  Defaults to an empty string.
