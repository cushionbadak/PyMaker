docs:


SSLContext.wrap_bio(incoming, outgoing, server_side=False, server_hostname=None, session=None)Â¶
Wrap the BIO objects incoming and outgoing and return an instance of
attr:SSLContext.sslobject_class (default SSLObject). The SSL
routines will read input data from the incoming BIO and write data to the
outgoing BIO.
The server_side, server_hostname and session parameters have the
same meaning as in SSLContext.wrap_socket().

Changed in version 3.6: session argument was added.


Changed in version 3.7: The method returns on instance of SSLContext.sslobject_class
instead of hard-coded SSLObject.
