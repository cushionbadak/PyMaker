<dd><p>This class implements reentrant lock objects.  A reentrant lock must be
released by the thread that acquired it.  Once a thread has acquired a
reentrant lock, the same thread may acquire it again without blocking; the
thread must release it once for each time it has acquired it.</p>
<p>Note that <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">RLock</span></code> is actually a factory function which returns an instance
of the most efficient version of the concrete RLock class that is supported
by the platform.</p>

<dd><p>Acquire a lock, blocking or non-blocking.</p>
<p>When invoked without arguments: if this thread already owns the lock, increment
the recursion level by one, and return immediately.  Otherwise, if another
thread owns the lock, block until the lock is unlocked.  Once the lock is
unlocked (not owned by any thread), then grab ownership, set the recursion level
to one, and return.  If more than one thread is blocked waiting until the lock
is unlocked, only one at a time will be able to grab ownership of the lock.
There is no return value in this case.</p>
<p>When invoked with the <em>blocking</em> argument set to true, do the same thing as when
called without arguments, and return true.</p>
<p>When invoked with the <em>blocking</em> argument set to false, do not block.  If a call
without an argument would block, return false immediately; otherwise, do the
same thing as when called without arguments, and return true.</p>
<p>When invoked with the floating-point <em>timeout</em> argument set to a positive
value, block for at most the number of seconds specified by <em>timeout</em>
and as long as the lock cannot be acquired.  Return true if the lock has
been acquired, false if the timeout has elapsed.</p>

<dd><p>Release a lock, decrementing the recursion level.  If after the decrement it is
zero, reset the lock to unlocked (not owned by any thread), and if any other
threads are blocked waiting for the lock to become unlocked, allow exactly one
of them to proceed.  If after the decrement the recursion level is still
nonzero, the lock remains locked and owned by the calling thread.</p>
<p>Only call this method when the calling thread owns the lock. A
<a class="reference internal" href="exceptions.html#RuntimeError" title="RuntimeError"><code class="xref py py-exc docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">RuntimeError</span></code></a> is raised if this method is called when the lock is
unlocked.</p>
