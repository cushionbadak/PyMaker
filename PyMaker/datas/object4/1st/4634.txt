exception()¶
Return the exception of the Task.
If the wrapped coroutine raised an exception that exception
is returned.  If the wrapped coroutine returned normally
this method returns None.
If the Task has been cancelled, this method raises a
CancelledError exception.
If the Task isn’t done yet, this method raises an
InvalidStateError exception.
