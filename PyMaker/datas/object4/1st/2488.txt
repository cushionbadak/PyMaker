mtimeÂ¶
When decompressing, the value of the last modification time field in
the most recently read header may be read from this attribute, as an
integer.  The initial value before reading any headers is None.
All gzip compressed streams are required to contain this
timestamp field.  Some programs, such as gunzip, make use
of the timestamp.  The format is the same as the return value of
time.time() and the st_mtime attribute of
the object returned by os.stat().
