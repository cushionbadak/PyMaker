docs:


attach(payload)Â¶
Add the given payload to the current payload, which must be None or
a list of Message objects before the call. After the call, the
payload will always be a list of Message objects.  If you want to
set the payload to a scalar object (e.g. a string), use
set_payload() instead.
This is a legacy method.  On the
EmailMessage class its functionality is
replaced by set_content() and the
related make and add methods.
