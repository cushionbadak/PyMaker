formatter.push_font((size, italic, bold, teletype))¶
Change some or all font properties of the writer object.  Properties which are
not set to AS_IS are set to the values passed in while others are
maintained at their current settings.  The writer’s new_font() method is
called with the fully resolved font specification.
