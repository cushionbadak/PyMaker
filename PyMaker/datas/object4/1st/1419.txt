types.MemberDescriptorTypeÂ¶
The type of objects defined in extension modules with PyMemberDef, such
as datetime.timedelta.days.  This type is used as descriptor for simple C
data members which use standard conversion functions; it has the same purpose
as the property type, but for classes defined in extension modules.

CPython implementation detail: In other implementations of Python, this type may be identical to
GetSetDescriptorType.
