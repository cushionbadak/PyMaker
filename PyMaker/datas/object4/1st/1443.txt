pprint.saferepr(object)Â¶
Return a string representation of object, protected against recursive data
structures.  If the representation of object exposes a recursive entry, the
recursive reference will be represented as <Recursion on typename with
id=number>.  The representation is not otherwise formatted.
>>> pprint.saferepr(stuff)
"[<Recursion on list with id=...>, 'spam', 'eggs', 'lumberjack', 'knights', 'ni']"
