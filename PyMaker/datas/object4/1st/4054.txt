Structures and unions¶
Structures and unions must derive from the Structure and Union
base classes which are defined in the ctypes module. Each subclass must
define a _fields_ attribute.  _fields_ must be a list of
2-tuples, containing a field name and a field type.
The field type must be a ctypes type like c_int, or any other
derived ctypes type: structure, union, array, pointer.
Here is a simple example of a POINT structure, which contains two integers named
x and y, and also shows how to initialize a structure in the constructor:
>>> from ctypes import *
>>> class POINT(Structure):
...     _fields_ = [("x", c_int),
...                 ("y", c_int)]
...
>>> point = POINT(10, 20)
>>> print(point.x, point.y)
10 20
>>> point = POINT(y=5)
>>> print(point.x, point.y)
0 5
>>> POINT(1, 2, 3)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ValueError: too many initializers
>>>


You can, however, build much more complicated structures.  A structure can
itself contain other structures by using a structure as a field type.
Here is a RECT structure which contains two POINTs named upperleft and
lowerright:
>>> class RECT(Structure):
...     _fields_ = [("upperleft", POINT),
...                 ("lowerright", POINT)]
...
>>> rc = RECT(point)
>>> print(rc.upperleft.x, rc.upperleft.y)
0 5
>>> print(rc.lowerright.x, rc.lowerright.y)
0 0
>>>


Nested structures can also be initialized in the constructor in several ways:
>>> r = RECT(POINT(1, 2), POINT(3, 4))
>>> r = RECT((1, 2), (3, 4))


Field descriptors can be retrieved from the class, they are useful
for debugging because they can provide useful information:
>>> print(POINT.x)
<Field type=c_long, ofs=0, size=4>
>>> print(POINT.y)
<Field type=c_long, ofs=4, size=4>
>>>



Warning
ctypes does not support passing unions or structures with bit-fields
to functions by value.  While this may work on 32-bit x86, it’s not
guaranteed by the library to work in the general case.  Unions and
structures with bit-fields should always be passed to functions by pointer.
