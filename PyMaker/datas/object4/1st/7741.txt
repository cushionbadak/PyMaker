gettext(message)¶
Look up the message id in the catalog and return the corresponding message
string, as a Unicode string.  If there is no entry in the catalog for the
message id, and a fallback has been set, the look up is forwarded to the
fallback’s gettext() method.  Otherwise, the
message id is returned.
