termios.tcgetattr(fd)Â¶
Return a list containing the tty attributes for file descriptor fd, as
follows: [iflag, oflag, cflag, lflag, ispeed, ospeed, cc] where cc is a
list of the tty special characters (each a string of length 1, except the
items with indices VMIN and VTIME, which are integers when
these fields are defined).  The interpretation of the flags and the speeds as
well as the indexing in the cc array must be done using the symbolic
constants defined in the termios module.
