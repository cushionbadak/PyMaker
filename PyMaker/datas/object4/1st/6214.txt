DocumentType.notationsÂ¶
This is a NamedNodeMap giving the definitions of notations. For
notation names defined more than once, only the first definition is provided
(others are ignored as required by the XML recommendation).  This may be
None if the information is not provided by the parser, or if no notations
are defined.
