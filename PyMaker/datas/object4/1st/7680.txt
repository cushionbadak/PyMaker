oss_audio_device.writeall(data)Â¶
Write a bytes-like object data to the audio device: waits until
the audio device is able to accept data, writes as much data as it will
accept, and repeats until data has been completely written. If the device
is in blocking mode (the default), this has the same effect as
write(); writeall() is only useful in non-blocking mode.  Has
no return value, since the amount of data written is always equal to the
amount of data supplied.

Changed in version 3.5: Writable bytes-like object is now accepted.
