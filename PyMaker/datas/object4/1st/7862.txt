turtle.pencolor(*args)Â¶
Return or set the pencolor.
Four input formats are allowed:

pencolor()
Return the current pencolor as color specification string or
as a tuple (see example).  May be used as input to another
color/pencolor/fillcolor call.
pencolor(colorstring)
Set pencolor to colorstring, which is a Tk color specification string,
such as "red", "yellow", or "#33cc8c".
pencolor((r, g, b))
Set pencolor to the RGB color represented by the tuple of r, g, and
b.  Each of r, g, and b must be in the range 0..colormode, where
colormode is either 1.0 or 255 (see colormode()).
pencolor(r, g, b)

Set pencolor to the RGB color represented by r, g, and b.  Each of
r, g, and b must be in the range 0..colormode.
If turtleshape is a polygon, the outline of that polygon is drawn with the
newly set pencolor.
