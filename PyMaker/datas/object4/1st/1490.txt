PicklingÂ¶
Enumerations can be pickled and unpickled:
>>> from test.test_enum import Fruit
>>> from pickle import dumps, loads
>>> Fruit.TOMATO is loads(dumps(Fruit.TOMATO))
True


The usual restrictions for pickling apply: picklable enums must be defined in
the top level of a module, since unpickling requires them to be importable
from that module.

Note
With pickle protocol version 4 it is possible to easily pickle enums
nested in other classes.

It is possible to modify how Enum members are pickled/unpickled by defining
__reduce_ex__() in the enumeration class.
