os.setxattr(path, attribute, value, flags=0, *, follow_symlinks=True)Â¶
Set the extended filesystem attribute attribute on path to value.
attribute must be a bytes or str with no embedded NULs (directly or
indirectly through the PathLike interface). If it is a str,
it is encoded with the filesystem encoding.  flags may be
XATTR_REPLACE or XATTR_CREATE. If XATTR_REPLACE is
given and the attribute does not exist, EEXISTS will be raised.
If XATTR_CREATE is given and the attribute already exists, the
attribute will not be created and ENODATA will be raised.
This function can support specifying a file descriptor and
not following symlinks.

Note
A bug in Linux kernel versions less than 2.6.39 caused the flags argument
to be ignored on some filesystems.


Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a path-like object for path and attribute.
