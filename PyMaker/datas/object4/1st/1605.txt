Trigonometric functions¶


cmath.acos(x)¶
Return the arc cosine of x. There are two branch cuts: One extends right from
1 along the real axis to ∞, continuous from below. The other extends left from
-1 along the real axis to -∞, continuous from above.



cmath.asin(x)¶
Return the arc sine of x. This has the same branch cuts as acos().



cmath.atan(x)¶
Return the arc tangent of x. There are two branch cuts: One extends from
1j along the imaginary axis to ∞j, continuous from the right. The
other extends from -1j along the imaginary axis to -∞j, continuous
from the left.



cmath.cos(x)¶
Return the cosine of x.



cmath.sin(x)¶
Return the sine of x.



cmath.tan(x)¶
Return the tangent of x.
