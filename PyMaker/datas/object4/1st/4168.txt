class ctypes._Pointer¶
Private, abstract base class for pointers.
Concrete pointer types are created by calling POINTER() with the
type that will be pointed to; this is done automatically by
pointer().
If a pointer points to an array, its elements can be read and
written using standard subscript and slice accesses.  Pointer objects
have no size, so len() will raise TypeError.  Negative
subscripts will read from the memory before the pointer (as in C), and
out-of-range subscripts will probably crash with an access violation (if
you’re lucky).


_type_¶
Specifies the type pointed to.



contents¶
Returns the object to which to pointer points.  Assigning to this
attribute changes the pointer to point to the assigned object.
