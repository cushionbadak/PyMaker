time.perf_counter() → float¶
Return the value (in fractional seconds) of a performance counter, i.e. a
clock with the highest available resolution to measure a short duration.  It
does include time elapsed during sleep and is system-wide.  The reference
point of the returned value is undefined, so that only the difference between
the results of consecutive calls is valid.

New in version 3.3.
