class xml.sax.xmlreader.InputSource(system_id=None)Â¶
Encapsulation of the information needed by the XMLReader to read
entities.
This class may include information about the public identifier, system
identifier, byte stream (possibly with character encoding information) and/or
the character stream of an entity.
Applications will create objects of this class for use in the
XMLReader.parse() method and for returning from
EntityResolver.resolveEntity.
An InputSource belongs to the application, the XMLReader is
not allowed to modify InputSource objects passed to it from the
application, although it may make copies and modify those.
