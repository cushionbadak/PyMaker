assertTrue(expr, msg=None)¶

assertFalse(expr, msg=None)¶
Test that expr is true (or false).
Note that this is equivalent to bool(expr) is True and not to expr
is True (use assertIs(expr, True) for the latter).  This method
should also be avoided when more specific methods are available (e.g.
assertEqual(a, b) instead of assertTrue(a == b)), because they
provide a better error message in case of failure.
