class multiprocessing.BoundedSemaphore([value])¶
A bounded semaphore object: a close analog of
threading.BoundedSemaphore.
A solitary difference from its close analog exists: its acquire method’s
first argument is named block, as is consistent with Lock.acquire().

Note
On Mac OS X, this is indistinguishable from Semaphore because
sem_getvalue() is not implemented on that platform.
