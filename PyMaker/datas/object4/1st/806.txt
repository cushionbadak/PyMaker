Match.lastindexÂ¶
The integer index of the last matched capturing group, or None if no group
was matched at all. For example, the expressions (a)b, ((a)(b)), and
((ab)) will have lastindex == 1 if applied to the string 'ab', while
the expression (a)(b) will have lastindex == 2, if applied to the same
string.
