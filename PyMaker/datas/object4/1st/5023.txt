Many constants of these forms, documented in the Unix documentation on sockets
and/or the IP protocol, are also defined in the socket module. They are
generally used in arguments to the setsockopt() and getsockopt()
methods of socket objects.  In most cases, only those symbols that are defined
in the Unix header files are defined; for a few symbols, default values are
provided.

Changed in version 3.6: SO_DOMAIN, SO_PROTOCOL, SO_PEERSEC, SO_PASSSEC,
TCP_USER_TIMEOUT, TCP_CONGESTION were added.

supports.


Changed in version 3.7: TCP_NOTSENT_LOWAT was added.
On Windows, TCP_KEEPIDLE, TCP_KEEPINTVL appear if run-time Windows
