ExpatError Exceptions¶
ExpatError exceptions have a number of interesting attributes:


ExpatError.code¶
Expat’s internal error number for the specific error.  The
errors.messages dictionary maps
these error numbers to Expat’s error messages.  For example:
from xml.parsers.expat import ParserCreate, ExpatError, errors

p = ParserCreate()
try:
    p.Parse(some_xml_document)
except ExpatError as err:
    print("Error:", errors.messages[err.code])


The errors module also provides error message
constants and a dictionary codes mapping
these messages back to the error codes, see below.



ExpatError.lineno¶
Line number on which the error was detected.  The first line is numbered 1.



ExpatError.offset¶
Character offset into the line where the error occurred.  The first column is
numbered 0.
