PurePath.is_reserved()Â¶
With PureWindowsPath, return True if the path is considered
reserved under Windows, False otherwise.  With PurePosixPath,
False is always returned.
>>> PureWindowsPath('nul').is_reserved()
True
>>> PurePosixPath('nul').is_reserved()
False


File system calls on reserved paths can fail mysteriously or have
unintended effects.
