<dd><p>Terminate the process.  On Unix this is done using the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SIGTERM</span></code> signal;
on Windows <code class="xref c c-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TerminateProcess()</span></code> is used.  Note that exit handlers and
finally clauses, etc., will not be executed.</p>
<p>Note that descendant processes of the process will <em>not</em> be terminated –
they will simply become orphaned.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="first admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p class="last">If this method is used when the associated process is using a pipe or
queue then the pipe or queue is liable to become corrupted and may
become unusable by other process.  Similarly, if the process has
acquired a lock or semaphore etc. then terminating it is liable to
cause other processes to deadlock.</p>
