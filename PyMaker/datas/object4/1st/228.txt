generator.close()¶
Raises a GeneratorExit at the point where the generator function was
paused.  If the generator function then exits gracefully, is already closed,
or raises GeneratorExit (by not catching the exception), close
returns to its caller.  If the generator yields a value, a
RuntimeError is raised.  If the generator raises any other exception,
it is propagated to the caller.  close() does nothing if the generator
has already exited due to an exception or normal exit.
