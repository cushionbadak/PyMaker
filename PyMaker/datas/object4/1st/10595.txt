imp.get_suffixes()Â¶
Return a list of 3-element tuples, each describing a particular type of
module. Each triple has the form (suffix, mode, type), where suffix is
a string to be appended to the module name to form the filename to search
for, mode is the mode string to pass to the built-in open() function
to open the file (this can be 'r' for text files or 'rb' for binary
files), and type is the file type, which has one of the values
PY_SOURCE, PY_COMPILED, or C_EXTENSION, described
below.

Deprecated since version 3.3: Use the constants defined on importlib.machinery instead.
