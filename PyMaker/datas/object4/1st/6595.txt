os_environ¶
The default environment variables to be included in every request’s WSGI
environment.  By default, this is a copy of os.environ at the time that
wsgiref.handlers was imported, but subclasses can either create their own
at the class or instance level.  Note that the dictionary should be considered
read-only, since the default value is shared between multiple classes and
instances.
