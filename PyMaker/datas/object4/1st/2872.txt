HMAC.hexdigest()¶
Like digest() except the digest is returned as a string twice the
length containing only hexadecimal digits.  This may be used to exchange the
value safely in email or other non-binary environments.

Warning
When comparing the output of hexdigest() to an externally-supplied
digest during a verification routine, it is recommended to use the
compare_digest() function instead of the == operator
to reduce the vulnerability to timing attacks.
