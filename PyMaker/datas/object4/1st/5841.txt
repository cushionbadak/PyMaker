get(key, default=None)¶

__getitem__(key)¶
Return a representation of the message corresponding to key. If no such
message exists, default is returned if the method was called as
get() and a KeyError exception is raised if the method was
called as __getitem__(). The message is represented as an instance
of the appropriate format-specific Message subclass unless a
custom message factory was specified when the Mailbox instance
was initialized.
