FieldStorage.getfirst(name, default=None)Â¶
This method always returns only one value associated with form field name.
The method returns only the first value in case that more values were posted
under such name.  Please note that the order in which the values are received
may vary from browser to browser and should not be counted on. [1]  If no such
form field or value exists then the method returns the value specified by the
optional parameter default.  This parameter defaults to None if not
specified.
