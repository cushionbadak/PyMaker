types.resolve_bases(bases)¶
Resolve MRO entries dynamically as specified by PEP 560.
This function looks for items in bases that are not instances of
type, and returns a tuple where each such object that has
an __mro_entries__ method is replaced with an unpacked result of
calling this method.  If a bases item is an instance of type,
or it doesn’t have an __mro_entries__ method, then it is included in
the return tuple unchanged.

New in version 3.7.
