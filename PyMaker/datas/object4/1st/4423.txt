result(timeout=None)¶
Return the value returned by the call. If the call hasn’t yet completed
then this method will wait up to timeout seconds.  If the call hasn’t
completed in timeout seconds, then a
concurrent.futures.TimeoutError will be raised. timeout can be
an int or float.  If timeout is not specified or None, there is no
limit to the wait time.
If the future is cancelled before completing then CancelledError
will be raised.
If the call raised, this method will raise the same exception.
