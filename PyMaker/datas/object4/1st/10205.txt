writer.send_literal_data(data)¶
Output character data which has already been formatted for display.  Generally,
this should be interpreted to mean that line breaks indicated by newline
characters should be preserved and no new line breaks should be introduced.  The
data may contain embedded newline and tab characters, unlike data provided to
the send_formatted_data() interface.
