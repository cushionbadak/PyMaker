base64.b64encode(s, altchars=None)Â¶
Encode the bytes-like object s using Base64 and return the encoded
bytes.
Optional altchars must be a bytes-like object of at least
length 2 (additional characters are ignored) which specifies an alternative
alphabet for the + and / characters.  This allows an application to e.g.
generate URL or filesystem safe Base64 strings.  The default is None, for
which the standard Base64 alphabet is used.
