prepare(record)Â¶
Prepares a record for queuing. The object returned by this
method is enqueued.
The base implementation formats the record to merge the message,
arguments, and exception information, if present.  It also
removes unpickleable items from the record in-place.
You might want to override this method if you want to convert
the record to a dict or JSON string, or send a modified copy
of the record while leaving the original intact.
