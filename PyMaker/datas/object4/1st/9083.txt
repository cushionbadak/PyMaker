tracemalloc.start(nframe: int=1)Â¶
Start tracing Python memory allocations: install hooks on Python memory
allocators. Collected tracebacks of traces will be limited to nframe
frames. By default, a trace of a memory block only stores the most recent
frame: the limit is 1. nframe must be greater or equal to 1.
Storing more than 1 frame is only useful to compute statistics grouped
by 'traceback' or to compute cumulative statistics: see the
Snapshot.compare_to() and Snapshot.statistics() methods.
Storing more frames increases the memory and CPU overhead of the
tracemalloc module. Use the get_tracemalloc_memory() function
to measure how much memory is used by the tracemalloc module.
The PYTHONTRACEMALLOC environment variable
(PYTHONTRACEMALLOC=NFRAME) and the -X tracemalloc=NFRAME
command line option can be used to start tracing at startup.
See also stop(), is_tracing() and get_traceback_limit()
functions.
