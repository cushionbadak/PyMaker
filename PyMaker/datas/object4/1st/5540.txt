class email.parser.FeedParser(_factory=None, *, policy=policy.compat32)Â¶
Works like BytesFeedParser except that the input to the
feed() method must be a string.  This is of limited
utility, since the only way for such a message to be valid is for it to
contain only ASCII text or, if utf8 is
True, no binary attachments.

Changed in version 3.3: Added the policy keyword.
