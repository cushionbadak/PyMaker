scheduler.enterabs(time, priority, action, argument=(), kwargs={})¶
Schedule a new event. The time argument should be a numeric type compatible
with the return value of the timefunc function passed  to the constructor.
Events scheduled for the same time will be executed in the order of their
priority. A lower number represents a higher priority.
Executing the event means executing action(*argument, **kwargs).
argument is a sequence holding the positional arguments for action.
kwargs is a dictionary holding the keyword arguments for action.
Return value is an event which may be used for later cancellation of the event
(see cancel()).

Changed in version 3.3: argument parameter is optional.


New in version 3.3: kwargs parameter was added.
