class types.MappingProxyType(mapping)¶
Read-only proxy of a mapping. It provides a dynamic view on the mapping’s
entries, which means that when the mapping changes, the view reflects these
changes.

New in version 3.3.



key in proxy
Return True if the underlying mapping has a key key, else
False.



proxy[key]
Return the item of the underlying mapping with key key.  Raises a
KeyError if key is not in the underlying mapping.



iter(proxy)
Return an iterator over the keys of the underlying mapping.  This is a
shortcut for iter(proxy.keys()).



len(proxy)
Return the number of items in the underlying mapping.



copy()¶
Return a shallow copy of the underlying mapping.



get(key[, default])¶
Return the value for key if key is in the underlying mapping, else
default.  If default is not given, it defaults to None, so that
this method never raises a KeyError.



items()¶
Return a new view of the underlying mapping’s items ((key, value)
pairs).



keys()¶
Return a new view of the underlying mapping’s keys.



values()¶
Return a new view of the underlying mapping’s values.
