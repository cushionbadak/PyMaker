shutil.copy(src, dst, *, follow_symlinks=True)¶
Copies the file src to the file or directory dst.  src and dst
should be strings.  If dst specifies a directory, the file will be
copied into dst using the base filename from src.  Returns the
path to the newly created file.
If follow_symlinks is false, and src is a symbolic link,
dst will be created as a symbolic link.  If follow_symlinks
is true and src is a symbolic link, dst will be a copy of
the file src refers to.
copy() copies the file data and the file’s permission
mode (see os.chmod()).  Other metadata, like the
file’s creation and modification times, is not preserved.
To preserve all file metadata from the original, use
copy2() instead.

Changed in version 3.3: Added follow_symlinks argument.
Now returns path to the newly created file.
