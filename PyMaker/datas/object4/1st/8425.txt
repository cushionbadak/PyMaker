-kÂ¶
Only run test methods and classes that match the pattern or substring.
This option may be used multiple times, in which case all test cases that
match of the given patterns are included.
Patterns that contain a wildcard character (*) are matched against the
test name using fnmatch.fnmatchcase(); otherwise simple case-sensitive
substring matching is used.
Patterns are matched against the fully qualified test method name as
imported by the test loader.
For example, -k foo matches foo_tests.SomeTest.test_something,
bar_tests.SomeTest.test_foo, but not bar_tests.FooTest.test_something.
