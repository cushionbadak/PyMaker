object.__index__(self)Â¶
Called to implement operator.index(), and whenever Python needs to
losslessly convert the numeric object to an integer object (such as in
slicing, or in the built-in bin(), hex() and oct()
functions). Presence of this method indicates that the numeric object is
an integer type.  Must return an integer.

Note
In order to have a coherent integer type class, when __index__() is
defined __int__() should also be defined, and both should return
the same value.
