Enum member typeÂ¶
Enum members are instances of their Enum class, and are
normally accessed as EnumClass.member.  Under certain circumstances they
can also be accessed as EnumClass.member.member, but you should never do
this as that lookup may fail or, worse, return something besides the
Enum member you are looking for (this is another good reason to use
all-uppercase names for members):
>>> class FieldTypes(Enum):
...     name = 0
...     value = 1
...     size = 2
...
>>> FieldTypes.value.size
<FieldTypes.size: 2>
>>> FieldTypes.size.value
2



Changed in version 3.5.
