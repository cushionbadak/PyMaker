class datetime.timezone(offset, name=None)Â¶
The offset argument must be specified as a timedelta
object representing the difference between the local time and UTC.  It must
be strictly between -timedelta(hours=24) and
timedelta(hours=24), otherwise ValueError is raised.
The name argument is optional.  If specified it must be a string that
will be used as the value returned by the datetime.tzname() method.

New in version 3.2.


Changed in version 3.7: The UTC offset is not restricted to a whole number of minutes.
