ZipFile.extract(member, path=None, pwd=None)¶
Extract a member from the archive to the current working directory; member
must be its full name or a ZipInfo object.  Its file information is
extracted as accurately as possible.  path specifies a different directory
to extract to.  member can be a filename or a ZipInfo object.
pwd is the password used for encrypted files.
Returns the normalized path created (a directory or new file).

Note
If a member filename is an absolute path, a drive/UNC sharepoint and
leading (back)slashes will be stripped, e.g.: ///foo/bar becomes
foo/bar on Unix, and C:\foo\bar becomes foo\bar on Windows.
And all ".." components in a member filename will be removed, e.g.:
../../foo../../ba..r becomes foo../ba..r.  On Windows illegal
characters (:, <, >, |, ", ?, and *)
replaced by underscore (_).


Changed in version 3.6: Calling extract() on a closed ZipFile will raise a
ValueError.  Previously, a RuntimeError was raised.


Changed in version 3.6.2: The path parameter accepts a path-like object.
