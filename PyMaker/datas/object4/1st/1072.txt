class datetime.timedelta(days=0, seconds=0, microseconds=0, milliseconds=0, minutes=0, hours=0, weeks=0)Â¶
All arguments are optional and default to 0.  Arguments may be integers
or floats, and may be positive or negative.
Only days, seconds and microseconds are stored internally.  Arguments are
converted to those units:

A millisecond is converted to 1000 microseconds.
A minute is converted to 60 seconds.
An hour is converted to 3600 seconds.
A week is converted to 7 days.

and days, seconds and microseconds are then normalized so that the
representation is unique, with

0 <= microseconds < 1000000
0 <= seconds < 3600*24 (the number of seconds in one day)
-999999999 <= days <= 999999999

If any argument is a float and there are fractional microseconds,
the fractional microseconds left over from all arguments are
combined and their sum is rounded to the nearest microsecond using
round-half-to-even tiebreaker.  If no argument is a float, the
conversion and normalization processes are exact (no information is
lost).
If the normalized value of days lies outside the indicated range,
OverflowError is raised.
Note that normalization of negative values may be surprising at first. For
example,
>>> from datetime import timedelta
>>> d = timedelta(microseconds=-1)
>>> (d.days, d.seconds, d.microseconds)
(-1, 86399, 999999)
