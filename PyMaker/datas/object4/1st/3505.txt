hasHandlers()¶
Checks to see if this logger has any handlers configured. This is done by
looking for handlers in this logger and its parents in the logger hierarchy.
Returns True if a handler was found, else False. The method stops searching
up the hierarchy whenever a logger with the ‘propagate’ attribute set to
false is found - that will be the last logger which is checked for the
existence of handlers.

New in version 3.2.
