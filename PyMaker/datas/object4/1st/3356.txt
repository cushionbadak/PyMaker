time.asctime([t])Â¶
Convert a tuple or struct_time representing a time as returned by
gmtime() or localtime() to a string of the following
form: 'Sun Jun 20 23:21:05 1993'.  If t is not provided, the current time
as returned by localtime() is used. Locale information is not used by
asctime().

Note
Unlike the C function of the same name, asctime() does not add a
trailing newline.
