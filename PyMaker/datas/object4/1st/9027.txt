repeat(repeat=5, number=1000000)¶
Call timeit() a few times.
This is a convenience function that calls the timeit() repeatedly,
returning a list of results.  The first argument specifies how many times
to call timeit().  The second argument specifies the number
argument for timeit().

Note
It’s tempting to calculate mean and standard deviation from the result
vector and report these.  However, this is not very useful.
In a typical case, the lowest value gives a lower bound for how fast
your machine can run the given code snippet; higher values in the
result vector are typically not caused by variability in Python’s
speed, but by other processes interfering with your timing accuracy.
So the min() of the result is probably the only number you
should be interested in.  After that, you should look at the entire
vector and apply common sense rather than statistics.


Changed in version 3.7: Default value of repeat changed from 3 to 5.
