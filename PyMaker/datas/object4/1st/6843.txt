FTP.set_debuglevel(level)¶
Set the instance’s debugging level.  This controls the amount of debugging
output printed.  The default, 0, produces no debugging output.  A value of
1 produces a moderate amount of debugging output, generally a single line
per request.  A value of 2 or higher produces the maximum amount of
debugging output, logging each line sent and received on the control connection.
