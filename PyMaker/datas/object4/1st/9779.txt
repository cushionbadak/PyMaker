Queries on ST Objects¶
Two functions are provided which allow an application to determine if an ST was
created as an expression or a suite.  Neither of these functions can be used to
determine if an ST was created from source code via expr() or
suite() or from a parse tree via sequence2st().


parser.isexpr(st)¶
When st represents an 'eval' form, this function returns true, otherwise
it returns false.  This is useful, since code objects normally cannot be queried
for this information using existing built-in functions.  Note that the code
objects created by compilest() cannot be queried like this either, and
are identical to those created by the built-in compile() function.



parser.issuite(st)¶
This function mirrors isexpr() in that it reports whether an ST object
represents an 'exec' form, commonly known as a “suite.”  It is not safe to
assume that this function is equivalent to not isexpr(st), as additional
syntactic fragments may be supported in the future.
