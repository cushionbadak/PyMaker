4.2.3. Builtins and restricted execution¶

CPython implementation detail: Users should not touch __builtins__; it is strictly an implementation
detail.  Users wanting to override values in the builtins namespace should
import the builtins module and modify its
attributes appropriately.

The builtins namespace associated with the execution of a code block
is actually found by looking up the name __builtins__ in its
global namespace; this should be a dictionary or a module (in the
latter case the module’s dictionary is used).  By default, when in the
__main__ module, __builtins__ is the built-in module
builtins; when in any other module, __builtins__ is an
alias for the dictionary of the builtins module itself.
