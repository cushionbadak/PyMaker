subtract([iterable-or-mapping])Â¶
Elements are subtracted from an iterable or from another mapping
(or counter).  Like dict.update() but subtracts counts instead
of replacing them.  Both inputs and outputs may be zero or negative.
>>> c = Counter(a=4, b=2, c=0, d=-2)
>>> d = Counter(a=1, b=2, c=3, d=4)
>>> c.subtract(d)
>>> c
Counter({'a': 3, 'b': 0, 'c': -3, 'd': -6})



New in version 3.2.
