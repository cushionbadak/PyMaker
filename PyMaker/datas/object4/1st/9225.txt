sys.__interactivehook__Â¶
When this attribute exists, its value is automatically called (with no
arguments) when the interpreter is launched in interactive mode.  This is done after the PYTHONSTARTUP file is
read, so that you can set this hook there.  The site module
sets this.

New in version 3.4.
