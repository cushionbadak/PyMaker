chr(i)¶
Return the string representing a character whose Unicode code point is the
integer i.  For example, chr(97) returns the string 'a', while
chr(8364) returns the string '€'. This is the inverse of ord().
The valid range for the argument is from 0 through 1,114,111 (0x10FFFF in
base 16).  ValueError will be raised if i is outside that range.
