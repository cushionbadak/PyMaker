exception ImportError¶
Raised when the import statement has troubles trying to
load a module.  Also raised when the “from list” in from ... import
has a name that cannot be found.
The name and path attributes can be set using keyword-only
arguments to the constructor. When set they represent the name of the module
that was attempted to be imported and the path to any file which triggered
the exception, respectively.

Changed in version 3.3: Added the name and path attributes.
