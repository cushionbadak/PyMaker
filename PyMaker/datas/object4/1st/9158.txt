-o <output>, --output=<output>Â¶
Write the output to a file named output.  If this option is not specified,
the output filename will be the same as the input source, with the
extension .pyz added.  If an explicit filename is given, it is used as
is (so a .pyz extension should be included if required).
An output filename must be specified if the source is an archive (and in
that case, output must not be the same as source).
