bytes.center(width[, fillbyte])¶

bytearray.center(width[, fillbyte])¶
Return a copy of the object centered in a sequence of length width.
Padding is done using the specified fillbyte (default is an ASCII
space). For bytes objects, the original sequence is returned if
width is less than or equal to len(s).

Note
The bytearray version of this method does not operate in place -
it always produces a new object, even if no changes were made.
