push(exit)¶
Adds a context manager’s __exit__() method to the callback stack.
As __enter__ is not invoked, this method can be used to cover
part of an __enter__() implementation with a context manager’s own
__exit__() method.
If passed an object that is not a context manager, this method assumes
it is a callback with the same signature as a context manager’s
__exit__() method and adds it directly to the callback stack.
By returning true values, these callbacks can suppress exceptions the
same way context manager __exit__() methods can.
The passed in object is returned from the function, allowing this
method to be used as a function decorator.
