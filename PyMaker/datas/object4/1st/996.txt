codecs.open(filename, mode='r', encoding=None, errors='strict', buffering=1)Â¶
Open an encoded file using the given mode and return an instance of
StreamReaderWriter, providing transparent encoding/decoding.
The default file mode is 'r', meaning to open the file in read mode.

Note
Underlying encoded files are always opened in binary mode.
No automatic conversion of '\n' is done on reading and writing.
The mode argument may be any binary mode acceptable to the built-in
open() function; the 'b' is automatically added.

encoding specifies the encoding which is to be used for the file.
Any encoding that encodes to and decodes from bytes is allowed, and
the data types supported by the file methods depend on the codec used.
errors may be given to define the error handling. It defaults to 'strict'
which causes a ValueError to be raised in case an encoding error occurs.
buffering has the same meaning as for the built-in open() function.  It
defaults to line buffered.
