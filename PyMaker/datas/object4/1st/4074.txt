class ctypes.LibraryLoader(dlltype)¶
Class which loads shared libraries.  dlltype should be one of the
CDLL, PyDLL, WinDLL, or OleDLL types.
__getattr__() has special behavior: It allows loading a shared library by
accessing it as attribute of a library loader instance.  The result is cached,
so repeated attribute accesses return the same library each time.


LoadLibrary(name)¶
Load a shared library into the process and return it.  This method always
returns a new instance of the library.
