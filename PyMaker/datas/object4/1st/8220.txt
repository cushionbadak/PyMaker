Format menu (Editor window only)Â¶

Indent Region
Shift selected lines right by the indent width (default 4 spaces).
Dedent Region
Shift selected lines left by the indent width (default 4 spaces).
Comment Out Region
Insert ## in front of selected lines.
Uncomment Region
Remove leading # or ## from selected lines.
Tabify Region
Turn leading stretches of spaces into tabs. (Note: We recommend using
4 space blocks to indent Python code.)
Untabify Region
Turn all tabs into the correct number of spaces.
Toggle Tabs
Open a dialog to switch between indenting with spaces and tabs.
New Indent Width
Open a dialog to change indent width. The accepted default by the Python
community is 4 spaces.
Format Paragraph
Reformat the current blank-line-delimited paragraph in comment block or
multiline string or selected line in a string.  All lines in the
paragraph will be formatted to less than N columns, where N defaults to 72.
Strip trailing whitespace
Remove trailing space and other whitespace characters after the last
non-whitespace character of a line by applying str.rstrip to each line,
including lines within multiline strings.
