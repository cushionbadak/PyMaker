exception SyntaxErrorÂ¶
Raised when the parser encounters a syntax error.  This may occur in an
import statement, in a call to the built-in functions exec()
or eval(), or when reading the initial script or standard input
(also interactively).
Instances of this class have attributes filename, lineno,
offset and text for easier access to the details.  str()
of the exception instance returns only the message.
