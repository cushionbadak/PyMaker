add_attachment(*args, content_manager=None, **kw)Â¶
If the message is a multipart/mixed, create a new message object,
pass all of the arguments to its set_content() method, and
attach() it to the multipart.  If the
message is a non-multipart, multipart/related, or
multipart/alternative, call make_mixed() and then proceed as
above. If content_manager is not specified, use the content_manager
specified by the current policy.  If the added part
has no Content-Disposition header, add one with the value
attachment.  This method can be used both for explicit attachments
(Content-Disposition: attachment) and inline attachments
(Content-Disposition: inline), by passing appropriate
options to the content_manager.
