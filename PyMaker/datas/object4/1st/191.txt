5.4.3. Module spec¶
The import machinery uses a variety of information about each module
during import, especially before loading.  Most of the information is
common to all modules.  The purpose of a module’s spec is to encapsulate
this import-related information on a per-module basis.
Using a spec during import allows state to be transferred between import
system components, e.g. between the finder that creates the module spec
and the loader that executes it.  Most importantly, it allows the
import machinery to perform the boilerplate operations of loading,
whereas without a module spec the loader had that responsibility.
The module’s spec is exposed as the __spec__ attribute on a module object.
See ModuleSpec for details on the contents of
the module spec.

New in version 3.4.
