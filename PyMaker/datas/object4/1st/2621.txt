TarFile.add(name, arcname=None, recursive=True, *, filter=None)Â¶
Add the file name to the archive. name may be any type of file
(directory, fifo, symbolic link, etc.). If given, arcname specifies an
alternative name for the file in the archive. Directories are added
recursively by default. This can be avoided by setting recursive to
False. Recursion adds entries in sorted order.
If filter is given, it
should be a function that takes a TarInfo object argument and
returns the changed TarInfo object. If it instead returns
None the TarInfo object will be excluded from the
archive. See Examples for an example.

Changed in version 3.2: Added the filter parameter.


Changed in version 3.7: Recursion adds entries in sorted order.
