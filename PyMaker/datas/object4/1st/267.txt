7.7. The yield statementÂ¶

yield_stmt ::=  yield_expression

A yield statement is semantically equivalent to a yield
expression. The yield statement can be used to omit the parentheses
that would otherwise be required in the equivalent yield expression
statement. For example, the yield statements
yield <expr>
yield from <expr>


are equivalent to the yield expression statements
(yield <expr>)
(yield from <expr>)


Yield expressions and statements are only used when defining a generator
function, and are only used in the body of the generator function.  Using yield
in a function definition is sufficient to cause that definition to create a
generator function instead of a normal function.
For full details of yield semantics, refer to the
Yield expressions section.
