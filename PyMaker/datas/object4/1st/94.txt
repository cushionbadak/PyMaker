object.__iter__(self)Â¶
This method is called when an iterator is required for a container. This method
should return a new iterator object that can iterate over all the objects in the
container.  For mappings, it should iterate over the keys of the container.
Iterator objects also need to implement this method; they are required to return
themselves.  For more information on iterator objects, see Iterator Types.
