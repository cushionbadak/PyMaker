mailcap.getcaps()¶
Returns a dictionary mapping MIME types to a list of mailcap file entries. This
dictionary must be passed to the findmatch() function.  An entry is stored
as a list of dictionaries, but it shouldn’t be necessary to know the details of
this representation.
The information is derived from all of the mailcap files found on the system.
Settings in the user’s mailcap file $HOME/.mailcap will override
settings in the system mailcap files /etc/mailcap,
/usr/etc/mailcap, and /usr/local/etc/mailcap.
