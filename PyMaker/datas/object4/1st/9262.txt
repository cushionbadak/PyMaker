sys.version_info¶
A tuple containing the five components of the version number: major, minor,
micro, releaselevel, and serial.  All values except releaselevel are
integers; the release level is 'alpha', 'beta', 'candidate', or
'final'.  The version_info value corresponding to the Python version 2.0
is (2, 0, 0, 'final', 0).  The components can also be accessed by name,
so sys.version_info[0] is equivalent to sys.version_info.major
and so on.

Changed in version 3.1: Added named component attributes.
