profile.run(command, filename=None, sort=-1)Â¶
This function takes a single argument that can be passed to the exec()
function, and an optional file name.  In all cases this routine executes:
exec(command, __main__.__dict__, __main__.__dict__)


and gathers profiling statistics from the execution. If no file name is
present, then this function automatically creates a Stats
instance and prints a simple profiling report. If the sort value is specified,
it is passed to this Stats instance to control how the
results are sorted.
