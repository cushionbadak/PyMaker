docs:


Request.get_method()¶
Return a string indicating the HTTP request method.  If
Request.method is not None, return its value, otherwise return
'GET' if Request.data is None, or 'POST' if it’s not.
This is only meaningful for HTTP requests.

Changed in version 3.3: get_method now looks at the value of Request.method.
