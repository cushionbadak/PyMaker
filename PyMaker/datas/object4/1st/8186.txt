Hierarchical ListBox¶


class tkinter.tix.HList¶
The HList widget
can be used to display any data that have a hierarchical structure, for example,
file system directory trees. The list entries are indented and connected by
branch lines according to their places in the hierarchy.



class tkinter.tix.CheckList¶
The CheckList
widget displays a list of items to be selected by the user. CheckList acts
similarly to the Tk checkbutton or radiobutton widgets, except it is capable of
handling many more items than checkbuttons or radiobuttons.



class tkinter.tix.Tree¶
The Tree widget
can be used to display hierarchical data in a tree form. The user can adjust the
view of the tree by opening or closing parts of the tree.
