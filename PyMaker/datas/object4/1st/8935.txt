faulthandler.register(signum, file=sys.stderr, all_threads=True, chain=False)Â¶
Register a user signal: install a handler for the signum signal to dump
the traceback of all threads, or of the current thread if all_threads is
False, into file. Call the previous handler if chain is True.
The file must be kept open until the signal is unregistered by
unregister(): see issue with file descriptors.
Not available on Windows.

Changed in version 3.5: Added support for passing file descriptor to this function.
