class dataclasses.FieldÂ¶
Field objects describe each defined field. These objects
are created internally, and are returned by the fields()
module-level method (see below).  Users should never instantiate a
Field object directly.  Its documented attributes are:


name: The name of the field.
type: The type of the field.
default, default_factory, init, repr, hash,
compare, and metadata have the identical meaning and
values as they do in the field() declaration.


Other attributes may exist, but they are private and must not be
inspected or relied on.
