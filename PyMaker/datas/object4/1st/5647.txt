class email.headerregistry.Address(display_name='', username='', domain='', addr_spec=None)¶
The class used to represent an email address.  The general form of an
address is:
[display_name] <username@domain>


or:
username@domain


where each part must conform to specific syntax rules spelled out in
RFC 5322.
As a convenience addr_spec can be specified instead of username and
domain, in which case username and domain will be parsed from the
addr_spec.  An addr_spec must be a properly RFC quoted string; if it is
not Address will raise an error.  Unicode characters are allowed and
will be property encoded when serialized.  However, per the RFCs, unicode is
not allowed in the username portion of the address.


display_name¶
The display name portion of the address, if any, with all quoting
removed.  If the address does not have a display name, this attribute
will be an empty string.



username¶
The username portion of the address, with all quoting removed.



domain¶
The domain portion of the address.



addr_spec¶
The username@domain portion of the address, correctly quoted
for use as a bare address (the second form shown above).  This
attribute is not mutable.



__str__()¶
The str value of the object is the address quoted according to
RFC 5322 rules, but with no Content Transfer Encoding of any non-ASCII
characters.

To support SMTP (RFC 5321), Address handles one special case: if
username and domain are both the empty string (or None), then
the string value of the Address is <>.
