_anonymous_Â¶
An optional sequence that lists the names of unnamed (anonymous) fields.
_anonymous_ must be already defined when _fields_ is
assigned, otherwise it will have no effect.
The fields listed in this variable must be structure or union type fields.
ctypes will create descriptors in the structure type that allows
accessing the nested fields directly, without the need to create the
structure or union field.
Here is an example type (Windows):
class _U(Union):
    _fields_ = [("lptdesc", POINTER(TYPEDESC)),
                ("lpadesc", POINTER(ARRAYDESC)),
                ("hreftype", HREFTYPE)]

class TYPEDESC(Structure):
    _anonymous_ = ("u",)
    _fields_ = [("u", _U),
                ("vt", VARTYPE)]


The TYPEDESC structure describes a COM data type, the vt field
specifies which one of the union fields is valid.  Since the u field
is defined as anonymous field, it is now possible to access the members
directly off the TYPEDESC instance. td.lptdesc and td.u.lptdesc
are equivalent, but the former is faster since it does not need to create
a temporary union instance:
td = TYPEDESC()
td.vt = VT_PTR
td.lptdesc = POINTER(some_type)
td.u.lptdesc = POINTER(some_type)
