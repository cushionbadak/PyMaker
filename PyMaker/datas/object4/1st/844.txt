ratio()¶
Return a measure of the sequences’ similarity as a float in the range [0,
1].
Where T is the total number of elements in both sequences, and M is the
number of matches, this is 2.0*M / T. Note that this is 1.0 if the
sequences are identical, and 0.0 if they have nothing in common.
This is expensive to compute if get_matching_blocks() or
get_opcodes() hasn’t already been called, in which case you may want
to try quick_ratio() or real_quick_ratio() first to get an
upper bound.
