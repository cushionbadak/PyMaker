discover(start_dir, pattern='test*.py', top_level_dir=None)¶
Find all the test modules by recursing into subdirectories from the
specified start directory, and return a TestSuite object containing them.
Only test files that match pattern will be loaded. (Using shell style
pattern matching.) Only module names that are importable (i.e. are valid
Python identifiers) will be loaded.
All test modules must be importable from the top level of the project. If
the start directory is not the top level directory then the top level
directory must be specified separately.
If importing a module fails, for example due to a syntax error, then
this will be recorded as a single error and discovery will continue.  If
the import failure is due to SkipTest being raised, it will be
recorded as a skip instead of an error.
If a package (a directory containing a file named __init__.py) is
found, the package will be checked for a load_tests function. If this
exists then it will be called
package.load_tests(loader, tests, pattern). Test discovery takes care
to ensure that a package is only checked for tests once during an
invocation, even if the load_tests function itself calls
loader.discover.
If load_tests exists then discovery does not recurse into the
package, load_tests is responsible for loading all tests in the
package.
The pattern is deliberately not stored as a loader attribute so that
packages can continue discovery themselves. top_level_dir is stored so
load_tests does not need to pass this argument in to
loader.discover().
start_dir can be a dotted module name as well as a directory.

New in version 3.2.


Changed in version 3.4: Modules that raise SkipTest on import are recorded as skips,
  not errors.
Discovery works for namespace packages.
Paths are sorted before being imported so that execution order is
  the same even if the underlying file system’s ordering is not
  dependent on file name.


Changed in version 3.5: Found packages are now checked for load_tests regardless of
whether their path matches pattern, because it is impossible for
a package name to match the default pattern.
