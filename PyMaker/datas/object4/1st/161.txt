coroutine.close()Â¶
Causes the coroutine to clean itself up and exit.  If the coroutine
is suspended, this method first delegates to the close()
method of the iterator that caused the coroutine to suspend, if it
has such a method.  Then it raises GeneratorExit at the
suspension point, causing the coroutine to immediately clean itself up.
Finally, the coroutine is marked as having finished executing, even if
it was never started.
Coroutine objects are automatically closed using the above process when
they are about to be destroyed.
