HAVE_ARGUMENT¶
This is not really an opcode.  It identifies the dividing line between
opcodes which don’t use their argument and those that do
(< HAVE_ARGUMENT and >= HAVE_ARGUMENT, respectively).

Changed in version 3.6: Now every instruction has an argument, but opcodes < HAVE_ARGUMENT
ignore it. Before, only opcodes >= HAVE_ARGUMENT had an argument.
