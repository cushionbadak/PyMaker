tkinter.Tcl(screenName=None, baseName=None, className='Tk', useTk=0)¶
The Tcl() function is a factory function which creates an object much like
that created by the Tk class, except that it does not initialize the Tk
subsystem.  This is most often useful when driving the Tcl interpreter in an
environment where one doesn’t want to create extraneous toplevel windows, or
where one cannot (such as Unix/Linux systems without an X server).  An object
created by the Tcl() object can have a Toplevel window created (and the Tk
subsystem initialized) by calling its loadtk() method.
