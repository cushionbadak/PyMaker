resource.RLIMIT_CPUÂ¶
The maximum amount of processor time (in seconds) that a process can use. If
this limit is exceeded, a SIGXCPU signal is sent to the process. (See
the signal module documentation for information about how to catch this
signal and do something useful, e.g. flush open files to disk.)
