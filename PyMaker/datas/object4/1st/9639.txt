find_module(fullname, path)Â¶
A legacy method for finding a loader for the specified
module.  If this is a top-level import, path will be None.
Otherwise, this is a search for a subpackage or module and path
will be the value of __path__ from the parent
package. If a loader cannot be found, None is returned.
If find_spec() is defined, backwards-compatible functionality is
provided.

Changed in version 3.4: Returns None when called instead of raising
NotImplementedError. Can use find_spec() to provide
functionality.


Deprecated since version 3.4: Use find_spec() instead.
