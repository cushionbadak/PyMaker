6.6. Unary arithmetic and bitwise operationsÂ¶
All unary arithmetic and bitwise operations have the same priority:

u_expr ::=  power | "-" u_expr | "+" u_expr | "~" u_expr

The unary - (minus) operator yields the negation of its numeric argument.
The unary + (plus) operator yields its numeric argument unchanged.
The unary ~ (invert) operator yields the bitwise inversion of its integer
argument.  The bitwise inversion of x is defined as -(x+1).  It only
applies to integral numbers.
In all three cases, if the argument does not have the proper type, a
TypeError exception is raised.
