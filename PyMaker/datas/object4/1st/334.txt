issubclass(class, classinfo)Â¶
Return true if class is a subclass (direct, indirect or virtual) of classinfo.  A
class is considered a subclass of itself. classinfo may be a tuple of class
objects, in which case every entry in classinfo will be checked. In any other
case, a TypeError exception is raised.
