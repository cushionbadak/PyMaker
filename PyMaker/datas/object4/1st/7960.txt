turtledemo — Demo scripts¶
The turtledemo package includes a set of demo scripts.  These
scripts can be run and viewed using the supplied demo viewer as follows:
python -m turtledemo


Alternatively, you can run the demo scripts individually.  For example,
python -m turtledemo.bytedesign


The turtledemo package directory contains:

A demo viewer __main__.py which can be used to view the sourcecode
of the scripts and run them at the same time.
Multiple scripts demonstrating different features of the turtle
module.  Examples can be accessed via the Examples menu.  They can also
be run standalone.
A turtle.cfg file which serves as an example of how to write
and use such files.

The demo scripts are:
