Console I/O¶


msvcrt.kbhit()¶
Return true if a keypress is waiting to be read.



msvcrt.getch()¶
Read a keypress and return the resulting character as a byte string.
Nothing is echoed to the console.  This call will block if a keypress
is not already available, but will not wait for Enter to be
pressed. If the pressed key was a special function key, this will
return '\000' or '\xe0'; the next call will return the keycode.
The Control-C keypress cannot be read with this function.



msvcrt.getwch()¶
Wide char variant of getch(), returning a Unicode value.



msvcrt.getche()¶
Similar to getch(), but the keypress will be echoed if it  represents a
printable character.



msvcrt.getwche()¶
Wide char variant of getche(), returning a Unicode value.



msvcrt.putch(char)¶
Print the byte string char to the console without buffering.



msvcrt.putwch(unicode_char)¶
Wide char variant of putch(), accepting a Unicode value.



msvcrt.ungetch(char)¶
Cause the byte string char to be “pushed back” into the console buffer;
it will be the next character read by getch() or getche().



msvcrt.ungetwch(unicode_char)¶
Wide char variant of ungetch(), accepting a Unicode value.
