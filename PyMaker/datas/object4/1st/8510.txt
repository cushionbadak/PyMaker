loadTestsFromTestCase(testCaseClass)Â¶
Return a suite of all test cases contained in the TestCase-derived
testCaseClass.
A test case instance is created for each method named by
getTestCaseNames(). By default these are the method names
beginning with test. If getTestCaseNames() returns no
methods, but the runTest() method is implemented, a single test
case is created for that method instead.
