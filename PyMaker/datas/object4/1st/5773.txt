email.utils.parsedate_tz(date)¶
Performs the same function as parsedate(), but returns either None or
a 10-tuple; the first 9 elements make up a tuple that can be passed directly to
time.mktime(), and the tenth is the offset of the date’s timezone from UTC
(which is the official term for Greenwich Mean Time) [1].  If the input string
has no timezone, the last element of the tuple returned is None.  Note that
indexes 6, 7, and 8 of the result tuple are not usable.
