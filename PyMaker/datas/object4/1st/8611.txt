class unittest.mock.MagicMock(*args, **kw)Â¶
MagicMock is a subclass of Mock with default implementations
of most of the magic methods. You can use MagicMock without having to
configure the magic methods yourself.
The constructor parameters have the same meaning as for Mock.
If you use the spec or spec_set arguments then only magic methods
that exist in the spec will be created.
