<dd><p>With a <em>lineno</em> argument, set a break there in the current file.  With a
<em>function</em> argument, set a break at the first executable statement within
that function.  The line number may be prefixed with a filename and a colon,
to specify a breakpoint in another file (probably one that hasn’t been loaded
yet).  The file is searched on <a class="reference internal" href="sys.html#sys.path" title="sys.path"><code class="xref py py-data docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sys.path</span></code></a>.  Note that each breakpoint
is assigned a number to which all the other breakpoint commands refer.</p>
<p>If a second argument is present, it is an expression which must evaluate to
true before the breakpoint is honored.</p>
<p>Without argument, list all breaks, including for each breakpoint, the number
of times that breakpoint has been hit, the current ignore count, and the
associated condition if any.</p>
