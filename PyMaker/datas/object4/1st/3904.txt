platform.uname()Â¶
Fairly portable uname interface. Returns a namedtuple()
containing six attributes: system, node, release,
version, machine, and processor.
Note that this adds a sixth attribute (processor) not present
in the os.uname() result.  Also, the attribute names are different
for the first two attributes; os.uname() names them
sysname and nodename.
Entries which cannot be determined are set to ''.

Changed in version 3.3: Result changed from a tuple to a namedtuple.
