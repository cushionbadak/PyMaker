platform.libc_ver(executable=sys.executable, lib='', version='', chunksize=16384)Â¶
Tries to determine the libc version against which the file executable (defaults
to the Python interpreter) is linked.  Returns a tuple of strings (lib,
version) which default to the given parameters in case the lookup fails.
Note that this function has intimate knowledge of how different libc versions
add symbols to the executable is probably only usable for executables compiled
using gcc.
The file is read and scanned in chunks of chunksize bytes.
