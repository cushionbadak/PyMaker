doctest.REPORT_NDIFFÂ¶
When specified, differences are computed by difflib.Differ, using the same
algorithm as the popular ndiff.py utility. This is the only method that
marks differences within lines as well as across lines.  For example, if a line
of expected output contains digit 1 where actual output contains letter
l, a line is inserted with a caret marking the mismatching column positions.
