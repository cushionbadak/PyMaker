threading.stack_size([size])Â¶
Return the thread stack size used when creating new threads.  The optional
size argument specifies the stack size to be used for subsequently created
threads, and must be 0 (use platform or configured default) or a positive
integer value of at least 32,768 (32 KiB). If size is not specified,
0 is used.  If changing the thread stack size is
unsupported, a RuntimeError is raised.  If the specified stack size is
invalid, a ValueError is raised and the stack size is unmodified.  32 KiB
is currently the minimum supported stack size value to guarantee sufficient
stack space for the interpreter itself.  Note that some platforms may have
particular restrictions on values for the stack size, such as requiring a
minimum stack size > 32 KiB or requiring allocation in multiples of the system
memory page size - platform documentation should be referred to for more
information (4 KiB pages are common; using multiples of 4096 for the stack size is
the suggested approach in the absence of more specific information).
Availability: Windows, systems with POSIX threads.
