OpenerDirector.add_handler(handler)¶
handler should be an instance of BaseHandler.  The following methods
are searched, and added to the possible chains (note that HTTP errors are a
special case).  Note that, in the following, protocol should be replaced
with the actual protocol to handle, for example http_response() would
be the HTTP protocol response handler.  Also type should be replaced with
the actual HTTP code, for example http_error_404() would handle HTTP
404 errors.

<protocol>_open() — signal that the handler knows how to open protocol
URLs.
See BaseHandler.<protocol>_open() for more information.

http_error_<type>() — signal that the handler knows how to handle HTTP
errors with HTTP error code type.
See BaseHandler.http_error_<nnn>() for more information.

<protocol>_error() — signal that the handler knows how to handle errors
from (non-http) protocol.

<protocol>_request() — signal that the handler knows how to pre-process
protocol requests.
See BaseHandler.<protocol>_request() for more information.

<protocol>_response() — signal that the handler knows how to
post-process protocol responses.
See BaseHandler.<protocol>_response() for more information.
