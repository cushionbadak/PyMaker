Finding all AdverbsÂ¶
findall() matches all occurrences of a pattern, not just the first
one as search() does.  For example, if a writer wanted to
find all of the adverbs in some text, they might use findall() in
the following manner:
>>> text = "He was carefully disguised but captured quickly by police."
>>> re.findall(r"\w+ly", text)
['carefully', 'quickly']
