<dd><p>Push a line of source text to the interpreter. The line should not have a
trailing newline; it may have internal newlines.  The line is appended to a
buffer and the interpreter’s <code class="xref py py-meth docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">runsource()</span></code> method is called with the
concatenated contents of the buffer as source.  If this indicates that the
command was executed or invalid, the buffer is reset; otherwise, the command is
incomplete, and the buffer is left as it was after the line was appended.  The
return value is <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">True</span></code> if more input is required, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">False</span></code> if the line was
dealt with in some way (this is the same as <code class="xref py py-meth docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">runsource()</span></code>).</p>
