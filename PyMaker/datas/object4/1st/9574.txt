InteractiveConsole.push(line)¶
Push a line of source text to the interpreter. The line should not have a
trailing newline; it may have internal newlines.  The line is appended to a
buffer and the interpreter’s runsource() method is called with the
concatenated contents of the buffer as source.  If this indicates that the
command was executed or invalid, the buffer is reset; otherwise, the command is
incomplete, and the buffer is left as it was after the line was appended.  The
return value is True if more input is required, False if the line was
dealt with in some way (this is the same as runsource()).
