sys.ps2¶
Strings specifying the primary and secondary prompt of the interpreter.  These
are only defined if the interpreter is in interactive mode.  Their initial
values in this case are '>>> ' and '... '.  If a non-string object is
assigned to either variable, its str() is re-evaluated each time the
interpreter prepares to read a new interactive command; this can be used to
implement a dynamic prompt.
