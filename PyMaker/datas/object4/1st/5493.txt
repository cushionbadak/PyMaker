__setitem__(name, val)¶
Add a header to the message with field name name and value val.  The
field is appended to the end of the message’s existing headers.
Note that this does not overwrite or delete any existing header with the same
name.  If you want to ensure that the new header is the only one present in the
message with field name name, delete the field first, e.g.:
del msg['subject']
msg['subject'] = 'Python roolz!'


If the policy defines certain headers to be unique (as the standard
policies do), this method may raise a ValueError when an attempt
is made to assign a value to such a header when one already exists.  This
behavior is intentional for consistency’s sake, but do not depend on it
as we may choose to make such assignments do an automatic deletion of the
existing header in the future.
