ContentHandler.startElement(name, attrs)Â¶
Signals the start of an element in non-namespace mode.
The name parameter contains the raw XML 1.0 name of the element type as a
string and the attrs parameter holds an object of the
Attributes
interface (see The Attributes Interface) containing the attributes of
the element.  The object passed as attrs may be re-used by the parser; holding
on to a reference to it is not a reliable way to keep a copy of the attributes.
To keep a copy of the attributes, use the copy() method of the attrs
object.
