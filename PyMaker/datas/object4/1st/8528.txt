bufferÂ¶
If set to true, sys.stdout and sys.stderr will be buffered in between
startTest() and stopTest() being called. Collected output will
only be echoed onto the real sys.stdout and sys.stderr if the test
fails or errors. Any output is also attached to the failure / error message.

New in version 3.2.
