Text Encodings¶
The following codecs provide str to bytes encoding and
bytes-like object to str decoding, similar to the Unicode text
encodings.







Codec
Aliases
Purpose



idna
 
Implements RFC 3490,
see also
encodings.idna.
Only errors='strict'
is supported.

mbcs
ansi,
dbcs
Windows only: Encode
operand according to the
ANSI codepage (CP_ACP)

oem
 
Windows only: Encode
operand according to the
OEM codepage (CP_OEMCP)

New in version 3.6.



palmos
 
Encoding of PalmOS 3.5

punycode
 
Implements RFC 3492.
Stateful codecs are not
supported.

raw_unicode_escape
 
Latin-1 encoding with
\uXXXX and
\UXXXXXXXX for other
code points. Existing
backslashes are not
escaped in any way.
It is used in the Python
pickle protocol.

undefined
 
Raise an exception for
all conversions, even
empty strings. The error
handler is ignored.

unicode_escape
 
Encoding suitable as the
contents of a Unicode
literal in ASCII-encoded
Python source code,
except that quotes are
not escaped. Decodes from
Latin-1 source code.
Beware that Python source
code actually uses UTF-8
by default.

unicode_internal
 
Return the internal
representation of the
operand. Stateful codecs
are not supported.

Deprecated since version 3.3: This representation is
obsoleted by
PEP 393.
