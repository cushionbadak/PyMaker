typing.TYPE_CHECKING¶
A special constant that is assumed to be True by 3rd party static
type checkers. It is False at runtime. Usage:
if TYPE_CHECKING:
    import expensive_mod

def fun(arg: 'expensive_mod.SomeType') -> None:
    local_var: expensive_mod.AnotherType = other_fun()


Note that the first type annotation must be enclosed in quotes, making it a
“forward reference”, to hide the expensive_mod reference from the
interpreter runtime.  Type annotations for local variables are not
evaluated, so the second annotation does not need to be enclosed in quotes.

New in version 3.5.2.
