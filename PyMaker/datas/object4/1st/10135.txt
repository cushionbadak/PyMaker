CALL_FUNCTION_EX(flags)¶
Calls a callable object with variable set of positional and keyword
arguments.  If the lowest bit of flags is set, the top of the stack
contains a mapping object containing additional keyword arguments.
Below that is an iterable object containing positional arguments and
a callable object to call.  BUILD_MAP_UNPACK_WITH_CALL and
BUILD_TUPLE_UNPACK_WITH_CALL can be used for merging multiple
mapping objects and iterables containing arguments.
Before the callable is called, the mapping object and iterable object
are each “unpacked” and their contents passed in as keyword and
positional arguments respectively.
CALL_FUNCTION_EX pops all arguments and the callable object off the stack,
calls the callable object with those arguments, and pushes the return value
returned by the callable object.

New in version 3.6.
