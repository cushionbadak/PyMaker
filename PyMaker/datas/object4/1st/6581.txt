class wsgiref.handlers.CGIHandlerÂ¶
CGI-based invocation via sys.stdin, sys.stdout, sys.stderr and
os.environ.  This is useful when you have a WSGI application and want to run
it as a CGI script.  Simply invoke CGIHandler().run(app), where app is
the WSGI application object you wish to invoke.
This class is a subclass of BaseCGIHandler that sets wsgi.run_once
to true, wsgi.multithread to false, and wsgi.multiprocess to true, and
always uses sys and os to obtain the necessary CGI streams and
environment.
