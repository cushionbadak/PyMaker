class http.cookies.SimpleCookie([input])Â¶
This class derives from BaseCookie and overrides value_decode()
and value_encode(). SimpleCookie supports strings as cookie values.
When setting the value, SimpleCookie calls the builtin str() to convert
the value to a string. Values received from HTTP are kept as strings.
