fetchmany(size=cursor.arraysize)¶
Fetches the next set of rows of a query result, returning a list.  An empty
list is returned when no more rows are available.
The number of rows to fetch per call is specified by the size parameter.
If it is not given, the cursor’s arraysize determines the number of rows
to be fetched. The method should try to fetch as many rows as indicated by
the size parameter. If this is not possible due to the specified number of
rows not being available, fewer rows may be returned.
Note there are performance considerations involved with the size parameter.
For optimal performance, it is usually best to use the arraysize attribute.
If the size parameter is used, then it is best for it to retain the same
value from one fetchmany() call to the next.
