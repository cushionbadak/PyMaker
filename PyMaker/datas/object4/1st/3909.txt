platform.popen(cmd, mode='r', bufsize=-1)¶
Portable popen() interface.  Find a working popen implementation
preferring win32pipe.popen().  On Windows NT, win32pipe.popen()
should work; on Windows 9x it hangs due to bugs in the MS C library.

Deprecated since version 3.3: This function is obsolete.  Use the subprocess module.  Check
especially the Replacing Older Functions with the subprocess Module section.
