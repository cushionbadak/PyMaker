socket.inet_pton(address_family, ip_string)¶
Convert an IP address from its family-specific string format to a packed,
binary format. inet_pton() is useful when a library or network protocol
calls for an object of type struct in_addr (similar to
inet_aton()) or struct in6_addr.
Supported values for address_family are currently AF_INET and
AF_INET6. If the IP address string ip_string is invalid,
OSError will be raised. Note that exactly what is valid depends on
both the value of address_family and the underlying implementation of
inet_pton().
Availability: Unix (maybe not all platforms), Windows.

Changed in version 3.4: Windows support added
