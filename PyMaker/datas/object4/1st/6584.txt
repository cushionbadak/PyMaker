class wsgiref.handlers.SimpleHandler(stdin, stdout, stderr, environ, multithread=True, multiprocess=False)Â¶
Similar to BaseCGIHandler, but designed for use with HTTP origin
servers.  If you are writing an HTTP server implementation, you will probably
want to subclass this instead of BaseCGIHandler.
This class is a subclass of BaseHandler.  It overrides the
__init__(), get_stdin(), get_stderr(), add_cgi_vars(),
_write(), and _flush() methods to support explicitly setting the
environment and streams via the constructor.  The supplied environment and
streams are stored in the stdin, stdout, stderr, and
environ attributes.
The write() method of stdout should write
each chunk in full, like io.BufferedIOBase.
