Popen.stderrÂ¶
If the stderr argument was PIPE, this attribute is a readable
stream object as returned by open(). Reading from the stream provides
error output from the child process. If the encoding or errors arguments
were specified or the universal_newlines argument was True, the stream
is a text stream, otherwise it is a byte stream. If the stderr argument was
not PIPE, this attribute is None.
