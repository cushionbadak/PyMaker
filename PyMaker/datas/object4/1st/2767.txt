class netrc.netrc([file])¶
A netrc instance or subclass instance encapsulates data from  a netrc
file.  The initialization argument, if present, specifies the file to parse.  If
no argument is given, the file .netrc in the user’s home directory –
as determined by os.path.expanduser() – will be read.  Otherwise,
a FileNotFoundError exception will be raised.
Parse errors will raise NetrcParseError with diagnostic
information including the file name, line number, and terminating token.
If no argument is specified on a POSIX system, the presence of passwords in
the .netrc file will raise a NetrcParseError if the file
ownership or permissions are insecure (owned by a user other than the user
running the process, or accessible for read or write by any other user).
This implements security behavior equivalent to that of ftp and other
programs that use .netrc.

Changed in version 3.4: Added the POSIX permission check.


Changed in version 3.7: os.path.expanduser() is used to find the location of the
.netrc file when file is not passed as argument.
