base64.b64decode(s, altchars=None, validate=False)Â¶
Decode the Base64 encoded bytes-like object or ASCII string
s and return the decoded bytes.
Optional altchars must be a bytes-like object or ASCII string of
at least length 2 (additional characters are ignored) which specifies the
alternative alphabet used instead of the + and / characters.
A binascii.Error exception is raised
if s is incorrectly padded.
If validate is False (the default), characters that are neither
in the normal base-64 alphabet nor the alternative alphabet are
discarded prior to the padding check.  If validate is True,
these non-alphabet characters in the input result in a
binascii.Error.
