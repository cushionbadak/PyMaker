isinstance(object, classinfo)Â¶
Return true if the object argument is an instance of the classinfo
argument, or of a (direct, indirect or virtual) subclass thereof.  If object is not
an object of the given type, the function always returns false.
If classinfo is a tuple of type objects (or recursively, other such
tuples), return true if object is an instance of any of the types.
If classinfo is not a type or tuple of types and such tuples,
a TypeError exception is raised.
