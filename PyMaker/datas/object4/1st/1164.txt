class datetime.tzinfoÂ¶
This is an abstract base class, meaning that this class should not be
instantiated directly.  You need to derive a concrete subclass, and (at least)
supply implementations of the standard tzinfo methods needed by the
datetime methods you use.  The datetime module supplies
a simple concrete subclass of tzinfo, timezone, which can represent
timezones with fixed offset from UTC such as UTC itself or North American EST and
EDT.
An instance of (a concrete subclass of) tzinfo can be passed to the
constructors for datetime and time objects. The latter objects
view their attributes as being in local time, and the tzinfo object
supports methods revealing offset of local time from UTC, the name of the time
zone, and DST offset, all relative to a date or time object passed to them.
Special requirement for pickling:  A tzinfo subclass must have an
__init__() method that can be called with no arguments, else it can be
pickled but possibly not unpickled again.  This is a technical requirement that
may be relaxed in the future.
A concrete subclass of tzinfo may need to implement the following
methods.  Exactly which methods are needed depends on the uses made of aware
datetime objects.  If in doubt, simply implement all of them.
