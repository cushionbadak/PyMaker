code.interact(banner=None, readfunc=None, local=None, exitmsg=None)Â¶
Convenience function to run a read-eval-print loop.  This creates a new
instance of InteractiveConsole and sets readfunc to be used as
the InteractiveConsole.raw_input() method, if provided.  If local is
provided, it is passed to the InteractiveConsole constructor for
use as the default namespace for the interpreter loop.  The interact()
method of the instance is then run with banner and exitmsg passed as the
banner and exit message to use, if provided.  The console object is discarded
after use.

Changed in version 3.6: Added exitmsg parameter.
