Document.createElementNS(namespaceURI, tagName)Â¶
Create and return a new element with a namespace.  The tagName may have a
prefix.  The element is not inserted into the document when it is created.  You
need to explicitly insert it with one of the other methods such as
insertBefore() or appendChild().
