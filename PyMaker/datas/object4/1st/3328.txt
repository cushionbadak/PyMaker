class io.BufferedRWPair(reader, writer, buffer_size=DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE)¶
A buffered I/O object combining two unidirectional RawIOBase
objects – one readable, the other writeable – into a single bidirectional
endpoint.  It inherits BufferedIOBase.
reader and writer are RawIOBase objects that are readable and
writeable respectively.  If the buffer_size is omitted it defaults to
DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE.
BufferedRWPair implements all of BufferedIOBase’s methods
except for detach(), which raises
UnsupportedOperation.

Warning
BufferedRWPair does not attempt to synchronize accesses to
its underlying raw streams.  You should not pass it the same object
as reader and writer; use BufferedRandom instead.
