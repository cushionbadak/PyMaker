turtle.circle(radius, extent=None, steps=None)¶




Parameters:
radius – a number
extent – a number (or None)
steps – an integer (or None)





Draw a circle with given radius.  The center is radius units left of
the turtle; extent – an angle – determines which part of the circle
is drawn.  If extent is not given, draw the entire circle.  If extent
is not a full circle, one endpoint of the arc is the current pen
position.  Draw the arc in counterclockwise direction if radius is
positive, otherwise in clockwise direction.  Finally the direction of the
turtle is changed by the amount of extent.
As the circle is approximated by an inscribed regular polygon, steps
determines the number of steps to use.  If not given, it will be
calculated automatically.  May be used to draw regular polygons.
