datetime.timetuple()Â¶
Return a time.struct_time such as returned by time.localtime().
d.timetuple() is equivalent to time.struct_time((d.year, d.month, d.day,
d.hour, d.minute, d.second, d.weekday(), yday, dst)), where yday =
d.toordinal() - date(d.year, 1, 1).toordinal() + 1 is the day number within
the current year starting with 1 for January 1st. The tm_isdst flag
of the result is set according to the dst() method: tzinfo is
None or dst() returns None, tm_isdst is set to -1;
else if dst() returns a non-zero value, tm_isdst is set to 1;
else tm_isdst is set to 0.
