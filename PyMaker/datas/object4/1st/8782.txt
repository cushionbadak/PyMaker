test.support.temp_cwd(name='tempcwd', quiet=False)Â¶
A context manager that temporarily creates a new directory and
changes the current working directory (CWD).
The context manager creates a temporary directory in the current
directory with name name before temporarily changing the current
working directory.  If name is None, the temporary directory is
created using tempfile.mkdtemp().
If quiet is False and it is not possible to create or change
the CWD, an error is raised.  Otherwise, only a warning is raised
and the original CWD is used.
