statistics.mode(data)Â¶
Return the most common data point from discrete or nominal data.  The mode
(when it exists) is the most typical value, and is a robust measure of
central location.
If data is empty, or if there is not exactly one most common value,
StatisticsError is raised.
mode assumes discrete data, and returns a single value. This is the
standard treatment of the mode as commonly taught in schools:
>>> mode([1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4])
3


The mode is unique in that it is the only statistic which also applies
to nominal (non-numeric) data:
>>> mode(["red", "blue", "blue", "red", "green", "red", "red"])
'red'
