socket.sendall(bytes[, flags])Â¶
Send data to the socket.  The socket must be connected to a remote socket.  The
optional flags argument has the same meaning as for recv() above.
Unlike send(), this method continues to send data from bytes until
either all data has been sent or an error occurs.  None is returned on
success.  On error, an exception is raised, and there is no way to determine how
much data, if any, was successfully sent.

Changed in version 3.5: The socket timeout is no more reset each time data is sent successfully.
The socket timeout is now the maximum total duration to send all data.


Changed in version 3.5: If the system call is interrupted and the signal handler does not raise
an exception, the method now retries the system call instead of raising
an InterruptedError exception (see PEP 475 for the rationale).
