aifc.open(file, mode=None)Â¶
Open an AIFF or AIFF-C file and return an object instance with methods that are
described below.  The argument file is either a string naming a file or a
file object.  mode must be 'r' or 'rb' when the file must be
opened for reading, or 'w'  or 'wb' when the file must be opened for writing.
If omitted, file.mode is used if it exists, otherwise 'rb' is used.  When
used for writing, the file object should be seekable, unless you know ahead of
time how many samples you are going to write in total and use
writeframesraw() and setnframes().
The open() function may be used in a with statement.  When
the with block completes, the close() method is called.

Changed in version 3.4: Support for the with statement was added.
