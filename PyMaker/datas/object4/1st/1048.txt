StreamReaderWriter Objects¶
The StreamReaderWriter is a convenience class that allows wrapping
streams which work in both read and write modes.
The design is such that one can use the factory functions returned by the
lookup() function to construct the instance.


class codecs.StreamReaderWriter(stream, Reader, Writer, errors='strict')¶
Creates a StreamReaderWriter instance. stream must be a file-like
object. Reader and Writer must be factory functions or classes providing the
StreamReader and StreamWriter interface resp. Error handling
is done in the same way as defined for the stream readers and writers.

StreamReaderWriter instances define the combined interfaces of
StreamReader and StreamWriter classes. They inherit all other
methods and attributes from the underlying stream.
