class poplib.POP3_SSL(host, port=POP3_SSL_PORT, keyfile=None, certfile=None, timeout=None, context=None)¶
This is a subclass of POP3 that connects to the server over an SSL
encrypted socket.  If port is not specified, 995, the standard POP3-over-SSL
port is used.  timeout works as in the POP3 constructor.
context is an optional ssl.SSLContext object which allows
bundling SSL configuration options, certificates and private keys into a
single (potentially long-lived) structure.  Please read Security considerations
for best practices.
keyfile and certfile are a legacy alternative to context - they can
point to PEM-formatted private key and certificate chain files,
respectively, for the SSL connection.

Changed in version 3.2: context parameter added.


Changed in version 3.4: The class now supports hostname check with
ssl.SSLContext.check_hostname and Server Name Indication (see
ssl.HAS_SNI).


Deprecated since version 3.6: keyfile and certfile are deprecated in favor of context.
Please use ssl.SSLContext.load_cert_chain() instead, or let
ssl.create_default_context() select the system’s trusted CA
certificates for you.
