fastÂ¶
Deprecated. Enable fast mode if set to a true value.  The fast mode
disables the usage of memo, therefore speeding the pickling process by not
generating superfluous PUT opcodes.  It should not be used with
self-referential objects, doing otherwise will cause Pickler to
recurse infinitely.
Use pickletools.optimize() if you need more compact pickles.
