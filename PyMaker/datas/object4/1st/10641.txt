I can’t seem to use os.read() on a pipe created with os.popen(); why?¶
os.read() is a low-level function which takes a file descriptor, a small
integer representing the opened file.  os.popen() creates a high-level
file object, the same type returned by the built-in open() function.
Thus, to read n bytes from a pipe p created with os.popen(), you need to
use p.read(n).
