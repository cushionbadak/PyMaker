shlex.whitespace_splitÂ¶
If True, tokens will only be split in whitespaces.  This is useful, for
example, for parsing command lines with shlex, getting
tokens in a similar way to shell arguments.  If this attribute is True,
punctuation_chars will have no effect, and splitting will happen
only on whitespaces.  When using punctuation_chars, which is
intended to provide parsing closer to that implemented by shells, it is
advisable to leave whitespace_split as False (the default value).
