frame.clear()¶
This method clears all references to local variables held by the
frame.  Also, if the frame belonged to a generator, the generator
is finalized.  This helps break reference cycles involving frame
objects (for example when catching an exception and storing its
traceback for later use).
RuntimeError is raised if the frame is currently executing.

New in version 3.4.
