plistlib.load(fp, *, fmt=None, use_builtin_types=True, dict_type=dict)¶
Read a plist file. fp should be a readable and binary file object.
Return the unpacked root object (which usually is a
dictionary).
The fmt is the format of the file and the following values are valid:

None: Autodetect the file format
FMT_XML: XML file format
FMT_BINARY: Binary plist format

If use_builtin_types is true (the default) binary data will be returned
as instances of bytes, otherwise it is returned as instances of
Data.
The dict_type is the type used for dictionaries that are read from the
plist file.
XML data for the FMT_XML format is parsed using the Expat parser
from xml.parsers.expat – see its documentation for possible
exceptions on ill-formed XML.  Unknown elements will simply be ignored
by the plist parser.
The parser for the binary format raises InvalidFileException
when the file cannot be parsed.

New in version 3.4.
