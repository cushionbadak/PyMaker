Implementation Limitations¶
Some JSON deserializer implementations may set limits on:

the size of accepted JSON texts
the maximum level of nesting of JSON objects and arrays
the range and precision of JSON numbers
the content and maximum length of JSON strings

This module does not impose any such limits beyond those of the relevant
Python datatypes themselves or the Python interpreter itself.
When serializing to JSON, beware any such limitations in applications that may
consume your JSON.  In particular, it is common for JSON numbers to be
deserialized into IEEE 754 double precision numbers and thus subject to that
representation’s range and precision limitations.  This is especially relevant
when serializing Python int values of extremely large magnitude, or
when serializing instances of “exotic” numerical types such as
decimal.Decimal.
