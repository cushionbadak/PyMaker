assert_has_calls(calls, any_order=False)Â¶
assert the mock has been called with the specified calls.
The mock_calls list is checked for the calls.
If any_order is false (the default) then the calls must be
sequential. There can be extra calls before or after the
specified calls.
If any_order is true then the calls can be in any order, but
they must all appear in mock_calls.
>>> mock = Mock(return_value=None)
>>> mock(1)
>>> mock(2)
>>> mock(3)
>>> mock(4)
>>> calls = [call(2), call(3)]
>>> mock.assert_has_calls(calls)
>>> calls = [call(4), call(2), call(3)]
>>> mock.assert_has_calls(calls, any_order=True)
