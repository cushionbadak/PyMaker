tzinfo.tzname(dt)¶
Return the time zone name corresponding to the datetime object dt, as
a string. Nothing about string names is defined by the datetime module,
and there’s no requirement that it mean anything in particular.  For example,
“GMT”, “UTC”, “-500”, “-5:00”, “EDT”, “US/Eastern”, “America/New York” are all
valid replies.  Return None if a string name isn’t known.  Note that this is
a method rather than a fixed string primarily because some tzinfo
subclasses will wish to return different names depending on the specific value
of dt passed, especially if the tzinfo class is accounting for
daylight time.
The default implementation of tzname() raises NotImplementedError.
