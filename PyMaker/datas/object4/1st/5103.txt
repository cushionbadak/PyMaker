socket.recvfrom(bufsize[, flags])¶
Receive data from the socket.  The return value is a pair (bytes, address)
where bytes is a bytes object representing the data received and address is the
address of the socket sending the data.  See the Unix manual page
recv(2) for the meaning of the optional argument flags; it defaults
to zero. (The format of address depends on the address family — see above.)

Changed in version 3.5: If the system call is interrupted and the signal handler does not raise
an exception, the method now retries the system call instead of raising
an InterruptedError exception (see PEP 475 for the rationale).


Changed in version 3.7: For multicast IPv6 address, first item of address does not contain
%scope part anymore. In order to get full IPv6 address use
getnameinfo().
