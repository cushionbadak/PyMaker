DefaultCookiePolicy.rfc2109_as_netscapeÂ¶
If true, request that the CookieJar instance downgrade RFC 2109 cookies
(ie. cookies received in a Set-Cookie header with a version
cookie-attribute of 1) to Netscape cookies by setting the version attribute of
the Cookie instance to 0.  The default value is None, in which
case RFC 2109 cookies are downgraded if and only if RFC 2965 handling is turned
off.  Therefore, RFC 2109 cookies are downgraded by default.
