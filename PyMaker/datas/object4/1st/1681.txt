<dd><p>Return the result of rotating the digits of the first operand by an amount
specified by the second operand.  The second operand must be an integer in
the range -precision through precision.  The absolute value of the second
operand gives the number of places to rotate.  If the second operand is
positive then rotation is to the left; otherwise rotation is to the right.
The coefficient of the first operand is padded on the left with zeros to
length precision if necessary.  The sign and exponent of the first operand
are unchanged.</p>
