faulthandler.dump_traceback_later(timeout, repeat=False, file=sys.stderr, exit=False)¶
Dump the tracebacks of all threads, after a timeout of timeout seconds, or
every timeout seconds if repeat is True.  If exit is True, call
_exit() with status=1 after dumping the tracebacks.  (Note
_exit() exits the process immediately, which means it doesn’t do any
cleanup like flushing file buffers.) If the function is called twice, the new
call replaces previous parameters and resets the timeout. The timer has a
sub-second resolution.
The file must be kept open until the traceback is dumped or
cancel_dump_traceback_later() is called: see issue with file
descriptors.
This function is implemented using a watchdog thread and therefore is not
available if Python is compiled with threads disabled.

Changed in version 3.5: Added support for passing file descriptor to this function.
