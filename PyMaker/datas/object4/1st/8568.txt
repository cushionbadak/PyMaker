assert_any_call(*args, **kwargs)Â¶
assert the mock has been called with the specified arguments.
The assert passes if the mock has ever been called, unlike
assert_called_with() and assert_called_once_with() that
only pass if the call is the most recent one, and in the case of
assert_called_once_with() it must also be the only call.
>>> mock = Mock(return_value=None)
>>> mock(1, 2, arg='thing')
>>> mock('some', 'thing', 'else')
>>> mock.assert_any_call(1, 2, arg='thing')
