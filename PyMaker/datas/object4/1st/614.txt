The NotImplemented Object¶
This object is returned from comparisons and binary operations when they are
asked to operate on types they don’t support. See Comparisons for more
information.  There is exactly one NotImplemented object.
type(NotImplemented)() produces the singleton instance.
It is written as NotImplemented.
