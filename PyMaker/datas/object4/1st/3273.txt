High-level Module Interface¶


io.DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE¶
An int containing the default buffer size used by the module’s buffered I/O
classes.  open() uses the file’s blksize (as obtained by
os.stat()) if possible.



io.open(file, mode='r', buffering=-1, encoding=None, errors=None, newline=None, closefd=True, opener=None)¶
This is an alias for the builtin open() function.



exception io.BlockingIOError¶
This is a compatibility alias for the builtin BlockingIOError
exception.



exception io.UnsupportedOperation¶
An exception inheriting OSError and ValueError that is raised
when an unsupported operation is called on a stream.


In-memory streams¶
It is also possible to use a str or bytes-like object as a
file for both reading and writing.  For strings StringIO can be used
like a file opened in text mode.  BytesIO can be used like a file
opened in binary mode.  Both provide full read-write capabilities with random
access.

sys
contains the standard IO streams: sys.stdin, sys.stdout,
and sys.stderr.
