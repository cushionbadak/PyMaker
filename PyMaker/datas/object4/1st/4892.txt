Read-only Transports¶


ReadTransport.is_reading()¶
Return True if the transport is receiving new data.

New in version 3.7.




ReadTransport.pause_reading()¶
Pause the receiving end of the transport.  No data will be passed to
the protocol’s protocol.data_received()
method until resume_reading() is called.

Changed in version 3.7: The method is idempotent, i.e. it can be called when the
transport is already paused or closed.




ReadTransport.resume_reading()¶
Resume the receiving end.  The protocol’s
protocol.data_received() method
will be called once again if some data is available for reading.

Changed in version 3.7: The method is idempotent, i.e. it can be called when the
transport is already reading.
