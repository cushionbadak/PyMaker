Path.samefile(other_path)Â¶
Return whether this path points to the same file as other_path, which
can be either a Path object, or a string.  The semantics are similar
to os.path.samefile() and os.path.samestat().
An OSError can be raised if either file cannot be accessed for some
reason.
>>> p = Path('spam')
>>> q = Path('eggs')
>>> p.samefile(q)
False
>>> p.samefile('spam')
True
