History file¶
The following functions operate on a history file:


readline.read_history_file([filename])¶
Load a readline history file, and append it to the history list.
The default filename is ~/.history.  This calls
read_history() in the underlying library.



readline.write_history_file([filename])¶
Save the history list to a readline history file, overwriting any
existing file.  The default filename is ~/.history.  This calls
write_history() in the underlying library.



readline.append_history_file(nelements[, filename])¶
Append the last nelements items of history to a file.  The default filename is
~/.history.  The file must already exist.  This calls
append_history() in the underlying library.  This function
only exists if Python was compiled for a version of the library
that supports it.

New in version 3.5.




readline.get_history_length()¶

readline.set_history_length(length)¶
Set or return the desired number of lines to save in the history file.
The write_history_file() function uses this value to truncate
the history file, by calling history_truncate_file() in
the underlying library.  Negative values imply
unlimited history file size.
