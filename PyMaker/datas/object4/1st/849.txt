compare(a, b)Â¶
Compare two sequences of lines, and generate the delta (a sequence of lines).
Each sequence must contain individual single-line strings ending with
newlines.  Such sequences can be obtained from the
readlines() method of file-like objects.  The delta
generated also consists of newline-terminated strings, ready to be
printed as-is via the writelines() method of a
file-like object.
