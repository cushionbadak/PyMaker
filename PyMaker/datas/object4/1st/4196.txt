daemonÂ¶
A boolean value indicating whether this thread is a daemon thread (True)
or not (False).  This must be set before start() is called,
otherwise RuntimeError is raised.  Its initial value is inherited
from the creating thread; the main thread is not a daemon thread and
therefore all threads created in the main thread default to
daemon = False.
The entire Python program exits when no alive non-daemon threads are left.
