class multiprocessing.JoinableQueue([maxsize])¶
JoinableQueue, a Queue subclass, is a queue which
additionally has task_done() and join() methods.


task_done()¶
Indicate that a formerly enqueued task is complete. Used by queue
consumers.  For each get() used to fetch a task, a subsequent
call to task_done() tells the queue that the processing on the task
is complete.
If a join() is currently blocking, it will resume when all
items have been processed (meaning that a task_done() call was
received for every item that had been put() into the queue).
Raises a ValueError if called more times than there were items
placed in the queue.



join()¶
Block until all items in the queue have been gotten and processed.
The count of unfinished tasks goes up whenever an item is added to the
queue.  The count goes down whenever a consumer calls
task_done() to indicate that the item was retrieved and all work on
it is complete.  When the count of unfinished tasks drops to zero,
join() unblocks.
