os.chdir(path)Â¶
Change the current working directory to path.
This function can support specifying a file descriptor.  The
descriptor must refer to an opened directory, not an open file.

New in version 3.3: Added support for specifying path as a file descriptor
on some platforms.


Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a path-like object.
