docs:


from_float(flt)Â¶
This class method constructs a Fraction representing the exact
value of flt, which must be a float. Beware that
Fraction.from_float(0.3) is not the same value as Fraction(3, 10).

Note
From Python 3.2 onwards, you can also construct a
Fraction instance directly from a float.
