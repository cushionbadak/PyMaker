class email.mime.text.MIMEText(_text, _subtype='plain', _charset=None, *, policy=compat32)¶
Module: email.mime.text
A subclass of MIMENonMultipart, the
MIMEText class is used to create MIME objects of major type
text. _text is the string for the payload.  _subtype is the
minor type and defaults to plain.  _charset is the character
set of the text and is passed as an argument to the
MIMENonMultipart constructor; it defaults
to us-ascii if the string contains only ascii code points, and
utf-8 otherwise.  The _charset parameter accepts either a string or a
Charset instance.
Unless the _charset argument is explicitly set to None, the
MIMEText object created will have both a Content-Type header
with a charset parameter, and a Content-Transfer-Encoding
header.  This means that a subsequent set_payload call will not result
in an encoded payload, even if a charset is passed in the set_payload
command.  You can “reset” this behavior by deleting the
Content-Transfer-Encoding header, after which a set_payload call
will automatically encode the new payload (and add a new
Content-Transfer-Encoding header).
Optional policy argument defaults to compat32.

Changed in version 3.5: _charset also accepts Charset instances.


Changed in version 3.6: Added policy keyword-only parameter.
