Programmatic access to enumeration members and their attributes¶
Sometimes it’s useful to access members in enumerations programmatically (i.e.
situations where Color.RED won’t do because the exact color is not known
at program-writing time).  Enum allows such access:
>>> Color(1)
<Color.RED: 1>
>>> Color(3)
<Color.BLUE: 3>


If you want to access enum members by name, use item access:
>>> Color['RED']
<Color.RED: 1>
>>> Color['GREEN']
<Color.GREEN: 2>


If you have an enum member and need its name or value:
>>> member = Color.RED
>>> member.name
'RED'
>>> member.value
1
