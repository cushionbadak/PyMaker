docs:


Path.resolve(strict=False)¶
Make the path absolute, resolving any symlinks.  A new path object is
returned:
>>> p = Path()
>>> p
PosixPath('.')
>>> p.resolve()
PosixPath('/home/antoine/pathlib')


“..” components are also eliminated (this is the only method to do so):
>>> p = Path('docs/../setup.py')
>>> p.resolve()
PosixPath('/home/antoine/pathlib/setup.py')


If the path doesn’t exist and strict is True, FileNotFoundError
is raised.  If strict is False, the path is resolved as far as possible
and any remainder is appended without checking whether it exists.  If an
infinite loop is encountered along the resolution path, RuntimeError
is raised.

New in version 3.6: The strict argument (pre-3.6 behavior is strict).
