print_stack(*, limit=None, file=None)Â¶
Print the stack or traceback for this Task.
This produces output similar to that of the traceback module
for the frames retrieved by get_stack().
The limit argument is passed to get_stack() directly.
The file argument is an I/O stream to which the output
is written; by default output is written to sys.stderr.
