__getitem__(name)¶
Return the value of the named header field.  name does not include the
colon field separator.  If the header is missing, None is returned; a
KeyError is never raised.
Note that if the named field appears more than once in the message’s
headers, exactly which of those field values will be returned is
undefined.  Use the get_all() method to get the values of all the
extant headers named name.
Using the standard (non-compat32) policies, the returned value is an
instance of a subclass of email.headerregistry.BaseHeader.
