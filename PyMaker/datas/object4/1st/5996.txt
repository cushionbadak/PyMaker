base64.a85decode(b, *, foldspaces=False, adobe=False, ignorechars=b' \t\n\r\v')¶
Decode the Ascii85 encoded bytes-like object or ASCII string b and
return the decoded bytes.
foldspaces is a flag that specifies whether the ‘y’ short sequence
should be accepted as shorthand for 4 consecutive spaces (ASCII 0x20).
This feature is not supported by the “standard” Ascii85 encoding.
adobe controls whether the input sequence is in Adobe Ascii85 format
(i.e. is framed with <~ and ~>).
ignorechars should be a bytes-like object or ASCII string
containing characters to ignore
from the input. This should only contain whitespace characters, and by
default contains all whitespace characters in ASCII.

New in version 3.4.
