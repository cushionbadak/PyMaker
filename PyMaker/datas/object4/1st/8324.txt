typing.TupleÂ¶
Tuple type; Tuple[X, Y] is the type of a tuple of two items
with the first item of type X and the second of type Y.
Example: Tuple[T1, T2] is a tuple of two elements corresponding
to type variables T1 and T2.  Tuple[int, float, str] is a tuple
of an int, a float and a string.
To specify a variable-length tuple of homogeneous type,
use literal ellipsis, e.g. Tuple[int, ...]. A plain Tuple
is equivalent to Tuple[Any, ...], and in turn to tuple.
