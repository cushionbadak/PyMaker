class wsgiref.util.FileWrapper(filelike, blksize=8192)¶
A wrapper to convert a file-like object to an iterator.  The resulting objects
support both __getitem__() and __iter__() iteration styles, for
compatibility with Python 2.1 and Jython. As the object is iterated over, the
optional blksize parameter will be repeatedly passed to the filelike
object’s read() method to obtain bytestrings to yield.  When read()
returns an empty bytestring, iteration is ended and is not resumable.
If filelike has a close() method, the returned object will also have a
close() method, and it will invoke the filelike object’s close()
method when called.
Example usage:
from io import StringIO
from wsgiref.util import FileWrapper

# We're using a StringIO-buffer for as the file-like object
filelike = StringIO("This is an example file-like object"*10)
wrapper = FileWrapper(filelike, blksize=5)

for chunk in wrapper:
    print(chunk)
