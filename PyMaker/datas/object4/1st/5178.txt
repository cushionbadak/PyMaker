ssl.PROTOCOL_SSLv3Â¶
Selects SSL version 3 as the channel encryption protocol.
This protocol is not be available if OpenSSL is compiled with the
OPENSSL_NO_SSLv3 flag.

Warning
SSL version 3 is insecure.  Its use is highly discouraged.


Deprecated since version 3.6: OpenSSL has deprecated all version specific protocols. Use the default
protocol PROTOCOL_TLS with flags like OP_NO_SSLv3 instead.
