class queue.PriorityQueue(maxsize=0)Â¶
Constructor for a priority queue.  maxsize is an integer that sets the upperbound
limit on the number of items that can be placed in the queue.  Insertion will
block once this size has been reached, until queue items are consumed.  If
maxsize is less than or equal to zero, the queue size is infinite.
The lowest valued entries are retrieved first (the lowest valued entry is the
one returned by sorted(list(entries))[0]).  A typical pattern for entries
is a tuple in the form: (priority_number, data).
If the data elements are not comparable, the data can be wrapped in a class
that ignores the data item and only compares the priority number:
from dataclasses import dataclass, field
from typing import Any

@dataclass(order=True)
class PrioritizedItem:
    priority: int
    item: Any=field(compare=False)
