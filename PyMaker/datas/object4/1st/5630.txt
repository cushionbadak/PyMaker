class email.headerregistry.MIMEVersionHeader¶
There is really only one valid value for the MIME-Version
header, and that is 1.0.  For future proofing, this header class
supports other valid version numbers.  If a version number has a valid value
per RFC 2045, then the header object will have non-None values for
the following attributes:


version¶
The version number as a string, with any whitespace and/or comments
removed.



major¶
The major version number as an integer



minor¶
The minor version number as an integer
