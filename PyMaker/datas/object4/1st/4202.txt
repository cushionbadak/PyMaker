release()Â¶
Release a lock.  This can be called from any thread, not only the thread
which has acquired the lock.
When the lock is locked, reset it to unlocked, and return.  If any other threads
are blocked waiting for the lock to become unlocked, allow exactly one of them
to proceed.
When invoked on an unlocked lock, a RuntimeError is raised.
There is no return value.
