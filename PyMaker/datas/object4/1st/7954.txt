class turtle.Vec2D(x, y)Â¶
A two-dimensional vector class, used as a helper class for implementing
turtle graphics.  May be useful for turtle graphics programs too.  Derived
from tuple, so a vector is a tuple!
Provides (for a, b vectors, k number):

a + b vector addition
a - b vector subtraction
a * b inner product
k * a and a * k multiplication with scalar
abs(a) absolute value of a
a.rotate(angle) rotation
