class asyncore.file_wrapperÂ¶
A file_wrapper takes an integer file descriptor and calls os.dup() to
duplicate the handle so that the original handle may be closed independently
of the file_wrapper.  This class implements sufficient methods to emulate a
socket for use by the file_dispatcher class.
Availability: Unix.
