Common problems and solutions¶

Most HTTP servers buffer the output from CGI scripts until the script is
completed.  This means that it is not possible to display a progress report on
the client’s display while the script is running.
Check the installation instructions above.
Check the HTTP server’s log files.  (tail -f logfile in a separate window
may be useful!)
Always check a script for syntax errors first, by doing something like
python script.py.
If your script does not have any syntax errors, try adding import cgitb;
cgitb.enable() to the top of the script.
When invoking external programs, make sure they can be found. Usually, this
means using absolute path names — PATH is usually not set to a very
useful value in a CGI script.
When reading or writing external files, make sure they can be read or written
by the userid under which your CGI script will be running: this is typically the
userid under which the web server is running, or some explicitly specified
userid for a web server’s suexec feature.
Don’t try to give a CGI script a set-uid mode.  This doesn’t work on most
systems, and is a security liability as well.

[1]Note that some recent versions of the HTML specification do state what
order the field values should be supplied in, but knowing whether a request
was received from a conforming browser, or even from a browser at all, is
tedious and error-prone.
