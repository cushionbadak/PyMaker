ExceptionsÂ¶
Exceptions raised in the child process, before the new program has started to
execute, will be re-raised in the parent.
The most common exception raised is OSError.  This occurs, for example,
when trying to execute a non-existent file.  Applications should prepare for
OSError exceptions.
A ValueError will be raised if Popen is called with invalid
arguments.
check_call() and check_output() will raise
CalledProcessError if the called process returns a non-zero return
code.
All of the functions and methods that accept a timeout parameter, such as
call() and Popen.communicate() will raise TimeoutExpired if
the timeout expires before the process exits.
Exceptions defined in this module all inherit from SubprocessError.


New in version 3.3: The SubprocessError base class was added.
