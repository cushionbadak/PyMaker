ssl.PROTOCOL_TLSv1_1Â¶
Selects TLS version 1.1 as the channel encryption protocol.
Available only with openssl version 1.0.1+.

New in version 3.4.


Deprecated since version 3.6: OpenSSL has deprecated all version specific protocols. Use the default
protocol PROTOCOL_TLS with flags like OP_NO_SSLv3 instead.
