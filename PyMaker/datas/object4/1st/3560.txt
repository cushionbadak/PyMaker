logging.lastResort¶
A “handler of last resort” is available through this attribute. This
is a StreamHandler writing to sys.stderr with a level of
WARNING, and is used to handle logging events in the absence of any
logging configuration. The end result is to just print the message to
sys.stderr. This replaces the earlier error message saying that
“no handlers could be found for logger XYZ”. If you need the earlier
behaviour for some reason, lastResort can be set to None.

New in version 3.2.
