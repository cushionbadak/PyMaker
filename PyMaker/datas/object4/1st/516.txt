bytearray.capitalize()¶
Return a copy of the sequence with each byte interpreted as an ASCII
character, and the first byte capitalized and the rest lowercased.
Non-ASCII byte values are passed through unchanged.

Note
The bytearray version of this method does not operate in place - it
always produces a new object, even if no changes were made.
