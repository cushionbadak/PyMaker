call_args_listÂ¶
This is a list of all the calls made to the mock object in sequence
(so the length of the list is the number of times it has been
called). Before any calls have been made it is an empty list. The
call object can be used for conveniently constructing lists of
calls to compare with call_args_list.
>>> mock = Mock(return_value=None)
>>> mock()
>>> mock(3, 4)
>>> mock(key='fish', next='w00t!')
>>> mock.call_args_list
[call(), call(3, 4), call(key='fish', next='w00t!')]
>>> expected = [(), ((3, 4),), ({'key': 'fish', 'next': 'w00t!'},)]
>>> mock.call_args_list == expected
True


Members of call_args_list are call objects. These can be
unpacked as tuples to get at the individual arguments. See
calls as tuples.
