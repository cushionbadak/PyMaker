object.__exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback)¶
Exit the runtime context related to this object. The parameters describe the
exception that caused the context to be exited. If the context was exited
without an exception, all three arguments will be None.
If an exception is supplied, and the method wishes to suppress the exception
(i.e., prevent it from being propagated), it should return a true value.
Otherwise, the exception will be processed normally upon exit from this method.
Note that __exit__() methods should not reraise the passed-in exception;
this is the caller’s responsibility.
