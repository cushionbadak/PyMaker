readline.set_startup_hook([function])Â¶
Set or remove the function invoked by the rl_startup_hook
callback of the underlying library.  If function is specified, it will
be used as the new hook function; if omitted or None, any function
already installed is removed.  The hook is called with no
arguments just before readline prints the first prompt.
