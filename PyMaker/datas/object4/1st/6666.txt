OpenerDirector.error(proto, *args)Â¶
Handle an error of the given protocol.  This will call the registered error
handlers for the given protocol with the given arguments (which are protocol
specific).  The HTTP protocol is a special case which uses the HTTP response
code to determine the specific error handler; refer to the http_error_<type>()
methods of the handler classes.
Return values and exceptions raised are the same as those of urlopen().
