Using locks, conditions, and semaphores in the with statementÂ¶
All of the objects provided by this module that have acquire() and
release() methods can be used as context managers for a with
statement.  The acquire() method will be called when the block is
entered, and release() will be called when the block is exited.  Hence,
the following snippet:
with some_lock:
    # do something...


is equivalent to:
some_lock.acquire()
try:
    # do something...
finally:
    some_lock.release()


Currently, Lock, RLock, Condition,
Semaphore, and BoundedSemaphore objects may be used as
with statement context managers.
