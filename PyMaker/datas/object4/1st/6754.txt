urllib.parse.quote(string, safe='/', encoding=None, errors=None)¶
Replace special characters in string using the %xx escape. Letters,
digits, and the characters '_.-~' are never quoted. By default, this
function is intended for quoting the path section of URL. The optional safe
parameter specifies additional ASCII characters that should not be quoted
— its default value is '/'.
string may be either a str or a bytes.

Changed in version 3.7: Moved from RFC 2396 to RFC 3986 for quoting URL strings. “~” is now
included in the set of reserved characters.

The optional encoding and errors parameters specify how to deal with
non-ASCII characters, as accepted by the str.encode() method.
encoding defaults to 'utf-8'.
errors defaults to 'strict', meaning unsupported characters raise a
UnicodeEncodeError.
encoding and errors must not be supplied if string is a
bytes, or a TypeError is raised.
Note that quote(string, safe, encoding, errors) is equivalent to
quote_from_bytes(string.encode(encoding, errors), safe).
Example: quote('/El Niño/') yields '/El%20Ni%C3%B1o/'.
