docs:


abort()¶
Put the barrier into a broken state.  This causes any active or future
calls to wait() to fail with the BrokenBarrierError.  Use
this for example if one of the needs to abort, to avoid deadlocking the
application.
It may be preferable to simply create the barrier with a sensible
timeout value to automatically guard against one of the threads going
awry.
