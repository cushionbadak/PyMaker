errorsÂ¶
A list of the non-fatal errors encountered while loading tests. Not reset
by the loader at any point. Fatal errors are signalled by the relevant
a method raising an exception to the caller. Non-fatal errors are also
indicated by a synthetic test that will raise the original error when
run.

New in version 3.5.
