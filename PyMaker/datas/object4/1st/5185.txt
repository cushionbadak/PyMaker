ssl.OP_NO_TLSv1Â¶
Prevents a TLSv1 connection.  This option is only applicable in
conjunction with PROTOCOL_TLS.  It prevents the peers from
choosing TLSv1 as the protocol version.

New in version 3.2.


Deprecated since version 3.7: The option is deprecated since OpenSSL 1.1.0, use the new
SSLContext.minimum_version and
SSLContext.maximum_version instead.
