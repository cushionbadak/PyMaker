Future Object¶


class asyncio.Future(*, loop=None)¶
A Future represents an eventual result of an asynchronous
operation.  Not thread-safe.
Future is an awaitable object.  Coroutines can await on
Future objects until they either have a result or an exception
set, or until they are cancelled.
Typically Futures are used to enable low-level
callback-based code (e.g. in protocols implemented using asyncio
transports)
to interoperate with high-level async/await code.
The rule of thumb is to never expose Future objects in user-facing
APIs, and the recommended way to create a Future object is to call
loop.create_future().  This way alternative event loop
implementations can inject their own optimized implementations
of a Future object.

Changed in version 3.7: Added support for the contextvars module.



result()¶
Return the result of the Future.
If the Future is done and has a result set by the
set_result() method, the result value is returned.
If the Future is done and has an exception set by the
set_exception() method, this method raises the exception.
If the Future has been cancelled, this method raises
a CancelledError exception.
If the Future’s result isn’t yet available, this method raises
a InvalidStateError exception.



set_result(result)¶
Mark the Future as done and set its result.
Raises a InvalidStateError error if the Future is
already done.



set_exception(exception)¶
Mark the Future as done and set an exception.
Raises a InvalidStateError error if the Future is
already done.



done()¶
Return True if the Future is done.
A Future is done if it was cancelled or if it has a result
or an exception set with set_result() or
set_exception() calls.



cancelled()¶
Return True if the Future was cancelled.
The method is usually used to check if a Future is not
cancelled before setting a result or an exception for it:
if not fut.cancelled():
    fut.set_result(42)





add_done_callback(callback, *, context=None)¶
Add a callback to be run when the Future is done.
The callback is called with the Future object as its only
argument.
If the Future is already done when this method is called,
the callback is scheduled with loop.call_soon().
An optional keyword-only context argument allows specifying a
custom contextvars.Context for the callback to run in.
The current context is used when no context is provided.
functools.partial() can be used to pass parameters
to the callback, e.g.:
# Call 'print("Future:", fut)' when "fut" is done.
fut.add_done_callback(
    functools.partial(print, "Future:"))



Changed in version 3.7: The context keyword-only parameter was added.
See PEP 567 for more details.




remove_done_callback(callback)¶
Remove callback from the callbacks list.
Returns the number of callbacks removed, which is typically 1,
unless a callback was added more than once.



cancel()¶
Cancel the Future and schedule callbacks.
If the Future is already done or cancelled, return False.
Otherwise, change the Future’s state to cancelled,
schedule the callbacks, and return True.



exception()¶
Return the exception that was set on this Future.
The exception (or None if no exception was set) is
returned only if the Future is done.
If the Future has been cancelled, this method raises a
CancelledError exception.
If the Future isn’t done yet, this method raises an
InvalidStateError exception.



get_loop()¶
Return the event loop the Future object is bound to.

New in version 3.7.



This example creates a Future object, creates and schedules an
asynchronous Task to set result for the Future, and waits until
the Future has a result:
async def set_after(fut, delay, value):
    # Sleep for *delay* seconds.
    await asyncio.sleep(delay)

    # Set *value* as a result of *fut* Future.
    fut.set_result(value)

async def main():
    # Get the current event loop.
    loop = asyncio.get_running_loop()

    # Create a new Future object.
    fut = loop.create_future()

    # Run "set_after()" coroutine in a parallel Task.
    # We are using the low-level "loop.create_task()" API here because
    # we already have a reference to the event loop at hand.
    # Otherwise we could have just used "asyncio.create_task()".
    loop.create_task(
        set_after(fut, 1, '... world'))

    print('hello ...')

    # Wait until *fut* has a result (1 second) and print it.
    print(await fut)

asyncio.run(main())



Important
The Future object was designed to mimic
concurrent.futures.Future.  Key differences include:

unlike asyncio Futures, concurrent.futures.Future
instances cannot be awaited.
asyncio.Future.result() and asyncio.Future.exception()
do not accept the timeout argument.
asyncio.Future.result() and asyncio.Future.exception()
raise an InvalidStateError exception when the Future is not
done.
Callbacks registered with asyncio.Future.add_done_callback()
are not called immediately.  They are scheduled with
loop.call_soon() instead.
asyncio Future is not compatible with the
concurrent.futures.wait() and
concurrent.futures.as_completed() functions.
