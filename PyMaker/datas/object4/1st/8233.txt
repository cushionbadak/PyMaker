CalltipsÂ¶
A calltip is shown when one types ( after the name of an accessible
function.  A name expression may include dots and subscripts.  A calltip
remains until it is clicked, the cursor is moved out of the argument area,
or ) is typed.  When the cursor is in the argument part of a definition,
the menu or shortcut display a calltip.
A calltip consists of the function signature and the first line of the
docstring.  For builtins without an accessible signature, the calltip
consists of all lines up the fifth line or the first blank line.  These
details may change.
The set of accessible functions depends on what modules have been imported
into the user process, including those imported by Idle itself,
and what definitions have been run, all since the last restart.
For example, restart the Shell and enter itertools.count(.  A calltip
appears because Idle imports itertools into the user process for its own use.
(This could change.)  Enter turtle.write( and nothing appears.  Idle does
not import turtle.  The menu or shortcut do nothing either.  Enter
import turtle and then turtle.write( will work.
In an editor, import statements have no effect until one runs the file.  One
might want to run a file after writing the import statements at the top,
or immediately run an existing file before editing.
