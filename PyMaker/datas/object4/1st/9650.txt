module_repr(module)¶
A legacy method which when implemented calculates and returns the
given module’s repr, as a string. The module type’s default repr() will
use the result of this method as appropriate.

New in version 3.3.


Changed in version 3.4: Made optional instead of an abstractmethod.


Deprecated since version 3.4: The import machinery now takes care of this automatically.
