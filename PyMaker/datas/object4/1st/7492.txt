class ipaddress.IPv6Interface(address)¶
Construct an IPv6 interface.  The meaning of address is as in the
constructor of IPv6Network, except that arbitrary host addresses
are always accepted.
IPv6Interface is a subclass of IPv6Address, so it inherits
all the attributes from that class.  In addition, the following attributes
are available:


ip¶



network¶



with_prefixlen¶



with_netmask¶



with_hostmask¶
Refer to the corresponding attribute documentation in
IPv4Interface.
