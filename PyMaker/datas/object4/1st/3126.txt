os.symlink(src, dst, target_is_directory=False, *, dir_fd=None)Â¶
Create a symbolic link pointing to src named dst.
On Windows, a symlink represents either a file or a directory, and does not
morph to the target dynamically.  If the target is present, the type of the
symlink will be created to match. Otherwise, the symlink will be created
as a directory if target_is_directory is True or a file symlink (the
default) otherwise.  On non-Windows platforms, target_is_directory is ignored.
Symbolic link support was introduced in Windows 6.0 (Vista).  symlink()
will raise a NotImplementedError on Windows versions earlier than 6.0.
This function can support paths relative to directory descriptors.

Note
On Windows, the SeCreateSymbolicLinkPrivilege is required in order to
successfully create symlinks. This privilege is not typically granted to
regular users but is available to accounts which can escalate privileges
to the administrator level. Either obtaining the privilege or running your
application as an administrator are ways to successfully create symlinks.
OSError is raised when the function is called by an unprivileged
user.

Availability: Unix, Windows.

Changed in version 3.2: Added support for Windows 6.0 (Vista) symbolic links.


New in version 3.3: Added the dir_fd argument, and now allow target_is_directory
on non-Windows platforms.


Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a path-like object for src and dst.
