Hashing Methods¶

New in version 3.3.

The crypt module defines the list of hashing methods (not all methods
are available on all platforms):


crypt.METHOD_SHA512¶
A Modular Crypt Format method with 16 character salt and 86 character
hash based on the SHA-512 hash function.  This is the strongest method.



crypt.METHOD_SHA256¶
Another Modular Crypt Format method with 16 character salt and 43
character hash based on the SHA-256 hash function.



crypt.METHOD_BLOWFISH¶
Another Modular Crypt Format method with 22 character salt and 31
character hash based on the Blowfish cipher.

New in version 3.7.




crypt.METHOD_MD5¶
Another Modular Crypt Format method with 8 character salt and 22
character hash based on the MD5 hash function.



crypt.METHOD_CRYPT¶
The traditional method with a 2 character salt and 13 characters of
hash.  This is the weakest method.
