mapLogRecord(record)¶
Provides a dictionary, based on record, which is to be URL-encoded
and sent to the web server. The default implementation just returns
record.__dict__. This method can be overridden if e.g. only a
subset of LogRecord is to be sent to the web server, or
if more specific customization of what’s sent to the server is required.
