object.__getitem__(self, key)Â¶
Called to implement evaluation of self[key]. For sequence types, the
accepted keys should be integers and slice objects.  Note that the special
interpretation of negative indexes (if the class wishes to emulate a sequence
type) is up to the __getitem__() method. If key is of an inappropriate
type, TypeError may be raised; if of a value outside the set of indexes
for the sequence (after any special interpretation of negative values),
IndexError should be raised. For mapping types, if key is missing (not
in the container), KeyError should be raised.

Note
for loops expect that an IndexError will be raised for illegal
indexes to allow proper detection of the end of the sequence.
