class codeop.Compile¶
Instances of this class have __call__() methods identical in signature to
the built-in function compile(), but with the difference that if the
instance compiles program text containing a __future__ statement, the
instance ‘remembers’ and compiles all subsequent program texts with the
statement in force.
