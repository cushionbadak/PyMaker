class shelve.DbfilenameShelf(filename, flag='c', protocol=None, writeback=False)Â¶
A subclass of Shelf which accepts a filename instead of a dict-like
object.  The underlying file will be opened using dbm.open().  By
default, the file will be created and opened for both read and write.  The
optional flag parameter has the same interpretation as for the open()
function.  The optional protocol and writeback parameters have the same
interpretation as for the Shelf class.
