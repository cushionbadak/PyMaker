curses.start_color()Â¶
Must be called if the programmer wants to use colors, and before any other color
manipulation routine is called.  It is good practice to call this routine right
after initscr().
start_color() initializes eight basic colors (black, red,  green, yellow,
blue, magenta, cyan, and white), and two global variables in the curses
module, COLORS and COLOR_PAIRS, containing the maximum number
of colors and color-pairs the terminal can support.  It also restores the colors
on the terminal to the values they had when the terminal was just turned on.
