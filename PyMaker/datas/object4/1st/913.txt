Init file¶
The following functions relate to the init file and user configuration:


readline.parse_and_bind(string)¶
Execute the init line provided in the string argument. This calls
rl_parse_and_bind() in the underlying library.



readline.read_init_file([filename])¶
Execute a readline initialization file. The default filename is the last filename
used. This calls rl_read_init_file() in the underlying library.
