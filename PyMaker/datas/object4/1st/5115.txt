docs:


socket.setblocking(flag)Â¶
Set blocking or non-blocking mode of the socket: if flag is false, the
socket is set to non-blocking, else to blocking mode.
This method is a shorthand for certain settimeout() calls:

sock.setblocking(True) is equivalent to sock.settimeout(None)
sock.setblocking(False) is equivalent to sock.settimeout(0.0)


Changed in version 3.7: The method no longer applies SOCK_NONBLOCK flag on
socket.type.
