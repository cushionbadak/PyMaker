<dd><p>Raised when an operation runs out of memory but the situation may still be
rescued (by deleting some objects).  The associated value is a string indicating
what kind of (internal) operation ran out of memory. Note that because of the
underlying memory management architecture (C’s <code class="xref c c-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">malloc()</span></code> function), the
interpreter may not always be able to completely recover from this situation; it
nevertheless raises an exception so that a stack traceback can be printed, in
case a run-away program was the cause.</p>
