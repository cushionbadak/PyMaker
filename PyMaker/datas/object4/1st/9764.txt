Setting up an importerÂ¶
For deep customizations of import, you typically want to implement an
importer. This means managing both the finder and loader
side of things. For finders there are two flavours to choose from depending on
your needs: a meta path finder or a path entry finder. The
former is what you would put on sys.meta_path while the latter is what
you create using a path entry hook on sys.path_hooks which works
with sys.path entries to potentially create a finder. This example will
show you how to register your own importers so that import will use them (for
creating an importer for yourself, read the documentation for the appropriate
classes defined within this package):
import importlib.machinery
import sys

# For illustrative purposes only.
SpamMetaPathFinder = importlib.machinery.PathFinder
SpamPathEntryFinder = importlib.machinery.FileFinder
loader_details = (importlib.machinery.SourceFileLoader,
                  importlib.machinery.SOURCE_SUFFIXES)

# Setting up a meta path finder.
# Make sure to put the finder in the proper location in the list in terms of
# priority.
sys.meta_path.append(SpamMetaPathFinder)

# Setting up a path entry finder.
# Make sure to put the path hook in the proper location in the list in terms
# of priority.
sys.path_hooks.append(SpamPathEntryFinder.path_hook(loader_details))
