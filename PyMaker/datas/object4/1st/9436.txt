gc.is_tracked(obj)¶
Returns True if the object is currently tracked by the garbage collector,
False otherwise.  As a general rule, instances of atomic types aren’t
tracked and instances of non-atomic types (containers, user-defined
objects…) are.  However, some type-specific optimizations can be present
in order to suppress the garbage collector footprint of simple instances
(e.g. dicts containing only atomic keys and values):
>>> gc.is_tracked(0)
False
>>> gc.is_tracked("a")
False
>>> gc.is_tracked([])
True
>>> gc.is_tracked({})
False
>>> gc.is_tracked({"a": 1})
False
>>> gc.is_tracked({"a": []})
True
