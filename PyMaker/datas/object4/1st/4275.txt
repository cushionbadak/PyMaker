put(obj[, block[, timeout]])Â¶
Put obj into the queue.  If the optional argument block is True
(the default) and timeout is None (the default), block if necessary until
a free slot is available.  If timeout is a positive number, it blocks at
most timeout seconds and raises the queue.Full exception if no
free slot was available within that time.  Otherwise (block is
False), put an item on the queue if a free slot is immediately
available, else raise the queue.Full exception (timeout is
ignored in that case).
