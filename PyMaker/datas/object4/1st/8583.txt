method_callsÂ¶
As well as tracking calls to themselves, mocks also track calls to
methods and attributes, and their methods and attributes:
>>> mock = Mock()
>>> mock.method()
<Mock name='mock.method()' id='...'>
>>> mock.property.method.attribute()
<Mock name='mock.property.method.attribute()' id='...'>
>>> mock.method_calls
[call.method(), call.property.method.attribute()]


Members of method_calls are call objects. These can be
unpacked as tuples to get at the individual arguments. See
calls as tuples.
