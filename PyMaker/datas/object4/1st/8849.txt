class test.support.DirsOnSysPath(*paths)Â¶
A context manager to temporarily add directories to sys.path.
This makes a copy of sys.path, appends any directories given
as positional arguments, then reverts sys.path to the copied
settings when the context ends.
Note that all sys.path modifications in the body of the
context manager, including replacement of the object,
will be reverted at the end of the block.
