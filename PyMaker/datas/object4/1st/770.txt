re.findall(pattern, string, flags=0)Â¶
Return all non-overlapping matches of pattern in string, as a list of
strings.  The string is scanned left-to-right, and matches are returned in
the order found.  If one or more groups are present in the pattern, return a
list of groups; this will be a list of tuples if the pattern has more than
one group.  Empty matches are included in the result.

Changed in version 3.7: Non-empty matches can now start just after a previous empty match.
