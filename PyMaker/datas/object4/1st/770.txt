<dd><p>Return all non-overlapping matches of <em>pattern</em> in <em>string</em>, as a list of
strings.  The <em>string</em> is scanned left-to-right, and matches are returned in
the order found.  If one or more groups are present in the pattern, return a
list of groups; this will be a list of tuples if the pattern has more than
one group.  Empty matches are included in the result.</p>

<p><span class="versionmodified">Changed in version 3.7: </span>Non-empty matches can now start just after a previous empty match.</p>
