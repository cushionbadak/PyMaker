window.instr([n])Â¶

window.instr(y, x[, n])
Return a bytes object of characters, extracted from the window starting at the
current cursor position, or at y, x if specified. Attributes are stripped
from the characters.  If n is specified, instr() returns a string
at most n characters long (exclusive of the trailing NUL).
