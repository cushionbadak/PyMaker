SimpleQueue.get(block=True, timeout=None)Â¶
Remove and return an item from the queue.  If optional args block is true and
timeout is None (the default), block if necessary until an item is available.
If timeout is a positive number, it blocks at most timeout seconds and
raises the Empty exception if no item was available within that time.
Otherwise (block is false), return an item if one is immediately available,
else raise the Empty exception (timeout is ignored in that case).
