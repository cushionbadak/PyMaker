3.3.3.1. MetaclassesÂ¶
By default, classes are constructed using type(). The class body is
executed in a new namespace and the class name is bound locally to the
result of type(name, bases, namespace).
The class creation process can be customized by passing the metaclass
keyword argument in the class definition line, or by inheriting from an
existing class that included such an argument. In the following example,
both MyClass and MySubclass are instances of Meta:
class Meta(type):
    pass

class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):
    pass

class MySubclass(MyClass):
    pass


Any other keyword arguments that are specified in the class definition are
passed through to all metaclass operations described below.
When a class definition is executed, the following steps occur:

MRO entries are resolved;
the appropriate metaclass is determined;
the class namespace is prepared;
the class body is executed;
the class object is created.
