assertRaisesRegex(exception, regex, callable, *args, **kwds)Â¶

assertRaisesRegex(exception, regex, *, msg=None)
Like assertRaises() but also tests that regex matches
on the string representation of the raised exception.  regex may be
a regular expression object or a string containing a regular expression
suitable for use by re.search().  Examples:
self.assertRaisesRegex(ValueError, "invalid literal for.*XYZ'$",
                       int, 'XYZ')


or:
with self.assertRaisesRegex(ValueError, 'literal'):
   int('XYZ')



New in version 3.1: Added under the name assertRaisesRegexp.


Changed in version 3.2: Renamed to assertRaisesRegex().


Changed in version 3.3: Added the msg keyword argument when used as a context manager.
