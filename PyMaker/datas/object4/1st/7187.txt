protocol_versionÂ¶
This specifies the HTTP protocol version used in responses.  If set to
'HTTP/1.1', the server will permit HTTP persistent connections;
however, your server must then include an accurate Content-Length
header (using send_header()) in all of its responses to clients.
For backwards compatibility, the setting defaults to 'HTTP/1.0'.
