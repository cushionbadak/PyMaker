str.format(*args, **kwargs)Â¶
Perform a string formatting operation.  The string on which this method is
called can contain literal text or replacement fields delimited by braces
{}.  Each replacement field contains either the numeric index of a
positional argument, or the name of a keyword argument.  Returns a copy of
the string where each replacement field is replaced with the string value of
the corresponding argument.
>>> "The sum of 1 + 2 is {0}".format(1+2)
'The sum of 1 + 2 is 3'


See Format String Syntax for a description of the various formatting options
that can be specified in format strings.

Note
When formatting a number (int, float, complex,
decimal.Decimal and subclasses) with the n type
(ex: '{:n}'.format(1234)), the function temporarily sets the
LC_CTYPE locale to the LC_NUMERIC locale to decode
decimal_point and thousands_sep fields of localeconv() if
they are non-ASCII or longer than 1 byte, and the LC_NUMERIC locale is
different than the LC_CTYPE locale.  This temporary change affects
other threads.


Changed in version 3.7: When formatting a number with the n type, the function sets
temporarily the LC_CTYPE locale to the LC_NUMERIC locale in some
cases.
