getEventType(record)¶
Returns the event type for the record. Override this if you want to
specify your own types. This version does a mapping using the handler’s
typemap attribute, which is set up in __init__() to a dictionary
which contains mappings for DEBUG, INFO,
WARNING, ERROR and CRITICAL. If you are using
your own levels, you will either need to override this method or place a
suitable dictionary in the handler’s typemap attribute.
