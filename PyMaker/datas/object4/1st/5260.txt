SSLContext.set_servername_callback(server_name_callback)¶
This is a legacy API retained for backwards compatibility. When possible,
you should use sni_callback instead. The given server_name_callback
is similar to sni_callback, except that when the server hostname is an
IDN-encoded internationalized domain name, the server_name_callback
receives a decoded U-label ("pythön.org").
If there is an decoding error on the server name, the TLS connection will
terminate with an ALERT_DESCRIPTION_INTERNAL_ERROR fatal TLS
alert message to the client.

New in version 3.4.
