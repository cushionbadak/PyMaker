abstractmethod get_filename(fullname)Â¶
An abstract method that is to return the value of __file__ for
the specified module. If no path is available, ImportError is
raised.
If source code is available, then the method should return the path to
the source file, regardless of whether a bytecode was used to load the
module.

Changed in version 3.4: Raises ImportError instead of NotImplementedError.
