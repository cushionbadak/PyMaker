sysconfig.parse_config_h(fp[, vars])¶
Parse a config.h-style file.
fp is a file-like object pointing to the config.h-like file.
A dictionary containing name/value pairs is returned.  If an optional
dictionary is passed in as the second argument, it is used instead of a new
dictionary, and updated with the values read in the file.
