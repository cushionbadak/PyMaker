doctest.DONT_ACCEPT_TRUE_FOR_1¶
By default, if an expected output block contains just 1, an actual output
block containing just 1 or just True is considered to be a match, and
similarly for 0 versus False.  When DONT_ACCEPT_TRUE_FOR_1 is
specified, neither substitution is allowed.  The default behavior caters to that
Python changed the return type of many functions from integer to boolean;
doctests expecting “little integer” output still work in these cases.  This
option will probably go away, but not for several years.
