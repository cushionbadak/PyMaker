test.support.swap_attr(obj, attr, new_val)¶
Context manager to swap out an attribute with a new object.
Usage:
with swap_attr(obj, "attr", 5):
    ...


This will set obj.attr to 5 for the duration of the with block,
restoring the old value at the end of the block.  If attr doesn’t
exist on obj, it will be created and then deleted at the end of the
block.
The old value (or None if it doesn’t exist) will be assigned to the
target of the “as” clause, if there is one.
