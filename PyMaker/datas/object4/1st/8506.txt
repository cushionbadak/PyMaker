__iter__()¶
Tests grouped by a TestSuite are always accessed by iteration.
Subclasses can lazily provide tests by overriding __iter__(). Note
that this method may be called several times on a single suite (for
example when counting tests or comparing for equality) so the tests
returned by repeated iterations before TestSuite.run() must be the
same for each call iteration. After TestSuite.run(), callers should
not rely on the tests returned by this method unless the caller uses a
subclass that overrides TestSuite._removeTestAtIndex() to preserve
test references.

Changed in version 3.2: In earlier versions the TestSuite accessed tests directly rather
than through iteration, so overriding __iter__() wasn’t sufficient
for providing tests.


Changed in version 3.4: In earlier versions the TestSuite held references to each
TestCase after TestSuite.run(). Subclasses can restore
that behavior by overriding TestSuite._removeTestAtIndex().
