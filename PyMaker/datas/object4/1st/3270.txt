Text I/OÂ¶
Text I/O expects and produces str objects.  This means that whenever
the backing store is natively made of bytes (such as in the case of a file),
encoding and decoding of data is made transparently as well as optional
translation of platform-specific newline characters.
The easiest way to create a text stream is with open(), optionally
specifying an encoding:
f = open("myfile.txt", "r", encoding="utf-8")


In-memory text streams are also available as StringIO objects:
f = io.StringIO("some initial text data")


The text stream API is described in detail in the documentation of
TextIOBase.
