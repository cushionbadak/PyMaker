binascii.b2a_uu(data, *, backtick=False)Â¶
Convert binary data to a line of ASCII characters, the return value is the
converted line, including a newline char. The length of data should be at most
45. If backtick is true, zeros are represented by '`' instead of spaces.

Changed in version 3.7: Added the backtick parameter.
