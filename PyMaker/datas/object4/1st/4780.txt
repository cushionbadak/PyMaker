docs:


loop.call_at(when, callback, *args, context=None)¶
Schedule callback to be called at the given absolute timestamp
when (an int or a float), using the same time reference as
loop.time().
This method’s behavior is the same as call_later().
An instance of asyncio.TimerHandle is returned which can
be used to cancel the callback.

Changed in version 3.7: The context keyword-only parameter was added. See PEP 567
for more details.


Changed in version 3.7.1: In Python 3.7.0 and earlier with the default event loop implementation,
the difference between when and the current time could not exceed
one day.  This has been fixed in Python 3.7.1.
