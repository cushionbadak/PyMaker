os.fsync(fd)¶
Force write of file with filedescriptor fd to disk.  On Unix, this calls the
native fsync() function; on Windows, the MS _commit() function.
If you’re starting with a buffered Python file object f, first do
f.flush(), and then do os.fsync(f.fileno()), to ensure that all internal
buffers associated with f are written to disk.
Availability: Unix, Windows.
