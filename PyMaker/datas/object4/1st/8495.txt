addCleanup(function, *args, **kwargs)Â¶
Add a function to be called after tearDown() to cleanup resources
used during the test. Functions will be called in reverse order to the
order they are added (LIFO).  They
are called with any arguments and keyword arguments passed into
addCleanup() when they are added.
If setUp() fails, meaning that tearDown() is not called,
then any cleanup functions added will still be called.

New in version 3.1.
