In-memory streamsÂ¶
It is also possible to use a str or bytes-like object as a
file for both reading and writing.  For strings StringIO can be used
like a file opened in text mode.  BytesIO can be used like a file
opened in binary mode.  Both provide full read-write capabilities with random
access.
