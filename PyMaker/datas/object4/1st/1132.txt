datetime.utctimetuple()Â¶
If datetime instance d is naive, this is the same as
d.timetuple() except that tm_isdst is forced to 0 regardless of what
d.dst() returns.  DST is never in effect for a UTC time.
If d is aware, d is normalized to UTC time, by subtracting
d.utcoffset(), and a time.struct_time for the
normalized time is returned.  tm_isdst is forced to 0. Note
that an OverflowError may be raised if d.year was
MINYEAR or MAXYEAR and UTC adjustment spills over a year
boundary.
