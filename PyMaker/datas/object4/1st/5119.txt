socket.share(process_id)Â¶
Duplicate a socket and prepare it for sharing with a target process.  The
target process must be provided with process_id.  The resulting bytes object
can then be passed to the target process using some form of interprocess
communication and the socket can be recreated there using fromshare().
Once this method has been called, it is safe to close the socket since
the operating system has already duplicated it for the target process.
Availability: Windows.

New in version 3.3.
