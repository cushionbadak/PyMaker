get_all(name)Â¶
Return a list of all the values for the named header.
The returned list will be sorted in the order they appeared in the original
header list or were added to this instance, and may contain duplicates.  Any
fields deleted and re-inserted are always appended to the header list.  If no
fields exist with the given name, returns an empty list.
