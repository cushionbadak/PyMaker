exception re.error(msg, pattern=None, pos=None)¶
Exception raised when a string passed to one of the functions here is not a
valid regular expression (for example, it might contain unmatched parentheses)
or when some other error occurs during compilation or matching.  It is never an
error if a string contains no match for a pattern.  The error instance has
the following additional attributes:


msg¶
The unformatted error message.



pattern¶
The regular expression pattern.



pos¶
The index in pattern where compilation failed (may be None).



lineno¶
The line corresponding to pos (may be None).



colno¶
The column corresponding to pos (may be None).


Changed in version 3.5: Added additional attributes.
