inspect.getcoroutinestate(coroutine)Â¶
Get current state of a coroutine object.  The function is intended to be
used with coroutine objects created by async def functions, but
will accept any coroutine-like object that has cr_running and
cr_frame attributes.

Possible states are:

CORO_CREATED: Waiting to start execution.
CORO_RUNNING: Currently being executed by the interpreter.
CORO_SUSPENDED: Currently suspended at an await expression.
CORO_CLOSED: Execution has completed.




New in version 3.5.
