Packer.pack_list(list, pack_item)Â¶
Packs a list of homogeneous items.  This method is useful for lists with an
indeterminate size; i.e. the size is not available until the entire list has
been walked.  For each item in the list, an unsigned integer 1 is packed
first, followed by the data value from the list.  pack_item is the function
that is called to pack the individual item.  At the end of the list, an unsigned
integer 0 is packed.
For example, to pack a list of integers, the code might appear like this:
import xdrlib
p = xdrlib.Packer()
p.pack_list([1, 2, 3], p.pack_int)
