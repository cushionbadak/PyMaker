ssl.enum_crls(store_name)¶
Retrieve CRLs from Windows’ system cert store. store_name may be
one of CA, ROOT or MY. Windows may provide additional cert
stores, too.
The function returns a list of (cert_bytes, encoding_type, trust) tuples.
The encoding_type specifies the encoding of cert_bytes. It is either
x509_asn for X.509 ASN.1 data or pkcs_7_asn for
PKCS#7 ASN.1 data.
Availability: Windows.

New in version 3.4.
