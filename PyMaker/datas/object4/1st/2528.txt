lzma.decompress(data, format=FORMAT_AUTO, memlimit=None, filters=None)Â¶
Decompress data (a bytes object), returning the uncompressed data
as a bytes object.
If data is the concatenation of multiple distinct compressed streams,
decompress all of these streams, and return the concatenation of the results.
See LZMADecompressor above for a description of the format,
memlimit and filters arguments.
