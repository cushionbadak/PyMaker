enumerate(iterable, start=0)Â¶
Return an enumerate object. iterable must be a sequence, an
iterator, or some other object which supports iteration.
The __next__() method of the iterator returned by
enumerate() returns a tuple containing a count (from start which
defaults to 0) and the values obtained from iterating over iterable.
>>> seasons = ['Spring', 'Summer', 'Fall', 'Winter']
>>> list(enumerate(seasons))
[(0, 'Spring'), (1, 'Summer'), (2, 'Fall'), (3, 'Winter')]
>>> list(enumerate(seasons, start=1))
[(1, 'Spring'), (2, 'Summer'), (3, 'Fall'), (4, 'Winter')]


Equivalent to:
def enumerate(sequence, start=0):
    n = start
    for elem in sequence:
        yield n, elem
        n += 1
