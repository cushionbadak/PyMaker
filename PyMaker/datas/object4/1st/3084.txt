os.rmdir(path, *, dir_fd=None)Â¶
Remove (delete) the directory path.  Only works when the directory is
empty, otherwise, OSError is raised.  In order to remove whole
directory trees, shutil.rmtree() can be used.
This function can support paths relative to directory descriptors.

New in version 3.3: The dir_fd parameter.


Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a path-like object.
