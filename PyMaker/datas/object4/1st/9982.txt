-d destdirÂ¶
Directory prepended to the path to each file being compiled.  This will
appear in compilation time tracebacks, and is also compiled in to the
byte-code file, where it will be used in tracebacks and other messages in
cases where the source file does not exist at the time the byte-code file is
executed.
