get_content_type()¶
Return the message’s content type.  The returned string is coerced to
lower case of the form maintype/subtype.  If there was no
Content-Type header in the message the default type as given
by get_default_type() will be returned.  Since according to
RFC 2045, messages always have a default type, get_content_type()
will always return a value.
RFC 2045 defines a message’s default type to be text/plain
unless it appears inside a multipart/digest container, in
which case it would be message/rfc822.  If the
Content-Type header has an invalid type specification,
RFC 2045 mandates that the default type be text/plain.
