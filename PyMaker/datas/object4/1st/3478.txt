getopt.gnu_getopt(args, shortopts, longopts=[])Â¶
This function works like getopt(), except that GNU style scanning mode is
used by default. This means that option and non-option arguments may be
intermixed. The getopt() function stops processing options as soon as a
non-option argument is encountered.
If the first character of the option string is '+', or if the environment
variable POSIXLY_CORRECT is set, then option processing stops as
soon as a non-option argument is encountered.
