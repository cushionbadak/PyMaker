dataclasses.replace(instance, **changes)¶
Creates a new object of the same type of instance, replacing
fields with values from changes.  If instance is not a Data
Class, raises TypeError.  If values in changes do not
specify fields, raises TypeError.
The newly returned object is created by calling the __init__()
method of the dataclass.  This ensures that
__post_init__(), if present, is also called.
Init-only variables without default values, if any exist, must be
specified on the call to replace() so that they can be passed to
__init__() and __post_init__().
It is an error for changes to contain any fields that are
defined as having init=False.  A ValueError will be raised
in this case.
Be forewarned about how init=False fields work during a call to
replace().  They are not copied from the source object, but
rather are initialized in __post_init__(), if they’re
initialized at all.  It is expected that init=False fields will
be rarely and judiciously used.  If they are used, it might be wise
to have alternate class constructors, or perhaps a custom
replace() (or similarly named) method which handles instance
copying.
