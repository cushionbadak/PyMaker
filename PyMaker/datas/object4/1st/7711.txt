gettext.bindtextdomain(domain, localedir=None)Â¶
Bind the domain to the locale directory localedir.  More concretely,
gettext will look for binary .mo files for the given domain using
the path (on Unix): localedir/language/LC_MESSAGES/domain.mo, where
languages is searched for in the environment variables LANGUAGE,
LC_ALL, LC_MESSAGES, and LANG respectively.
If localedir is omitted or None, then the current binding for domain is
returned. [1]
