Policy Objects¶
The abstract event loop policy base class is defined as follows:


class asyncio.AbstractEventLoopPolicy¶
An abstract base class for asyncio policies.


get_event_loop()¶
Get the event loop for the current context.
Return an event loop object implementing the
AbstractEventLoop interface.
This method should never return None.

Changed in version 3.6.




set_event_loop(loop)¶
Set the event loop for the current context to loop.



new_event_loop()¶
Create and return a new event loop object.
This method should never return None.



get_child_watcher()¶
Get a child process watcher object.
Return a watcher object implementing the
AbstractChildWatcher interface.
This function is Unix specific.



set_child_watcher(watcher)¶
Set the current child process watcher to watcher.
This function is Unix specific.


asyncio ships with the following built-in policies:


class asyncio.DefaultEventLoopPolicy¶
The default asyncio policy.  Uses SelectorEventLoop
on both Unix and Windows platforms.
There is no need to install the default policy manually. asyncio
is configured to use the default policy automatically.



class asyncio.WindowsProactorEventLoopPolicy¶
An alternative event loop policy that uses the
ProactorEventLoop event loop implementation.
Availability: Windows.
