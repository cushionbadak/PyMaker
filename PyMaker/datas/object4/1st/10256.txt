start_component(component=None, feature=None, flags=None, keyfile=None, uuid=None)¶
Add an entry to the Component table, and make this component the current
component for this directory. If no component name is given, the directory
name is used. If no feature is given, the current feature is used. If no
flags are given, the directory’s default flags are used. If no keyfile
is given, the KeyPath is left null in the Component table.
