traceback.print_tb(tb, limit=None, file=None)¶
Print up to limit stack trace entries from traceback object tb (starting
from the caller’s frame) if limit is positive.  Otherwise, print the last
abs(limit) entries.  If limit is omitted or None, all entries are
printed.  If file is omitted or None, the output goes to
sys.stderr; otherwise it should be an open file or file-like object to
receive the output.

Changed in version 3.5: Added negative limit support.
