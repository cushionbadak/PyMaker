class urllib.request.ProxyHandler(proxies=None)¶
Cause requests to go through a proxy. If proxies is given, it must be a
dictionary mapping protocol names to URLs of proxies. The default is to read
the list of proxies from the environment variables
<protocol>_proxy.  If no proxy environment variables are set, then
in a Windows environment proxy settings are obtained from the registry’s
Internet Settings section, and in a Mac OS X environment proxy information
is retrieved from the OS X System Configuration Framework.
To disable autodetected proxy pass an empty dictionary.
The no_proxy environment variable can be used to specify hosts
which shouldn’t be reached via proxy; if set, it should be a comma-separated
list of hostname suffixes, optionally with :port appended, for example
cern.ch,ncsa.uiuc.edu,some.host:8080.


Note
HTTP_PROXY will be ignored if a variable REQUEST_METHOD is set;
see the documentation on getproxies().
