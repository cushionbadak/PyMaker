sys._xoptionsÂ¶
A dictionary of the various implementation-specific flags passed through
the -X command-line option.  Option names are either mapped to
their values, if given explicitly, or to True.  Example:
$ ./python -Xa=b -Xc
Python 3.2a3+ (py3k, Oct 16 2010, 20:14:50)
[GCC 4.4.3] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import sys
>>> sys._xoptions
{'a': 'b', 'c': True}



CPython implementation detail: This is a CPython-specific way of accessing options passed through
-X.  Other implementations may export them through other
means, or not at all.


New in version 3.2.
