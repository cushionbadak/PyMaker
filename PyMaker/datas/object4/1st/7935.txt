docs:


turtle.register_shape(name, shape=None)¶

turtle.addshape(name, shape=None)¶
There are three different ways to call this function:

name is the name of a gif-file and shape is None: Install the
corresponding image shape.
>>> screen.register_shape("turtle.gif")



Note
Image shapes do not rotate when turning the turtle, so they do not
display the heading of the turtle!


name is an arbitrary string and shape is a tuple of pairs of
coordinates: Install the corresponding polygon shape.
>>> screen.register_shape("triangle", ((5,-3), (0,5), (-5,-3)))



name is an arbitrary string and shape is a (compound) Shape
object: Install the corresponding compound shape.


Add a turtle shape to TurtleScreen’s shapelist.  Only thusly registered
shapes can be used by issuing the command shape(shapename).
