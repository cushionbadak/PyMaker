Basic ExampleÂ¶
The following example shows how the Command-Line Interface
can be used to create an executable archive from a directory containing
Python code.  When run, the archive will execute the main function from
the module myapp in the archive.
$ python -m zipapp myapp -m "myapp:main"
$ python myapp.pyz
<output from myapp>
