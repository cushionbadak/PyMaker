timezone.tzname(dt)¶
Return the fixed value specified when the timezone instance
is constructed.  If name is not provided in the constructor, the
name returned by tzname(dt) is generated from the value of the
offset as follows.  If offset is timedelta(0), the name
is “UTC”, otherwise it is a string ‘UTC±HH:MM’, where ± is the sign
of offset, HH and MM are two digits of offset.hours and
offset.minutes respectively.

Changed in version 3.6: Name generated from offset=timedelta(0) is now plain ‘UTC’, not
‘UTC+00:00’.
