os.path.getmtime(path)Â¶
Return the time of last modification of path.  The return value is a floating point number
giving the number of seconds since the epoch (see the  time module).
Raise OSError if the file does not exist or is inaccessible.

Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a path-like object.
