os.lseek(fd, pos, how)Â¶
Set the current position of file descriptor fd to position pos, modified
by how: SEEK_SET or 0 to set the position relative to the
beginning of the file; SEEK_CUR or 1 to set it relative to the
current position; SEEK_END or 2 to set it relative to the end of
the file. Return the new cursor position in bytes, starting from the beginning.
