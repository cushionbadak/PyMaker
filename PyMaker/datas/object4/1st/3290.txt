seek(offset[, whence])¶
Change the stream position to the given byte offset.  offset is
interpreted relative to the position indicated by whence.  The default
value for whence is SEEK_SET.  Values for whence are:

SEEK_SET or 0 – start of the stream (the default);
offset should be zero or positive
SEEK_CUR or 1 – current stream position; offset may
be negative
SEEK_END or 2 – end of the stream; offset is usually
negative

Return the new absolute position.

New in version 3.1: The SEEK_* constants.


New in version 3.3: Some operating systems could support additional values, like
os.SEEK_HOLE or os.SEEK_DATA. The valid values
for a file could depend on it being open in text or binary mode.
