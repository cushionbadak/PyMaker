How do I avoid blocking in the connect() method of a socket?¶
The select module is commonly used to help with asynchronous I/O on
sockets.
To prevent the TCP connect from blocking, you can set the socket to non-blocking
mode.  Then when you do the connect(), you will either connect immediately
(unlikely) or get an exception that contains the error number as .errno.
errno.EINPROGRESS indicates that the connection is in progress, but hasn’t
finished yet.  Different OSes will return different values, so you’re going to
have to check what’s returned on your system.
You can use the connect_ex() method to avoid creating an exception.  It will
just return the errno value.  To poll, you can call connect_ex() again later
– 0 or errno.EISCONN indicate that you’re connected – or you can pass this
socket to select to check if it’s writable.

Note
The asyncore module presents a framework-like approach to the problem
of writing non-blocking networking code.
The third-party Twisted library is
a popular and feature-rich alternative.
