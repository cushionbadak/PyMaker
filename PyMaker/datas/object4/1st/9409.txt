docs:


format(*, chain=True)Â¶
Format the exception.
If chain is not True, __cause__ and __context__ will not
be formatted.
The return value is a generator of strings, each ending in a newline and
some containing internal newlines. print_exception()
is a wrapper around this method which just prints the lines to a file.
The message indicating which exception occurred is always the last
string in the output.
