iteritems()¶

items()¶
Return an iterator over (key, message) pairs, where key is a key and
message is a message representation, if called as iteritems() or
return a list of such pairs if called as items(). The messages are
represented as instances of the appropriate format-specific
Message subclass unless a custom message factory was specified
when the Mailbox instance was initialized.
