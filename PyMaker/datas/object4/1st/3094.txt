stat(*, follow_symlinks=True)Â¶
Return a stat_result object for this entry. This method
follows symbolic links by default; to stat a symbolic link add the
follow_symlinks=False argument.
On Unix, this method always requires a system call. On Windows, it
only requires a system call if follow_symlinks is True and the
entry is a symbolic link.
On Windows, the st_ino, st_dev and st_nlink attributes of the
stat_result are always set to zero. Call os.stat() to
get these attributes.
The result is cached on the os.DirEntry object, with a separate cache
for follow_symlinks True and False. Call os.stat() to
fetch up-to-date information.
