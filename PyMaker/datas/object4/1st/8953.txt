h(elp) [command]Â¶
Without argument, print the list of available commands.  With a command as
argument, print help about that command.  help pdb displays the full
documentation (the docstring of the pdb module).  Since the command
argument must be an identifier, help exec must be entered to get help on
the ! command.
