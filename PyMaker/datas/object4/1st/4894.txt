ReadTransport.pause_reading()¶
Pause the receiving end of the transport.  No data will be passed to
the protocol’s protocol.data_received()
method until resume_reading() is called.

Changed in version 3.7: The method is idempotent, i.e. it can be called when the
transport is already paused or closed.
