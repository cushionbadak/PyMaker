3.3.3.2. Resolving MRO entriesÂ¶
If a base that appears in class definition is not an instance of type,
then an __mro_entries__ method is searched on it. If found, it is called
with the original bases tuple. This method must return a tuple of classes that
will be used instead of this base. The tuple may be empty, in such case
the original base is ignored.
