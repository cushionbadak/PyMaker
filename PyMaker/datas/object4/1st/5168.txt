ssl.VERIFY_CRL_CHECK_LEAF¶
Possible value for SSLContext.verify_flags. In this mode, only the
peer cert is check but non of the intermediate CA certificates. The mode
requires a valid CRL that is signed by the peer cert’s issuer (its direct
ancestor CA). If no proper has been loaded
SSLContext.load_verify_locations, validation will fail.

New in version 3.4.
