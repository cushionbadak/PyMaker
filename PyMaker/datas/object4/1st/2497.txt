docs:


peek([n])Â¶
Return buffered data without advancing the file position. At least one
byte of data will be returned (unless at EOF). The exact number of bytes
returned is unspecified.

Note
While calling peek() does not change the file position of
the BZ2File, it may change the position of the underlying file
object (e.g. if the BZ2File was constructed by passing a file
object for filename).


New in version 3.3.
