dbm.dumb.open(filename[, flag[, mode]])¶
Open a dumbdbm database and return a dumbdbm object.  The filename argument is
the basename of the database file (without any specific extensions).  When a
dumbdbm database is created, files with .dat and .dir extensions
are created.
The optional flag argument supports only the semantics of 'c'
and 'n' values.  Other values will default to database being always
opened for update, and will be created if it does not exist.
The optional mode argument is the Unix mode of the file, used only when the
database has to be created.  It defaults to octal 0o666 (and will be modified
by the prevailing umask).

Warning
It is possible to crash the Python interpreter when loading a database
with a sufficiently large/complex entry due to stack depth limitations in
Python’s AST compiler.


Changed in version 3.5: open() always creates a new database when the flag has the value
'n'.


Deprecated since version 3.6, will be removed in version 3.8: Creating database in 'r' and 'w' modes.  Modifying database in
'r' mode.

In addition to the methods provided by the
collections.abc.MutableMapping class, dumbdbm objects
provide the following methods:


dumbdbm.sync()¶
Synchronize the on-disk directory and data files.  This method is called
by the Shelve.sync() method.



dumbdbm.close()¶
Close the dumbdbm database.
