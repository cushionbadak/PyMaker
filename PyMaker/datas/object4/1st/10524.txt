Understanding option actions¶
Actions tell optparse what to do when it encounters an option on the
command line.  There is a fixed set of actions hard-coded into optparse;
adding new actions is an advanced topic covered in section
Extending optparse.  Most actions tell optparse to store
a value in some variable—for example, take a string from the command line and
store it in an attribute of options.
If you don’t specify an option action, optparse defaults to store.
