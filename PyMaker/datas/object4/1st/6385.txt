IncrementalParser Objects¶
Instances of IncrementalParser offer the following additional methods:


IncrementalParser.feed(data)¶
Process a chunk of data.



IncrementalParser.close()¶
Assume the end of the document. That will check well-formedness conditions that
can be checked only at the end, invoke handlers, and may clean up resources
allocated during parsing.



IncrementalParser.reset()¶
This method is called after close has been called to reset the parser so that it
is ready to parse new documents. The results of calling parse or feed after
close without calling reset are undefined.
