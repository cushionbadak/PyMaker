Handling boolean (flag) options¶
Flag options—set a variable to true or false when a particular option is
seen—are quite common.  optparse supports them with two separate actions,
store_true and store_false.  For example, you might have a verbose
flag that is turned on with -v and off with -q:
parser.add_option("-v", action="store_true", dest="verbose")
parser.add_option("-q", action="store_false", dest="verbose")


Here we have two different options with the same destination, which is perfectly
OK.  (It just means you have to be a bit careful when setting default
values—see below.)
When optparse encounters -v on the command line, it sets
options.verbose to True; when it encounters -q,
options.verbose is set to False.
