object.__getnewargs_ex__()Â¶
In protocols 2 and newer, classes that implements the
__getnewargs_ex__() method can dictate the values passed to the
__new__() method upon unpickling.  The method must return a pair
(args, kwargs) where args is a tuple of positional arguments
and kwargs a dictionary of named arguments for constructing the
object.  Those will be passed to the __new__() method upon
unpickling.
You should implement this method if the __new__() method of your
class requires keyword-only arguments.  Otherwise, it is recommended for
compatibility to implement __getnewargs__().

Changed in version 3.6: __getnewargs_ex__() is now used in protocols 2 and 3.
