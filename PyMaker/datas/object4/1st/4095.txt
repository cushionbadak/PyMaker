ctypes.util.find_library(name)Â¶
Try to find a library and return a pathname.  name is the library name
without any prefix like lib, suffix like .so, .dylib or version
number (this is the form used for the posix linker option -l).  If
no library can be found, returns None.
The exact functionality is system dependent.
