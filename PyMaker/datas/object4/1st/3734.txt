curses.resize_term(nlines, ncols)Â¶
Backend function used by resizeterm(), performing most of the work;
when resizing the windows, resize_term() blank-fills the areas that are
extended.  The calling application should fill in these areas with
appropriate data.  The resize_term() function attempts to resize all
windows.  However, due to the calling convention of pads, it is not possible
to resize these without additional interaction with the application.
