Examples¶

Simple hashing¶
To calculate hash of some data, you should first construct a hash object by
calling the appropriate constructor function (blake2b() or
blake2s()), then update it with the data by calling update() on the
object, and, finally, get the digest out of the object by calling
digest() (or hexdigest() for hex-encoded string).
>>> from hashlib import blake2b
>>> h = blake2b()
>>> h.update(b'Hello world')
>>> h.hexdigest()
'6ff843ba685842aa82031d3f53c48b66326df7639a63d128974c5c14f31a0f33343a8c65551134ed1ae0f2b0dd2bb495dc81039e3eeb0aa1bb0388bbeac29183'


As a shortcut, you can pass the first chunk of data to update directly to the
constructor as the positional argument:
>>> from hashlib import blake2b
>>> blake2b(b'Hello world').hexdigest()
'6ff843ba685842aa82031d3f53c48b66326df7639a63d128974c5c14f31a0f33343a8c65551134ed1ae0f2b0dd2bb495dc81039e3eeb0aa1bb0388bbeac29183'


You can call hash.update() as many times as you need to iteratively
update the hash:
>>> from hashlib import blake2b
>>> items = [b'Hello', b' ', b'world']
>>> h = blake2b()
>>> for item in items:
...     h.update(item)
>>> h.hexdigest()
'6ff843ba685842aa82031d3f53c48b66326df7639a63d128974c5c14f31a0f33343a8c65551134ed1ae0f2b0dd2bb495dc81039e3eeb0aa1bb0388bbeac29183'




Using different digest sizes¶
BLAKE2 has configurable size of digests up to 64 bytes for BLAKE2b and up to 32
bytes for BLAKE2s. For example, to replace SHA-1 with BLAKE2b without changing
the size of output, we can tell BLAKE2b to produce 20-byte digests:
>>> from hashlib import blake2b
>>> h = blake2b(digest_size=20)
>>> h.update(b'Replacing SHA1 with the more secure function')
>>> h.hexdigest()
'd24f26cf8de66472d58d4e1b1774b4c9158b1f4c'
>>> h.digest_size
20
>>> len(h.digest())
20


Hash objects with different digest sizes have completely different outputs
(shorter hashes are not prefixes of longer hashes); BLAKE2b and BLAKE2s
produce different outputs even if the output length is the same:
>>> from hashlib import blake2b, blake2s
>>> blake2b(digest_size=10).hexdigest()
'6fa1d8fcfd719046d762'
>>> blake2b(digest_size=11).hexdigest()
'eb6ec15daf9546254f0809'
>>> blake2s(digest_size=10).hexdigest()
'1bf21a98c78a1c376ae9'
>>> blake2s(digest_size=11).hexdigest()
'567004bf96e4a25773ebf4'




Keyed hashing¶
Keyed hashing can be used for authentication as a faster and simpler
replacement for Hash-based message authentication code (HMAC).
BLAKE2 can be securely used in prefix-MAC mode thanks to the
indifferentiability property inherited from BLAKE.
This example shows how to get a (hex-encoded) 128-bit authentication code for
message b'message data' with key b'pseudorandom key':
>>> from hashlib import blake2b
>>> h = blake2b(key=b'pseudorandom key', digest_size=16)
>>> h.update(b'message data')
>>> h.hexdigest()
'3d363ff7401e02026f4a4687d4863ced'


As a practical example, a web application can symmetrically sign cookies sent
to users and later verify them to make sure they weren’t tampered with:
>>> from hashlib import blake2b
>>> from hmac import compare_digest
>>>
>>> SECRET_KEY = b'pseudorandomly generated server secret key'
>>> AUTH_SIZE = 16
>>>
>>> def sign(cookie):
...     h = blake2b(digest_size=AUTH_SIZE, key=SECRET_KEY)
...     h.update(cookie)
...     return h.hexdigest().encode('utf-8')
>>>
>>> def verify(cookie, sig):
...     good_sig = sign(cookie)
...     return compare_digest(good_sig, sig)
>>>
>>> cookie = b'user-alice'
>>> sig = sign(cookie)
>>> print("{0},{1}".format(cookie.decode('utf-8'), sig))
user-alice,b'43b3c982cf697e0c5ab22172d1ca7421'
>>> verify(cookie, sig)
True
>>> verify(b'user-bob', sig)
False
>>> verify(cookie, b'0102030405060708090a0b0c0d0e0f00')
False


Even though there’s a native keyed hashing mode, BLAKE2 can, of course, be used
in HMAC construction with hmac module:
>>> import hmac, hashlib
>>> m = hmac.new(b'secret key', digestmod=hashlib.blake2s)
>>> m.update(b'message')
>>> m.hexdigest()
'e3c8102868d28b5ff85fc35dda07329970d1a01e273c37481326fe0c861c8142'




Randomized hashing¶
By setting salt parameter users can introduce randomization to the hash
function. Randomized hashing is useful for protecting against collision attacks
on the hash function used in digital signatures.

Randomized hashing is designed for situations where one party, the message
preparer, generates all or part of a message to be signed by a second
party, the message signer. If the message preparer is able to find
cryptographic hash function collisions (i.e., two messages producing the
same hash value), then they might prepare meaningful versions of the message
that would produce the same hash value and digital signature, but with
different results (e.g., transferring $1,000,000 to an account, rather than
$10). Cryptographic hash functions have been designed with collision
resistance as a major goal, but the current concentration on attacking
cryptographic hash functions may result in a given cryptographic hash
function providing less collision resistance than expected. Randomized
hashing offers the signer additional protection by reducing the likelihood
that a preparer can generate two or more messages that ultimately yield the
same hash value during the digital signature generation process — even if
it is practical to find collisions for the hash function. However, the use
of randomized hashing may reduce the amount of security provided by a
digital signature when all portions of the message are prepared
by the signer.
(NIST SP-800-106 “Randomized Hashing for Digital Signatures”)

In BLAKE2 the salt is processed as a one-time input to the hash function during
initialization, rather than as an input to each compression function.

Warning
Salted hashing (or just hashing) with BLAKE2 or any other general-purpose
cryptographic hash function, such as SHA-256, is not suitable for hashing
passwords.  See BLAKE2 FAQ for more
information.

>>> import os
>>> from hashlib import blake2b
>>> msg = b'some message'
>>> # Calculate the first hash with a random salt.
>>> salt1 = os.urandom(blake2b.SALT_SIZE)
>>> h1 = blake2b(salt=salt1)
>>> h1.update(msg)
>>> # Calculate the second hash with a different random salt.
>>> salt2 = os.urandom(blake2b.SALT_SIZE)
>>> h2 = blake2b(salt=salt2)
>>> h2.update(msg)
>>> # The digests are different.
>>> h1.digest() != h2.digest()
True




Personalization¶
Sometimes it is useful to force hash function to produce different digests for
the same input for different purposes. Quoting the authors of the Skein hash
function:

We recommend that all application designers seriously consider doing this;
we have seen many protocols where a hash that is computed in one part of
the protocol can be used in an entirely different part because two hash
computations were done on similar or related data, and the attacker can
force the application to make the hash inputs the same. Personalizing each
hash function used in the protocol summarily stops this type of attack.
(The Skein Hash Function Family,
p. 21)

BLAKE2 can be personalized by passing bytes to the person argument:
>>> from hashlib import blake2b
>>> FILES_HASH_PERSON = b'MyApp Files Hash'
>>> BLOCK_HASH_PERSON = b'MyApp Block Hash'
>>> h = blake2b(digest_size=32, person=FILES_HASH_PERSON)
>>> h.update(b'the same content')
>>> h.hexdigest()
'20d9cd024d4fb086aae819a1432dd2466de12947831b75c5a30cf2676095d3b4'
>>> h = blake2b(digest_size=32, person=BLOCK_HASH_PERSON)
>>> h.update(b'the same content')
>>> h.hexdigest()
'cf68fb5761b9c44e7878bfb2c4c9aea52264a80b75005e65619778de59f383a3'


Personalization together with the keyed mode can also be used to derive different
keys from a single one.
>>> from hashlib import blake2s
>>> from base64 import b64decode, b64encode
>>> orig_key = b64decode(b'Rm5EPJai72qcK3RGBpW3vPNfZy5OZothY+kHY6h21KM=')
>>> enc_key = blake2s(key=orig_key, person=b'kEncrypt').digest()
>>> mac_key = blake2s(key=orig_key, person=b'kMAC').digest()
>>> print(b64encode(enc_key).decode('utf-8'))
rbPb15S/Z9t+agffno5wuhB77VbRi6F9Iv2qIxU7WHw=
>>> print(b64encode(mac_key).decode('utf-8'))

Tree mode¶
Here’s an example of hashing a minimal tree with two leaf nodes:
  10
 /  \
00  01


This example uses 64-byte internal digests, and returns the 32-byte final
digest:
>>> from hashlib import blake2b
>>>
>>> FANOUT = 2
>>> DEPTH = 2
>>> LEAF_SIZE = 4096
>>> INNER_SIZE = 64
>>>
>>> buf = bytearray(6000)
>>>
>>> # Left leaf
... h00 = blake2b(buf[0:LEAF_SIZE], fanout=FANOUT, depth=DEPTH,
...               leaf_size=LEAF_SIZE, inner_size=INNER_SIZE,
...               node_offset=0, node_depth=0, last_node=False)
>>> # Right leaf
... h01 = blake2b(buf[LEAF_SIZE:], fanout=FANOUT, depth=DEPTH,
...               leaf_size=LEAF_SIZE, inner_size=INNER_SIZE,
...               node_offset=1, node_depth=0, last_node=True)
>>> # Root node
... h10 = blake2b(digest_size=32, fanout=FANOUT, depth=DEPTH,
...               leaf_size=LEAF_SIZE, inner_size=INNER_SIZE,
...               node_offset=0, node_depth=1, last_node=True)
>>> h10.update(h00.digest())
>>> h10.update(h01.digest())
>>> h10.hexdigest()
