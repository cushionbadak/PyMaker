<dd><p>Acquire the interpreter’s global import lock for the current thread.
This lock should be used by import hooks to ensure thread-safety when
importing modules.</p>
<p>Once a thread has acquired the import lock, the same thread may acquire it
again without blocking; the thread must release it once for each time it has
acquired it.</p>
<p>On platforms without threads, this function does nothing.</p>
<div class="versionchanged">
<p><span class="versionmodified">Changed in version 3.3: </span>The locking scheme has changed to per-module locks for
the most part.  A global import lock is kept for some critical tasks,
such as initializing the per-module locks.</p>
