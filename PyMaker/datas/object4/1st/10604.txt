imp.acquire_lock()¶
Acquire the interpreter’s global import lock for the current thread.
This lock should be used by import hooks to ensure thread-safety when
importing modules.
Once a thread has acquired the import lock, the same thread may acquire it
again without blocking; the thread must release it once for each time it has
acquired it.
On platforms without threads, this function does nothing.

Changed in version 3.3: The locking scheme has changed to per-module locks for
the most part.  A global import lock is kept for some critical tasks,
such as initializing the per-module locks.


Deprecated since version 3.4.
