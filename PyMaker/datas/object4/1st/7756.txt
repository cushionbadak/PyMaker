locale.setlocale(category, locale=None)¶
If locale is given and not None, setlocale() modifies the locale
setting for the category. The available categories are listed in the data
description below. locale may be a string, or an iterable of two strings
(language code and encoding). If it’s an iterable, it’s converted to a locale
name using the locale aliasing engine. An empty string specifies the user’s
default settings. If the modification of the locale fails, the exception
Error is raised. If successful, the new locale setting is returned.
If locale is omitted or None, the current setting for category is
returned.
setlocale() is not thread-safe on most systems. Applications typically
start with a call of
import locale
locale.setlocale(locale.LC_ALL, '')


This sets the locale for all categories to the user’s default setting (typically
specified in the LANG environment variable).  If the locale is not
changed thereafter, using multithreading should not cause problems.
