tixCommand.tix_getbitmap(name)Â¶
Locates a bitmap file of the name name.xpm or name in one of the bitmap
directories (see the tix_addbitmapdir() method).  By using
tix_getbitmap(), you can avoid hard coding the pathnames of the bitmap
files in your application. When successful, it returns the complete pathname of
the bitmap file, prefixed with the character @.  The returned value can be
used to configure the bitmap option of the Tk and Tix widgets.
