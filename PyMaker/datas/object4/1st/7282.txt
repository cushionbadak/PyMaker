DefaultCookiePolicy.strict_rfc2965_unverifiableÂ¶
Follow RFC 2965 rules on unverifiable transactions (usually, an unverifiable
transaction is one resulting from a redirect or a request for an image hosted on
another site).  If this is false, cookies are never blocked on the basis of
verifiability
