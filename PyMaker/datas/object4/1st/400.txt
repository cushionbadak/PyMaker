Immutable Sequence TypesÂ¶
The only operation that immutable sequence types generally implement that is
not also implemented by mutable sequence types is support for the hash()
built-in.
This support allows immutable sequences, such as tuple instances, to
be used as dict keys and stored in set and frozenset
instances.
Attempting to hash an immutable sequence that contains unhashable values will
result in TypeError.
