cmath.acosh(x)¶
Return the inverse hyperbolic cosine of x. There is one branch cut,
extending left from 1 along the real axis to -∞, continuous from above.



cmath.asinh(x)¶
Return the inverse hyperbolic sine of x. There are two branch cuts:
One extends from 1j along the imaginary axis to ∞j,
continuous from the right.  The other extends from -1j along
the imaginary axis to -∞j, continuous from the left.



cmath.atanh(x)¶
Return the inverse hyperbolic tangent of x. There are two branch cuts: One
extends from 1 along the real axis to ∞, continuous from below. The
other extends from -1 along the real axis to -∞, continuous from
above.



cmath.cosh(x)¶
Return the hyperbolic cosine of x.



cmath.sinh(x)¶
Return the hyperbolic sine of x.



cmath.tanh(x)¶
Return the hyperbolic tangent of x.
