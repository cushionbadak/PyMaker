sys.getsizeof(object[, default])¶
Return the size of an object in bytes. The object can be any type of
object. All built-in objects will return correct results, but this
does not have to hold true for third-party extensions as it is implementation
specific.
Only the memory consumption directly attributed to the object is
accounted for, not the memory consumption of objects it refers to.
If given, default will be returned if the object does not provide means to
retrieve the size.  Otherwise a TypeError will be raised.
getsizeof() calls the object’s __sizeof__ method and adds an
additional garbage collector overhead if the object is managed by the garbage
collector.
See recursive sizeof recipe
for an example of using getsizeof() recursively to find the size of
containers and all their contents.
