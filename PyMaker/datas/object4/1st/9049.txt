Modifiers¶


-f, --file=<file>¶
Name of a file to accumulate counts over several tracing runs.  Should be
used with the --count option.



-C, --coverdir=<dir>¶
Directory where the report files go.  The coverage report for
package.module is written to file dir/package/module.cover.



-m, --missing¶
When generating annotated listings, mark lines which were not executed with
>>>>>>.



-s, --summary¶
When using --count or --report, write a brief
summary to stdout for each file processed.



-R, --no-report¶
Do not generate annotated listings.  This is useful if you intend to make
several runs with --count, and then produce a single set of
annotated listings at the end.



-g, --timing¶
Prefix each line with the time since the program started.  Only used while
tracing.
