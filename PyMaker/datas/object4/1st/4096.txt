ctypes.util.find_msvcrt()Â¶
Windows only: return the filename of the VC runtime library used by Python,
and by the extension modules.  If the name of the library cannot be
determined, None is returned.
If you need to free memory, for example, allocated by an extension module
with a call to the free(void *), it is important that you use the
function in the same library that allocated the memory.
