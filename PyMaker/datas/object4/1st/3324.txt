class io.BufferedWriter(raw, buffer_size=DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE)¶
A buffer providing higher-level access to a writeable, sequential
RawIOBase object.  It inherits BufferedIOBase.
When writing to this object, data is normally placed into an internal
buffer.  The buffer will be written out to the underlying RawIOBase
object under various conditions, including:

when the buffer gets too small for all pending data;
when flush() is called;
when a seek() is requested (for BufferedRandom objects);
when the BufferedWriter object is closed or destroyed.

The constructor creates a BufferedWriter for the given writeable
raw stream.  If the buffer_size is not given, it defaults to
DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE.
BufferedWriter provides or overrides these methods in addition to
those from BufferedIOBase and IOBase:


flush()¶
Force bytes held in the buffer into the raw stream.  A
BlockingIOError should be raised if the raw stream blocks.



write(b)¶
Write the bytes-like object, b, and return the
number of bytes written.  When in non-blocking mode, a
BlockingIOError is raised if the buffer needs to be written out but
the raw stream blocks.
