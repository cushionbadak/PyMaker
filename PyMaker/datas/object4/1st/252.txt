6.12. Conditional expressions¶

conditional_expression ::=  or_test ["if" or_test "else" expression]
expression             ::=  conditional_expression | lambda_expr
expression_nocond      ::=  or_test | lambda_expr_nocond

Conditional expressions (sometimes called a “ternary operator”) have the lowest
priority of all Python operations.
The expression x if C else y first evaluates the condition, C rather than x.
If C is true, x is evaluated and its value is returned; otherwise, y is
evaluated and its value is returned.
See PEP 308 for more details about conditional expressions.
