Changes since Python 2.6Â¶

The methods Turtle.tracer(), Turtle.window_width() and
Turtle.window_height() have been eliminated.
Methods with these names and functionality are now available only
as methods of Screen. The functions derived from these remain
available. (In fact already in Python 2.6 these methods were merely
duplications of the corresponding
TurtleScreen/Screen-methods.)
The method Turtle.fill() has been eliminated.
The behaviour of begin_fill() and end_fill()
have changed slightly: now  every filling-process must be completed with an
end_fill() call.
A method Turtle.filling() has been added. It returns a boolean
value: True if a filling process is under way, False otherwise.
This behaviour corresponds to a fill() call without arguments in
Python 2.6.
