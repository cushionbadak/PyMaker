ssl.RAND_pseudo_bytes(num)Â¶
Return (bytes, is_cryptographic): bytes are num pseudo-random bytes,
is_cryptographic is True if the bytes generated are cryptographically
strong. Raises an SSLError if the operation is not supported by the
current RAND method.
Generated pseudo-random byte sequences will be unique if they are of
sufficient length, but are not necessarily unpredictable. They can be used
for non-cryptographic purposes and for certain purposes in cryptographic
protocols, but usually not for key generation etc.
For almost all applications os.urandom() is preferable.

New in version 3.3.


Deprecated since version 3.6: OpenSSL has deprecated ssl.RAND_pseudo_bytes(), use
ssl.RAND_bytes() instead.
