class tracemalloc.Filter(inclusive: bool, filename_pattern: str, lineno: int=None, all_frames: bool=False, domain: int=None)¶
Filter on traces of memory blocks.
See the fnmatch.fnmatch() function for the syntax of
filename_pattern. The '.pyc' file extension is
replaced with '.py'.
Examples:

Filter(True, subprocess.__file__) only includes traces of the
subprocess module
Filter(False, tracemalloc.__file__) excludes traces of the
tracemalloc module
Filter(False, "<unknown>") excludes empty tracebacks


Changed in version 3.5: The '.pyo' file extension is no longer replaced with '.py'.


Changed in version 3.6: Added the domain attribute.



domain¶
Address space of a memory block (int or None).
tracemalloc uses the domain 0 to trace memory allocations made by
Python. C extensions can use other domains to trace other resources.



inclusive¶
If inclusive is True (include), only match memory blocks allocated
in a file with a name matching filename_pattern at line number
lineno.
If inclusive is False (exclude), ignore memory blocks allocated in
a file with a name matching filename_pattern at line number
lineno.



lineno¶
Line number (int) of the filter. If lineno is None, the filter
matches any line number.



filename_pattern¶
Filename pattern of the filter (str). Read-only property.



all_frames¶
If all_frames is True, all frames of the traceback are checked. If
all_frames is False, only the most recent frame is checked.
This attribute has no effect if the traceback limit is 1.  See the
get_traceback_limit() function and Snapshot.traceback_limit
attribute.
