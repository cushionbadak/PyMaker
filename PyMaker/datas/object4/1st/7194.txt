send_response(code, message=None)Â¶
Adds a response header to the headers buffer and logs the accepted
request. The HTTP response line is written to the internal buffer,
followed by Server and Date headers. The values for these two headers
are picked up from the version_string() and
date_time_string() methods, respectively. If the server does not
intend to send any other headers using the send_header() method,
then send_response() should be followed by an end_headers()
call.

Changed in version 3.3: Headers are stored to an internal buffer and end_headers()
needs to be called explicitly.
