bytes.replace(old, new[, count])¶

bytearray.replace(old, new[, count])¶
Return a copy of the sequence with all occurrences of subsequence old
replaced by new.  If the optional argument count is given, only the
first count occurrences are replaced.
The subsequence to search for and its replacement may be any
bytes-like object.

Note
The bytearray version of this method does not operate in place - it
always produces a new object, even if no changes were made.
