Counter objects¶
A counter tool is provided to support convenient and rapid tallies.
For example:
>>> # Tally occurrences of words in a list
>>> cnt = Counter()
>>> for word in ['red', 'blue', 'red', 'green', 'blue', 'blue']:
...     cnt[word] += 1
>>> cnt
Counter({'blue': 3, 'red': 2, 'green': 1})

>>> # Find the ten most common words in Hamlet
>>> import re
>>> words = re.findall(r'\w+', open('hamlet.txt').read().lower())
>>> Counter(words).most_common(10)
[('the', 1143), ('and', 966), ('to', 762), ('of', 669), ('i', 631),
 ('you', 554),  ('a', 546), ('my', 514), ('hamlet', 471), ('in', 451)]




class collections.Counter([iterable-or-mapping])¶
A Counter is a dict subclass for counting hashable objects.
It is a collection where elements are stored as dictionary keys
and their counts are stored as dictionary values.  Counts are allowed to be
any integer value including zero or negative counts.  The Counter
class is similar to bags or multisets in other languages.
Elements are counted from an iterable or initialized from another
mapping (or counter):
>>> c = Counter()                           # a new, empty counter
>>> c = Counter('gallahad')                 # a new counter from an iterable
>>> c = Counter({'red': 4, 'blue': 2})      # a new counter from a mapping
>>> c = Counter(cats=4, dogs=8)             # a new counter from keyword args


Counter objects have a dictionary interface except that they return a zero
count for missing items instead of raising a KeyError:
>>> c = Counter(['eggs', 'ham'])
>>> c['bacon']                              # count of a missing element is zero
0


Setting a count to zero does not remove an element from a counter.
Use del to remove it entirely:
>>> c['sausage'] = 0                        # counter entry with a zero count
>>> del c['sausage']                        # del actually removes the entry



New in version 3.1.

Counter objects support three methods beyond those available for all
dictionaries:


elements()¶
Return an iterator over elements repeating each as many times as its
count.  Elements are returned in arbitrary order.  If an element’s count
is less than one, elements() will ignore it.
>>> c = Counter(a=4, b=2, c=0, d=-2)
>>> sorted(c.elements())
['a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'b', 'b']





most_common([n])¶
Return a list of the n most common elements and their counts from the
most common to the least.  If n is omitted or None,
most_common() returns all elements in the counter.
Elements with equal counts are ordered arbitrarily:
>>> Counter('abracadabra').most_common(3)  # doctest: +SKIP
[('a', 5), ('r', 2), ('b', 2)]





subtract([iterable-or-mapping])¶
Elements are subtracted from an iterable or from another mapping
(or counter).  Like dict.update() but subtracts counts instead
of replacing them.  Both inputs and outputs may be zero or negative.
>>> c = Counter(a=4, b=2, c=0, d=-2)
>>> d = Counter(a=1, b=2, c=3, d=4)
>>> c.subtract(d)
>>> c
Counter({'a': 3, 'b': 0, 'c': -3, 'd': -6})



New in version 3.2.


The usual dictionary methods are available for Counter objects
except for two which work differently for counters.


fromkeys(iterable)¶
This class method is not implemented for Counter objects.



update([iterable-or-mapping])¶
Elements are counted from an iterable or added-in from another
mapping (or counter).  Like dict.update() but adds counts
instead of replacing them.  Also, the iterable is expected to be a
sequence of elements, not a sequence of (key, value) pairs.


Common patterns for working with Counter objects:
sum(c.values())                 # total of all counts
c.clear()                       # reset all counts
list(c)                         # list unique elements
set(c)                          # convert to a set
dict(c)                         # convert to a regular dictionary
c.items()                       # convert to a list of (elem, cnt) pairs
Counter(dict(list_of_pairs))    # convert from a list of (elem, cnt) pairs
c.most_common()[:-n-1:-1]       # n least common elements
+c                              # remove zero and negative counts


Several mathematical operations are provided for combining Counter
objects to produce multisets (counters that have counts greater than zero).
Addition and subtraction combine counters by adding or subtracting the counts
of corresponding elements.  Intersection and union return the minimum and
maximum of corresponding counts.  Each operation can accept inputs with signed
counts, but the output will exclude results with counts of zero or less.
>>> c = Counter(a=3, b=1)
>>> d = Counter(a=1, b=2)
>>> c + d                       # add two counters together:  c[x] + d[x]
Counter({'a': 4, 'b': 3})
>>> c - d                       # subtract (keeping only positive counts)
Counter({'a': 2})
>>> c & d                       # intersection:  min(c[x], d[x]) # doctest: +SKIP
Counter({'a': 1, 'b': 1})
>>> c | d                       # union:  max(c[x], d[x])
Counter({'a': 3, 'b': 2})


Unary addition and subtraction are shortcuts for adding an empty counter
or subtracting from an empty counter.
>>> c = Counter(a=2, b=-4)
>>> +c
Counter({'a': 2})
>>> -c
Counter({'b': 4})



New in version 3.3: Added support for unary plus, unary minus, and in-place multiset operations.


Note
Counters were primarily designed to work with positive integers to represent
running counts; however, care was taken to not unnecessarily preclude use
cases needing other types or negative values.  To help with those use cases,
this section documents the minimum range and type restrictions.

The Counter class itself is a dictionary subclass with no
restrictions on its keys and values.  The values are intended to be numbers
representing counts, but you could store anything in the value field.
The most_common() method requires only that the values be orderable.
For in-place operations such as c[key] += 1, the value type need only
support addition and subtraction.  So fractions, floats, and decimals would
work and negative values are supported.  The same is also true for
update() and subtract() which allow negative and zero values
for both inputs and outputs.
The multiset methods are designed only for use cases with positive values.
The inputs may be negative or zero, but only outputs with positive values
are created.  There are no type restrictions, but the value type needs to
support addition, subtraction, and comparison.
The elements() method requires integer counts.  It ignores zero and
negative counts.
