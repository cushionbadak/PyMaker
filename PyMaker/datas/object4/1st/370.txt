Constants added by the site module¶
The site module (which is imported automatically during startup, except
if the -S command-line option is given) adds several constants to the
built-in namespace.  They are useful for the interactive interpreter shell and
should not be used in programs.


quit(code=None)¶

exit(code=None)¶
Objects that when printed, print a message like “Use quit() or Ctrl-D
(i.e. EOF) to exit”, and when called, raise SystemExit with the
specified exit code.



copyright¶

credits¶
Objects that when printed or called, print the text of copyright or
credits, respectively.



license¶
Object that when printed, prints the message “Type license() to see the
full license text”, and when called, displays the full license text in a
pager-like fashion (one screen at a time).
