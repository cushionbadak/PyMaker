os.popen(cmd, mode='r', buffering=-1)¶
Open a pipe to or from command cmd.
The return value is an open file object
connected to the pipe, which can be read or written depending on whether mode
is 'r' (default) or 'w'. The buffering argument has the same meaning as
the corresponding argument to the built-in open() function. The
returned file object reads or writes text strings rather than bytes.
The close method returns None if the subprocess exited
successfully, or the subprocess’s return code if there was an
error. On POSIX systems, if the return code is positive it
represents the return value of the process left-shifted by one
byte.  If the return code is negative, the process was terminated
by the signal given by the negated value of the return code.  (For
example, the return value might be - signal.SIGKILL if the
subprocess was killed.)  On Windows systems, the return value
contains the signed integer return code from the child process.
This is implemented using subprocess.Popen; see that class’s
documentation for more powerful ways to manage and communicate with
subprocesses.
