Datagram Protocols¶
Datagram Protocol instances should be constructed by protocol
factories passed to the loop.create_datagram_endpoint() method.


DatagramProtocol.datagram_received(data, addr)¶
Called when a datagram is received.  data is a bytes object containing
the incoming data.  addr is the address of the peer sending the data;
the exact format depends on the transport.



DatagramProtocol.error_received(exc)¶
Called when a previous send or receive operation raises an
OSError.  exc is the OSError instance.
This method is called in rare conditions, when the transport (e.g. UDP)
detects that a datagram could not be delivered to its recipient.
In many conditions though, undeliverable datagrams will be silently
dropped.


Note
On BSD systems (macOS, FreeBSD, etc.) flow control is not supported
for datagram protocols, because there is no reliable way to detect send
failures caused by writing too many packets.
The socket always appears ‘ready’ and excess packets are dropped. An
OSError with errno set to errno.ENOBUFS may
or may not be raised; if it is raised, it will be reported to
DatagramProtocol.error_received() but otherwise ignored.
