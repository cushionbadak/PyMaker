lock()¶

unlock()¶
Three locking mechanisms are used—dot locking and, if available, the
flock() and lockf() system calls. For MH mailboxes, locking
the mailbox means locking the .mh_sequences file and, only for the
duration of any operations that affect them, locking individual message
files.
