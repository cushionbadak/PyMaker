header_encode_lines(string, maxlengths)¶
Header-encode a string by converting it first to bytes.
This is similar to header_encode() except that the string is fit
into maximum line lengths as given by the argument maxlengths, which
must be an iterator: each element returned from this iterator will provide
the next maximum line length.
