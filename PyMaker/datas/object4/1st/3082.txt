os.renames(old, new)Â¶
Recursive directory or file renaming function. Works like rename(), except
creation of any intermediate directories needed to make the new pathname good is
attempted first. After the rename, directories corresponding to rightmost path
segments of the old name will be pruned away using removedirs().

Note
This function can fail with the new directory structure made if you lack
permissions needed to remove the leaf directory or file.


Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a path-like object for old and new.
