__subclasshook__(subclass)Â¶
(Must be defined as a class method.)
Check whether subclass is considered a subclass of this ABC.  This means
that you can customize the behavior of issubclass further without the
need to call register() on every class you want to consider a
subclass of the ABC.  (This class method is called from the
__subclasscheck__() method of the ABC.)
This method should return True, False or NotImplemented.  If
it returns True, the subclass is considered a subclass of this ABC.
If it returns False, the subclass is not considered a subclass of
this ABC, even if it would normally be one.  If it returns
NotImplemented, the subclass check is continued with the usual
mechanism.
