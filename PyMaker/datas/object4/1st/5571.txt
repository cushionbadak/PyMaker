cte_type¶
Controls the type of Content Transfer Encodings that may be or are
required to be used.  The possible values are:






7bit
all data must be “7 bit clean” (ASCII-only).  This means that
where necessary data will be encoded using either
quoted-printable or base64 encoding.

8bit
data is not constrained to be 7 bit clean.  Data in headers is
still required to be ASCII-only and so will be encoded (see
fold_binary() and utf8 below for
exceptions), but body parts may use the 8bit CTE.



A cte_type value of 8bit only works with BytesGenerator, not
Generator, because strings cannot contain binary data.  If a
Generator is operating under a policy that specifies
cte_type=8bit, it will act as if cte_type is 7bit.
