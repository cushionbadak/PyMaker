acquire(blocking=True, timeout=None)Â¶
Acquire a semaphore.
When invoked without arguments:

If the internal counter is larger than zero on entry, decrement it by
one and return true immediately.
If the internal counter is zero on entry, block until awoken by a call to
release().  Once awoken (and the counter is greater
than 0), decrement the counter by 1 and return true.  Exactly one
thread will be awoken by each call to release().  The
order in which threads are awoken should not be relied on.

When invoked with blocking set to false, do not block.  If a call
without an argument would block, return false immediately; otherwise, do
the same thing as when called without arguments, and return true.
When invoked with a timeout other than None, it will block for at
most timeout seconds.  If acquire does not complete successfully in
that interval, return false.  Return true otherwise.

Changed in version 3.2: The timeout parameter is new.
