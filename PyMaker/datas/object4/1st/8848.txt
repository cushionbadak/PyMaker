class test.support.CleanImport(*module_names)Â¶
A context manager to force import to return a new module reference.  This
is useful for testing module-level behaviors, such as the emission of a
DeprecationWarning on import.  Example usage:
with CleanImport('foo'):
    importlib.import_module('foo')  # New reference.
