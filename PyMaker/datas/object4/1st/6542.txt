cgi.escape(s, quote=False)Â¶
Convert the characters '&', '<' and '>' in string s to HTML-safe
sequences.  Use this if you need to display text that might contain such
characters in HTML.  If the optional flag quote is true, the quotation mark
character (") is also translated; this helps for inclusion in an HTML
attribute value delimited by double quotes, as in <a href="...">.  Note
that single quotes are never translated.

Deprecated since version 3.2: This function is unsafe because quote is false by default, and therefore
deprecated.  Use html.escape() instead.
