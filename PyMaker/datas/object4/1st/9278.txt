sysconfig.get_platform()¶
Return a string that identifies the current platform.
This is used mainly to distinguish platform-specific build directories and
platform-specific built distributions.  Typically includes the OS name and
version and the architecture (as supplied by ‘os.uname()’), although the
exact information included depends on the OS; e.g., on Linux, the kernel
version isn’t particularly important.
Examples of returned values:

linux-i586
linux-alpha (?)
solaris-2.6-sun4u

Windows will return one of:

win-amd64 (64bit Windows on AMD64, aka x86_64, Intel64, and EM64T)
win32 (all others - specifically, sys.platform is returned)

Mac OS X can return:

macosx-10.6-ppc
macosx-10.4-ppc64
macosx-10.3-i386
macosx-10.4-fat

For other non-POSIX platforms, currently just returns sys.platform.
