Syntax
Meaning



tag
Selects all child elements with the given tag.
For example, spam selects all child elements
named spam, and spam/egg selects all
grandchildren named egg in all children named
spam.

*
Selects all child elements.  For example, */egg
selects all grandchildren named egg.

.
Selects the current node.  This is mostly useful
at the beginning of the path, to indicate that it’s
a relative path.

//
Selects all subelements, on all levels beneath the
current  element.  For example, .//egg selects
all egg elements in the entire tree.

..
Selects the parent element.  Returns None if the
path attempts to reach the ancestors of the start
element (the element find was called on).

[@attrib]
Selects all elements that have the given attribute.

[@attrib='value']
Selects all elements for which the given attribute
has the given value.  The value cannot contain
quotes.

[tag]
Selects all elements that have a child named
tag.  Only immediate children are supported.

[.='text']
Selects all elements whose complete text content,
including descendants, equals the given text.

New in version 3.7.



[tag='text']
Selects all elements that have a child named
tag whose complete text content, including
descendants, equals the given text.

[position]
Selects all elements that are located at the given
position.  The position can be either an integer
(1 is the first position), the expression last()
(for the last position), or a position relative to
the last position (e.g. last()-1).



Predicates (expressions within square brackets) must be preceded by a tag
name, an asterisk, or another predicate.  position predicates must be
preceded by a tag name.
