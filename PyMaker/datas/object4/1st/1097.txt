date.ctime()Â¶
Return a string representing the date, for example date(2002, 12,
4).ctime() == 'Wed Dec 4 00:00:00 2002'. d.ctime() is equivalent to
time.ctime(time.mktime(d.timetuple())) on platforms where the native C
ctime() function (which time.ctime() invokes, but which
date.ctime() does not invoke) conforms to the C standard.
