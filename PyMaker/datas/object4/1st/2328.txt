object.__getstate__()¶
Classes can further influence how their instances are pickled; if the class
defines the method __getstate__(), it is called and the returned object
is pickled as the contents for the instance, instead of the contents of the
instance’s dictionary.  If the __getstate__() method is absent, the
instance’s __dict__ is pickled as usual.
