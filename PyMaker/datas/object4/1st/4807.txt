coroutine loop.sock_sendall(sock, data)Â¶
Send data to the sock socket. Asynchronous version of
socket.sendall().
This method continues to send to the socket until either all data
in data has been sent or an error occurs.  None is returned
on success.  On error, an exception is raised. Additionally, there is no way
to determine how much data, if any, was successfully processed by the
receiving end of the connection.
sock must be a non-blocking socket.

Changed in version 3.7: Even though the method was always documented as a coroutine
method, before Python 3.7 it returned an Future.
Since Python 3.7, this is an async def method.
