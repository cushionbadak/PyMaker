os.forkpty()¶
Fork a child process, using a new pseudo-terminal as the child’s controlling
terminal. Return a pair of (pid, fd), where pid is 0 in the child, the
new child’s process id in the parent, and fd is the file descriptor of the
master end of the pseudo-terminal.  For a more portable approach, use the
pty module.  If an error occurs OSError is raised.
