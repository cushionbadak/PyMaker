urllib.parse.urlunsplit(parts)Â¶
Combine the elements of a tuple as returned by urlsplit() into a
complete URL as a string. The parts argument can be any five-item
iterable. This may result in a slightly different, but equivalent URL, if the
URL that was parsed originally had unnecessary delimiters (for example, a ?
with an empty query; the RFC states that these are equivalent).
