typing.OptionalÂ¶
Optional type.
Optional[X] is equivalent to Union[X, None].
Note that this is not the same concept as an optional argument,
which is one that has a default.  An optional argument with a
default does not require the Optional qualifier on its type
annotation just because it is optional. For example:
def foo(arg: int = 0) -> None:
    ...


On the other hand, if an explicit value of None is allowed, the
use of Optional is appropriate, whether the argument is optional
or not. For example:
def foo(arg: Optional[int] = None) -> None:
    ...
