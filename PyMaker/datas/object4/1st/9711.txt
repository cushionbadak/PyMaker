classmethod path_hook(*loader_details)Â¶
A class method which returns a closure for use on sys.path_hooks.
An instance of FileFinder is returned by the closure using the
path argument given to the closure directly and loader_details
indirectly.
If the argument to the closure is not an existing directory,
ImportError is raised.
