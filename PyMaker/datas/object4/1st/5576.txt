handle_defect(obj, defect)Â¶
Handle a defect found on obj.  When the email package calls this
method, defect will always be a subclass of
Defect.
The default implementation checks the raise_on_defect flag.  If
it is True, defect is raised as an exception.  If it is False
(the default), obj and defect are passed to register_defect().
