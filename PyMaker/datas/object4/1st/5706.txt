set_type(type, header='Content-Type', requote=True)¶
Set the main type and subtype for the Content-Type
header. type must be a string in the form maintype/subtype,
otherwise a ValueError is raised.
This method replaces the Content-Type header, keeping all
the parameters in place.  If requote is False, this leaves the
existing header’s quoting as is, otherwise the parameters will be quoted
(the default).
An alternative header can be specified in the header argument. When the
Content-Type header is set a MIME-Version
header is also added.
This is a legacy method.  On the
EmailMessage class its functionality is
replaced by the make_ and add_ methods.
