Wave_write.writeframes(data)Â¶
Write audio frames and make sure nframes is correct.  It will raise an
error if the output stream is not seekable and the total number of frames
that have been written after data has been written does not match the
previously set value for nframes.

Changed in version 3.4: Any bytes-like object is now accepted.
