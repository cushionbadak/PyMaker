The numeric tower¶


class numbers.Complex¶
Subclasses of this type describe complex numbers and include the operations
that work on the built-in complex type. These are: conversions to
complex and bool, real, imag, +,
-, *, /, abs(), conjugate(), ==, and !=. All
except - and != are abstract.


real¶
Abstract. Retrieves the real component of this number.



imag¶
Abstract. Retrieves the imaginary component of this number.



abstractmethod conjugate()¶
Abstract. Returns the complex conjugate. For example, (1+3j).conjugate()
== (1-3j).




class numbers.Real¶
To Complex, Real adds the operations that work on real
numbers.
In short, those are: a conversion to float, math.trunc(),
round(), math.floor(), math.ceil(), divmod(), //,
%, <, <=, >, and >=.
Real also provides defaults for complex(), real,
imag, and conjugate().



class numbers.Rational¶
Subtypes Real and adds
numerator and denominator properties, which
should be in lowest terms. With these, it provides a default for
float().


numerator¶
Abstract.



denominator¶
Abstract.




class numbers.Integral¶
Subtypes Rational and adds a conversion to int.  Provides
defaults for float(), numerator, and
denominator.  Adds abstract methods for ** and
bit-string operations: <<, >>, &, ^, |, ~.
