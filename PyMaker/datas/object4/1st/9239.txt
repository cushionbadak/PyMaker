sys.prefixÂ¶
A string giving the site-specific directory prefix where the platform
independent Python files are installed; by default, this is the string
'/usr/local'.  This can be set at build time with the --prefix
argument to the configure script.  The main collection of Python
library modules is installed in the directory prefix/lib/pythonX.Y
while the platform independent header files (all except pyconfig.h) are
stored in prefix/include/pythonX.Y, where X.Y is the version
number of Python, for example 3.2.

Note
If a virtual environment is in effect, this
value will be changed in site.py to point to the virtual
environment. The value for the Python installation will still be
available, via base_prefix.
