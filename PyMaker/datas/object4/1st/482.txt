bytes.join(iterable)¶

bytearray.join(iterable)¶
Return a bytes or bytearray object which is the concatenation of the
binary data sequences in iterable.  A TypeError will be raised
if there are any values in iterable that are not bytes-like
objects, including str objects.  The
separator between elements is the contents of the bytes or
bytearray object providing this method.
