inspect.getinnerframes(traceback, context=1)¶
Get a list of frame records for a traceback’s frame and all inner frames.  These
frames represent calls made as a consequence of frame.  The first entry in the
list represents traceback; the last entry represents where the exception was
raised.

Changed in version 3.5: A list of named tuples
FrameInfo(frame, filename, lineno, function, code_context, index)
is returned.
