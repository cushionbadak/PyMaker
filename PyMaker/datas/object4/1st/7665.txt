imghdr.testsÂ¶
A list of functions performing the individual tests.  Each function takes two
arguments: the byte-stream and an open file-like object. When what() is
called with a byte-stream, the file-like object will be None.
The test function should return a string describing the image type if the test
succeeded, or None if it failed.
