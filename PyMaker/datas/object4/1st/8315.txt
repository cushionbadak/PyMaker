typing.get_type_hints(obj[, globals[, locals]])Â¶
Return a dictionary containing type hints for a function, method, module
or class object.
This is often the same as obj.__annotations__. In addition,
forward references encoded as string literals are handled by evaluating
them in globals and locals namespaces. If necessary,
Optional[t] is added for function and method annotations if a default
value equal to None is set. For a class C, return
a dictionary constructed by merging all the __annotations__ along
C.__mro__ in reverse order.
