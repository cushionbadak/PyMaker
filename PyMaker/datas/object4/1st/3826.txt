window.timeout(delay)Â¶
Set blocking or non-blocking read behavior for the window.  If delay is
negative, blocking read is used (which will wait indefinitely for input).  If
delay is zero, then non-blocking read is used, and getch() will
return -1 if no input is waiting.  If delay is positive, then
getch() will block for delay milliseconds, and return -1 if there is
still no input at the end of that time.
