readline.set_completion_display_matches_hook([function])Â¶
Set or remove the completion display function.  If function is
specified, it will be used as the new completion display function;
if omitted or None, any completion display function already
installed is removed.  This sets or clears the
rl_completion_display_matches_hook callback in the
underlying library.  The completion display function is called as
function(substitution, [matches], longest_match_length) once
each time matches need to be displayed.
