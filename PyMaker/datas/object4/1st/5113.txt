socket.sendfile(file, offset=0, count=None)Â¶
Send a file until EOF is reached by using high-performance
os.sendfile and return the total number of bytes which were sent.
file must be a regular file object opened in binary mode. If
os.sendfile is not available (e.g. Windows) or file is not a
regular file send() will be used instead. offset tells from where to
start reading the file. If specified, count is the total number of bytes
to transmit as opposed to sending the file until EOF is reached. File
position is updated on return or also in case of error in which case
file.tell() can be used to figure out the number of
bytes which were sent. The socket must be of SOCK_STREAM type.
Non-blocking sockets are not supported.

New in version 3.5.
