ctypes.byref(obj[, offset])Â¶
Returns a light-weight pointer to obj, which must be an instance of a
ctypes type.  offset defaults to zero, and must be an integer that will be
added to the internal pointer value.
byref(obj, offset) corresponds to this C code:
(((char *)&obj) + offset)


The returned object can only be used as a foreign function call parameter.
It behaves similar to pointer(obj), but the construction is a lot faster.
