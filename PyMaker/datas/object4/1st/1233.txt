parentsÂ¶
Property returning a new ChainMap containing all of the maps in
the current instance except the first one.  This is useful for skipping
the first map in the search.  Use cases are similar to those for the
nonlocal keyword used in nested scopes.  The use cases also parallel those for the built-in
super() function.  A reference to d.parents is equivalent to:
ChainMap(*d.maps[1:]).
