xml.dom.registerDOMImplementation(name, factory)¶
Register the factory function with the name name.  The factory function
should return an object which implements the DOMImplementation
interface.  The factory function can return the same object every time, or a new
one for each call, as appropriate for the specific implementation (e.g. if that
implementation supports some customization).
