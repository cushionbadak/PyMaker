class os.stat_result¶
Object whose attributes correspond roughly to the members of the
stat structure. It is used for the result of os.stat(),
os.fstat() and os.lstat().
Attributes:


st_mode¶
File mode: file type and file mode bits (permissions).



st_ino¶
Platform dependent, but if non-zero, uniquely identifies the
file for a given value of st_dev. Typically:

the inode number on Unix,
the file index on
Windows




st_dev¶
Identifier of the device on which this file resides.



st_nlink¶
Number of hard links.



st_uid¶
User identifier of the file owner.



st_gid¶
Group identifier of the file owner.



st_size¶
Size of the file in bytes, if it is a regular file or a symbolic link.
The size of a symbolic link is the length of the pathname it contains,
without a terminating null byte.

Timestamps:


st_atime¶
Time of most recent access expressed in seconds.



st_mtime¶
Time of most recent content modification expressed in seconds.



st_ctime¶
Platform dependent:

the time of most recent metadata change on Unix,
the time of creation on Windows, expressed in seconds.




st_atime_ns¶
Time of most recent access expressed in nanoseconds as an integer.



st_mtime_ns¶
Time of most recent content modification expressed in nanoseconds as an
integer.



st_ctime_ns¶
Platform dependent:

the time of most recent metadata change on Unix,
the time of creation on Windows, expressed in nanoseconds as an
integer.



Note
The exact meaning and resolution of the st_atime,
st_mtime, and st_ctime attributes depend on the operating
system and the file system. For example, on Windows systems using the FAT
or FAT32 file systems, st_mtime has 2-second resolution, and
st_atime has only 1-day resolution.  See your operating system
documentation for details.
Similarly, although st_atime_ns, st_mtime_ns,
and st_ctime_ns are always expressed in nanoseconds, many
systems do not provide nanosecond precision.  On systems that do
provide nanosecond precision, the floating-point object used to
store st_atime, st_mtime, and st_ctime
cannot preserve all of it, and as such will be slightly inexact.
If you need the exact timestamps you should always use
st_atime_ns, st_mtime_ns, and st_ctime_ns.

On some Unix systems (such as Linux), the following attributes may also be
available:


st_blocks¶
Number of 512-byte blocks allocated for file.
This may be smaller than st_size/512 when the file has holes.



st_blksize¶
“Preferred” blocksize for efficient file system I/O. Writing to a file in
smaller chunks may cause an inefficient read-modify-rewrite.



st_rdev¶
Type of device if an inode device.



st_flags¶
User defined flags for file.

On other Unix systems (such as FreeBSD), the following attributes may be
available (but may be only filled out if root tries to use them):


st_gen¶
File generation number.



st_birthtime¶
Time of file creation.

On Solaris and derivatives, the following attributes may also be
available:


st_fstype¶
String that uniquely identifies the type of the filesystem that
contains the file.

On Mac OS systems, the following attributes may also be available:


st_rsize¶
Real size of the file.



st_creator¶
Creator of the file.



st_type¶
File type.

On Windows systems, the following attribute is also available:


st_file_attributes¶
Windows file attributes: dwFileAttributes member of the
BY_HANDLE_FILE_INFORMATION structure returned by
GetFileInformationByHandle(). See the FILE_ATTRIBUTE_*
constants in the stat module.

The standard module stat defines functions and constants that are
useful for extracting information from a stat structure. (On
Windows, some items are filled with dummy values.)
For backward compatibility, a stat_result instance is also
accessible as a tuple of at least 10 integers giving the most important (and
portable) members of the stat structure, in the order
st_mode, st_ino, st_dev, st_nlink,
st_uid, st_gid, st_size, st_atime,
st_mtime, st_ctime. More items may be added at the end by
some implementations. For compatibility with older Python versions,
accessing stat_result as a tuple always returns integers.

New in version 3.3: Added the st_atime_ns, st_mtime_ns, and
st_ctime_ns members.


New in version 3.5: Added the st_file_attributes member on Windows.


Changed in version 3.5: Windows now returns the file index as st_ino when
available.


New in version 3.7: Added the st_fstype member to Solaris/derivatives.
