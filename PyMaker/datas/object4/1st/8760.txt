test.support.findfile(filename, subdir=None)Â¶
Return the path to the file named filename. If no match is found
filename is returned. This does not equal a failure since it could be the
path to the file.
Setting subdir indicates a relative path to use to find the file
rather than looking directly in the path directories.
