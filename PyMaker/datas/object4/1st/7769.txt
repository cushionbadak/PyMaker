locale.ERA¶
Get a string that represents the era used in the current locale.
Most locales do not define this value.  An example of a locale which does
define this value is the Japanese one.  In Japan, the traditional
representation of dates includes the name of the era corresponding to the
then-emperor’s reign.
Normally it should not be necessary to use this value directly. Specifying
the E modifier in their format strings causes the time.strftime()
function to use this information.  The format of the returned string is not
specified, and therefore you should not assume knowledge of it on different
systems.
