class collections.abc.AwaitableÂ¶
ABC for awaitable objects, which can be used in await
expressions.  Custom implementations must provide the __await__()
method.
Coroutine objects and instances of the
Coroutine ABC are all instances of this ABC.

Note
In CPython, generator-based coroutines (generators decorated with
types.coroutine() or asyncio.coroutine()) are
awaitables, even though they do not have an __await__() method.
Using isinstance(gencoro, Awaitable) for them will return False.
Use inspect.isawaitable() to detect them.


New in version 3.5.
