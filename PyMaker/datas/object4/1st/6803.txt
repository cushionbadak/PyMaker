exception http.client.RemoteDisconnectedÂ¶
A subclass of ConnectionResetError and BadStatusLine.  Raised
by HTTPConnection.getresponse() when the attempt to read the response
results in no data read from the connection, indicating that the remote end
has closed the connection.

New in version 3.5: Previously, BadStatusLine('') was raised.
