Compound shapes¶
To use compound turtle shapes, which consist of several polygons of different
color, you must use the helper class Shape explicitly as described
below:

Create an empty Shape object of type “compound”.

Add as many components to this object as desired, using the
addcomponent() method.
For example:
>>> s = Shape("compound")
>>> poly1 = ((0,0),(10,-5),(0,10),(-10,-5))
>>> s.addcomponent(poly1, "red", "blue")
>>> poly2 = ((0,0),(10,-5),(-10,-5))
>>> s.addcomponent(poly2, "blue", "red")



Now add the Shape to the Screen’s shapelist and use it:
>>> register_shape("myshape", s)
>>> shape("myshape")





Note
The Shape class is used internally by the register_shape()
method in different ways.  The application programmer has to deal with the
Shape class only when using compound shapes like shown above!
