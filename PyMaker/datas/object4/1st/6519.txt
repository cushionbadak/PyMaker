webbrowser.register(name, constructor, instance=None, *, preferred=False)Â¶
Register the browser type name.  Once a browser type is registered, the
get() function can return a controller for that browser type.  If
instance is not provided, or is None, constructor will be called without
parameters to create an instance when needed.  If instance is provided,
constructor will never be called, and may be None.
Setting preferred to True makes this browser a preferred result for
a get() call with no argument.  Otherwise, this entry point is only
useful if you plan to either set the BROWSER variable or call
get() with a nonempty argument matching the name of a handler you
declare.

Changed in version 3.7: preferred keyword-only parameter was added.
