Help sources¶
Help menu entry “IDLE Help” displays a formatted html version of the
IDLE chapter of the Library Reference.  The result, in a read-only
tkinter text window, is close to what one sees in a web browser.
Navigate through the text with a mousewheel,
the scrollbar, or up and down arrow keys held down.
Or click the TOC (Table of Contents) button and select a section
header in the opened box.
Help menu entry “Python Docs” opens the extensive sources of help,
including tutorials, available at docs.python.org/x.y, where ‘x.y’
is the currently running Python version.  If your system
has an off-line copy of the docs (this may be an installation option),
that will be opened instead.
Selected URLs can be added or removed from the help menu at any time using the
General tab of the Configure IDLE dialog .
