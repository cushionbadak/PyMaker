seek(offset[, whence])¶
Change the stream position to the given offset.  Behaviour depends on
the whence parameter.  The default value for whence is
SEEK_SET.

SEEK_SET or 0: seek from the start of the stream
(the default); offset must either be a number returned by
TextIOBase.tell(), or zero.  Any other offset value
produces undefined behaviour.
SEEK_CUR or 1: “seek” to the current position;
offset must be zero, which is a no-operation (all other values
are unsupported).
SEEK_END or 2: seek to the end of the stream;
offset must be zero (all other values are unsupported).

Return the new absolute position as an opaque number.

New in version 3.1: The SEEK_* constants.
