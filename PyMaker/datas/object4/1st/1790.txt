class decimal.FloatOperationÂ¶
Enable stricter semantics for mixing floats and Decimals.
If the signal is not trapped (default), mixing floats and Decimals is
permitted in the Decimal constructor,
create_decimal() and all comparison operators.
Both conversion and comparisons are exact. Any occurrence of a mixed
operation is silently recorded by setting FloatOperation in the
context flags. Explicit conversions with from_float()
or create_decimal_from_float() do not set the flag.
Otherwise (the signal is trapped), only equality comparisons and explicit
conversions are silent. All other mixed operations raise FloatOperation.
