formatmonth(theyear, themonth, w=0, l=0)¶
Return a month’s calendar in a multi-line string. If w is provided, it
specifies the width of the date columns, which are centered. If l is
given, it specifies the number of lines that each week will use. Depends
on the first weekday as specified in the constructor or set by the
setfirstweekday() method.
