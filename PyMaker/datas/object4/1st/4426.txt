set_running_or_notify_cancel()Â¶
This method should only be called by Executor implementations
before executing the work associated with the Future and by unit
tests.
If the method returns False then the Future was cancelled,
i.e. Future.cancel() was called and returned True.  Any threads
waiting on the Future completing (i.e. through
as_completed() or wait()) will be woken up.
If the method returns True then the Future was not cancelled
and has been put in the running state, i.e. calls to
Future.running() will return True.
This method can only be called once and cannot be called after
Future.set_result() or Future.set_exception() have been
called.
