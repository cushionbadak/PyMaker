TarFile.list(verbose=True, *, members=None)Â¶
Print a table of contents to sys.stdout. If verbose is False,
only the names of the members are printed. If it is True, output
similar to that of ls -l is produced. If optional members is
given, it must be a subset of the list returned by getmembers().

Changed in version 3.5: Added the members parameter.
