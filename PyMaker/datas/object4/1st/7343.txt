xmlrpc.client.dumps(params, methodname=None, methodresponse=None, encoding=None, allow_none=False)¶
Convert params into an XML-RPC request. or into a response if methodresponse
is true. params can be either a tuple of arguments or an instance of the
Fault exception class.  If methodresponse is true, only a single value
can be returned, meaning that params must be of length 1. encoding, if
supplied, is the encoding to use in the generated XML; the default is UTF-8.
Python’s None value cannot be used in standard XML-RPC; to allow using
it via an extension,  provide a true value for allow_none.
