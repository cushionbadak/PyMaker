Node.nodeNameÂ¶
This has a different meaning for each node type; see the DOM specification for
details.  You can always get the information you would get here from another
property such as the tagName property for elements or the name
property for attributes. For all node types, the value of this attribute will be
either a string or None.  This is a read-only attribute.
