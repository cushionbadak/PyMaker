email.utils.parsedate(date)¶
Attempts to parse a date according to the rules in RFC 2822. however, some
mailers don’t follow that format as specified, so parsedate() tries to
guess correctly in such cases.  date is a string containing an RFC 2822
date, such as  "Mon, 20 Nov 1995 19:12:08 -0500".  If it succeeds in parsing
the date, parsedate() returns a 9-tuple that can be passed directly to
time.mktime(); otherwise None will be returned.  Note that indexes 6,
7, and 8 of the result tuple are not usable.
