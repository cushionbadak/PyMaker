CookieJar.extract_cookies(response, request)¶
Extract cookies from HTTP response and store them in the CookieJar,
where allowed by policy.
The CookieJar will look for allowable Set-Cookie and
Set-Cookie2 headers in the response argument, and store cookies
as appropriate (subject to the CookiePolicy.set_ok() method’s approval).
The response object (usually the result of a call to
urllib.request.urlopen(), or similar) should support an info()
method, which returns an email.message.Message instance.
The request object (usually a urllib.request.Request instance)
must support the methods get_full_url(), get_host(),
unverifiable(), and origin_req_host attribute, as documented
by urllib.request.  The request is used to set default values for
cookie-attributes as well as for checking that the cookie is allowed to be
set.

Changed in version 3.3: request object needs origin_req_host attribute. Dependency on a
deprecated method get_origin_req_host() has been removed.
