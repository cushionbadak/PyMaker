socket.getprotobyname(protocolname)¶
Translate an Internet protocol name (for example, 'icmp') to a constant
suitable for passing as the (optional) third argument to the socket()
function.  This is usually only needed for sockets opened in “raw” mode
(SOCK_RAW); for the normal socket modes, the correct protocol is chosen
automatically if the protocol is omitted or zero.
