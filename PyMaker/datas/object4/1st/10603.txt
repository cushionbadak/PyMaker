imp.lock_held()Â¶
Return True if the global import lock is currently held, else
False. On platforms without threads, always return False.
On platforms with threads, a thread executing an import first holds a
global import lock, then sets up a per-module lock for the rest of the
import.  This blocks other threads from importing the same module until
the original import completes, preventing other threads from seeing
incomplete module objects constructed by the original thread.  An
exception is made for circular imports, which by construction have to
expose an incomplete module object at some point.

Changed in version 3.3: The locking scheme has changed to per-module locks for
the most part.  A global import lock is kept for some critical tasks,
such as initializing the per-module locks.


Deprecated since version 3.4.
