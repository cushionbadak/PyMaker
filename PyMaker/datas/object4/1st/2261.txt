linecache.lazycache(filename, module_globals)Â¶
Capture enough detail about a non-file-based module to permit getting its
lines later via getline() even if module_globals is None in the later
call. This avoids doing I/O until a line is actually needed, without having
to carry the module globals around indefinitely.

New in version 3.5.
