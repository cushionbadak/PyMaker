str.format_map(mapping)Â¶
Similar to str.format(**mapping), except that mapping is
used directly and not copied to a dict.  This is useful
if for example mapping is a dict subclass:
>>> class Default(dict):
...     def __missing__(self, key):
...         return key
...
>>> '{name} was born in {country}'.format_map(Default(name='Guido'))
'Guido was born in country'



New in version 3.2.
