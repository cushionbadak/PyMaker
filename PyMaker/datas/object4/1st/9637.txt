class importlib.abc.MetaPathFinder¶
An abstract base class representing a meta path finder. For
compatibility, this is a subclass of Finder.

New in version 3.3.



find_spec(fullname, path, target=None)¶
An abstract method for finding a spec for
the specified module.  If this is a top-level import, path will
be None.  Otherwise, this is a search for a subpackage or
module and path will be the value of __path__ from the
parent package. If a spec cannot be found, None is returned.
When passed in, target is a module object that the finder may
use to make a more educated guess about what spec to return.

New in version 3.4.




find_module(fullname, path)¶
A legacy method for finding a loader for the specified
module.  If this is a top-level import, path will be None.
Otherwise, this is a search for a subpackage or module and path
will be the value of __path__ from the parent
package. If a loader cannot be found, None is returned.
If find_spec() is defined, backwards-compatible functionality is
provided.

Changed in version 3.4: Returns None when called instead of raising
NotImplementedError. Can use find_spec() to provide
functionality.


Deprecated since version 3.4: Use find_spec() instead.




invalidate_caches()¶
An optional method which, when called, should invalidate any internal
cache used by the finder. Used by importlib.invalidate_caches()
when invalidating the caches of all finders on sys.meta_path.

Changed in version 3.4: Returns None when called instead of NotImplemented.
