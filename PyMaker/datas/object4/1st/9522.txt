inspect.trace(context=1)Â¶
Return a list of frame records for the stack between the current frame and the
frame in which an exception currently being handled was raised in.  The first
entry in the list represents the caller; the last entry represents where the
exception was raised.

Changed in version 3.5: A list of named tuples
FrameInfo(frame, filename, lineno, function, code_context, index)
is returned.
