class asyncio.Transport(WriteTransport, ReadTransport)Â¶
Interface representing a bidirectional transport, such as a
TCP connection.
The user does not instantiate a transport directly; they call a
utility function, passing it a protocol factory and other
information necessary to create the transport and protocol.
Instances of the Transport class are returned from or used by
event loop methods like loop.create_connection(),
loop.create_unix_connection(),
loop.create_server(), loop.sendfile(), etc.
