@typing.no_type_checkÂ¶
Decorator to indicate that annotations are not type hints.
This works as class or function decorator.  With a class, it
applies recursively to all methods defined in that class (but not
to methods defined in its superclasses or subclasses).
This mutates the function(s) in place.
