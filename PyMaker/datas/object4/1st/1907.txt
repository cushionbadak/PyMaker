Perform “rich comparisons” between a and b. Specifically, lt(a, b) is
equivalent to a < b, le(a, b) is equivalent to a <= b, eq(a,
b) is equivalent to a == b, ne(a, b) is equivalent to a != b,
gt(a, b) is equivalent to a > b and ge(a, b) is equivalent to a
>= b.  Note that these functions can return any value, which may
or may not be interpretable as a Boolean value.  See
Comparisons for more information about rich comparisons.
