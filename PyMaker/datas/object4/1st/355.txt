@staticmethod¶
Transform a method into a static method.
A static method does not receive an implicit first argument. To declare a static
method, use this idiom:
class C:
    @staticmethod
    def f(arg1, arg2, ...): ...


The @staticmethod form is a function decorator – see
Function definitions for details.
A static method can be called either on the class (such as C.f()) or on an instance (such
as C().f()).
Static methods in Python are similar to those found in Java or C++. Also see
classmethod() for a variant that is useful for creating alternate class
constructors.
Like all decorators, it is also possible to call staticmethod as
a regular function and do something with its result.  This is needed
in some cases where you need a reference to a function from a class
body and you want to avoid the automatic transformation to instance
method.  For these cases, use this idiom:
class C:
    builtin_open = staticmethod(open)


For more information on static methods, see The standard type hierarchy.
