restype¶
Assign a ctypes type to specify the result type of the foreign function.
Use None for void, a function not returning anything.
It is possible to assign a callable Python object that is not a ctypes
type, in this case the function is assumed to return a C int, and
the callable will be called with this integer, allowing further
processing or error checking.  Using this is deprecated, for more flexible
post processing or error checking use a ctypes data type as
restype and assign a callable to the errcheck attribute.
