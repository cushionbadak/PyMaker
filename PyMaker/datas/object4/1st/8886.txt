dispatch_call(frame, arg)Â¶
If the debugger should stop on this function call, invoke the
user_call() method (which should be overridden in subclasses).
Raise a BdbQuit exception if the Bdb.quitting flag is set
(which can be set from user_call()).  Return a reference to the
trace_dispatch() method for further tracing in that scope.
