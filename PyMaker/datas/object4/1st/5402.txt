bind(address)¶
Bind the socket to address.  The socket must not already be bound.  (The
format of address depends on the address family — refer to the
socket documentation for more information.)  To mark
the socket as re-usable (setting the SO_REUSEADDR option), call
the dispatcher object’s set_reuse_addr() method.
