inspect.getouterframes(frame, context=1)¶
Get a list of frame records for a frame and all outer frames.  These frames
represent the calls that lead to the creation of frame. The first entry in the
returned list represents frame; the last entry represents the outermost call
on frame’s stack.

Changed in version 3.5: A list of named tuples
FrameInfo(frame, filename, lineno, function, code_context, index)
is returned.
