writer.send_paragraph(blankline)Â¶
Produce a paragraph separation of at least blankline blank lines, or the
equivalent.  The blankline value will be an integer.  Note that the
implementation will receive a call to send_line_break() before this call
if a line break is needed;  this method should not include ending the last line
of the paragraph. It is only responsible for vertical spacing between
paragraphs.
