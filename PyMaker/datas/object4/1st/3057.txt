os.chmod(path, mode, *, dir_fd=None, follow_symlinks=True)¶
Change the mode of path to the numeric mode. mode may take one of the
following values (as defined in the stat module) or bitwise ORed
combinations of them:

stat.S_ISUID
stat.S_ISGID
stat.S_ENFMT
stat.S_ISVTX
stat.S_IREAD
stat.S_IWRITE
stat.S_IEXEC
stat.S_IRWXU
stat.S_IRUSR
stat.S_IWUSR
stat.S_IXUSR
stat.S_IRWXG
stat.S_IRGRP
stat.S_IWGRP
stat.S_IXGRP
stat.S_IRWXO
stat.S_IROTH
stat.S_IWOTH
stat.S_IXOTH

This function can support specifying a file descriptor,
paths relative to directory descriptors and not
following symlinks.

Note
Although Windows supports chmod(), you can only set the file’s
read-only flag with it (via the stat.S_IWRITE and stat.S_IREAD
constants or a corresponding integer value).  All other bits are ignored.


New in version 3.3: Added support for specifying path as an open file descriptor,
and the dir_fd and follow_symlinks arguments.


Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a path-like object.
