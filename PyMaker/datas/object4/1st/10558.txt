Standard option typesÂ¶
optparse has five built-in option types: "string", "int",
"choice", "float" and "complex".  If you need to add new
option types, see section Extending optparse.
Arguments to string options are not checked or converted in any way: the text on
the command line is stored in the destination (or passed to the callback) as-is.
Integer arguments (type "int") are parsed as follows:

if the number starts with 0x, it is parsed as a hexadecimal number
if the number starts with 0, it is parsed as an octal number
if the number starts with 0b, it is parsed as a binary number
otherwise, the number is parsed as a decimal number

The conversion is done by calling int() with the appropriate base (2, 8,
10, or 16).  If this fails, so will optparse, although with a more useful
error message.
"float" and "complex" option arguments are converted directly with
float() and complex(), with similar error-handling.
"choice" options are a subtype of "string" options.  The
choices option attribute (a sequence of strings) defines the
set of allowed option arguments.  optparse.check_choice() compares
user-supplied option arguments against this master list and raises
OptionValueError if an invalid string is given.
