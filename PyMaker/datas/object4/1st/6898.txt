POP3.stls(context=None)Â¶
Start a TLS session on the active connection as specified in RFC 2595.
This is only allowed before user authentication
context parameter is a ssl.SSLContext object which allows
bundling SSL configuration options, certificates and private keys into
a single (potentially long-lived) structure.  Please read Security considerations
for best practices.
This method supports hostname checking via
ssl.SSLContext.check_hostname and Server Name Indication (see
ssl.HAS_SNI).

New in version 3.4.
