Resource Usage¶
These functions are used to retrieve resource usage information:


resource.getrusage(who)¶
This function returns an object that describes the resources consumed by either
the current process or its children, as specified by the who parameter.  The
who parameter should be specified using one of the RUSAGE_*
constants described below.
The fields of the return value each describe how a particular system resource
has been used, e.g. amount of time spent running is user mode or number of times
the process was swapped out of main memory. Some values are dependent on the
clock tick internal, e.g. the amount of memory the process is using.
For backward compatibility, the return value is also accessible as a tuple of 16
elements.
The fields ru_utime and ru_stime of the return value are
floating point values representing the amount of time spent executing in user
mode and the amount of time spent executing in system mode, respectively. The
remaining values are integers. Consult the getrusage(2) man page for
detailed information about these values. A brief summary is presented here:







Index
Field
Resource



0
ru_utime
time in user mode (float)

1
ru_stime
time in system mode (float)

2
ru_maxrss
maximum resident set size

3
ru_ixrss
shared memory size

4
ru_idrss
unshared memory size

5
ru_isrss
unshared stack size

6
ru_minflt
page faults not requiring I/O

7
ru_majflt
page faults requiring I/O

8
ru_nswap
number of swap outs

9
ru_inblock
block input operations

10
ru_oublock
block output operations

11
ru_msgsnd
messages sent

12
ru_msgrcv
messages received

13
ru_nsignals
signals received

14
ru_nvcsw
voluntary context switches

15
ru_nivcsw
involuntary context switches



This function will raise a ValueError if an invalid who parameter is
specified. It may also raise error exception in unusual circumstances.



resource.getpagesize()¶
Returns the number of bytes in a system page. (This need not be the same as the
hardware page size.)

The following RUSAGE_* symbols are passed to the getrusage()
function to specify which processes information should be provided for.


resource.RUSAGE_SELF¶
Pass to getrusage() to request resources consumed by the calling
process, which is the sum of resources used by all threads in the process.



resource.RUSAGE_CHILDREN¶
Pass to getrusage() to request resources consumed by child processes
of the calling process which have been terminated and waited for.



resource.RUSAGE_BOTH¶
Pass to getrusage() to request resources consumed by both the current
process and child processes.  May not be available on all systems.



resource.RUSAGE_THREAD¶
Pass to getrusage() to request resources consumed by the current
thread.  May not be available on all systems.

New in version 3.2.
