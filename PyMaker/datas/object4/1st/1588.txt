Constants¶


math.pi¶
The mathematical constant π = 3.141592…, to available precision.



math.e¶
The mathematical constant e = 2.718281…, to available precision.



math.tau¶
The mathematical constant τ = 6.283185…, to available precision.
Tau is a circle constant equal to 2π, the ratio of a circle’s circumference to
its radius. To learn more about Tau, check out Vi Hart’s video Pi is (still)
Wrong, and start celebrating
Tau day by eating twice as much pie!

New in version 3.6.




math.inf¶
A floating-point positive infinity.  (For negative infinity, use
-math.inf.)  Equivalent to the output of float('inf').

New in version 3.5.




math.nan¶
A floating-point “not a number” (NaN) value.  Equivalent to the output of
float('nan').

New in version 3.5.



CPython implementation detail: The math module consists mostly of thin wrappers around the platform C
math library functions.  Behavior in exceptional cases follows Annex F of
the C99 standard where appropriate.  The current implementation will raise
ValueError for invalid operations like sqrt(-1.0) or log(0.0)
(where C99 Annex F recommends signaling invalid operation or divide-by-zero),
and OverflowError for results that overflow (for example,
exp(1000.0)).  A NaN will not be returned from any of the functions
above unless one or more of the input arguments was a NaN; in that case,
most functions will return a NaN, but (again following C99 Annex F) there
are some exceptions to this rule, for example pow(float('nan'), 0.0) or
hypot(float('nan'), float('inf')).
Note that Python makes no effort to distinguish signaling NaNs from
quiet NaNs, and behavior for signaling NaNs remains unspecified.
Typical behavior is to treat all NaNs as though they were quiet.
