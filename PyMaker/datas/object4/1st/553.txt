tolist()Â¶
Return the data in the buffer as a list of elements.
>>> memoryview(b'abc').tolist()
[97, 98, 99]
>>> import array
>>> a = array.array('d', [1.1, 2.2, 3.3])
>>> m = memoryview(a)
>>> m.tolist()
[1.1, 2.2, 3.3]



Changed in version 3.3: tolist() now supports all single character native formats in
struct module syntax as well as multi-dimensional
representations.
