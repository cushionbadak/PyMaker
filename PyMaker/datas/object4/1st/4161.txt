_fields_Â¶
A sequence defining the structure fields.  The items must be 2-tuples or
3-tuples.  The first item is the name of the field, the second item
specifies the type of the field; it can be any ctypes data type.
For integer type fields like c_int, a third optional item can be
given.  It must be a small positive integer defining the bit width of the
field.
Field names must be unique within one structure or union.  This is not
checked, only one field can be accessed when names are repeated.
It is possible to define the _fields_ class variable after the
class statement that defines the Structure subclass, this allows creating
data types that directly or indirectly reference themselves:
class List(Structure):
    pass
List._fields_ = [("pnext", POINTER(List)),
                 ...
                ]


The _fields_ class variable must, however, be defined before the
type is first used (an instance is created, sizeof() is called on it,
and so on).  Later assignments to the _fields_ class variable will
raise an AttributeError.
It is possible to define sub-subclasses of structure types, they inherit
the fields of the base class plus the _fields_ defined in the
sub-subclass, if any.
