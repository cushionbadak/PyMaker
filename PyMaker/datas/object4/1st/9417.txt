class traceback.FrameSummary(filename, lineno, name, lookup_line=True, locals=None, line=None)Â¶
Represent a single frame in the traceback or stack that is being formatted
or printed. It may optionally have a stringified version of the frames
locals included in it. If lookup_line is False, the source code is not
looked up until the FrameSummary has the line
attribute accessed (which also happens when casting it to a tuple).
line may be directly provided, and will prevent line
lookups happening at all. locals is an optional local variable
dictionary, and if supplied the variable representations are stored in the
summary for later display.
