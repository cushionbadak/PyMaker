typing.ClassVarÂ¶
Special type construct to mark class variables.
As introduced in PEP 526, a variable annotation wrapped in ClassVar
indicates that a given attribute is intended to be used as a class variable
and should not be set on instances of that class. Usage:
class Starship:
    stats: ClassVar[Dict[str, int]] = {} # class variable
    damage: int = 10                     # instance variable


ClassVar accepts only types and cannot be further subscribed.
ClassVar is not a class itself, and should not
be used with isinstance() or issubclass().
ClassVar does not change Python runtime behavior, but
it can be used by third-party type checkers. For example, a type checker
might flag the following code as an error:
enterprise_d = Starship(3000)
enterprise_d.stats = {} # Error, setting class variable on instance
Starship.stats = {}     # This is OK



New in version 3.5.3.
