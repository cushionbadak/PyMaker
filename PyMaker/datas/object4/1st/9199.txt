sys.exit([arg])¶
Exit from Python.  This is implemented by raising the SystemExit
exception, so cleanup actions specified by finally clauses of try
statements are honored, and it is possible to intercept the exit attempt at
an outer level.
The optional argument arg can be an integer giving the exit status
(defaulting to zero), or another type of object.  If it is an integer, zero
is considered “successful termination” and any nonzero value is considered
“abnormal termination” by shells and the like.  Most systems require it to be
in the range 0–127, and produce undefined results otherwise.  Some systems
have a convention for assigning specific meanings to specific exit codes, but
these are generally underdeveloped; Unix programs generally use 2 for command
line syntax errors and 1 for all other kind of errors.  If another type of
object is passed, None is equivalent to passing zero, and any other
object is printed to stderr and results in an exit code of 1.  In
particular, sys.exit("some error message") is a quick way to exit a
program when an error occurs.
Since exit() ultimately “only” raises an exception, it will only exit
the process when called from the main thread, and the exception is not
intercepted.

Changed in version 3.6: If an error occurs in the cleanup after the Python interpreter
has caught SystemExit (such as an error flushing buffered data
in the standard streams), the exit status is changed to 120.
