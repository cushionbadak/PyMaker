turtle.shapesize(stretch_wid=None, stretch_len=None, outline=None)¶

turtle.turtlesize(stretch_wid=None, stretch_len=None, outline=None)¶




Parameters:
stretch_wid – positive number
stretch_len – positive number
outline – positive number





Return or set the pen’s attributes x/y-stretchfactors and/or outline.  Set
resizemode to “user”.  If and only if resizemode is set to “user”, the turtle
will be displayed stretched according to its stretchfactors: stretch_wid is
stretchfactor perpendicular to its orientation, stretch_len is
stretchfactor in direction of its orientation, outline determines the width
of the shapes’s outline.
