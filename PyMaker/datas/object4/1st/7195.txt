send_header(keyword, value)Â¶
Adds the HTTP header to an internal buffer which will be written to the
output stream when either end_headers() or flush_headers() is
invoked. keyword should specify the header keyword, with value
specifying its value. Note that, after the send_header calls are done,
end_headers() MUST BE called in order to complete the operation.

Changed in version 3.2: Headers are stored in an internal buffer.
