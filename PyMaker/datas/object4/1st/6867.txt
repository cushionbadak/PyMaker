FTP.quit()¶
Send a QUIT command to the server and close the connection. This is the
“polite” way to close a connection, but it may raise an exception if the server
responds with an error to the QUIT command.  This implies a call to the
close() method which renders the FTP instance useless for
subsequent calls (see below).
