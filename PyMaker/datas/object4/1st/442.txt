static str.maketrans(x[, y[, z]])Â¶
This static method returns a translation table usable for str.translate().
If there is only one argument, it must be a dictionary mapping Unicode
ordinals (integers) or characters (strings of length 1) to Unicode ordinals,
strings (of arbitrary lengths) or None.  Character keys will then be
converted to ordinals.
If there are two arguments, they must be strings of equal length, and in the
resulting dictionary, each character in x will be mapped to the character at
the same position in y.  If there is a third argument, it must be a string,
whose characters will be mapped to None in the result.
