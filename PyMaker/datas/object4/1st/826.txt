make_file(fromlines, tolines, fromdesc='', todesc='', context=False, numlines=5, *, charset='utf-8')¶
Compares fromlines and tolines (lists of strings) and returns a string which
is a complete HTML file containing a table showing line by line differences with
inter-line and intra-line changes highlighted.
fromdesc and todesc are optional keyword arguments to specify from/to file
column header strings (both default to an empty string).
context and numlines are both optional keyword arguments. Set context to
True when contextual differences are to be shown, else the default is
False to show the full files. numlines defaults to 5.  When context
is True numlines controls the number of context lines which surround the
difference highlights.  When context is False numlines controls the
number of lines which are shown before a difference highlight when using the
“next” hyperlinks (setting to zero would cause the “next” hyperlinks to place
the next difference highlight at the top of the browser without any leading
context).

Changed in version 3.5: charset keyword-only argument was added.  The default charset of
HTML document changed from 'ISO-8859-1' to 'utf-8'.
