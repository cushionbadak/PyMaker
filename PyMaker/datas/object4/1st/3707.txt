curses.init_pair(pair_number, fg, bg)Â¶
Change the definition of a color-pair.  It takes three arguments: the number of
the color-pair to be changed, the foreground color number, and the background
color number.  The value of pair_number must be between 1 and
COLOR_PAIRS - 1 (the 0 color pair is wired to white on black and cannot
be changed).  The value of fg and bg arguments must be between 0 and
COLORS.  If the color-pair was previously initialized, the screen is
refreshed and all occurrences of that color-pair are changed to the new
definition.
