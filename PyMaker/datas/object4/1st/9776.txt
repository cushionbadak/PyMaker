parser.st2list(st, line_info=False, col_info=False)Â¶
This function accepts an ST object from the caller in st and returns a
Python list representing the equivalent parse tree.  The resulting list
representation can be used for inspection or the creation of a new parse tree in
list form.  This function does not fail so long as memory is available to build
the list representation.  If the parse tree will only be used for inspection,
st2tuple() should be used instead to reduce memory consumption and
fragmentation.  When the list representation is required, this function is
significantly faster than retrieving a tuple representation and converting that
to nested lists.
If line_info is true, line number information will be included for all
terminal tokens as a third element of the list representing the token.  Note
that the line number provided specifies the line on which the token ends.
This information is omitted if the flag is false or omitted.
