class smtpd.MailmanProxy(localaddr, remoteaddr)¶
Create a new pure proxy server. Arguments are as per SMTPServer.
Everything will be relayed to remoteaddr, unless local mailman configurations
knows about an address, in which case it will be handled via mailman.  Note that
running this has a good chance to make you into an open relay, so please be
careful.
