docs:


remove(key)¶

__delitem__(key)¶

discard(key)¶
Delete the message corresponding to key from the mailbox.
If no such message exists, a KeyError exception is raised if the
method was called as remove() or __delitem__() but no
exception is raised if the method was called as discard(). The
behavior of discard() may be preferred if the underlying mailbox
format supports concurrent modification by other processes.
