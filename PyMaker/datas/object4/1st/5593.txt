fold(name, value)¶
Header folding is controlled by the refold_source policy setting.
A value is considered to be a ‘source value’ if and only if it does not
have a name attribute (having a name attribute means it is a
header object of some sort).  If a source value needs to be refolded
according to the policy, it is converted into a header object by
passing the name and the value with any CR and LF characters removed
to the header_factory.  Folding of a header object is done by
calling its fold method with the current policy.
Source values are split into lines using splitlines().  If
the value is not to be refolded, the lines are rejoined using the
linesep from the policy and returned.  The exception is lines
containing non-ascii binary data.  In that case the value is refolded
regardless of the refold_source setting, which causes the binary data
to be CTE encoded using the unknown-8bit charset.
