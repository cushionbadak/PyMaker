classmethod datetime.now(tz=None)¶
Return the current local date and time.  If optional argument tz is None
or not specified, this is like today(), but, if possible, supplies more
precision than can be gotten from going through a time.time() timestamp
(for example, this may be possible on platforms supplying the C
gettimeofday() function).
If tz is not None, it must be an instance of a tzinfo subclass, and the
current date and time are converted to tz’s time zone.  In this case the
result is equivalent to tz.fromutc(datetime.utcnow().replace(tzinfo=tz)).
See also today(), utcnow().
