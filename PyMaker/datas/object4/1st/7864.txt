turtle.color(*args)Â¶
Return or set pencolor and fillcolor.
Several input formats are allowed.  They use 0 to 3 arguments as
follows:

color()
Return the current pencolor and the current fillcolor as a pair of color
specification strings or tuples as returned by pencolor() and
fillcolor().
color(colorstring), color((r,g,b)), color(r,g,b)
Inputs as in pencolor(), set both, fillcolor and pencolor, to the
given value.
color(colorstring1, colorstring2), color((r1,g1,b1), (r2,g2,b2))

Equivalent to pencolor(colorstring1) and fillcolor(colorstring2)
and analogously if the other input format is used.
If turtleshape is a polygon, outline and interior of that polygon is drawn
with the newly set colors.
