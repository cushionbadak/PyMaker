@test.support.bigmemtest(size, memuse, dry_run=True)¶
Decorator for bigmem tests.
size is a requested size for the test (in arbitrary, test-interpreted
units.)  memuse is the number of bytes per unit for the test, or a good
estimate of it.  For example, a test that needs two byte buffers, of 4 GiB
each, could be decorated with @bigmemtest(size=_4G, memuse=2).
The size argument is normally passed to the decorated test method as an
extra argument.  If dry_run is True, the value passed to the test
method may be less than the requested value.  If dry_run is False, it
means the test doesn’t support dummy runs when -M is not specified.
