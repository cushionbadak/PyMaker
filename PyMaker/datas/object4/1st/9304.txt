warnings.simplefilter(action, category=Warning, lineno=0, append=False)Â¶
Insert a simple entry into the list of warnings filter specifications.  The meaning of the function parameters is as for
filterwarnings(), but regular expressions are not needed as the filter
inserted always matches any message in any module as long as the category and
line number match.
