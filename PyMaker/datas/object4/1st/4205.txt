<dd><p>Acquire a lock, blocking or non-blocking.</p>
<p>When invoked without arguments: if this thread already owns the lock, increment
the recursion level by one, and return immediately.  Otherwise, if another
thread owns the lock, block until the lock is unlocked.  Once the lock is
unlocked (not owned by any thread), then grab ownership, set the recursion level
to one, and return.  If more than one thread is blocked waiting until the lock
is unlocked, only one at a time will be able to grab ownership of the lock.
There is no return value in this case.</p>
<p>When invoked with the <em>blocking</em> argument set to true, do the same thing as when
called without arguments, and return true.</p>
<p>When invoked with the <em>blocking</em> argument set to false, do not block.  If a call
without an argument would block, return false immediately; otherwise, do the
same thing as when called without arguments, and return true.</p>
<p>When invoked with the floating-point <em>timeout</em> argument set to a positive
value, block for at most the number of seconds specified by <em>timeout</em>
and as long as the lock cannot be acquired.  Return true if the lock has
been acquired, false if the timeout has elapsed.</p>
