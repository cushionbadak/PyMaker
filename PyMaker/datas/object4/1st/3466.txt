ArgumentParser.convert_arg_line_to_args(arg_line)¶
Arguments that are read from a file (see the fromfile_prefix_chars
keyword argument to the ArgumentParser constructor) are read one
argument per line. convert_arg_line_to_args() can be overridden for
fancier reading.
This method takes a single argument arg_line which is a string read from
the argument file.  It returns a list of arguments parsed from this string.
The method is called once per line read from the argument file, in order.
A useful override of this method is one that treats each space-separated word
as an argument.  The following example demonstrates how to do this:
class MyArgumentParser(argparse.ArgumentParser):
    def convert_arg_line_to_args(self, arg_line):
        return arg_line.split()
