docs:


email.message_from_file(fp, _class=None, *, policy=policy.compat32)Â¶
Return a message object structure tree from an open file object.
This is equivalent to Parser().parse(fp).  _class and policy are
interpreted as with the Parser class constructor.

Changed in version 3.3: Removed the strict argument.  Added the policy keyword.


Changed in version 3.6: _class defaults to the policy message_factory.
