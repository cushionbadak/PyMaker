Large File SupportÂ¶
Several operating systems (including AIX, HP-UX, Irix and Solaris) provide
support for files that are larger than 2 GiB from a C programming model where
int and long are 32-bit values. This is typically accomplished
by defining the relevant size and offset types as 64-bit values. Such files are
sometimes referred to as large files.
Large file support is enabled in Python when the size of an off_t is
larger than a long and the long long type is available and is
at least as large as an off_t.
It may be necessary to configure and compile Python with certain compiler flags
to enable this mode. For example, it is enabled by default with recent versions
of Irix, but with Solaris 2.6 and 2.7 you need to do something like:
CFLAGS="`getconf LFS_CFLAGS`" OPT="-g -O2 $CFLAGS" \
        ./configure


On large-file-capable Linux systems, this might work:
CFLAGS='-D_LARGEFILE64_SOURCE -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64' OPT="-g -O2 $CFLAGS" \
        ./configure
