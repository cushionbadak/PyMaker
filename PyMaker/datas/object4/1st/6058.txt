HTMLParser.handle_starttag(tag, attrs)¶
This method is called to handle the start of a tag (e.g. <div id="main">).
The tag argument is the name of the tag converted to lower case. The attrs
argument is a list of (name, value) pairs containing the attributes found
inside the tag’s <> brackets.  The name will be translated to lower case,
and quotes in the value have been removed, and character and entity references
have been replaced.
For instance, for the tag <A HREF="https://www.cwi.nl/">, this method
would be called as handle_starttag('a', [('href', 'https://www.cwi.nl/')]).
All entity references from html.entities are replaced in the attribute
values.
