Command Line Interface¶
Source code: Lib/json/tool.py

The json.tool module provides a simple command line interface to validate
and pretty-print JSON objects.
If the optional infile and outfile arguments are not
specified, sys.stdin and sys.stdout will be used respectively:
$ echo '{"json": "obj"}' | python -m json.tool
{
    "json": "obj"
}
$ echo '{1.2:3.4}' | python -m json.tool
Expecting property name enclosed in double quotes: line 1 column 2 (char 1)



Changed in version 3.5: The output is now in the same order as the input. Use the
--sort-keys option to sort the output of dictionaries
alphabetically by key.


Command line options¶


infile¶
The JSON file to be validated or pretty-printed:
$ python -m json.tool mp_films.json
[
    {
        "title": "And Now for Something Completely Different",
        "year": 1971
    },
    {
        "title": "Monty Python and the Holy Grail",
        "year": 1975
    }
]


If infile is not specified, read from sys.stdin.



outfile¶
Write the output of the infile to the given outfile. Otherwise, write it
to sys.stdout.



--sort-keys¶
Sort the output of dictionaries alphabetically by key.

New in version 3.5.




-h, --help¶

Footnotes



[1]As noted in the errata for RFC 7159,
JSON permits literal U+2028 (LINE SEPARATOR) and
U+2029 (PARAGRAPH SEPARATOR) characters in strings, whereas JavaScript
(as of ECMAScript Edition 5.1) does not.
