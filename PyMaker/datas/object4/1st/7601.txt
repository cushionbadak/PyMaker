AU_write Objects¶
AU_write objects, as returned by open() above, have the following methods:


AU_write.setnchannels(n)¶
Set the number of channels.



AU_write.setsampwidth(n)¶
Set the sample width (in bytes.)

Changed in version 3.4: Added support for 24-bit samples.




AU_write.setframerate(n)¶
Set the frame rate.



AU_write.setnframes(n)¶
Set the number of frames. This can be later changed, when and if more  frames
are written.



AU_write.setcomptype(type, name)¶
Set the compression type and description. Only 'NONE' and 'ULAW' are
supported on output.



AU_write.setparams(tuple)¶
The tuple should be (nchannels, sampwidth, framerate, nframes, comptype,
compname), with values valid for the set*() methods.  Set all
parameters.



AU_write.tell()¶
Return current position in the file, with the same disclaimer for the
AU_read.tell() and AU_read.setpos() methods.



AU_write.writeframesraw(data)¶
Write audio frames, without correcting nframes.

Changed in version 3.4: Any bytes-like object is now accepted.




AU_write.writeframes(data)¶
Write audio frames and make sure nframes is correct.

Changed in version 3.4: Any bytes-like object is now accepted.




AU_write.close()¶
Make sure nframes is correct, and close the file.
This method is called upon deletion.

Note that it is invalid to set any parameters after calling  writeframes()
or writeframesraw().
