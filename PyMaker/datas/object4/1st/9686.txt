importlib.resources.open_text(package, resource, encoding='utf-8', errors='strict')Â¶
Open for text reading the resource within package.  By default, the
resource is opened for reading as UTF-8.
package is either a name or a module object which conforms to the
Package requirements.  resource is the name of the resource to open
within package; it may not contain path separators and it may not have
sub-resources (i.e. it cannot be a directory).  encoding and errors
have the same meaning as with built-in open().
This function returns a typing.TextIO instance, a text I/O stream open
for reading.
