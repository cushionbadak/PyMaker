os.getgroups()Â¶
Return list of supplemental group ids associated with the current process.
Availability: Unix.

Note
On Mac OS X, getgroups() behavior differs somewhat from
other Unix platforms. If the Python interpreter was built with a
deployment target of 10.5 or earlier, getgroups() returns
the list of effective group ids associated with the current user process;
this list is limited to a system-defined number of entries, typically 16,
and may be modified by calls to setgroups() if suitably privileged.
If built with a deployment target greater than 10.5,
getgroups() returns the current group access list for the user
associated with the effective user id of the process; the group access
list may change over the lifetime of the process, it is not affected by
calls to setgroups(), and its length is not limited to 16.  The
deployment target value, MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET, can be
obtained with sysconfig.get_config_var().
