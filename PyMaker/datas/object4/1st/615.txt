Boolean ValuesÂ¶
Boolean values are the two constant objects False and True.  They are
used to represent truth values (although other values can also be considered
false or true).  In numeric contexts (for example when used as the argument to
an arithmetic operator), they behave like the integers 0 and 1, respectively.
The built-in function bool() can be used to convert any value to a
Boolean, if the value can be interpreted as a truth value (see section
Truth Value Testing above).
They are written as False and True, respectively.
