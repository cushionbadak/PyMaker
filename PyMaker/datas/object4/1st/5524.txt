make_mixed(boundary=None)Â¶
Convert a non-multipart, a multipart/related, or a
multipart-alternative into a multipart/mixed, moving any existing
Content- headers and payload into a (new) first part of the
multipart.  If boundary is specified, use it as the boundary string
in the multipart, otherwise leave the boundary to be automatically
created when it is needed (for example, when the message is serialized).
