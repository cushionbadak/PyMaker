Protocol.eof_received()¶
Called when the other end signals it won’t send any more data
(for example by calling transport.write_eof(), if the other end also uses
asyncio).
This method may return a false value (including None), in which case
the transport will close itself.  Conversely, if this method returns a
true value, the protocol used determines whether to close the transport.
Since the default implementation returns None, it implicitly closes the
connection.
Some transports, including SSL, don’t support half-closed connections,
in which case returning true from this method will result in the connection
being closed.
