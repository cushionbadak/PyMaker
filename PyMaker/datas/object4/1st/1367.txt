weakref.proxy(object[, callback])Â¶
Return a proxy to object which uses a weak reference.  This supports use of
the proxy in most contexts instead of requiring the explicit dereferencing used
with weak reference objects.  The returned object will have a type of either
ProxyType or CallableProxyType, depending on whether object is
callable.  Proxy objects are not hashable regardless of the referent; this
avoids a number of problems related to their fundamentally mutable nature, and
prevent their use as dictionary keys.  callback is the same as the parameter
of the same name to the ref() function.
