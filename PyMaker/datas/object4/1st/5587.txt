header_factoryÂ¶
A callable that takes two arguments, name and value, where
name is a header field name and value is an unfolded header field
value, and returns a string subclass that represents that header.  A
default header_factory (see headerregistry) is provided
that supports custom parsing for the various address and date RFC 5322
header field types, and the major MIME header field stypes.  Support for
additional custom parsing will be added in the future.
