ContentHandler.setDocumentLocator(locator)¶
Called by the parser to give the application a locator for locating the origin
of document events.
SAX parsers are strongly encouraged (though not absolutely required) to supply a
locator: if it does so, it must supply the locator to the application by
invoking this method before invoking any of the other methods in the
DocumentHandler interface.
The locator allows the application to determine the end position of any
document-related event, even if the parser is not reporting an error. Typically,
the application will use this information for reporting its own errors (such as
character content that does not match an application’s business rules). The
information returned by the locator is probably not sufficient for use with a
search engine.
Note that the locator will return correct information only during the invocation
of the events in this interface. The application should not attempt to use it at
any other time.
