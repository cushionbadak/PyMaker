curses.mousemask(mousemask)¶
Set the mouse events to be reported, and return a tuple (availmask,
oldmask).   availmask indicates which of the specified mouse events can be
reported; on complete failure it returns 0.  oldmask is the previous value of
the given window’s mouse event mask.  If this function is never called, no mouse
events are ever reported.
