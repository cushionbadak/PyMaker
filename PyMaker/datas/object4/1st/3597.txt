class logging.handlers.WatchedFileHandler(filename, mode='a', encoding=None, delay=False)¶
Returns a new instance of the WatchedFileHandler class. The specified
file is opened and used as the stream for logging. If mode is not specified,
'a' is used.  If encoding is not None, it is used to open the file
with that encoding.  If delay is true, then file opening is deferred until the
first call to emit().  By default, the file grows indefinitely.

Changed in version 3.6: As well as string values, Path objects are also accepted
for the filename argument.



reopenIfNeeded()¶
Checks to see if the file has changed.  If it has, the existing stream is
flushed and closed and the file opened again, typically as a precursor to
outputting the record to the file.

New in version 3.6.




emit(record)¶
Outputs the record to the file, but first calls reopenIfNeeded() to
reopen the file if it has changed.
