os.setgroups(groups)Â¶
Set the list of supplemental group ids associated with the current process to
groups. groups must be a sequence, and each element must be an integer
identifying a group. This operation is typically available only to the superuser.
Availability: Unix.

Note
On Mac OS X, the length of groups may not exceed the
system-defined maximum number of effective group ids, typically 16.
See the documentation for getgroups() for cases where it may not
return the same group list set by calling setgroups().
