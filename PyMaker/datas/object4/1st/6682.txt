ProxyHandler ObjectsÂ¶


ProxyHandler.<protocol>_open(request)
The ProxyHandler will have a method <protocol>_open() for every
protocol which has a proxy in the proxies dictionary given in the
constructor.  The method will modify requests to go through the proxy, by
calling request.set_proxy(), and call the next handler in the chain to
actually execute the protocol.
