signal.getsignal(signalnum)Â¶
Return the current signal handler for the signal signalnum. The returned value
may be a callable Python object, or one of the special values
signal.SIG_IGN, signal.SIG_DFL or None.  Here,
signal.SIG_IGN means that the signal was previously ignored,
signal.SIG_DFL means that the default way of handling the signal was
previously in use, and None means that the previous signal handler was not
installed from Python.
