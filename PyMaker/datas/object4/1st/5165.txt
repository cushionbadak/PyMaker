ssl.CERT_REQUIREDÂ¶
Possible value for SSLContext.verify_mode, or the cert_reqs
parameter to wrap_socket().  In this mode, certificates are
required from the other side of the socket connection; an SSLError
will be raised if no certificate is provided, or if its validation fails.
This mode is not sufficient to verify a certificate in client mode as
it does not match hostnames.  check_hostname must be
enabled as well to verify the authenticity of a cert.
PROTOCOL_TLS_CLIENT uses CERT_REQUIRED and
enables check_hostname by default.
With server socket, this mode provides mandatory TLS client cert
authentication.  A client certificate request is sent to the client and
the client must provide a valid and trusted certificate.
Use of this setting requires a valid set of CA certificates to
be passed, either to SSLContext.load_verify_locations() or as a
value of the ca_certs parameter to wrap_socket().
