What WWW tools are there for Python?Â¶
See the chapters titled Internet Protocols and Support and Internet Data Handling in the Library
Reference Manual.  Python has many modules that will help you build server-side
and client-side web systems.
A summary of available frameworks is maintained by Paul Boddie at
https://wiki.python.org/moin/WebProgramming.
Cameron Laird maintains a useful set of pages about Python web technologies at
http://phaseit.net/claird/comp.lang.python/web_python.
