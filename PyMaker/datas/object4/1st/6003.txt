base64.encodebytes(s)Â¶
Encode the bytes-like object s, which can contain arbitrary binary
data, and return bytes containing the base64-encoded data, with newlines
(b'\n') inserted after every 76 bytes of output, and ensuring that
there is a trailing newline, as per RFC 2045 (MIME).

New in version 3.1.
