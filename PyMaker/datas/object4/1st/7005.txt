NNTP.xhdr(hdr, str, *, file=None)Â¶
Send an XHDR command.  The hdr argument is a header keyword, e.g.
'subject'.  The str argument should have the form 'first-last'
where first and last are the first and last article numbers to search.
Return a pair (response, list), where list is a list of pairs (id,
text), where id is an article number (as a string) and text is the text of
the requested header for that article. If the file parameter is supplied, then
the output of the  XHDR command is stored in a file.  If file is a string,
then the method will open a file with that name, write to it  then close it.
If file is a file object, then it will start calling write() on
it to store the lines of the command output. If file is supplied, then the
returned list is an empty list.
