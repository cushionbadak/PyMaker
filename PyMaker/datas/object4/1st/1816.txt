Functions for integers¶


random.randrange(stop)¶

random.randrange(start, stop[, step])
Return a randomly selected element from range(start, stop, step).  This is
equivalent to choice(range(start, stop, step)), but doesn’t actually build a
range object.
The positional argument pattern matches that of range().  Keyword arguments
should not be used because the function may use them in unexpected ways.

Changed in version 3.2: randrange() is more sophisticated about producing equally distributed
values.  Formerly it used a style like int(random()*n) which could produce
slightly uneven distributions.




random.randint(a, b)¶
Return a random integer N such that a <= N <= b.  Alias for
randrange(a, b+1).
