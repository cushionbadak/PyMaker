FTP_TLS Objects¶
FTP_TLS class inherits from FTP, defining these additional objects:


FTP_TLS.ssl_version¶
The SSL version to use (defaults to ssl.PROTOCOL_SSLv23).



FTP_TLS.auth()¶
Set up a secure control connection by using TLS or SSL, depending on what
is specified in the ssl_version attribute.

Changed in version 3.4: The method now supports hostname check with
ssl.SSLContext.check_hostname and Server Name Indication (see
ssl.HAS_SNI).




FTP_TLS.ccc()¶
Revert control channel back to plaintext.  This can be useful to take
advantage of firewalls that know how to handle NAT with non-secure FTP
without opening fixed ports.

New in version 3.3.




FTP_TLS.prot_p()¶
Set up secure data connection.



FTP_TLS.prot_c()¶
Set up clear text data connection.
