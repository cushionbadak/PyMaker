poll.register(fd[, eventmask])¶
Register a file descriptor with the polling object.  Future calls to the
poll() method will then check whether the file descriptor has any
pending I/O events.  fd can be either an integer, or an object with a
fileno() method that returns an integer.  File objects
implement fileno(), so they can also be used as the argument.
eventmask is an optional bitmask describing the type of events you want to
check for, and can be a combination of the constants POLLIN,
POLLPRI, and POLLOUT, described in the table below.  If not
specified, the default value used will check for all 3 types of events.






Constant
Meaning



POLLIN
There is data to read

POLLPRI
There is urgent data to read

POLLOUT
Ready for output: writing will not block

POLLERR
Error condition of some sort

POLLHUP
Hung up

POLLRDHUP
Stream socket peer closed connection, or
shut down writing half of connection

POLLNVAL
Invalid request: descriptor not open



Registering a file descriptor that’s already registered is not an error, and has
the same effect as registering the descriptor exactly once.
