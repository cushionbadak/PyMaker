tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(mode='w+b', buffering=None, encoding=None, newline=None, suffix=None, prefix=None, dir=None, delete=True)Â¶
This function operates exactly as TemporaryFile() does, except that
the file is guaranteed to have a visible name in the file system (on
Unix, the directory entry is not unlinked).  That name can be retrieved
from the name attribute of the returned
file-like object.  Whether the name can be
used to open the file a second time, while the named temporary file is
still open, varies across platforms (it can be so used on Unix; it cannot
on Windows NT or later).  If delete is true (the default), the file is
deleted as soon as it is closed.
The returned object is always a file-like object whose file
attribute is the underlying true file object. This file-like object can
be used in a with statement, just like a normal file.
