object.__get__(self, instance, owner)¶
Called to get the attribute of the owner class (class attribute access) or of an
instance of that class (instance attribute access). owner is always the owner
class, while instance is the instance that the attribute was accessed through,
or None when the attribute is accessed through the owner.  This method
should return the (computed) attribute value or raise an AttributeError
exception.
