path_mtime(path)¶
Optional abstract method which returns the modification time for the
specified path.

Deprecated since version 3.3: This method is deprecated in favour of path_stats().  You don’t
have to implement it, but it is still available for compatibility
purposes. Raise OSError if the path cannot be handled.


Changed in version 3.4: Raise OSError instead of NotImplementedError.
