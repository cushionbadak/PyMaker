gettext.find(domain, localedir=None, languages=None, all=False)Â¶
This function implements the standard .mo file search algorithm.  It
takes a domain, identical to what textdomain() takes.  Optional
localedir is as in bindtextdomain(). Optional languages is a list of
strings, where each string is a language code.
If localedir is not given, then the default system locale directory is used.
[2]  If languages is not given, then the following environment variables are
searched: LANGUAGE, LC_ALL, LC_MESSAGES, and
LANG.  The first one returning a non-empty value is used for the
languages variable. The environment variables should contain a colon separated
list of languages, which will be split on the colon to produce the expected list
of language code strings.
find() then expands and normalizes the languages, and then iterates
through them, searching for an existing file built of these components:
localedir/language/LC_MESSAGES/domain.mo
The first such file name that exists is returned by find(). If no such
file is found, then None is returned. If all is given, it returns a list
of all file names, in the order in which they appear in the languages list or
the environment variables.
