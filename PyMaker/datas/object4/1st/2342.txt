ExampleÂ¶
The example below would like to show how to register a pickle function and how
it will be used:
>>> import copyreg, copy, pickle
>>> class C(object):
...     def __init__(self, a):
...         self.a = a
...
>>> def pickle_c(c):
...     print("pickling a C instance...")
...     return C, (c.a,)
...
>>> copyreg.pickle(C, pickle_c)
>>> c = C(1)
>>> d = copy.copy(c)  # doctest: +SKIP
pickling a C instance...
>>> p = pickle.dumps(c)  # doctest: +SKIP
pickling a C instance...
