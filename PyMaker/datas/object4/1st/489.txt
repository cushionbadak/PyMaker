bytes.rfind(sub[, start[, end]])¶

bytearray.rfind(sub[, start[, end]])¶
Return the highest index in the sequence where the subsequence sub is
found, such that sub is contained within s[start:end].  Optional
arguments start and end are interpreted as in slice notation. Return
-1 on failure.
The subsequence to search for may be any bytes-like object or an
integer in the range 0 to 255.

Changed in version 3.3: Also accept an integer in the range 0 to 255 as the subsequence.
