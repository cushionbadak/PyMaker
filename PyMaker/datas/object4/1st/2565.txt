ZipInfo Objects¶
Instances of the ZipInfo class are returned by the getinfo() and
infolist() methods of ZipFile objects.  Each object stores
information about a single member of the ZIP archive.
There is one classmethod to make a ZipInfo instance for a filesystem
file:


classmethod ZipInfo.from_file(filename, arcname=None)¶
Construct a ZipInfo instance for a file on the filesystem, in
preparation for adding it to a zip file.
filename should be the path to a file or directory on the filesystem.
If arcname is specified, it is used as the name within the archive.
If arcname is not specified, the name will be the same as filename, but
with any drive letter and leading path separators removed.

New in version 3.6.


Changed in version 3.6.2: The filename parameter accepts a path-like object.


Instances have the following methods and attributes:


ZipInfo.is_dir()¶
Return True if this archive member is a directory.
This uses the entry’s name: directories should always end with /.

New in version 3.6.




ZipInfo.filename¶
Name of the file in the archive.



ZipInfo.date_time¶
