run(result=None)¶
Run the test, collecting the result into the TestResult object
passed as result.  If result is omitted or None, a temporary
result object is created (by calling the defaultTestResult()
method) and used. The result object is returned to run()’s
caller.
The same effect may be had by simply calling the TestCase
instance.

Changed in version 3.3: Previous versions of run did not return the result. Neither did
calling an instance.
