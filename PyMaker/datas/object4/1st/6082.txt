XML tree and elementsÂ¶
XML is an inherently hierarchical data format, and the most natural way to
represent it is with a tree.  ET has two classes for this purpose -
ElementTree represents the whole XML document as a tree, and
Element represents a single node in this tree.  Interactions with
the whole document (reading and writing to/from files) are usually done
on the ElementTree level.  Interactions with a single XML element
and its sub-elements are done on the Element level.
