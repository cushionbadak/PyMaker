os.environ¶
A mapping object representing the string environment. For example,
environ['HOME'] is the pathname of your home directory (on some platforms),
and is equivalent to getenv("HOME") in C.
This mapping is captured the first time the os module is imported,
typically during Python startup as part of processing site.py.  Changes
to the environment made after this time are not reflected in os.environ,
except for changes made by modifying os.environ directly.
If the platform supports the putenv() function, this mapping may be used
to modify the environment as well as query the environment.  putenv() will
be called automatically when the mapping is modified.
On Unix, keys and values use sys.getfilesystemencoding() and
'surrogateescape' error handler. Use environb if you would like
to use a different encoding.

Note
Calling putenv() directly does not change os.environ, so it’s better
to modify os.environ.


Note
On some platforms, including FreeBSD and Mac OS X, setting environ may
cause memory leaks.  Refer to the system documentation for
putenv().

If putenv() is not provided, a modified copy of this mapping  may be
passed to the appropriate process-creation functions to cause  child processes
to use a modified environment.
If the platform supports the unsetenv() function, you can delete items in
this mapping to unset environment variables. unsetenv() will be called
automatically when an item is deleted from os.environ, and when
one of the pop() or clear() methods is called.
