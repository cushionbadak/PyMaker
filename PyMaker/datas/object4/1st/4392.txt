Address FormatsÂ¶

An 'AF_INET' address is a tuple of the form (hostname, port) where
hostname is a string and port is an integer.
An 'AF_UNIX' address is a string representing a filename on the
filesystem.

An 'AF_PIPE' address is a string of the form
r'\\.\pipe{PipeName}'.  To use Client() to connect to a named
pipe on a remote computer called ServerName one should use an address of the
form r'\ServerName\pipe{PipeName}' instead.



Note that any string beginning with two backslashes is assumed by default to be
an 'AF_PIPE' address rather than an 'AF_UNIX' address.
