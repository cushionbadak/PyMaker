classmethod find_spec(fullname, path=None, target=None)¶
Class method that attempts to find a spec
for the module specified by fullname on sys.path or, if
defined, on path. For each path entry that is searched,
sys.path_importer_cache is checked. If a non-false object
is found then it is used as the path entry finder to look
for the module being searched for. If no entry is found in
sys.path_importer_cache, then sys.path_hooks is
searched for a finder for the path entry and, if found, is stored
in sys.path_importer_cache along with being queried about
the module. If no finder is ever found then None is both
stored in the cache and returned.

New in version 3.4.


Changed in version 3.5: If the current working directory – represented by an empty string –
is no longer valid then None is returned but no value is cached
in sys.path_importer_cache.
