writer.new_font(font)¶
Set the font style.  The value of font will be None, indicating that the
device’s default font should be used, or a tuple of the form (size,
italic, bold, teletype).  Size will be a string indicating the size of
font that should be used; specific strings and their interpretation must be
defined by the application.  The italic, bold, and teletype values are
Boolean values specifying which of those font attributes should be used.
