Unix Platforms¶


platform.dist(distname='', version='', id='', supported_dists=('SuSE', 'debian', 'redhat', 'mandrake', ...))¶
This is another name for linux_distribution().

Deprecated since version 3.5, will be removed in version 3.8: See alternative like the distro package.




platform.linux_distribution(distname='', version='', id='', supported_dists=('SuSE', 'debian', 'redhat', 'mandrake', ...), full_distribution_name=1)¶
Tries to determine the name of the Linux OS distribution name.
supported_dists may be given to define the set of Linux distributions to
look for. It defaults to a list of currently supported Linux distributions
identified by their release file name.
If full_distribution_name is true (default), the full distribution read
from the OS is returned. Otherwise the short name taken from
supported_dists is used.
Returns a tuple (distname,version,id) which defaults to the args given as
parameters.  id is the item in parentheses after the version number.  It
is usually the version codename.

Deprecated since version 3.5, will be removed in version 3.8: See alternative like the distro package.




platform.libc_ver(executable=sys.executable, lib='', version='', chunksize=16384)¶
Tries to determine the libc version against which the file executable (defaults
to the Python interpreter) is linked.  Returns a tuple of strings (lib,
version) which default to the given parameters in case the lookup fails.
Note that this function has intimate knowledge of how different libc versions
add symbols to the executable is probably only usable for executables compiled
using gcc.
The file is read and scanned in chunks of chunksize bytes.
