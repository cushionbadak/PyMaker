docs:


contextlib.closing(thing)Â¶
Return a context manager that closes thing upon completion of the block.  This
is basically equivalent to:
from contextlib import contextmanager

@contextmanager
def closing(thing):
    try:
        yield thing
    finally:
        thing.close()


And lets you write code like this:
from contextlib import closing
from urllib.request import urlopen

with closing(urlopen('http://www.python.org')) as page:
    for line in page:
        print(line)


without needing to explicitly close page.  Even if an error occurs,
page.close() will be called when the with block is exited.
