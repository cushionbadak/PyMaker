tempfile.mkdtemp(suffix=None, prefix=None, dir=None)¶
Creates a temporary directory in the most secure manner possible. There
are no race conditions in the directory’s creation.  The directory is
readable, writable, and searchable only by the creating user ID.
The user of mkdtemp() is responsible for deleting the temporary
directory and its contents when done with it.
The prefix, suffix, and dir arguments are the same as for
mkstemp().
mkdtemp() returns the absolute pathname of the new directory.

Changed in version 3.5: suffix, prefix, and dir may now be supplied in bytes in order to
obtain a bytes return value.  Prior to this, only str was allowed.
suffix and prefix now accept and default to None to cause
an appropriate default value to be used.
