FunctionsÂ¶
Function objects are created by function definitions.  The only operation on a
function object is to call it: func(argument-list).
There are really two flavors of function objects: built-in functions and
user-defined functions.  Both support the same operation (to call the function),
but the implementation is different, hence the different object types.
See Function definitions for more information.
