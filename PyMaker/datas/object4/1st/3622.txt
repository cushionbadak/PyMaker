<dd><p>Tries to create a socket; on failure, uses an exponential back-off
algorithm.  On initial failure, the handler will drop the message it was
trying to send.  When subsequent messages are handled by the same
instance, it will not try connecting until some time has passed.  The
default parameters are such that the initial delay is one second, and if
after that delay the connection still can’t be made, the handler will
double the delay each time up to a maximum of 30 seconds.</p>
<p>This behaviour is controlled by the following handler attributes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">retryStart</span></code> (initial delay, defaulting to 1.0 seconds).</li>
<li><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">retryFactor</span></code> (multiplier, defaulting to 2.0).</li>
<li><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">retryMax</span></code> (maximum delay, defaulting to 30.0 seconds).</li>
</ul>
<p>This means that if the remote listener starts up <em>after</em> the handler has
been used, you could lose messages (since the handler won’t even attempt
a connection until the delay has elapsed, but just silently drop messages
during the delay period).</p>
