shutil.make_archive(base_name, format[, root_dir[, base_dir[, verbose[, dry_run[, owner[, group[, logger]]]]]]])¶
Create an archive file (such as zip or tar) and return its name.
base_name is the name of the file to create, including the path, minus
any format-specific extension. format is the archive format: one of
“zip” (if the zlib module is available), “tar”, “gztar” (if the
zlib module is available), “bztar” (if the bz2 module is
available), or “xztar” (if the lzma module is available).
root_dir is a directory that will be the root directory of the
archive; for example, we typically chdir into root_dir before creating the
archive.
base_dir is the directory where we start archiving from;
i.e. base_dir will be the common prefix of all files and
directories in the archive.
root_dir and base_dir both default to the current directory.
If dry_run is true, no archive is created, but the operations that would be
executed are logged to logger.
owner and group are used when creating a tar archive. By default,
uses the current owner and group.
logger must be an object compatible with PEP 282, usually an instance of
logging.Logger.
The verbose argument is unused and deprecated.
