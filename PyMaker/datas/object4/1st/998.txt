codecs.iterencode(iterator, encoding, errors='strict', **kwargs)Â¶
Uses an incremental encoder to iteratively encode the input provided by
iterator. This function is a generator.
The errors argument (as well as any
other keyword argument) is passed through to the incremental encoder.
This function requires that the codec accept text str objects
to encode. Therefore it does not support bytes-to-bytes encoders such as
base64_codec.
