os.times()Â¶
Returns the current global process times.
The return value is an object with five attributes:

user - user time
system - system time
children_user - user time of all child processes
children_system - system time of all child processes
elapsed - elapsed real time since a fixed point in the past

For backwards compatibility, this object also behaves like a five-tuple
containing user, system, children_user,
children_system, and elapsed in that order.
See the Unix manual page
times(2) or the corresponding Windows Platform API documentation.
On Windows, only user and system are known; the other
attributes are zero.
Availability: Unix, Windows.

Changed in version 3.3: Return type changed from a tuple to a tuple-like object
with named attributes.
