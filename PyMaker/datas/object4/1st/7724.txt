gettext.translation(domain, localedir=None, languages=None, class_=None, fallback=False, codeset=None)¶
Return a *Translations instance based on the domain, localedir,
and languages, which are first passed to find() to get a list of the
associated .mo file paths.  Instances with identical .mo file
names are cached.  The actual class instantiated is class_ if
provided, otherwise GNUTranslations.  The class’s constructor must
take a single file object argument.  If provided, codeset will change
the charset used to encode translated strings in the
lgettext() and lngettext()
methods.
If multiple files are found, later files are used as fallbacks for earlier ones.
To allow setting the fallback, copy.copy() is used to clone each
translation object from the cache; the actual instance data is still shared with
the cache.
If no .mo file is found, this function raises OSError if
fallback is false (which is the default), and returns a
NullTranslations instance if fallback is true.

Changed in version 3.3: IOError used to be raised instead of OSError.
