Alternative Generator¶


class random.Random([seed])¶
Class that implements the default pseudo-random number generator used by the
random module.



class random.SystemRandom([seed])¶
Class that uses the os.urandom() function for generating random numbers
from sources provided by the operating system. Not available on all systems.
Does not rely on software state, and sequences are not reproducible. Accordingly,
the seed() method has no effect and is ignored.
The getstate() and setstate() methods raise
NotImplementedError if called.
