Image TypesÂ¶
The tkinter.tix module adds:

pixmap
capabilities to all tkinter.tix and tkinter widgets to create
color images from XPM files.
Compound image
types can be used to create images that consists of multiple horizontal lines;
each line is composed of a series of items (texts, bitmaps, images or spaces)
arranged from left to right. For example, a compound image can be used to
display a bitmap and a text string simultaneously in a Tk Button
widget.
