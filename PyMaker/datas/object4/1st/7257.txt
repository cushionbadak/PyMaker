FileCookieJar.save(filename=None, ignore_discard=False, ignore_expires=False)Â¶
Save cookies to a file.
This base class raises NotImplementedError.  Subclasses may leave this
method unimplemented.
filename is the name of file in which to save cookies.  If filename is not
specified, self.filename is used (whose default is the value passed to
the constructor, if any); if self.filename is None,
ValueError is raised.
ignore_discard: save even cookies set to be discarded. ignore_expires: save
even cookies that have expired
The file is overwritten if it already exists, thus wiping all the cookies it
contains.  Saved cookies can be restored later using the load() or
revert() methods.
