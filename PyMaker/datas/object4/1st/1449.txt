PrettyPrinter.format(object, context, maxlevels, level)Â¶
Returns three values: the formatted version of object as a string, a flag
indicating whether the result is readable, and a flag indicating whether
recursion was detected.  The first argument is the object to be presented.  The
second is a dictionary which contains the id() of objects that are part of
the current presentation context (direct and indirect containers for object
that are affecting the presentation) as the keys; if an object needs to be
presented which is already represented in context, the third return value
should be True.  Recursive calls to the format() method should add
additional entries for containers to this dictionary.  The third argument,
maxlevels, gives the requested limit to recursion; this will be 0 if there
is no requested limit.  This argument should be passed unmodified to recursive
calls. The fourth argument, level, gives the current level; recursive calls
should be passed a value less than that of the current call.
