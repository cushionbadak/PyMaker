CookiePolicy.domain_return_ok(domain, request)Â¶
Return false if cookies should not be returned, given cookie domain.
This method is an optimization.  It removes the need for checking every cookie
with a particular domain (which might involve reading many files).  Returning
true from domain_return_ok() and path_return_ok() leaves all the
work to return_ok().
If domain_return_ok() returns true for the cookie domain,
path_return_ok() is called for the cookie path.  Otherwise,
path_return_ok() and return_ok() are never called for that cookie
domain.  If path_return_ok() returns true, return_ok() is called
with the Cookie object itself for a full check.  Otherwise,
return_ok() is never called for that cookie path.
Note that domain_return_ok() is called for every cookie domain, not just
for the request domain.  For example, the function might be called with both
".example.com" and "www.example.com" if the request domain is
"www.example.com".  The same goes for path_return_ok().
The request argument is as documented for return_ok().
