macOSÂ¶
Modern macOS versions are fully supported.
macOS <= 10.8
On macOS 10.6, 10.7 and 10.8, the default event loop
uses selectors.KqueueSelector, which does not support
character devices on these versions.  The SelectorEventLoop
can be manually configured to use SelectSelector
or PollSelector to support character devices on
these older versions of macOS.  Example:
import asyncio
import selectors

selector = selectors.SelectSelector()
loop = asyncio.SelectorEventLoop(selector)
asyncio.set_event_loop(loop)
