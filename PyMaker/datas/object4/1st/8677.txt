idiomsÂ¶
This optional fixer performs several transformations that make Python code
more idiomatic.  Type comparisons like type(x) is SomeClass and
type(x) == SomeClass are converted to isinstance(x, SomeClass).
while 1 becomes while True.  This fixer also tries to make use of
sorted() in appropriate places.  For example, this block
L = list(some_iterable)
L.sort()


is changed to
L = sorted(some_iterable)
