socket.socketpair([family[, type[, proto]]])Â¶
Build a pair of connected socket objects using the given address family, socket
type, and protocol number.  Address family, socket type, and protocol number are
as for the socket() function above. The default family is AF_UNIX
if defined on the platform; otherwise, the default is AF_INET.
The newly created sockets are non-inheritable.

Changed in version 3.2: The returned socket objects now support the whole socket API, rather
than a subset.


Changed in version 3.4: The returned sockets are now non-inheritable.


Changed in version 3.5: Windows support added.
