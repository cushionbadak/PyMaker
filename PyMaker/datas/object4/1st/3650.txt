class logging.handlers.MemoryHandler(capacity, flushLevel=ERROR, target=None, flushOnClose=True)¶
Returns a new instance of the MemoryHandler class. The instance is
initialized with a buffer size of capacity. If flushLevel is not specified,
ERROR is used. If no target is specified, the target will need to be
set using setTarget() before this handler does anything useful. If
flushOnClose is specified as False, then the buffer is not flushed when
the handler is closed. If not specified or specified as True, the previous
behaviour of flushing the buffer will occur when the handler is closed.

Changed in version 3.6: The flushOnClose parameter was added.



close()¶
Calls flush(), sets the target to None and clears the
buffer.



flush()¶
For a MemoryHandler, flushing means just sending the buffered
records to the target, if there is one. The buffer is also cleared when
this happens. Override if you want different behavior.



setTarget(target)¶
Sets the target handler for this handler.



shouldFlush(record)¶
Checks for buffer full or a record at the flushLevel or higher.
