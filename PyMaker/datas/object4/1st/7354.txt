SimpleXMLRPCServer.register_instance(instance, allow_dotted_names=False)¶
Register an object which is used to expose method names which have not been
registered using register_function().  If instance contains a
_dispatch() method, it is called with the requested method name and the
parameters from the request.  Its API is def _dispatch(self, method, params)
(note that params does not represent a variable argument list).  If it calls
an underlying function to perform its task, that function is called as
func(*params), expanding the parameter list. The return value from
_dispatch() is returned to the client as the result.  If instance does
not have a _dispatch() method, it is searched for an attribute matching
the name of the requested method.
If the optional allow_dotted_names argument is true and the instance does not
have a _dispatch() method, then if the requested method name contains
periods, each component of the method name is searched for individually, with
the effect that a simple hierarchical search is performed.  The value found from
this search is then called with the parameters from the request, and the return
value is passed back to the client.

Warning
Enabling the allow_dotted_names option allows intruders to access your
module’s global variables and may allow intruders to execute arbitrary code on
your machine.  Only use this option on a secure, closed network.
