os.path.expanduser(path)¶
On Unix and Windows, return the argument with an initial component of ~ or
~user replaced by that user’s home directory.
On Unix, an initial ~ is replaced by the environment variable HOME
if it is set; otherwise the current user’s home directory is looked up in the
password directory through the built-in module pwd. An initial ~user
is looked up directly in the password directory.
On Windows, HOME and USERPROFILE will be used if set,
otherwise a combination of HOMEPATH and HOMEDRIVE will be
used.  An initial ~user is handled by stripping the last directory component
from the created user path derived above.
If the expansion fails or if the path does not begin with a tilde, the path is
returned unchanged.

Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a path-like object.
