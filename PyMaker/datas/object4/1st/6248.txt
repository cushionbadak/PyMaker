NamedNodeMap Objects¶
NamedNodeMap does not inherit from Node.


NamedNodeMap.length¶
The length of the attribute list.



NamedNodeMap.item(index)¶
Return an attribute with a particular index.  The order you get the attributes
in is arbitrary but will be consistent for the life of a DOM.  Each item is an
attribute node.  Get its value with the value attribute.

There are also experimental methods that give this class more mapping behavior.
You can use them or you can use the standardized getAttribute*() family
of methods on the Element objects.
