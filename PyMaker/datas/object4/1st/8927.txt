Fault handler state¶


faulthandler.enable(file=sys.stderr, all_threads=True)¶
Enable the fault handler: install handlers for the SIGSEGV,
SIGFPE, SIGABRT, SIGBUS and SIGILL
signals to dump the Python traceback. If all_threads is True,
produce tracebacks for every running thread. Otherwise, dump only the current
thread.
The file must be kept open until the fault handler is disabled: see
issue with file descriptors.

Changed in version 3.5: Added support for passing file descriptor to this function.


Changed in version 3.6: On Windows, a handler for Windows exception is also installed.




faulthandler.disable()¶
Disable the fault handler: uninstall the signal handlers installed by
enable().



faulthandler.is_enabled()¶
Check if the fault handler is enabled.
