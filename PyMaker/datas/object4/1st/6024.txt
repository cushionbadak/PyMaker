binascii.crc32(data[, value])Â¶
Compute CRC-32, the 32-bit checksum of data, starting with an
initial CRC of value.  The default initial CRC is zero.  The algorithm
is consistent with the ZIP file checksum.  Since the algorithm is designed for
use as a checksum algorithm, it is not suitable for use as a general hash
algorithm.  Use as follows:
print(binascii.crc32(b"hello world"))
# Or, in two pieces:
crc = binascii.crc32(b"hello")
crc = binascii.crc32(b" world", crc)
print('crc32 = {:#010x}'.format(crc))



Changed in version 3.0: The result is always unsigned.
To generate the same numeric value across all Python versions and
platforms, use crc32(data) & 0xffffffff.
