os.mkdir(path, mode=0o777, *, dir_fd=None)¶
Create a directory named path with numeric mode mode.
If the directory already exists, FileExistsError is raised.
On some systems, mode is ignored.  Where it is used, the current umask
value is first masked out.  If bits other than the last 9 (i.e. the last 3
digits of the octal representation of the mode) are set, their meaning is
platform-dependent.  On some platforms, they are ignored and you should call
chmod() explicitly to set them.
This function can also support paths relative to directory descriptors.
It is also possible to create temporary directories; see the
tempfile module’s tempfile.mkdtemp() function.

New in version 3.3: The dir_fd argument.


Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a path-like object.
