socket.gethostbyname_ex(hostname)Â¶
Translate a host name to IPv4 address format, extended interface. Return a
triple (hostname, aliaslist, ipaddrlist) where hostname is the primary
host name responding to the given ip_address, aliaslist is a (possibly
empty) list of alternative host names for the same address, and ipaddrlist is
a list of IPv4 addresses for the same interface on the same host (often but not
always a single address). gethostbyname_ex() does not support IPv6 name
resolution, and getaddrinfo() should be used instead for IPv4/v6 dual
stack support.
