select.epoll(sizehint=-1, flags=0)Â¶
(Only supported on Linux 2.5.44 and newer.) Return an edge polling object,
which can be used as Edge or Level Triggered interface for I/O
events.
sizehint informs epoll about the expected number of events to be
registered.  It must be positive, or -1 to use the default. It is only
used on older systems where epoll_create1() is not available;
otherwise it has no effect (though its value is still checked).
flags is deprecated and completely ignored.  However, when supplied, its
value must be 0 or select.EPOLL_CLOEXEC, otherwise OSError is
raised.
See the Edge and Level Trigger Polling (epoll) Objects section below for the methods supported by
epolling objects.
epoll objects support the context management protocol: when used in a
with statement, the new file descriptor is automatically closed
at the end of the block.
The new file descriptor is non-inheritable.

Changed in version 3.3: Added the flags parameter.


Changed in version 3.4: Support for the with statement was added.
The new file descriptor is now non-inheritable.


Deprecated since version 3.4: The flags parameter.  select.EPOLL_CLOEXEC is used by default now.
Use os.set_inheritable() to make the file descriptor inheritable.
