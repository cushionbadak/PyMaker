tearDown()Â¶
Method called immediately after the test method has been called and the
result recorded.  This is called even if the test method raised an
exception, so the implementation in subclasses may need to be particularly
careful about checking internal state.  Any exception, other than
AssertionError or SkipTest, raised by this method will be
considered an additional error rather than a test failure (thus increasing
the total number of reported errors). This method will only be called if
the setUp() succeeds, regardless of the outcome of the test method.
The default implementation does nothing.
