statistics.pvariance(data, mu=None)¶
Return the population variance of data, a non-empty iterable of real-valued
numbers.  Variance, or second moment about the mean, is a measure of the
variability (spread or dispersion) of data.  A large variance indicates that
the data is spread out; a small variance indicates it is clustered closely
around the mean.
If the optional second argument mu is given, it should be the mean of
data.  If it is missing or None (the default), the mean is
automatically calculated.
Use this function to calculate the variance from the entire population.  To
estimate the variance from a sample, the variance() function is usually
a better choice.
Raises StatisticsError if data is empty.
Examples:
>>> data = [0.0, 0.25, 0.25, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2.75, 3.25]
>>> pvariance(data)
1.25


If you have already calculated the mean of your data, you can pass it as the
optional second argument mu to avoid recalculation:
>>> mu = mean(data)
>>> pvariance(data, mu)
1.25


This function does not attempt to verify that you have passed the actual mean
as mu.  Using arbitrary values for mu may lead to invalid or impossible
results.
Decimals and Fractions are supported:
>>> from decimal import Decimal as D
>>> pvariance([D("27.5"), D("30.25"), D("30.25"), D("34.5"), D("41.75")])
Decimal('24.815')

>>> from fractions import Fraction as F
>>> pvariance([F(1, 4), F(5, 4), F(1, 2)])
Fraction(13, 72)



Note
When called with the entire population, this gives the population variance
σ².  When called on a sample instead, this is the biased sample variance
s², also known as variance with N degrees of freedom.
If you somehow know the true population mean μ, you may use this function
to calculate the variance of a sample, giving the known population mean as
the second argument.  Provided the data points are representative
(e.g. independent and identically distributed), the result will be an
unbiased estimate of the population variance.
