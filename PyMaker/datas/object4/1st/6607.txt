origin_server¶
This attribute should be set to a true value if the handler’s _write() and
_flush() are being used to communicate directly to the client, rather than
via a CGI-like gateway protocol that wants the HTTP status in a special
Status: header.
This attribute’s default value is true in BaseHandler, but false in
BaseCGIHandler and CGIHandler.
