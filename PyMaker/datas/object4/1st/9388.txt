traceback.format_exception_only(etype, value)Â¶
Format the exception part of a traceback.  The arguments are the exception
type and value such as given by sys.last_type and sys.last_value.
The return value is a list of strings, each ending in a newline.  Normally,
the list contains a single string; however, for SyntaxError
exceptions, it contains several lines that (when printed) display detailed
information about where the syntax error occurred.  The message indicating
which exception occurred is the always last string in the list.
