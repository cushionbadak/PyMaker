FTP.nlst(argument[, ...])Â¶
Return a list of file names as returned by the NLST command.  The
optional argument is a directory to list (default is the current server
directory).  Multiple arguments can be used to pass non-standard options to
the NLST command.

Note
If your server supports the command, mlsd() offers a better API.
