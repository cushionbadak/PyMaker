rowcount¶
Although the Cursor class of the sqlite3 module implements this
attribute, the database engine’s own support for the determination of “rows
affected”/”rows selected” is quirky.
For executemany() statements, the number of modifications are summed up
into rowcount.
As required by the Python DB API Spec, the rowcount attribute “is -1 in
case no executeXX() has been performed on the cursor or the rowcount of the
last operation is not determinable by the interface”. This includes SELECT
statements because we cannot determine the number of rows a query produced
until all rows were fetched.
With SQLite versions before 3.6.5, rowcount is set to 0 if
you make a DELETE FROM table without any condition.
