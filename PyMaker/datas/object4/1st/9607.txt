pkgutil.get_loader(module_or_name)Â¶
Get a loader object for module_or_name.
If the module or package is accessible via the normal import mechanism, a
wrapper around the relevant part of that machinery is returned.  Returns
None if the module cannot be found or imported.  If the named module is
not already imported, its containing package (if any) is imported, in order
to establish the package __path__.

Changed in version 3.3: Updated to be based directly on importlib rather than relying
on the package internal PEP 302 import emulation.


Changed in version 3.4: Updated to be based on PEP 451
