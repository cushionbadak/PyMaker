The class of the result returned by Pool.apply_async() and
Pool.map_async().


get([timeout])¶
Return the result when it arrives.  If timeout is not None and the
result does not arrive within timeout seconds then
multiprocessing.TimeoutError is raised.  If the remote call raised
an exception then that exception will be reraised by get().



wait([timeout])¶
Wait until the result is available or until timeout seconds pass.



ready()¶
Return whether the call has completed.



successful()¶
Return whether the call completed without raising an exception.  Will
raise AssertionError if the result is not ready.
