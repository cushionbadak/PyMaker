signal.sigwait(sigset)Â¶
Suspend execution of the calling thread until the delivery of one of the
signals specified in the signal set sigset.  The function accepts the signal
(removes it from the pending list of signals), and returns the signal number.
Availability: Unix (see the man page sigwait(3) for further
information).
See also pause(), pthread_sigmask(), sigpending(),
sigwaitinfo() and sigtimedwait().

New in version 3.3.
