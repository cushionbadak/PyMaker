HTMLParser.handle_pi(data)Â¶
Method called when a processing instruction is encountered.  The data
parameter will contain the entire processing instruction. For example, for the
processing instruction <?proc color='red'>, this method would be called as
handle_pi("proc color='red'").  It is intended to be overridden by a derived
class; the base class implementation does nothing.

Note
The HTMLParser class uses the SGML syntactic rules for processing
instructions.  An XHTML processing instruction using the trailing '?' will
cause the '?' to be included in data.
