urllib.request.install_opener(opener)Â¶
Install an OpenerDirector instance as the default global opener.
Installing an opener is only necessary if you want urlopen to use that
opener; otherwise, simply call OpenerDirector.open() instead of
urlopen().  The code does not check for a real
OpenerDirector, and any class with the appropriate interface will
work.
