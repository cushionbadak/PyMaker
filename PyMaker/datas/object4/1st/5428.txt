Signals and threads¶
Python signal handlers are always executed in the main Python thread,
even if the signal was received in another thread.  This means that signals
can’t be used as a means of inter-thread communication.  You can use
the synchronization primitives from the threading module instead.
Besides, only the main thread is allowed to set a new signal handler.
