patch.dict(in_dict, values=(), clear=False, **kwargs)Â¶
Patch a dictionary, or dictionary like object, and restore the dictionary
to its original state after the test.
in_dict can be a dictionary or a mapping like container. If it is a
mapping then it must at least support getting, setting and deleting items
plus iterating over keys.
in_dict can also be a string specifying the name of the dictionary, which
will then be fetched by importing it.
values can be a dictionary of values to set in the dictionary. values
can also be an iterable of (key, value) pairs.
If clear is true then the dictionary will be cleared before the new
values are set.
patch.dict() can also be called with arbitrary keyword arguments to set
values in the dictionary.
patch.dict() can be used as a context manager, decorator or class
decorator. When used as a class decorator patch.dict() honours
patch.TEST_PREFIX for choosing which methods to wrap.
