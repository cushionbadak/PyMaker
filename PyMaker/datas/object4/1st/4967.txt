add_child_handler(pid, callback, *args)Â¶
Register a new child handler.
Arrange for callback(pid, returncode, *args) to be called
when a process with PID equal to pid terminates.  Specifying
another callback for the same process replaces the previous
handler.
The callback callable must be thread-safe.
