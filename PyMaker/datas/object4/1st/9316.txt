dataclasses.astuple(instance, *, tuple_factory=tuple)Â¶
Converts the dataclass instance to a tuple (by using the
factory function tuple_factory).  Each dataclass is converted
to a tuple of its field values.  dataclasses, dicts, lists, and
tuples are recursed into.
Continuing from the previous example:
assert astuple(p) == (10, 20)
assert astuple(c) == ([(0, 0), (10, 4)],)


Raises TypeError if instance is not a dataclass instance.
