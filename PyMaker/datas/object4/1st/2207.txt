filecmp.cmpfiles(dir1, dir2, common, shallow=True)¶
Compare the files in the two directories dir1 and dir2 whose names are
given by common.
Returns three lists of file names: match, mismatch,
errors.  match contains the list of files that match, mismatch contains
the names of those that don’t, and errors lists the names of files which
could not be compared.  Files are listed in errors if they don’t exist in
one of the directories, the user lacks permission to read them or if the
comparison could not be done for some other reason.
The shallow parameter has the same meaning and default value as for
filecmp.cmp().
For example, cmpfiles('a', 'b', ['c', 'd/e']) will compare a/c with
b/c and a/d/e with b/d/e.  'c' and 'd/e' will each be in
one of the three returned lists.
