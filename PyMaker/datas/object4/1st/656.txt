<dd><p>Raised when the result of an arithmetic operation is too large to be
represented.  This cannot occur for integers (which would rather raise
<a class="reference internal" href="#MemoryError" title="MemoryError"><code class="xref py py-exc docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">MemoryError</span></code></a> than give up).  However, for historical reasons,
OverflowError is sometimes raised for integers that are outside a required
range.   Because of the lack of standardization of floating point exception
handling in C, most floating point operations are not checked.</p>
