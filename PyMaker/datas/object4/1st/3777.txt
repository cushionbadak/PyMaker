window.encodingÂ¶
Encoding used to encode method arguments (Unicode strings and characters).
The encoding attribute is inherited from the parent window when a subwindow
is created, for example with window.subwin(). By default, the locale
encoding is used (see locale.getpreferredencoding()).

New in version 3.3.
