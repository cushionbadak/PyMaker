zlib.decompressobj(wbits=MAX_WBITS[, zdict])¶
Returns a decompression object, to be used for decompressing data streams that
won’t fit into memory at once.
The wbits parameter controls the size of the history buffer (or the
“window size”), and what header and trailer format is expected.  It has
the same meaning as described for decompress().
The zdict parameter specifies a predefined compression dictionary. If
provided, this must be the same dictionary as was used by the compressor that
produced the data that is to be decompressed.

Note
If zdict is a mutable object (such as a bytearray), you must not
modify its contents between the call to decompressobj() and the first
call to the decompressor’s decompress() method.


Changed in version 3.3: Added the zdict parameter.
