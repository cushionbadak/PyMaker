authkey¶
The process’s authentication key (a byte string).
When multiprocessing is initialized the main process is assigned a
random string using os.urandom().
When a Process object is created, it will inherit the
authentication key of its parent process, although this may be changed by
setting authkey to another byte string.
See Authentication keys.
