__path__¶
If the module is a package (either regular or namespace), the module
object’s __path__ attribute must be set.  The value must be
iterable, but may be empty if __path__ has no further significance.
If __path__ is not empty, it must produce strings when iterated
over. More details on the semantics of __path__ are given
below.
Non-package modules should not have a __path__ attribute.
