StreamRecoder Objects¶
The StreamRecoder translates data from one encoding to another,
which is sometimes useful when dealing with different encoding environments.
The design is such that one can use the factory functions returned by the
lookup() function to construct the instance.


class codecs.StreamRecoder(stream, encode, decode, Reader, Writer, errors='strict')¶
Creates a StreamRecoder instance which implements a two-way conversion:
encode and decode work on the frontend — the data visible to
code calling read() and write(), while Reader and Writer
work on the backend — the data in stream.
You can use these objects to do transparent transcodings from e.g. Latin-1
to UTF-8 and back.
The stream argument must be a file-like object.
The encode and decode arguments must
adhere to the Codec interface. Reader and
Writer must be factory functions or classes providing objects of the
StreamReader and StreamWriter interface respectively.
Error handling is done in the same way as defined for the stream readers and
writers.

StreamRecoder instances define the combined interfaces of
StreamReader and StreamWriter classes. They inherit all other
methods and attributes from the underlying stream.
