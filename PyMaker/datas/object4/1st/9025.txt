timeit(number=1000000)Â¶
Time number executions of the main statement.  This executes the setup
statement once, and then returns the time it takes to execute the main
statement a number of times, measured in seconds as a float.
The argument is the number of times through the loop, defaulting to one
million.  The main statement, the setup statement and the timer function
to be used are passed to the constructor.

Note
By default, timeit() temporarily turns off garbage
collection during the timing.  The advantage of this approach is that
it makes independent timings more comparable.  The disadvantage is
that GC may be an important component of the performance of the
function being measured.  If so, GC can be re-enabled as the first
statement in the setup string.  For example:
timeit.Timer('for i in range(10): oct(i)', 'gc.enable()').timeit()
