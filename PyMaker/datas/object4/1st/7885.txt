turtle.shearfactor(shear=None)¶




Parameters:shear – number (optional)



Set or return the current shearfactor. Shear the turtleshape according to
the given shearfactor shear, which is the tangent of the shear angle.
Do not change the turtle’s heading (direction of movement).
If shear is not given: return the current shearfactor, i. e. the
tangent of the shear angle, by which lines parallel to the
heading of the turtle are sheared.
