class urllib.request.AbstractBasicAuthHandler(password_mgr=None)Â¶
This is a mixin class that helps with HTTP authentication, both to the remote
host and to a proxy. password_mgr, if given, should be something that is
compatible with HTTPPasswordMgr; refer to section
HTTPPasswordMgr Objects for information on the interface that must be
supported.  If passwd_mgr also provides is_authenticated and
update_authenticated methods (see
HTTPPasswordMgrWithPriorAuth Objects), then the handler will use the
is_authenticated result for a given URI to determine whether or not to
send authentication credentials with the request.  If is_authenticated
returns True for the URI, credentials are sent.  If is_authenticated
is False, credentials are not sent, and then if a 401 response is
received the request is re-sent with the authentication credentials.  If
authentication succeeds, update_authenticated is called to set
is_authenticated True for the URI, so that subsequent requests to
the URI or any of its super-URIs will automatically include the
authentication credentials.

New in version 3.5: Added is_authenticated support.
