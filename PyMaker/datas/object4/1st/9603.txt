class pkgutil.ImpImporter(dirname=None)¶
PEP 302 Finder that wraps Python’s “classic” import algorithm.
If dirname is a string, a PEP 302 finder is created that searches that
directory.  If dirname is None, a PEP 302 finder is created that
searches the current sys.path, plus any modules that are frozen or
built-in.
Note that ImpImporter does not currently support being used by
placement on sys.meta_path.

Deprecated since version 3.3: This emulation is no longer needed, as the standard import mechanism
is now fully PEP 302 compliant and available in importlib.
