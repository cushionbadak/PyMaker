loop.run_forever()Â¶
Run the event loop until stop() is called.
If stop() is called before run_forever() is called,
the loop will poll the I/O selector once with a timeout of zero,
run all callbacks scheduled in response to I/O events (and
those that were already scheduled), and then exit.
If stop() is called while run_forever() is running,
the loop will run the current batch of callbacks and then exit.
Note that new callbacks scheduled by callbacks will not run in this
case; instead, they will run the next time run_forever() or
run_until_complete() is called.
