docs:


coroutine loop.sock_recv(sock, nbytes)Â¶
Receive up to nbytes from sock.  Asynchronous version of
socket.recv().
Return the received data as a bytes object.
sock must be a non-blocking socket.

Changed in version 3.7: Even though this method was always documented as a coroutine
method, releases before Python 3.7 returned a Future.
Since Python 3.7 this is an async def method.
