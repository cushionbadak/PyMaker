compare_to(old_snapshot: Snapshot, key_type: str, cumulative: bool=False)Â¶
Compute the differences with an old snapshot. Get statistics as a sorted
list of StatisticDiff instances grouped by key_type.
See the Snapshot.statistics() method for key_type and cumulative
parameters.
The result is sorted from the biggest to the smallest by: absolute value
of StatisticDiff.size_diff, StatisticDiff.size, absolute
value of StatisticDiff.count_diff, Statistic.count and
then by StatisticDiff.traceback.
