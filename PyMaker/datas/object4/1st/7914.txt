turtle.delay(delay=None)¶




Parameters:delay – positive integer



Set or return the drawing delay in milliseconds.  (This is approximately
the time interval between two consecutive canvas updates.)  The longer the
drawing delay, the slower the animation.
Optional argument:
>>> screen.delay()
10
>>> screen.delay(5)
>>> screen.delay()
5





turtle.tracer(n=None, delay=None)¶




Parameters:
n – nonnegative integer
delay – nonnegative integer





Turn turtle animation on/off and set delay for update drawings.  If
n is given, only each n-th regular screen update is really
performed.  (Can be used to accelerate the drawing of complex
graphics.)  When called without arguments, returns the currently
stored value of n. Second argument sets delay value (see
delay()).
>>> screen.tracer(8, 25)
>>> dist = 2
>>> for i in range(200):
...     fd(dist)
...     rt(90)
...     dist += 2





turtle.update()¶
Perform a TurtleScreen update. To be used when tracer is turned off.
