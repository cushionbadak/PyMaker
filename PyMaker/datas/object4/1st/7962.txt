Changes since Python 3.0Â¶

The methods Turtle.shearfactor(), Turtle.shapetransform() and
Turtle.get_shapepoly() have been added. Thus the full range of
regular linear transforms is now available for transforming turtle shapes.
Turtle.tiltangle() has been enhanced in functionality: it now can
be used to get or set the tiltangle. Turtle.settiltangle() has been
deprecated.
The method Screen.onkeypress() has been added as a complement to
Screen.onkey() which in fact binds actions to the keyrelease event.
Accordingly the latter has got an alias: Screen.onkeyrelease().
The method  Screen.mainloop() has been added. So when working only
with Screen and Turtle objects one must not additionally import
mainloop() anymore.
Two input methods has been added Screen.textinput() and
Screen.numinput(). These popup input dialogs and return
strings and numbers respectively.
Two example scripts tdemo_nim.py and tdemo_round_dance.py
have been added to the Lib/turtledemo directory.
