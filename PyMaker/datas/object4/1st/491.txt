docs:


bytes.rindex(sub[, start[, end]])¶

bytearray.rindex(sub[, start[, end]])¶
Like rfind() but raises ValueError when the
subsequence sub is not found.
The subsequence to search for may be any bytes-like object or an
integer in the range 0 to 255.

Changed in version 3.3: Also accept an integer in the range 0 to 255 as the subsequence.
