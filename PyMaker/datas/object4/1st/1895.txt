partial Objects¶
partial objects are callable objects created by partial(). They
have three read-only attributes:


partial.func¶
A callable object or function.  Calls to the partial object will be
forwarded to func with new arguments and keywords.



partial.args¶
The leftmost positional arguments that will be prepended to the positional
arguments provided to a partial object call.



partial.keywords¶
The keyword arguments that will be supplied when the partial object is
called.

partial objects are like function objects in that they are
callable, weak referencable, and can have attributes.  There are some important
differences.  For instance, the __name__ and __doc__ attributes
are not created automatically.  Also, partial objects defined in
classes behave like static methods and do not transform into bound methods
during instance attribute look-up.
