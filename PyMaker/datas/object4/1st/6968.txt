class nntplib.NNTP_SSL(host, port=563, user=None, password=None, ssl_context=None, readermode=None, usenetrc=False[, timeout])Â¶
Return a new NNTP_SSL object, representing an encrypted
connection to the NNTP server running on host host, listening at
port port.  NNTP_SSL objects have the same methods as
NNTP objects.  If port is omitted, port 563 (NNTPS) is used.
ssl_context is also optional, and is a SSLContext object.
Please read Security considerations for best practices.
All other parameters behave the same as for NNTP.
Note that SSL-on-563 is discouraged per RFC 4642, in favor of
STARTTLS as described below.  However, some servers only support the
former.

New in version 3.2.


Changed in version 3.4: The class now supports hostname check with
ssl.SSLContext.check_hostname and Server Name Indication (see
ssl.HAS_SNI).
