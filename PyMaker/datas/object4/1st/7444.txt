hosts()Â¶
Returns an iterator over the usable hosts in the network.  The usable
hosts are all the IP addresses that belong to the network, except the
network address itself and the network broadcast address.  For networks
with a mask length of 31, the network address and network broadcast
address are also included in the result.
>>> list(ip_network('192.0.2.0/29').hosts())  #doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
[IPv4Address('192.0.2.1'), IPv4Address('192.0.2.2'),
 IPv4Address('192.0.2.3'), IPv4Address('192.0.2.4'),
 IPv4Address('192.0.2.5'), IPv4Address('192.0.2.6')]
>>> list(ip_network('192.0.2.0/31').hosts())
[IPv4Address('192.0.2.0'), IPv4Address('192.0.2.1')]
