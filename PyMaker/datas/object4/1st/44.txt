object.__str__(self)¶
Called by str(object) and the built-in functions
format() and print() to compute the “informal” or nicely
printable string representation of an object.  The return value must be a
string object.
This method differs from object.__repr__() in that there is no
expectation that __str__() return a valid Python expression: a more
convenient or concise representation can be used.
The default implementation defined by the built-in type object
calls object.__repr__().
