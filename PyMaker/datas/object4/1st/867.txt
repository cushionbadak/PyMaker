fix_sentence_endings¶
(default: False) If true, TextWrapper attempts to detect
sentence endings and ensure that sentences are always separated by exactly
two spaces.  This is generally desired for text in a monospaced font.
However, the sentence detection algorithm is imperfect: it assumes that a
sentence ending consists of a lowercase letter followed by one of '.',
'!', or '?', possibly followed by one of '"' or "'",
followed by a space.  One problem with this is algorithm is that it is
unable to detect the difference between “Dr.” in
[...] Dr. Frankenstein's monster [...]


and “Spot.” in
[...] See Spot. See Spot run [...]


fix_sentence_endings is false by default.
Since the sentence detection algorithm relies on string.lowercase for
the definition of “lowercase letter,” and a convention of using two spaces
after a period to separate sentences on the same line, it is specific to
English-language texts.
