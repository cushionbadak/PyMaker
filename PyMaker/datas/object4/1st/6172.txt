xml.dom.getDOMImplementation(name=None, features=())Â¶
Return a suitable DOM implementation. The name is either well-known, the
module name of a DOM implementation, or None. If it is not None, imports
the corresponding module and returns a DOMImplementation object if the
import succeeds.  If no name is given, and if the environment variable
PYTHON_DOM is set, this variable is used to find the implementation.
If name is not given, this examines the available implementations to find one
with the required feature set.  If no implementation can be found, raise an
ImportError.  The features list must be a sequence of (feature,
version) pairs which are passed to the hasFeature() method on available
DOMImplementation objects.
