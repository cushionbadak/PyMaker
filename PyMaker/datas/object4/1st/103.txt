These methods are called to implement the binary arithmetic operations
(+, -, *, @, /, //, %, divmod(),
pow(), **, <<, >>, &, ^, |).  For instance, to
evaluate the expression x + y, where x is an instance of a class that
has an __add__() method, x.__add__(y) is called.  The
__divmod__() method should be the equivalent to using
__floordiv__() and __mod__(); it should not be related to
__truediv__().  Note that __pow__() should be defined to accept
an optional third argument if the ternary version of the built-in pow()
function is to be supported.
If one of those methods does not support the operation with the supplied
arguments, it should return NotImplemented.
