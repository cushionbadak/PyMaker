exception ossaudiodev.OSSAudioErrorÂ¶
This exception is raised on certain errors.  The argument is a string describing
what went wrong.
(If ossaudiodev receives an error from a system call such as
open(), write(), or ioctl(), it raises OSError.
Errors detected directly by ossaudiodev result in OSSAudioError.)
(For backwards compatibility, the exception class is also available as
ossaudiodev.error.)
