site.ENABLE_USER_SITEÂ¶
Flag showing the status of the user site-packages directory.  True means
that it is enabled and was added to sys.path.  False means that it
was disabled by user request (with -s or
PYTHONNOUSERSITE).  None means it was disabled for security
reasons (mismatch between user or group id and effective id) or by an
administrator.
