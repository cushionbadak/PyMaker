sys.path_importer_cacheÂ¶
A dictionary acting as a cache for finder objects. The keys are
paths that have been passed to sys.path_hooks and the values are
the finders that are found. If a path is a valid file system path but no
finder is found on sys.path_hooks then None is
stored.
Originally specified in PEP 302.

Changed in version 3.3: None is stored instead of imp.NullImporter when no finder
is found.
