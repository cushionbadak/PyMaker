class email.mime.application.MIMEApplication(_data, _subtype='octet-stream', _encoder=email.encoders.encode_base64, *, policy=compat32, **_params)Â¶
Module: email.mime.application
A subclass of MIMENonMultipart, the
MIMEApplication class is used to represent MIME message objects of
major type application.  _data is a string containing the raw
byte data.  Optional _subtype specifies the MIME subtype and defaults to
octet-stream.
Optional _encoder is a callable (i.e. function) which will perform the actual
encoding of the data for transport.  This callable takes one argument, which is
the MIMEApplication instance. It should use
get_payload() and
set_payload() to change the payload to encoded
form.  It should also add
any Content-Transfer-Encoding or other headers to the message
object as necessary.  The default encoding is base64.  See the
email.encoders module for a list of the built-in encoders.
Optional policy argument defaults to compat32.
_params are passed straight through to the base class constructor.

Changed in version 3.6: Added policy keyword-only parameter.
