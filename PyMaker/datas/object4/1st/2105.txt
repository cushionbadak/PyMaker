docs:


os.path.splitext(path)Â¶
Split the pathname path into a pair (root, ext)  such that root + ext ==
path, and ext is empty or begins with a period and contains at most one
period. Leading periods on the basename are  ignored; splitext('.cshrc')
returns  ('.cshrc', '').

Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a path-like object.
