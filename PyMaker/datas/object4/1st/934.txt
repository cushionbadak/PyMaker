Startup hooks¶


readline.set_startup_hook([function])¶
Set or remove the function invoked by the rl_startup_hook
callback of the underlying library.  If function is specified, it will
be used as the new hook function; if omitted or None, any function
already installed is removed.  The hook is called with no
arguments just before readline prints the first prompt.



readline.set_pre_input_hook([function])¶
Set or remove the function invoked by the rl_pre_input_hook
callback of the underlying library.  If function is specified, it will
be used as the new hook function; if omitted or None, any
function already installed is removed.  The hook is called
with no arguments after the first prompt has been printed and just before
readline starts reading input characters.  This function only exists
if Python was compiled for a version of the library that supports it.
