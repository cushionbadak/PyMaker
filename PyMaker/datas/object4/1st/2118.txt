class fileinput.FileInput(files=None, inplace=False, backup='', bufsize=0, mode='r', openhook=None)Â¶
Class FileInput is the implementation; its methods filename(),
fileno(), lineno(), filelineno(), isfirstline(),
isstdin(), nextfile() and close() correspond to the
functions of the same name in the module. In addition it has a
readline() method which returns the next input line,
and a __getitem__() method which implements the sequence behavior.
The sequence must be accessed in strictly sequential order; random access
and readline() cannot be mixed.
With mode you can specify which file mode will be passed to open(). It
must be one of 'r', 'rU', 'U' and 'rb'.
The openhook, when given, must be a function that takes two arguments,
filename and mode, and returns an accordingly opened file-like object. You
cannot use inplace and openhook together.
A FileInput instance can be used as a context manager in the
with statement.  In this example, input is closed after the
with statement is exited, even if an exception occurs:
with FileInput(files=('spam.txt', 'eggs.txt')) as input:
    process(input)



Changed in version 3.2: Can be used as a context manager.


Deprecated since version 3.4: The 'rU' and 'U' modes.


Deprecated since version 3.6, will be removed in version 3.8: The bufsize parameter.
