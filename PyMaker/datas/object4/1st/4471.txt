Popen.wait(timeout=None)Â¶
Wait for child process to terminate.  Set and return
returncode attribute.
If the process does not terminate after timeout seconds, raise a
TimeoutExpired exception.  It is safe to catch this exception and
retry the wait.

Note
This will deadlock when using stdout=PIPE or stderr=PIPE
and the child process generates enough output to a pipe such that
it blocks waiting for the OS pipe buffer to accept more data.
Use Popen.communicate() when using pipes to avoid that.


Note
The function is implemented using a busy loop (non-blocking call and
short sleeps). Use the asyncio module for an asynchronous wait:
see asyncio.create_subprocess_exec.


Changed in version 3.3: timeout was added.
