traceback.format_list(extracted_list)Â¶
Given a list of tuples or FrameSummary objects as returned by
extract_tb() or extract_stack(), return a list of strings ready
for printing.  Each string in the resulting list corresponds to the item with
the same index in the argument list.  Each string ends in a newline; the
strings may contain internal newlines as well, for those items whose source
text line is not None.
