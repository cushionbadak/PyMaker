warnings.warn_explicit(message, category, filename, lineno, module=None, registry=None, module_globals=None, source=None)Â¶
This is a low-level interface to the functionality of warn(), passing in
explicitly the message, category, filename and line number, and optionally the
module name and the registry (which should be the __warningregistry__
dictionary of the module).  The module name defaults to the filename with
.py stripped; if no registry is passed, the warning is never suppressed.
message must be a string and category a subclass of Warning or
message may be a Warning instance, in which case category will be
ignored.
module_globals, if supplied, should be the global namespace in use by the code
for which the warning is issued.  (This argument is used to support displaying
source for modules found in zipfiles or other non-filesystem import
sources).
source, if supplied, is the destroyed object which emitted a
ResourceWarning.

Changed in version 3.6: Add the source parameter.
