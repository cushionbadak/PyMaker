Main options¶
At least one of the following options must be specified when invoking
trace.  The --listfuncs option is mutually exclusive with
the --trace and --count options. When
--listfuncs is provided, neither --count nor
--trace are accepted, and vice versa.


-c, --count¶
Produce a set of annotated listing files upon program completion that shows
how many times each statement was executed.  See also
--coverdir, --file and
--no-report below.



-t, --trace¶
Display lines as they are executed.



-l, --listfuncs¶
Display the functions executed by running the program.



-r, --report¶
Produce an annotated list from an earlier program run that used the
--count and --file option.  This does not
execute any code.



-T, --trackcalls¶
Display the calling relationships exposed by running the program.
