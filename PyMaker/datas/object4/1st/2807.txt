Exceptions¶
Exceptions in this module are coded as class instances:


exception xdrlib.Error¶
The base exception class.  Error has a single public attribute
msg containing the description of the error.



exception xdrlib.ConversionError¶
Class derived from Error.  Contains no additional instance variables.

Here is an example of how you would catch one of these exceptions:
import xdrlib
p = xdrlib.Packer()
try:
    p.pack_double(8.01)
except xdrlib.ConversionError as instance:
    print('packing the double failed:', instance.msg)
