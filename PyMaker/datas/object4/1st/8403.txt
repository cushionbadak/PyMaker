doctest.script_from_examples(s)Â¶
Convert text with examples to a script.
Argument s is a string containing doctest examples.  The string is converted
to a Python script, where doctest examples in s are converted to regular code,
and everything else is converted to Python comments.  The generated script is
returned as a string. For example,
import doctest
print(doctest.script_from_examples(r"""
    Set x and y to 1 and 2.
    >>> x, y = 1, 2

    Print their sum:
    >>> print(x+y)
    3
"""))


displays:
# Set x and y to 1 and 2.
x, y = 1, 2
#
# Print their sum:
print(x+y)
# Expected:
## 3


This function is used internally by other functions (see below), but can also be
useful when you want to transform an interactive Python session into a Python
script.
