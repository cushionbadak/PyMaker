itertools.cycle(iterable)Â¶
Make an iterator returning elements from the iterable and saving a copy of each.
When the iterable is exhausted, return elements from the saved copy.  Repeats
indefinitely.  Roughly equivalent to:
def cycle(iterable):
    # cycle('ABCD') --> A B C D A B C D A B C D ...
    saved = []
    for element in iterable:
        yield element
        saved.append(element)
    while saved:
        for element in saved:
              yield element


Note, this member of the toolkit may require significant auxiliary storage
(depending on the length of the iterable).
