class tkinter.tix.NoteBook¶
The NoteBook
widget can be used to display many windows in a limited space using a notebook
metaphor. The notebook is divided into a stack of pages. At one time only one of
these pages can be shown. The user can navigate through these pages by choosing
the visual “tabs” at the top of the NoteBook widget.
