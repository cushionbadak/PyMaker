Structure/union alignment and byte orderÂ¶
By default, Structure and Union fields are aligned in the same way the C
compiler does it. It is possible to override this behavior be specifying a
_pack_ class attribute in the subclass definition. This must be set to a
positive integer and specifies the maximum alignment for the fields. This is
what #pragma pack(n) also does in MSVC.
ctypes uses the native byte order for Structures and Unions.  To build
structures with non-native byte order, you can use one of the
BigEndianStructure, LittleEndianStructure,
BigEndianUnion, and LittleEndianUnion base classes.  These
classes cannot contain pointer fields.
