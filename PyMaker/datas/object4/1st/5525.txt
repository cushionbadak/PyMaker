add_related(*args, content_manager=None, **kw)Â¶
If the message is a multipart/related, create a new message
object, pass all of the arguments to its set_content() method,
and attach() it to the multipart.  If
the message is a non-multipart, call make_related() and then
proceed as above.  If the message is any other type of multipart,
raise a TypeError. If content_manager is not specified, use
the content_manager specified by the current policy.
If the added part has no Content-Disposition header,
add one with the value inline.
