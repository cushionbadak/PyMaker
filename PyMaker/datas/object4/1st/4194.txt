ident¶
The ‘thread identifier’ of this thread or None if the thread has not
been started.  This is a nonzero integer.  See the get_ident()
function.  Thread identifiers may be recycled when a thread exits and
another thread is created.  The identifier is available even after the
thread has exited.
