6.2.2. Literals¶
Python supports string and bytes literals and various numeric literals:

literal ::=  stringliteral | bytesliteral
             | integer | floatnumber | imagnumber

Evaluation of a literal yields an object of the given type (string, bytes,
integer, floating point number, complex number) with the given value.  The value
may be approximated in the case of floating point and imaginary (complex)
literals.  See section Literals for details.
All literals correspond to immutable data types, and hence the object’s identity
is less important than its value.  Multiple evaluations of literals with the
same value (either the same occurrence in the program text or a different
occurrence) may obtain the same object or a different object with the same
value.
