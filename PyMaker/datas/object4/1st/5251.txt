SSLContext.load_default_certs(purpose=Purpose.SERVER_AUTH)¶
Load a set of default “certification authority” (CA) certificates from
default locations. On Windows it loads CA certs from the CA and
ROOT system stores. On other systems it calls
SSLContext.set_default_verify_paths(). In the future the method may
load CA certificates from other locations, too.
The purpose flag specifies what kind of CA certificates are loaded. The
default settings Purpose.SERVER_AUTH loads certificates, that are
flagged and trusted for TLS web server authentication (client side
sockets). Purpose.CLIENT_AUTH loads CA certificates for client
certificate verification on the server side.

New in version 3.4.
