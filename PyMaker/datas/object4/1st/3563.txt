logging.captureWarnings(capture)Â¶
This function is used to turn the capture of warnings by logging on and
off.
If capture is True, warnings issued by the warnings module will
be redirected to the logging system. Specifically, a warning will be
formatted using warnings.formatwarning() and the resulting string
logged to a logger named 'py.warnings' with a severity of WARNING.
If capture is False, the redirection of warnings to the logging system
will stop, and warnings will be redirected to their original destinations
(i.e. those in effect before captureWarnings(True) was called).
