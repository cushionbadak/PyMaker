os.readlink(path, *, dir_fd=None)Â¶
Return a string representing the path to which the symbolic link points.  The
result may be either an absolute or relative pathname; if it is relative, it
may be converted to an absolute pathname using
os.path.join(os.path.dirname(path), result).
If the path is a string object (directly or indirectly through a
PathLike interface), the result will also be a string object,
and the call may raise a UnicodeDecodeError. If the path is a bytes
object (direct or indirectly), the result will be a bytes object.
This function can also support paths relative to directory descriptors.
Availability: Unix, Windows.

Changed in version 3.2: Added support for Windows 6.0 (Vista) symbolic links.


New in version 3.3: The dir_fd argument.


Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a path-like object.
