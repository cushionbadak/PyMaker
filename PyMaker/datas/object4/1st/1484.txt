Ensuring unique enumeration values¶
By default, enumerations allow multiple names as aliases for the same value.
When this behavior isn’t desired, the following decorator can be used to
ensure each value is used only once in the enumeration:


@enum.unique

A class decorator specifically for enumerations.  It searches an
enumeration’s __members__ gathering any aliases it finds; if any are
found ValueError is raised with the details:
>>> from enum import Enum, unique
>>> @unique
... class Mistake(Enum):
...     ONE = 1
...     TWO = 2
...     THREE = 3
...     FOUR = 3
...
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: duplicate values found in <enum 'Mistake'>: FOUR -> THREE
