os.writev(fd, buffers)Â¶

a sequence of bytes-like objects. Buffers are
processed in array order. Entire contents of the first buffer is written
before proceeding to the second, and so on.

The operating system may set a limit (sysconf() value
'SC_IOV_MAX') on the number of buffers that can be used.
