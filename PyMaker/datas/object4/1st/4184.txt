Thread-Local Data¶
Thread-local data is data whose values are thread specific.  To manage
thread-local data, just create an instance of local (or a
subclass) and store attributes on it:
mydata = threading.local()
mydata.x = 1


The instance’s values will be different for separate threads.


class threading.local¶
A class that represents thread-local data.
For more details and extensive examples, see the documentation string of the
_threading_local module.
