Path.read_text(encoding=None, errors=None)Â¶
Return the decoded contents of the pointed-to file as a string:
>>> p = Path('my_text_file')
>>> p.write_text('Text file contents')
18
>>> p.read_text()
'Text file contents'


The file is opened and then closed. The optional parameters have the same
meaning as in open().
