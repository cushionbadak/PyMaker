How do I send mail from a Python script?¶
Use the standard library module smtplib.
Here’s a very simple interactive mail sender that uses it.  This method will
work on any host that supports an SMTP listener.
import sys, smtplib

fromaddr = input("From: ")
toaddrs  = input("To: ").split(',')
print("Enter message, end with ^D:")
msg = ''
while True:
    line = sys.stdin.readline()
    if not line:
        break
    msg += line

# The actual mail send
server = smtplib.SMTP('localhost')
server.sendmail(fromaddr, toaddrs, msg)
server.quit()


A Unix-only alternative uses sendmail.  The location of the sendmail program
varies between systems; sometimes it is /usr/lib/sendmail, sometimes
/usr/sbin/sendmail.  The sendmail manual page will help you out.  Here’s
some sample code:
import os

SENDMAIL = "/usr/sbin/sendmail"  # sendmail location
p = os.popen("%s -t -i" % SENDMAIL, "w")
p.write("To: receiver@example.com\n")
p.write("Subject: test\n")
p.write("\n")  # blank line separating headers from body
p.write("Some text\n")
p.write("some more text\n")
sts = p.close()
if sts != 0:
    print("Sendmail exit status", sts)
