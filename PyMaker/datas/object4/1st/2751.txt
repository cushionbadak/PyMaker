add_section(section)Â¶
Add a section named section to the instance.  If a section by the given
name already exists, DuplicateSectionError is raised.  If the
default section name is passed, ValueError is raised.
Type of section is not checked which lets users create non-string named
sections.  This behaviour is unsupported and may cause internal errors.
