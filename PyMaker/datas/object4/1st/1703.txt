create_decimal(num)Â¶
Creates a new Decimal instance from num but using self as
context. Unlike the Decimal constructor, the context precision,
rounding method, flags, and traps are applied to the conversion.
This is useful because constants are often given to a greater precision
than is needed by the application.  Another benefit is that rounding
immediately eliminates unintended effects from digits beyond the current
precision. In the following example, using unrounded inputs means that
adding zero to a sum can change the result:
>>> getcontext().prec = 3
>>> Decimal('3.4445') + Decimal('1.0023')
Decimal('4.45')
>>> Decimal('3.4445') + Decimal(0) + Decimal('1.0023')
Decimal('4.44')


This method implements the to-number operation of the IBM specification.
If the argument is a string, no leading or trailing whitespace or
underscores are permitted.
