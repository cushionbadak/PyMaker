class asyncore.file_dispatcherÂ¶
A file_dispatcher takes a file descriptor or file object along
with an optional map argument and wraps it for use with the poll()
or loop() functions.  If provided a file object or anything with a
fileno() method, that method will be called and passed to the
file_wrapper constructor.
