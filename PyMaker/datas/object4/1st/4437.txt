exception concurrent.futures.process.BrokenProcessPoolÂ¶
Derived from BrokenExecutor (formerly
RuntimeError), this exception class is raised when one of the
workers of a ProcessPoolExecutor has terminated in a non-clean
fashion (for example, if it was killed from the outside).

New in version 3.3.
