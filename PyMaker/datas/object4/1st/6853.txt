FTP.storbinary(cmd, fp, blocksize=8192, callback=None, rest=None)¶
Store a file in binary transfer mode.  cmd should be an appropriate
STOR command: "STOR filename". fp is a file object
(opened in binary mode) which is read until EOF using its read()
method in blocks of size blocksize to provide the data to be stored.
The blocksize argument defaults to 8192.  callback is an optional single
parameter callable that is called on each block of data after it is sent.
rest means the same thing as in the transfercmd() method.

Changed in version 3.2: rest parameter added.
