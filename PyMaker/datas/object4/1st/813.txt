search() vs. match()Â¶
Python offers two different primitive operations based on regular expressions:
re.match() checks for a match only at the beginning of the string, while
re.search() checks for a match anywhere in the string (this is what Perl
does by default).
For example:
>>> re.match("c", "abcdef")    # No match
>>> re.search("c", "abcdef")   # Match
<re.Match object; span=(2, 3), match='c'>


Regular expressions beginning with '^' can be used with search() to
restrict the match at the beginning of the string:
>>> re.match("c", "abcdef")    # No match
>>> re.search("^c", "abcdef")  # No match
>>> re.search("^a", "abcdef")  # Match
<re.Match object; span=(0, 1), match='a'>


Note however that in MULTILINE mode match() only matches at the
beginning of the string, whereas using search() with a regular expression
beginning with '^' will match at the beginning of each line.
>>> re.match('X', 'A\nB\nX', re.MULTILINE)  # No match
>>> re.search('^X', 'A\nB\nX', re.MULTILINE)  # Match
<re.Match object; span=(4, 5), match='X'>
