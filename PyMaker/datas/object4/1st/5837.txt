docs:


itervalues()¶

__iter__()¶

values()¶
Return an iterator over representations of all messages if called as
itervalues() or __iter__() or return a list of such
representations if called as values(). The messages are represented
as instances of the appropriate format-specific Message subclass
unless a custom message factory was specified when the Mailbox
instance was initialized.

Note
The behavior of __iter__() is unlike that of dictionaries, which
iterate over keys.
