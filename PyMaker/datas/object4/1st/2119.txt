fileinput.hook_compressed(filename, mode)Â¶
Transparently opens files compressed with gzip and bzip2 (recognized by the
extensions '.gz' and '.bz2') using the gzip and bz2
modules.  If the filename extension is not '.gz' or '.bz2', the file is
opened normally (ie, using open() without any decompression).
Usage example:  fi = fileinput.FileInput(openhook=fileinput.hook_compressed)
