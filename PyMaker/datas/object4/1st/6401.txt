InputSource.setByteStream(bytefile)Â¶
Set the byte stream (a binary file) for this input source.
The SAX parser will ignore this if there is also a character stream specified,
but it will use a byte stream in preference to opening a URI connection itself.
If the application knows the character encoding of the byte stream, it should
set it with the setEncoding method.
