curses.halfdelay(tenths)Â¶
Used for half-delay mode, which is similar to cbreak mode in that characters
typed by the user are immediately available to the program. However, after
blocking for tenths tenths of seconds, raise an exception if nothing has
been typed.  The value of tenths must be a number between 1 and 255.  Use
nocbreak() to leave half-delay mode.
