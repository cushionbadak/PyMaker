winreg.SaveKey(key, file_name)¶
Saves the specified key, and all its subkeys to the specified file.
key is an already open key, or one of the predefined
HKEY_* constants.
file_name is the name of the file to save registry data to.  This file
cannot already exist. If this filename includes an extension, it cannot be
used on file allocation table (FAT) file systems by the LoadKey()
method.
If key represents a key on a remote computer, the path described by
file_name is relative to the remote computer. The caller of this method must
possess the SeBackupPrivilege security privilege.  Note that
privileges are different than permissions – see the
Conflicts Between User Rights and Permissions documentation
for more details.
This function passes NULL for security_attributes to the API.
