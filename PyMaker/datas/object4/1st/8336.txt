Which Docstrings Are Examined?¶
The module docstring, and all function, class and method docstrings are
searched.  Objects imported into the module are not searched.
In addition, if M.__test__ exists and “is true”, it must be a dict, and each
entry maps a (string) name to a function object, class object, or string.
Function and class object docstrings found from M.__test__ are searched, and
strings are treated as if they were docstrings.  In output, a key K in
M.__test__ appears with name
<name of M>.__test__.K


Any classes found are recursively searched similarly, to test docstrings in
their contained methods and nested classes.

CPython implementation detail: Prior to version 3.4, extension modules written in C were not fully
searched by doctest.
