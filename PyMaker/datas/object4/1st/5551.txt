email.message_from_binary_file(fp, _class=None, *, policy=policy.compat32)Â¶
Return a message object structure tree from an open binary file
object.  This is equivalent to BytesParser().parse(fp).  _class and
policy are interpreted as with the BytesParser class
constructor.

New in version 3.2.


Changed in version 3.3: Removed the strict argument.  Added the policy keyword.
