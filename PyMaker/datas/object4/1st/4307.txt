docs:


recv_bytes([maxlength])Â¶
Return a complete message of byte data sent from the other end of the
connection as a string.  Blocks until there is something to receive.
Raises EOFError if there is nothing left
to receive and the other end has closed.
If maxlength is specified and the message is longer than maxlength
then OSError is raised and the connection will no longer be
readable.

Changed in version 3.3: This function used to raise IOError, which is now an
alias of OSError.
