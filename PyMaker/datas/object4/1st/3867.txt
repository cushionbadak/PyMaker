Functions¶
The module curses.panel defines the following functions:


curses.panel.bottom_panel()¶
Returns the bottom panel in the panel stack.



curses.panel.new_panel(win)¶
Returns a panel object, associating it with the given window win. Be aware
that you need to keep the returned panel object referenced explicitly.  If you
don’t, the panel object is garbage collected and removed from the panel stack.



curses.panel.top_panel()¶
Returns the top panel in the panel stack.



curses.panel.update_panels()¶
Updates the virtual screen after changes in the panel stack. This does not call
curses.doupdate(), so you’ll have to do this yourself.
