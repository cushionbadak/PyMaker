DOMImplementation Objects¶
The DOMImplementation interface provides a way for applications to
determine the availability of particular features in the DOM they are using.
DOM Level 2 added the ability to create new Document and
DocumentType objects using the DOMImplementation as well.


DOMImplementation.hasFeature(feature, version)¶
Return true if the feature identified by the pair of strings feature and
version is implemented.



DOMImplementation.createDocument(namespaceUri, qualifiedName, doctype)¶
Return a new Document object (the root of the DOM), with a child
Element object having the given namespaceUri and qualifiedName. The
doctype must be a DocumentType object created by
createDocumentType(), or None. In the Python DOM API, the first two
arguments can also be None in order to indicate that no Element
child is to be created.



DOMImplementation.createDocumentType(qualifiedName, publicId, systemId)¶
Return a new DocumentType object that encapsulates the given
qualifiedName, publicId, and systemId strings, representing the
information contained in an XML document type declaration.
