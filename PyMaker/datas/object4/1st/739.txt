Format Specification Mini-Language¶
“Format specifications” are used within replacement fields contained within a
format string to define how individual values are presented (see
Format String Syntax and Formatted string literals).
They can also be passed directly to the built-in
format() function.  Each formattable type may define how the format
specification is to be interpreted.
Most built-in types implement the following options for format specifications,
although some of the formatting options are only supported by the numeric types.
A general convention is that an empty format string ("") produces
the same result as if you had called str() on the value. A
non-empty format string typically modifies the result.
The general form of a standard format specifier is:

format_spec     ::=  [[fill]align][sign][#][0][width][grouping_option][.precision][type]
fill            ::=  <any character>
align           ::=  "<" | ">" | "=" | "^"
sign            ::=  "+" | "-" | " "
width           ::=  digit+
grouping_option ::=  "_" | ","
precision       ::=  digit+
type            ::=  "b" | "c" | "d" | "e" | "E" | "f" | "F" | "g" | "G" | "n" | "o" | "s" | "x" | "X" | "%"

If a valid align value is specified, it can be preceded by a fill
character that can be any character and defaults to a space if omitted.
It is not possible to use a literal curly brace (“{” or “}”) as
the fill character in a formatted string literal or when using the str.format()
method.  However, it is possible to insert a curly brace
with a nested replacement field.  This limitation doesn’t
affect the format() function.
The meaning of the various alignment options is as follows:







Option
Meaning



'<'
Forces the field to be left-aligned within the available
space (this is the default for most objects).

'>'
Forces the field to be right-aligned within the
available space (this is the default for numbers).

'='
Forces the padding to be placed after the sign (if any)
but before the digits.  This is used for printing fields
in the form ‘+000000120’. This alignment option is only
valid for numeric types.  It becomes the default when ‘0’
immediately precedes the field width.

'^'
Forces the field to be centered within the available
space.




Note that unless a minimum field width is defined, the field width will always
be the same size as the data to fill it, so that the alignment option has no
meaning in this case.
The sign option is only valid for number types, and can be one of the
following:







Option
Meaning



'+'
indicates that a sign should be used for both
positive as well as negative numbers.

'-'
indicates that a sign should be used only for negative
numbers (this is the default behavior).

space
indicates that a leading space should be used on
positive numbers, and a minus sign on negative numbers.




The '#' option causes the “alternate form” to be used for the
conversion.  The alternate form is defined differently for different
types.  This option is only valid for integer, float, complex and
Decimal types. For integers, when binary, octal, or hexadecimal output
is used, this option adds the prefix respective '0b', '0o', or
'0x' to the output value. For floats, complex and Decimal the
alternate form causes the result of the conversion to always contain a
decimal-point character, even if no digits follow it. Normally, a
decimal-point character appears in the result of these conversions
only if a digit follows it. In addition, for 'g' and 'G'
conversions, trailing zeros are not removed from the result.
The ',' option signals the use of a comma for a thousands separator.
For a locale aware separator, use the 'n' integer presentation type
instead.

Changed in version 3.1: Added the ',' option (see also PEP 378).

The '_' option signals the use of an underscore for a thousands
separator for floating point presentation types and for integer
presentation type 'd'.  For integer presentation types 'b',
'o', 'x', and 'X', underscores will be inserted every 4
digits.  For other presentation types, specifying this option is an
error.

Changed in version 3.6: Added the '_' option (see also PEP 515).

width is a decimal integer defining the minimum field width.  If not
specified, then the field width will be determined by the content.
When no explicit alignment is given, preceding the width field by a zero
('0') character enables
sign-aware zero-padding for numeric types.  This is equivalent to a fill
character of '0' with an alignment type of '='.
The precision is a decimal number indicating how many digits should be
displayed after the decimal point for a floating point value formatted with
'f' and 'F', or before and after the decimal point for a floating point
value formatted with 'g' or 'G'.  For non-number types the field
indicates the maximum field size - in other words, how many characters will be
used from the field content. The precision is not allowed for integer values.
Finally, the type determines how the data should be presented.
The available string presentation types are:







Type
Meaning



's'
String format. This is the default type for strings and
may be omitted.

None
The same as 's'.




The available integer presentation types are:







Type
Meaning



'b'
Binary format. Outputs the number in base 2.

'c'
Character. Converts the integer to the corresponding
unicode character before printing.

'd'
Decimal Integer. Outputs the number in base 10.

'o'
Octal format. Outputs the number in base 8.

'x'
Hex format. Outputs the number in base 16, using
lower-case letters for the digits above 9.

'X'
Hex format. Outputs the number in base 16, using
upper-case letters for the digits above 9.

'n'
Number. This is the same as 'd', except that it uses
the current locale setting to insert the appropriate
number separator characters.

None
The same as 'd'.




In addition to the above presentation types, integers can be formatted
with the floating point presentation types listed below (except
'n' and None). When doing so, float() is used to convert the
integer to a floating point number before formatting.
The available presentation types for floating point and decimal values are:







Type
Meaning



'e'
Exponent notation. Prints the number in scientific
notation using the letter ‘e’ to indicate the exponent.
The default precision is 6.

'E'
Exponent notation. Same as 'e' except it uses an
upper case ‘E’ as the separator character.

'f'
Fixed-point notation. Displays the number as a
fixed-point number.  The default precision is 6.

'F'
Fixed-point notation. Same as 'f', but converts
nan to  NAN and inf to INF.

'g'
General format.  For a given precision p >= 1,
this rounds the number to p significant digits and
then formats the result in either fixed-point format
or in scientific notation, depending on its magnitude.
The precise rules are as follows: suppose that the
result formatted with presentation type 'e' and
precision p-1 would have exponent exp.  Then
if -4 <= exp < p, the number is formatted
with presentation type 'f' and precision
p-1-exp.  Otherwise, the number is formatted
with presentation type 'e' and precision p-1.
In both cases insignificant trailing zeros are removed
from the significand, and the decimal point is also
removed if there are no remaining digits following it.
Positive and negative infinity, positive and negative
zero, and nans, are formatted as inf, -inf,
0, -0 and nan respectively, regardless of
the precision.
A precision of 0 is treated as equivalent to a
precision of 1.  The default precision is 6.


'G'
General format. Same as 'g' except switches to
'E' if the number gets too large. The
representations of infinity and NaN are uppercased, too.

'n'
Number. This is the same as 'g', except that it uses
the current locale setting to insert the appropriate
number separator characters.

'%'
Percentage. Multiplies the number by 100 and displays
in fixed ('f') format, followed by a percent sign.

None
Similar to 'g', except that fixed-point notation,
when used, has at least one digit past the decimal point.
The default precision is as high as needed to represent
the particular value. The overall effect is to match the
output of str() as altered by the other format
modifiers.
