os.fork()¶
Fork a child process.  Return 0 in the child and the child’s process id in the
parent.  If an error occurs OSError is raised.
Note that some platforms including FreeBSD <= 6.3 and Cygwin have
known issues when using fork() from a thread.

Warning
See ssl for applications that use the SSL module with fork().
