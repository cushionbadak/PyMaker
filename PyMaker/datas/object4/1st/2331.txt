object.__reduce_ex__(protocol)¶
Alternatively, a __reduce_ex__() method may be defined.  The only
difference is this method should take a single integer argument, the protocol
version.  When defined, pickle will prefer it over the __reduce__()
method.  In addition, __reduce__() automatically becomes a synonym for
the extended version.  The main use for this method is to provide
backwards-compatible reduce values for older Python releases.
