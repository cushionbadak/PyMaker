Simulating scanf()Â¶
Python does not currently have an equivalent to scanf().  Regular
expressions are generally more powerful, though also more verbose, than
scanf() format strings.  The table below offers some more-or-less
equivalent mappings between scanf() format tokens and regular
expressions.






scanf() Token
Regular Expression



%c
.

%5c
.{5}

%d
[-+]?\d+

%e, %E, %f, %g
[-+]?(\d+(\.\d*)?|\.\d+)([eE][-+]?\d+)?

%i
[-+]?(0[xX][\dA-Fa-f]+|0[0-7]*|\d+)

%o
[-+]?[0-7]+

%s
\S+

%u
\d+

%x, %X
[-+]?(0[xX])?[\dA-Fa-f]+



To extract the filename and numbers from a string like
/usr/sbin/sendmail - 0 errors, 4 warnings


you would use a scanf() format like
%s - %d errors, %d warnings


The equivalent regular expression would be
(\S+) - (\d+) errors, (\d+) warnings
