6.1. Arithmetic conversions¶
When a description of an arithmetic operator below uses the phrase “the numeric
arguments are converted to a common type,” this means that the operator
implementation for built-in types works as follows:

If either argument is a complex number, the other is converted to complex;
otherwise, if either argument is a floating point number, the other is
converted to floating point;
otherwise, both must be integers and no conversion is necessary.

Some additional rules apply for certain operators (e.g., a string as a left
argument to the ‘%’ operator).  Extensions must define their own conversion
behavior.
