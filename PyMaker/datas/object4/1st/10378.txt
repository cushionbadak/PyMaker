winsound.PlaySound(sound, flags)Â¶
Call the underlying PlaySound() function from the Platform API.  The
sound parameter may be a filename, a system sound alias, audio data as a
bytes-like object, or None.  Its
interpretation depends on the value of flags, which can be a bitwise ORed
combination of the constants described below. If the sound parameter is
None, any currently playing waveform sound is stopped. If the system
indicates an error, RuntimeError is raised.
