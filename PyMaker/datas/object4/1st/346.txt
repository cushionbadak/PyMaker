pow(x, y[, z])Â¶
Return x to the power y; if z is present, return x to the power y,
modulo z (computed more efficiently than pow(x, y) % z). The two-argument
form pow(x, y) is equivalent to using the power operator: x**y.
The arguments must have numeric types.  With mixed operand types, the
coercion rules for binary arithmetic operators apply.  For int
operands, the result has the same type as the operands (after coercion)
unless the second argument is negative; in that case, all arguments are
converted to float and a float result is delivered.  For example, 10**2
returns 100, but 10**-2 returns 0.01.  If the second argument is
negative, the third argument must be omitted.  If z is present, x and y
must be of integer types, and y must be non-negative.
