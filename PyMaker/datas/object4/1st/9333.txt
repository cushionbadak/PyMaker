class contextlib.AbstractAsyncContextManagerÂ¶
An abstract base class for classes that implement
object.__aenter__() and object.__aexit__(). A default
implementation for object.__aenter__() is provided which returns
self while object.__aexit__() is an abstract method which by default
returns None. See also the definition of
Asynchronous Context Managers.
