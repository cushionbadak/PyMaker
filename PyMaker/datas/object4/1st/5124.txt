Timeouts and the connect methodÂ¶
The connect() operation is also subject to the timeout
setting, and in general it is recommended to call settimeout()
before calling connect() or pass a timeout parameter to
create_connection().  However, the system network stack may also
return a connection timeout error of its own regardless of any Python socket
timeout setting.
