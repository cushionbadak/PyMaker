winreg.DeleteKeyEx(key, sub_key, access=KEY_WOW64_64KEY, reserved=0)Â¶
Deletes the specified key.

Note
The DeleteKeyEx() function is implemented with the RegDeleteKeyEx
Windows API function, which is specific to 64-bit versions of Windows.
See the RegDeleteKeyEx documentation.

key is an already open key, or one of the predefined
HKEY_* constants.
sub_key is a string that must be a subkey of the key identified by the
key parameter. This value must not be None, and the key may not have
subkeys.
reserved is a reserved integer, and must be zero. The default is zero.
access is an integer that specifies an access mask that describes the desired
security access for the key.  Default is KEY_WOW64_64KEY.  See
Access Rights for other allowed values.
This method can not delete keys with subkeys.
If the method succeeds, the entire key, including all of its values, is
removed. If the method fails, an OSError exception is raised.
On unsupported Windows versions, NotImplementedError is raised.

New in version 3.2.


Changed in version 3.3: See above.
