Enum Members (aka instances)Â¶
The most interesting thing about Enum members is that they are singletons.
EnumMeta creates them all while it is creating the Enum
class itself, and then puts a custom __new__() in place to ensure
that no new ones are ever instantiated by returning only the existing
member instances.
