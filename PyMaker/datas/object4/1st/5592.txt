header_fetch_parse(name, value)Â¶
If the value has a name attribute, it is returned to unmodified.
Otherwise the name, and the value with any CR or LF characters
removed, are passed to the header_factory, and the resulting
header object is returned.  Any surrogateescaped bytes get turned into
the unicode unknown-character glyph.
