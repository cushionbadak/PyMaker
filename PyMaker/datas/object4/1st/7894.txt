turtle.ondrag(fun, btn=1, add=None)¶




Parameters:
fun – a function with two arguments which will be called with the
coordinates of the clicked point on the canvas
btn – number of the mouse-button, defaults to 1 (left mouse button)
add – True or False – if True, a new binding will be
added, otherwise it will replace a former binding





Bind fun to mouse-move events on this turtle.  If fun is None,
existing bindings are removed.
Remark: Every sequence of mouse-move-events on a turtle is preceded by a
mouse-click event on that turtle.
>>> turtle.ondrag(turtle.goto)


Subsequently, clicking and dragging the Turtle will move it across
the screen thereby producing handdrawings (if pen is down).
