load_module(fullname)Â¶
A legacy method for loading a module. If the module cannot be
loaded, ImportError is raised, otherwise the loaded module is
returned.
If the requested module already exists in sys.modules, that
module should be used and reloaded.
Otherwise the loader should create a new module and insert it into
sys.modules before any loading begins, to prevent recursion
from the import. If the loader inserted a module and the load fails, it
must be removed by the loader from sys.modules; modules already
in sys.modules before the loader began execution should be left
alone (see importlib.util.module_for_loader()).
The loader should set several attributes on the module.
(Note that some of these attributes can change when a module is
reloaded):


__name__
The name of the module.



__file__
The path to where the module data is stored (not set for built-in
modules).



__cached__
The path to where a compiled version of the module is/should be
stored (not set when the attribute would be inappropriate).



__path__
A list of strings specifying the search path within a
package. This attribute is not set on modules.



__package__
The parent package for the module/package. If the module is
top-level then it has a value of the empty string. The
importlib.util.module_for_loader() decorator can handle the
details for __package__.



__loader__
The loader used to load the module. The
importlib.util.module_for_loader() decorator can handle the
details for __package__.



When exec_module() is available then backwards-compatible
functionality is provided.

Changed in version 3.4: Raise ImportError when called instead of
NotImplementedError. Functionality provided when
exec_module() is available.


Deprecated since version 3.4: The recommended API for loading a module is exec_module()
(and create_module()).  Loaders should implement
it instead of load_module().  The import machinery takes care of
all the other responsibilities of load_module() when exec_module()
is implemented.
