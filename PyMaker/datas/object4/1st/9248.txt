sys.set_asyncgen_hooks(firstiter, finalizer)Â¶
Accepts two optional keyword arguments which are callables that accept an
asynchronous generator iterator as an argument. The firstiter
callable will be called when an asynchronous generator is iterated for the
first time. The finalizer will be called when an asynchronous generator
is about to be garbage collected.

New in version 3.6: See PEP 525 for more details, and for a reference example of a
finalizer method see the implementation of
asyncio.Loop.shutdown_asyncgens in
Lib/asyncio/base_events.py


Note
This function has been added on a provisional basis (see PEP 411
for details.)
