os.supports_follow_symlinks¶
A Set object indicating which functions in the
os module permit use of their follow_symlinks parameter.  Different
platforms provide different functionality, and an option that might work on
one might be unsupported on another.  For consistency’s sakes, functions that
support follow_symlinks always allow specifying the parameter, but will
raise an exception if the functionality is not actually available.
To check whether a particular function permits use of its follow_symlinks
parameter, use the in operator on supports_follow_symlinks.  As an
example, this expression determines whether the follow_symlinks parameter
of os.stat() is locally available:
os.stat in os.supports_follow_symlinks



New in version 3.3.
