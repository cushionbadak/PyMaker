<p>How could I read a text file with the following list of items:</p>
<pre><code>    milk
    eggs 
    bacon
</code></pre>
<p>and convert them into integers by adding up their ord() values and store them in another file or store them in the same file by overwriting its values? </p>
<p>So far I have: </p>
<pre><code>with open("grocery_items.txt") as f:
     items = [word.strip() for word in f]

text_file = open("item_ordvals.txt", "w+")


c = 2 
for i in items:
    for k in i:
    result = ord(i[0])
    result = result * c + ord(i[k])

text_file.close()
</code></pre>
<p>I read each item from a file named "grocery_items.txt" and stored it into a list called items. 
What essentially Im trying to do is get a unique value for each word in the file by multiplying the first letter of a word in the items list by a constant c and then adding it to the ord values of the rest of the letters in the word. What am I doing wrong so far?   </p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Code:  </p>
<pre><code>with open('list.txt', 'r') as f:
    lines = [line for line in f.read().split('\n')]

numbers = [[ord(character) for character in word] for word in lines] # Use list comprehension to find ord() of each character.
print([word for word in lines][0], sum(numbers[0]))
print([word for word in lines][1], sum(numbers[1]))
print([word for word in lines][2], sum(numbers[2]))
</code></pre>
<p>list.txt:</p>
<pre><code>milk
eggs
bacon
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>milk 429
eggs 422
bacon 515
</code></pre>
<p>What is it doing:  </p>
<ol>
<li>First it is opening the file <code>list.txt</code></li>
<li>Uses Python's list comprehension syntax to find out ord(character) of each character.</li>
<li>Takes sum of all values in list and prints them</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong> </p>
<p>The list comprehension is equivalent to this:</p>
<pre><code>numbers = []
for word in lines:
    for character in word:
        numbers.append(ord(character))
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">On top of that, your method would result to the same number for any xyyyyyy, where x is the first letter and yyyyyy and permutation of the rest.</span>
