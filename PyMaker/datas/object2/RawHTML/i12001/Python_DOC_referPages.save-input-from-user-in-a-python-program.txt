<p>I am writing a program in Python where a user can input information that is saved - even if the program is terminated. How do I implement this?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Assuming you want the user to input a string of data, you can use <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Python_Programming/Input_and_Output" rel="nofollow"><code>raw_input()</code></a> to get it, and then send it to a file using <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/UsingPickle" rel="nofollow"><code>pickle</code></a> library, as mentioned in comments above.</p>
<p>To use <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/UsingPickle" rel="nofollow"><code>pickle</code></a>, you should before <code>open</code> a file in writing mode and then use this file to dump into it your object containing the string. </p>
<p>A secure way to open a file is to use a <a href="http://preshing.com/20110920/the-python-with-statement-by-example/" rel="nofollow"><code>with</code> statement</a>, it will be closed at the end of the statement.</p>
<pre><code>import pickle

myData = raw_input('What is your name ? ')

with open("name.p", "wb" ) as myFile:
    pickle.dump(myData, myFile)
</code></pre>
<p>Later, you can get back the object by opening the pickle file in read mode and store its content in a variable.</p>
<pre><code>import pickle

with open("name.p", "rb" ) as myFile:
    myData = pickle.load(myFile)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Look up <code>pickle</code>. It allows you to easily save ('serialize') data of any Python type and later reimport those.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yup, this is possible :-) You should probably <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/posts/35904441/edit">edit</a> your question to include your code; that way more specific advice can be given. In general, though, I would say using the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>json</code></a> module works quite well for many purposes.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You can write it to a file, use a database etc etc. There are literally tons of storage options. Just search, pick one and go ahead.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@roadrunner66 <code>pickle</code> has security issues (<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/26934565/660921">see here</a>) and I would not advice it unless I'm really sure what it's being used for.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You should <a href="http://www.stackoverflow.com/help/mcve">refer to this</a> to improve your question. That said, what you're actually looking for is a signal handler: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1112343/how-do-i-capture-sigint-in-python" title="how do i capture sigint in python">stackoverflow.com/questions/1112343/â€¦</a></span>
