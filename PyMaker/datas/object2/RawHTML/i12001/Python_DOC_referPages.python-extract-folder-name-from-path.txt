<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have a path as a string in python:</p>
<pre><code>path = "/folder_a/folder_b/folder_c/folder_d"
</code></pre>
<p>How can I extract the name of the last folder ("folder_d") from the <code>path</code>?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html?highlight=basename#os.path.basename" rel="nofollow">os.path.basename</a>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; path = "/folder_a/folder_b/folder_c/folder_d"
&gt;&gt;&gt; import os
&gt;&gt;&gt; os.path.basename(path)
'folder_d'
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Maybe you could try this:</p>
<pre><code>y=path.split('/')
last_folder=y[-1]
</code></pre>
<p>Which is the last item in the list</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Just what I was looking for. Your answer will be accepted in a few minutes. Thanks</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you don't use <code>os.path.basename()</code>, you should at least use <code>os.path.split()</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You're probably right. I am only familiar with os' really basic methods and i didn't know this one. Thanks for pointing it out :)</span>
