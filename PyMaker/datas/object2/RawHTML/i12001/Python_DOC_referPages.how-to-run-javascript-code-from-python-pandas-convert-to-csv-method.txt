<p>I have been working Python pandas DF. I usually Load a csv files, but at the same time I have excel files too. I find out pandas is very slow reading Excel files. I have JavaScript code that will convert from excel to csv. I am looking to way calling this script to automating conversion to csv to speed the pipeline. Basically do conversion behind scene. What is the best way to do this? I can share JS code anytime. </p>

<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35788729/start-node-app-from-python-script">start node app from python script</a> explains how to use <code>python</code> <code>subprocess</code> to run a <code>node.js</code> script.</p>
<p><code>node.js</code> runs <code>javascript</code> code on a <code>v8</code> (chrome) engine.  It's is easy to install on both Linux and Windows.  There's an active SO tag, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/node.js">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/node.js</a></p>
<p>I like <code>coffeescript</code> as a way of writing <code>javascript</code> code with a syntax that is much more like Python.</p>
<p>I've see Python web stack questions (e.g. <code>django</code>) that talk about running <code>javascript</code>, though that might be on the client side rather than the serve.</p>

<p>I follow <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html" rel="nofollow">subprocess</a> method and it worked perfectly for me. Here is what I added to my code, order to run javascript code from python.</p>
<pre><code>Import subprocess
subprocess.check_call(["cscript", "yourjsfile.js"])
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">@IanS I did found both of them. I am taking another look in PyV8, but still not sure if this will solve my problem. Thank you</span>
