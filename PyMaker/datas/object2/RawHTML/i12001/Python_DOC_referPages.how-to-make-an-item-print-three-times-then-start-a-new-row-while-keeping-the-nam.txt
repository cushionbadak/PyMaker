<p>Currently using Python 3.5.1</p>
<p>I've been trying to work on this code for hours. I need this for homework any tips or leads for anything im struggling tired and frustrated.</p>
<p>All I got was</p>
<ul>
<li>HB</li>
<li>HB</li>
<li>HB</li>
<li>HB</li>
</ul>
<p>What I need is HB HB HB</p>
<p>HB HB HB HB</p>
<p>This is my first programming class so all we really worked on was If, else, print, input, while, if i in range, and other basic python statements.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>There are two aspects here:</p>
<ol>
<li>printing 'HB' on the same line multiple times</li>
<li>adding a new line every 3 times HB prints</li>
</ol>
<p>To get HB to print on the same line, you add additional arguments to the print function like this:</p>
<p>print('HB', end='')</p>
<p>The default end is a new line, so this changes it to print on one line.</p>
<p>To have a new line added after every 3 prints, the easiest way is to use the modulus operator (%) so that you add a new line when division by 3 has a 0 remainder.</p>
<p>One way to achieve this for your example would be this:</p>
<pre><code>num_times = int(input('How many times should display HB '))

for i in range(num_times):
    print('HB ', end='')
    if (i + 1)%3 == 0:
        print('\n')
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>For python 3, use argument  <code>end=''</code> (empty string) in the print function to prevent changing lines (see documentation <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print" rel="nofollow">https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print</a>)</p>

<span class="comment-copy">It's really difficult to discern what is going on in that screenshot you posted.  Instead, you should post the code that you are using.  The behavior you are seeing and what is unexpected.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you im learning im just trying to understand it more since I never learned this in class</span>
