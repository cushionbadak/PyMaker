<p>Im having trouble printing twin pairs.</p>
<p>When i first did the code i was geting the first number to be prime but not the second number. </p>
<p>so i took the prime checker and through it in the printTwinPrimeNumbers(twinPrime) function. but now it's saying that num 2 isnt defined. </p>
<p>How do i go about having it check both the first and the second number. </p>
<pre><code># determine if numbers are prime

        if num1 % divisor == 0:

            return False # number is not a prime
        divisor += 1

    return True # number is prime

def printTwinPrimeNumbers(twinPrime):
    NUMBER_OF_PRIMES = 50
    NUMBER_OF_PRIMES_PER_LINE = 1
    num1 = 3 # number to be tested starting point
    count = 0

    for i in range(0, 1001):

        if Prime(num1):
            def prime2(num2):

                num2 = num1 + 2

                    divisor += 1

                return True # number is prime

<p>The variable <code>num2</code> is undefined because it is only defined <em>within</em> <code>prime2</code>, but you use it as a parameter <em>for</em> <code>prime2</code>. Also, <code>prime2</code> is not needed at all, at it is just the same as <code>Prime</code> but with a different parameter. Just use <code>Prime</code> for both <code>num1</code> and <code>num2</code>. </p>
<pre><code>for i in range(0, 1001):
    num1 = i
    num2 = i + 2
    if Prime(num1) and Prime(num2):
        print("(", num1, ",", num2, ")")

<p>Also, this is pretty wasteful, as you are testing the primality of each number twice. Instead, just create a list of all the prime numbers in that range and for each number check whether its "twin" is in that list, too.</p>
