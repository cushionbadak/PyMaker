<p>So I currently have this code at the end of my program that allows the user to save the text file. I have no idea how to convert the data to string and that is what is giving me the error if i try to use this code.</p>
<pre><code>save = input("Would you like to save the latest generation? ('y' to save):")
if save == 'y':
    destination = input("enter destination file name:")
    with open(destination, 'w') as file:
        file.writelines('\t'.join(i) + '\n' for i in original_graph)
else:
    print("End of program.")
</code></pre>
<p>However, my <code>original_graph</code> is a nested list with only integer values, ex: <code>[0,1,1,0],[0,0,0,1],[0,0,1,0]</code></p>
<p>How would I make it so that the text file is looks something like</p>
<p><code>0110
0001
0010</code></p>
<p>in the text file after I save it? Also, is there a way to prompt the user if they were overwrite an existing file?</p>
<p>Thank you for your time.</p>

<p>A compact way to write this is using list comprehensions. For convenience, I'll use <code>stdout</code> as the output file.</p>
<pre><code>import sys

original_graph = [
    [0, 1, 1, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 1],
    [0, 0, 1, 0],
]

f = sys.stdout
rows = [''.join([str(u) for u in row]) for row in original_graph]
f.write('\n'.join(rows) + '\n')
</code></pre>
<p><strong>output</strong></p>
<pre><code>0110
0001
0010
</code></pre>
<p>To save the data to a file whose name is a string stored in <code>destination</code>, just do:</p>
<pre><code>rows = [''.join([str(u) for u in row]) for row in original_graph]
with open(destination, 'w') as f:
    f.write('\n'.join(rows) + '\n')
</code></pre>
<hr/>
<p>To check if a file already exists, use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html#os.path.exists" rel="nofollow"><code>os.path.exists</code></a> function. If you need further help on this aspect please ask a new question. Stack Overflow questions should contain a single question in order to maximize their usefulness for future readers.</p>

<p>Please check this works </p>
<pre><code>original_graph=[[0,1,1,0],[0,0,0,1],[0,0,1,0]]
save = input("Would you like to save the latest generation? ('y' to save):")
if save == 'y':
    destination = input("enter destination file name:")
    with open(destination, 'w') as file:
        file.writelines('\t'.join(str(i) for i in original_graph))
else:
    print("End of program.")

<span class="comment-copy">Do you mind having newlines between your values?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Newlines might be troublesome if I have to reuse the text file again for another program. I don't exactly know how to exclude things.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Is there a way to do it without importing sys? I'm not really sure how it works. And thank you for the advice, I will remember not to ask multiple questions next time.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you so much! I'm going to see if I can fully understand what happens in the line of code. I'm a little haze on what '\n' represents.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@George <code>\n</code> is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_sequence" rel="nofollow noreferrer">escape sequence</a> for the newline character. Similarly, <code>\t</code> is the tab character. So <code>'\n'.join(rows)</code> says to join all the strings in <code>rows</code> into one big string, with a <code>\n</code> between each one. Then we add another <code>\n</code> at the end so that the file ends with a newline.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This works but it prints out the nested list on one line on the text document. What if I wanted something like the example I put in the question on the text file? It wouldn't be a nested list but just rows of numbers.</span>
