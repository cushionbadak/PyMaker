<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Note: I've already tried to find solutions from <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/" rel="nofollow">https://docs.python.org/3/</a> and other stack overflow questions, but I haven't been able to find it.</p>
<p>What I'm looking for is quite simple. While using a code like this:</p>
<pre><code>import turtle
s = turtle.Screen()
def u():
t.forward(50)
s.onkey(u(), "Up")
s.listen()
</code></pre>
<p>It simply runs the code <code>u</code> So first of all: Why does it not wait until I press "Up"? And second, how can I make it so that it does?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You need to do the <code>onkey</code> and <code>listen</code> calls <em>outside</em> the <code>u</code> callback function. </p>
<p>Like this:</p>
<pre><code>import turtle

def u():
    t.forward(50)

s = turtle.Screen()
t = turtle.Turtle()

s.onkey(u, "Up")
s.listen()

turtle.done()
</code></pre>
<p>Note that in <code>s.onkey(u, "Up")</code> I just have <code>u</code> <strong>not</strong> <code>u()</code>. The former passes the function itself to <code>.onkey</code> so it knows what function to call when the <code>"Up"</code> key event occurs. The latter just passes the result of calling <code>u</code> (which is <code>None</code>, since <code>u</code> doesn't have a <code>return</code> statement) to <code>.onkey</code>. </p>
<p>Also, your code omits the <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/turtle.html#turtle.done" rel="nofollow"><code>turtle.done()</code></a> call. That tells turtle to go into the event loop so it will listen for events and respond to them. Without it, the script opens a turtle window and then closes it immediately.</p>
<hr/>
<p>BTW, the code you posted has an <code>IndentationError</code>; correct indentation is <em>vital</em> in Python.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You are calling the function when you put parentheses after it.  Just take those out to pass the function itself rather than what it returns:</p>
<pre><code>import turtle
s = turtle.Screen()

def u():
    t.forward(50)

s.onkey(u, "Up")
s.listen()
</code></pre>
<p>In Python, functions are objects just like everything else.  You don't need parentheses in order to use them.  You could do <code>v = u</code> and you would be able to use <code>v()</code>.  If you were to say <code>u = 4</code>, you wouldn't be able to use <code>u()</code> any more because now <code>u</code> refers to something else.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Thank you, this works. Also about the error, I don't have that in my actual code, for some reason it wouldn't let me indent here. I assumed people would just find the main problem.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@PigglesThePig: 1). Without correct indentation we can't tell what your problem is, since we don't know if there's only the <code>t.forward(50)</code> line inside the <code>u</code> function or if all 3 lines are inside <code>u</code>. 2). The SO code editor is rather rudimentary. The easiest way to use it (IMHO) is to just paste your code into your post, select it, then press the <code>{}</code> button (or click <code>Ctrl-k</code> on your keyboard) to place it in a code block.</span>
