<p>Having a problem recently when using the max() function in python. Here is my code:</p>
<pre><code>x = ["AJK","exit","Down","World","HappyASD"]
max(x)
</code></pre>
<p>But instead of getting "HappyASD", I get "exit".
Any help?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you are looking for the max by length, you need to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#max" rel="nofollow">send the key to the <code>max</code> function</a></p>
<pre><code>x = ["AJK","exit","Down","World","HappyASD"]
max(x, key=len)
</code></pre>
<p>DEMO: </p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; x = ["AJK","exit","Down","World","HappyASD"]
&gt;&gt;&gt; max(x, key=len)
'HappyASD'
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
</code></pre>
<p>If the key is not specified, by default the max is determined by the coerced type.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>ord('e')=101 is higher than ord('H')=72</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>can see no error in here... ord values of first letter in <code>exit</code> are the highest</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>It is because the max() compares the ascii value of the character. I think.
'e' is 0x65, while, 'A' is 0x41, 'D' is 0x44 and so on.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">How are you defining maximum? Longest string?</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>max</code> compares lexicographically, the value of <code>e</code> is higher than <code>H</code>. See <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/34115735/4099593">this</a> answer to know how <code>max</code> works on lists</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I wonder if OP is simply looking for <code>x[-1]</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Please clarify how <i>you</i> are defining "maximum".</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I tried this and it works! Thanks, didn't realise you need to pass anything into the max() function (this is why I hate python). Going to mark this as correct.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@AlexKnight: How do you expect Python to know that you want maximum by string length rather than its default ordering unless you tell it?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@AlexKnight i understand your frustration. Just give it some more time and you will start appreciate the flexibility and simplicity that Python provides.. It is the initial phases you might have a few hiccups with. But trust me, you will like it over time.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">"This is why I hate python", WUT??!? You should know the tools you want to use. You won't expect a car to tell you how to drive it right?</span>
