<p>With <code>os.listdir(some_dir)</code>, we can get all the files from <code>some_dir</code>, but sometimes, there would be 20M files(no sub-dirs) under <code>some_dir</code>, these would be a long time to return 20M strings from <code>os.listdir()</code>.</p>
<p>(We don't think it's a wise option to put 20M files under a single directory, but it's really there and out of my control...)</p>
<p>Is it any other generator-like method to do the list operation like this: once find a file, <code>yield</code> it, we fetch it and then the next file.</p>
<p>I have tried <code>os.walk()</code>, it's really a generator-style tool, but it also call <code>os.listdir()</code> to do the list operation, and it can not handle unicode file names well (UTF-8 names along with GBK names).</p>

<p>If you have python 3.5+ you can use os.scandir() see documentation for <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.scandir" rel="nofollow">scandir</a></p>

<span class="comment-copy">And if you're on pre-3.5 Python, you can get the <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/scandir" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>scandir</code> package</a> for earlier versions of Python (it's the code on which 3.5's <code>os.scandir</code> was based).</span>
