<p>I have read through similar questions on stack overflow, however non of them solve the unicode problem I have: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xc3 in position 302.</p>
<p>Have tried:
    import sys
    reload(sys)
    sys.setdefaultencoding("utf-8")</p>
<p>however receive an error: NameError: name 'reload' is not defined</p>
<p>I try to read file with danish vowels: æ, ø, å. In return receive 'UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xc3 position 302 etc. 
Position 302 and further on include danish vowels. Is there a way to fix this?</p>
<p>So far I have tried putting a specially-formatted comment as the first line of the source code: <code># -*- coding: &lt;ascii&gt; -*-</code>.  Did not give any result.</p>
<p>Also tried: <code>f = open(fname, encoding="ascii", errors="surrogate escape")</code>. But instead of reading file with characters as they are for example in the word "Europæiske" I get "Europ\udcc3\udca6iske".</p>
<p>Then I tried suggestions from the blog (lost a link to that blog) to "import unicodedata", however, it was not well explained where to take it form there.</p>
<pre><code>import unicodedata
import csv

with open('File.csv') as f:
  reader = csv.reader(f)
  for row in reader:
    print(row)
</code></pre>

<p>Simply open with the correct encoding.  You have to know the encoding that the file was saved in.  Western versions of Windows might be <code>Windows-1252</code>, or perhaps <code>utf8</code>.  Modules such as <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/chardet" rel="nofollow">chardet</a> can perform an educated guess. Also, for for <code>csv</code> module, open with <code>newline=''</code> as well (see documentation for using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.reader" rel="nofollow"><code>csv.reader</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>import csv

with open('File.csv',encoding='utf8',newline='') as f:
  reader = csv.reader(f)
  for row in reader:
    print(row)
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>that <code>#-- coding:</code> thing is only for what's being used <em>in the program itself</em>, for example if you define a variable or function with Danish characters.</p>
<p>what you're dealing with is I/O, so remember the rule: bytes on the edges, Unicode inside. this means use <code>str.decode</code> when reading in, and <code>unicode.encode</code> when writing out.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">kchomski, not trying to concatenate but rather read file with danish characters, it is a different case!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you @jcomeau_ictx I understand the problem better now!</span>
