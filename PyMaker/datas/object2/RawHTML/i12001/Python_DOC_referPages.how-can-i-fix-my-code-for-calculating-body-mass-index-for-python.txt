<p>I'm using Python 3.5.1, and I need to make a BMI calculator using the formula 703 * weight/height^2, after I input my height and weight, I get "TypeError: can't multiply sequence by non-int of type 'str'"</p>
<p>And I'm honestly not sure how to fix it. This is my code.</p>
<pre><code>def calculateBMI():
    weight = input("Please enter weight in pounds: ")
    height = input("Please enter height in inches: ")

    return weight * ((703.0) / (height * height))

bmi = calculateBMI()

print ("""Your BMI is""", str(bmi))

if bmi &lt; 18.5:
    print("You are underweight.")
elif bmi &gt; 25:
    print("You are overweight.")
else:
    print ("You are of optimal weight.")
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>There are three errors in your program:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Since you are using Python3, you need to use <code>input()</code>, not <code>raw_input()</code> to read the user's weight and height.</p></li>
<li><p>You need to convert the user's data to a numeric type using <code>int()</code> or <code>float()</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Your indentation is incorrect.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a program that works:</p>
<pre><code>def calculateBMI():
    weight = int(input("Please enter weight: "))
    height = int(input("Please enter height: "))

    return weight * ((703.0) / (height * height))
bmi = calculateBMI()

print ("""Your BMI is""", str(bmi))

if bmi &lt; 18.5:
    print("You are underweight.")
elif bmi &gt; 25:
    print("You are overweight.")
else:
    print ("You are of optimal weight.")
</code></pre>

<p>Before I help out, I just wanted to point out that the code you have pasted has no indentation.  Python is indentation-sensitive -- did you just paste it wrong, or is this how your code actually looks? :)</p>
<p>Now, there are probably two problems here:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Python version</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>When I try running this code, it is able to take input from the
    command line fine.  I am using Python 2.7.8.  The <code>raw_input</code> method
    has been renamed to <code>input</code> in Python 3.  So, if you are using
    Python 3, you should change the <code>raw_input</code> to <code>input</code>.</p>
<p>If you are on Linux, you can find out your Python version on the console like this:</p>
<pre><code>    $ python --version
</code></pre>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Floats and strings</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>When you take input from the command line, using <code>input</code> or <code>raw_input</code>, it is saved as a string, as shown here in the docs</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input" rel="nofollow">https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input</a></p>
<p>If you want to multiply the two values together, you have to convert them to float, like this:</p>
<pre><code>weight = float(input("Please enter weight: "))
height = float(input("Please enter height: "))
</code></pre>
<p>I hope this solves your problems :)</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Does your real program have any indentation?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Are you using Python2 or Python3? Python2 has <code>raw_input</code>, Python3 doesn't.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What version of python are you running? raw_input is specific to python2</span>
<span class="comment-copy">yup, I just kind of sloppily indented here so I could post it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What is the error message?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you so much! This does work. I also added weight "in pounds" and height "in inches" so that it's less confusing.</span>
