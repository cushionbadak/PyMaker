<p>I really don't understand the max or min functions, the meaning of them. For instance, when i write these in the notepad++, in the output i see a letter of the word. And i can't understand it. Why only this letter, not another letters of this word? 
Please, help me on this way. Thanks</p>
<p><strong>In the Notepad++</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>x = max ("Hello Home")</li>
<li>print x</li>
<li>y = min ("World")</li>
<li>print y</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In the Output</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>o</p></li>
<li><p>W</p></li>
</ul>

<p>As per the ASCII table</p>
<ul>
<li>Capital letters points to decimal 65 to 90 (65-90 → A-Z )</li>
<li>Small letters points to decimal 97-122 (97-122 → a-z)</li>
</ul>
<p>so, max value = o (decimal 111)
min value = W (decimal 87)</p>

<p>To find out why, you can <code>map</code> <code>ord</code> over the strings:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; list(map(ord, "Hello Home"))
[72, 101, 108, 108, 111, 32, 72, 111, 109, 101]
</code></pre>
<p>The highest number in there is 111, which corresponds to "o" (the ASCII value of "o" is 111).</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Did you read the documentation on <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#min" rel="nofollow noreferrer">min</a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#max" rel="nofollow noreferrer">max</a>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Look <a href="http://www.asciitable.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a> for the answer.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It's all in the <i>ASCII values</i>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What is it you are trying to achieve?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Letters have a numerical value assigned to them and <code>min</code> or <code>max</code> will find the minimum or maximum of those numerical values.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I don't hear about ASCII table. But now i understand my question's answer. Thank you very much for information.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I understand the meaning of them. But now i have another question for you.  Although they have same values, is it first "o" or second "o" ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It really makes no difference in this case, but technically it should be the first "o".</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I understand. Thank you for information and help.</span>
