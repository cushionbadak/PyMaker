<p>New here and hoping I can help as much as I am helped. Basically, I have been tasked with writing a fizzbuzz program in Python and so far so good except for some feedback I received. </p>
<p>Now I have to ensure that the output of my program comes across horizontally and is not printed vertically on new lines. From my understanding, and my lecturers hinting, I need to turn function to produce strings and remove the print statements as well.</p>
<p>Code is below:</p>
<pre><code>def fizzbuzz1 (num):
    for num in range(1, num): 
        if (num%3 == 0) and (num%5 == 0): 
             print("Fizzbuzz")
        elif ((num % 3) == 0):
             print("Fizz")
        elif ((num % 5) == 0):
             print("buzz")
        else :
             print (num)

def main (): 
    while True: #Just to keep my program up and running while I play with it
    num = input ("please type a number: ") #
    num = int (num)
    print ("Please select an type what option you wish to try: A) Is this Fizz or Buzz? B) Count saying fizz/buzz/fizzbuzz") 
    opt = input ("Please type A or B and press enter: ")
    if opt == "A": 
        fizzbuzz(num)
    elif (opt == "a")
        fizzbuzz(num)
    elif (opt == "B"):
        print (fizzbuzz1(num))
    elif (opt == "b"):
        print (fizzbuzz1(num))

main ()

<p>I have tried a whole host of things, and my lecturer doesn't seem too interested in help me. Womp. I was recommended to review this exercise were I played with this piece of code:</p>
<pre><code>def func(num):
value = ‘’
for x in range(...):
    if   .... == .... :
        value += str(x) + ‘, ‘
return value[…]# You need to remove the last comma and the space
</code></pre>
<p>When I do play with this code, I do get numbers to go across the screen. But for the life of me I can not seem to incorporate what I have written with elements from this. Where am I going astray? </p>
<p>Thank you for any and all your advice/help. If you do choose to reply, please keep it as simple as possible for me.</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>
<p>Update: Thanks everyone for your suggestions, lots of thimgs I didnt know to try! </p>
<p>I also found a thread here at: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18458024/cant-figure-out-how-to-print-horizontally-in-python">Can't figure out how to print horizontally in python?</a></p>

<p>Try printing without a new line, if you use Python 3.x</p>
<pre><code>def fizzbuzz1 (num):
for num in range(1, num): 
    if (num%3 == 0) and (num%5 == 0): 
        print("Fizzbuzz ", end="")
    elif ((num % 3) == 0):
        print("Fizz ", end="")
    elif ((num % 5) == 0):
        print("buzz ", end="")
    else:
        print ( str(num) + " ")
print(" ")

<p>You're very close.  The approach I would take would be to store the results in a list, then <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.join" rel="nofollow"><code>join</code></a> the contents of the list to make the output string.  Here's an example:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def fizzbuzz1(num):
...     fb = []
...
...     # Iterate through the range, then use `fb.append()` to append the
...     # new element to the end of the list.
...     for n in range(1, num):
...         if not (n%3 or n%5):
...             fb.append('Fizzbuzz')
...         elif not n%3:
...             fb.append('Fizz')
...         elif not n%5:
...             fb.append('Buzz')
...         else:
...             fb.append(str(n))
...
...     return ', '.join(fb)
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; fizzbuzz1(20)
'1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 11, Fizz, 13, 14, Fizzbuzz, 16, 17, Fizz, 19'

<span class="comment-copy">If i understanding right it sounds like they want you to add values to a string and then print the string once at the end.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Gather the results in a <code>list</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">When is the program supposed to exit to print the result? You have a <code>while True</code> that doesn't stop</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Add a comma to the end of all print statements to suppress linefeed</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Alright, you also should indent the code under the <code>while True</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hi Yunhe,   That did the trick. Amazing. But can I ask, how does the , and end = "" actually make it work?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Also, I am unsure if this will fly with my lecturer as the print statement is still within the function (He doesn't want it in there), however I am very, very impressed with it myself. However thanks again, this really did help me.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">print is treated as a function in Python 3.x and end = "" means the line ends with "" rather than a linebreak. Hope it helps!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Tyvm,  I will try this. I havent been taught thay yet so if I oull it off I will have to make sure I can explain it. Again, ty.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you can't use join a do a for each loop and append each item in the list and ", " @Buggs</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hi Doug R, your suggestion did the trick for me. I will have to learn mour about the .append however in order to explain how it actually works.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Buggs - Glad to help.  <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.5/tutorial/datastructures.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>list.append()</code></a> does exactly what it sounds like--it appends a new element to the end of the list.  You can also accomplish the same thing by changing <code>fb.append('Fizzbuzz')</code> to <code>fb += ['Fizzbuzz']</code>, but it's slower and a less Pythonic way to do it.  There's a discussion of the two methods <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/725882/1843248">here</a>.</span>
