<p>I'm writing code for a project, and when using SQLite3 I came across this error that I can't seem to fix.</p>
<p>I've looked up the answer before, but it always seems to be a case of the SQLite reading a variable as a column title, but here the column it can't find isn't one of my variables so I'm a bit lost. </p>
<p>I am attempting to insert data from variables into an SQLite database, and while at first I got a simpler version working okay, now that I try and integrate it into my full code I'm getting stuck again.</p>
<p>Here's a trial version that I'm using to get the whole thing working before I try and use it properly:</p>
<pre><code>c.execute("CREATE TABLE TEST (GIFNAME, TagStyle, TagEvent, TagTime)")
def SaveStyle():
    if (GIFName.get() != "") and (TagStyle.get() != ""):
        #print(GIFName.get(), ", ", TagStyle.get(), ", ", TagEvent.get(), ", ", TagTime.get())
        #Saved1=tk.Label(window4, text="Saved!", fg="#ffffff", bg="#D0CEC2")
        #Saved1.grid(row=9, column=1)
        c.execute("INSERT INTO TEST VALUES (%s,%s,%s,%s)" %(GIFName2, TagStyle2, TagEvent2, TagTime2))
        conn.commit()
        c.execute("select * from TEST")
        print(c.fetchall())
</code></pre>
<p>I know the code isn't great, I'm relatively new to coding so it's not exactly perfect, I just want to get that one part fixed because it will be used for quite a few parts of my program.</p>
<p>The 4 variables its grabbing are being used because the original ones are <code>tk.StringVar()</code> and the sqlite kept coming back saying they were unsupported.</p>
<p>Here is the full error message:</p>
<pre><code>"Exception in Tkinter callback

</code></pre>
<p>(Sorry I had to format this as code, it wouldn't let me post it as a quote)</p>
<p>Originally I was using <code>?</code> instead of <code>%s</code> but it kept saying my variables were unsupported, and a friend is using <code>%s</code> and got it working, but she can't remember what she did, and now she's lost the file so I can't try and use it for help.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for your help, and if I've missed any information, let me know.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The syntax of your INSERT INTO statement isn't quite right.</p>
<p>It should be:</p>
<pre><code>c.execute("INSERT INTO TEST VALUES (?,?,?,?)", (GIFName2, TagStyle2, TagEvent2, TagTime2))
</code></pre>
<p>A question mark (?) is the parameter substitution symbol for sqlite in python; using this will ensure that your data is inserted into the database securely - see the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html" rel="nofollow">sqlite3 documentation</a>. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">Have you tried searching this site for <code>PY_VAR0</code>? This sort of question comes up a lot, and it's always due to the same reason.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This gets it to save something, so  thank you, but if I force it to read the variables as strings it just says that they are "Py_Var0" 1,2,3, but if I don't force it to read them as strings it says they are 'probably unsupported'</span>
<span class="comment-copy">As @BryanOakley suggested in his comment, have a look at questions like <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24768455/tkinter-intvar-returning-py-var0-instead-of-value" title="tkinter intvar returning py var0 instead of value">stackoverflow.com/questions/24768455/â€¦</a> - you probably need to call .get() on the variables you're saving to get their values, for example GifName2.get() instead of just GifName2.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yeah, I just tried that, and it's working now so thank you :)</span>
