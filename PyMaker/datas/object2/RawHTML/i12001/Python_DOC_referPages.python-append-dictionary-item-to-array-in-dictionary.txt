<p>What is the proper way to append dictionary value to array of dictionaries?</p>
<p>Original dictionary: </p>
<pre><code>dict = {
            "myIPs": [
                    {"IP": "10.0.0.1/32"},
                    {"IP": "10.0.0.2/32"}
                 ]
       }

print dict['myIPs'] -&gt; [{'IP': '10.0.0.1/32'}, {'IP': '10.0.0.2/32'}] 
</code></pre>
<p>Trying:</p>
<pre><code>dictarray = dict['myIPs']
dictarray = newdict.append({"IP": "10.0.0.3/32"})

print newdict -&gt; None
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>In your example, the normal way would be:</p>
<pre><code>dict['myIPs'].append( {'IP' : '10.0.0.3/32'} )
</code></pre>
<p>You can access the array object directly via the <code>dict</code> handle and it's subsequent key called <code>myIPs</code>. This will give you direct access to the array and it's functions. In this case <code>append()</code>.</p>
<p>It's quite straight forward once you get used to working with dictionaries.<br/>
One way to look at it, is the way you print the array by accessing it via <code>print dict['myIPs']</code>, is the same way you'll modify it by accessing it with <code>dict['myIPs'].append()</code>. I hope this makes sense.</p>
<h2><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html" rel="nofollow"><code>__builtins__</code></a> - Do not re-use built in functions!</h2>
<p>It's a big no-no to re-use system defined/built in functions.<br/>
One of which happens to be <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-dict" rel="nofollow">dict</a>.</p>
<p>So please consider changing your variable name to something more appropriate.</p>
<pre><code>system_info = {
            "myIPs": [
                    {"IP": "10.0.0.1/32"},
                    {"IP": "10.0.0.2/32"}
                 ]
       }

system_info['myIPs'].append( {'IP' : '10.0.0.3/32'} )
print(system_info['myIPs'])
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can just use:</p>
<pre><code>dict['myIPs'].append({"IP": "10.0.0.3/32"})
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>dict["myIPs"].append(item)
</code></pre>
<p>should work for your situation.</p>
<p>PS: better not use names like "dict", it can be confusing. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">What is <code>newdict</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Try not to use variable names like <code>dict</code>, when they are built-in things (<code>dict</code> is the type for dictionaries)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, I'm not using dict in my code, I changed the parameter names here, but you are correct had to avoid using builtins.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@DmitryR Glad to hear. I'll still point it out and leave my answer as it is for the next programmer that comes along and copies your code : ) Just so they know what to avoid. Cheers for clarifying!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">As described in two post previously over 30 minutes ago. I'm not trying to be rude or point to my own nor the other guys answer. I just think this is a bit redundant at this point : )</span>
