<p>I am very new to type hinting in Python 3, and have tried reading and understanding the PEP, and I'm struggling with this.</p>
<p>I have a function that returns the iterator from re.finditer()</p>
<pre><code>def get_collected_issues(book: Book) -&gt; Iterator:
    """Parse the 'collecting' part of the book description, for series names and issue details.
    """
    collecting = get_collecting(book)
    return re.finditer(FULL_REGEX, collecting, re.IGNORECASE)
</code></pre>
<p>When inspecting at runtime, each iteration of finditer() is a <code>_sre.SRE_Match</code> object, but that's not importable, so I'm not sure how I can make the return type hint any more specific.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The <code>typing.re.Match</code> was added for exactly this reason. </p>
