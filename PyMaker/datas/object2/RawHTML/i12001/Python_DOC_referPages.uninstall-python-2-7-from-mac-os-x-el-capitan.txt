<p>I want to completely reinstall Python 2 but none of the guides I have found allow me to uninstall it. No matter what I do, <code>python --version</code> still returns 2.7.10, even after I run the Python 2.7.11 installer. All the other guides on StackOverflow tell me to remove a bunch of files, but python is still there.</p>

<p>I was looking to do the same.  But I came across this paragraph at the Foundation (<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/using/mac.html#getting-and-installing-macpython">Getting and uninstalling MacPython</a>) which convinced me to leave well alone and not uninstall it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Apple-provided build of Python is installed in /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework and /usr/bin/python, respectively. <strong><em>You should never modify or delete these, as they are Apple-controlled and are used by Apple- or third-party software.</em></strong> Remember that if you choose to install a newer Python version from python.org, you will have two different but functional Python installations on your computer, so it will be important that your paths and usages are consistent with what you want to do.</p>

<p>Set your an alias to use the python version that you want to use from inside your <code>.bashrc</code> (or zsh if you use it).</p>
<p>Like: 
<code>alias python='/usr/bin/python3.4'</code></p>

<p>Agree with the accepted answer that uninstalling is a bad idea, but for those of you using HomeBrew to install your own Python, you don't need an alias as in @Mat Marsiglio's answer.  Rather you can do what the HomeBrew installation suggestions:</p>
<pre><code>export PATH="/usr/local/opt/python/libexec/bin:$PATH"
</code></pre>
<p>This gives brew's python precedence over the built-in one at /usr/bin/python</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Have you looked at your bash profile?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I have followed <i>every</i> guide. My bash profile is clean.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Try typing <code>which -a python</code> What do you see? Are you trying to replace the system Python? -- not a great idea...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Not a good idea because many system supplied programs could use it, and they will not have been tested on the new version.  In addition some might be written in C which should be linked with the version specific libraries.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Not a great idea because you will confuse OS X updates in the future. Also, the system Python in OS X is a framework and cannot be removed entirely. You should just install the newer version of Python in its own location and change your PATH or do an alias to have your new version execute instead of the system version.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I want to actually uninstall it completely, not just use a different version.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I see! Maybe it can help you out: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3819449/how-to-uninstall-python-2-7-on-a-mac-os-x-10-6-4" title="how to uninstall python 2 7 on a mac os x 10 6 4">stackoverflow.com/questions/3819449/â€¦</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">As I've said, I followed every guide, including that one. It was not enough.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is not the correct answer. Pedro wants to UNINSTALL not to rename his actual version</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@acostela yes I got it wrong.</span>
