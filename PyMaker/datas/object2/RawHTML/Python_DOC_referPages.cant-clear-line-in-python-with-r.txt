<p>So I'm trying to make kind of a progress bar in Python, and in a for-loop I wrote this:</p>
<pre><code>print(i, end='\r', flush=True)
sleep(0.1)
</code></pre>
<p>so it's supposed to write <code>0</code> then <code>1</code>, etc. But instead I get something like:</p>
<pre><code>0123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839
</code></pre>
<p>What am I doing wrong?</p>
<p>Update: I am using Spyder.</p>
<p>Here is the entire loop:</p>
<pre><code>for i in range(it):
    _sum += z**i * f(i)
    print(i, end='\r', flush=True)
    sleep(0.1)
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>This works for me as intended, it is hard to tell what the problem with your code was, since you only posted fractional code</p>
<p>If you are using a for loop with a list, then it must be formatted properly. use a list if you plan to use out of order numbers.</p>
<pre><code>import time
numbers = ['1','2','3','4','5','6','7']

for number in numbers:
    print(number, end='\r', flush=True)
    time.sleep(0.5)
</code></pre>
<p>If you want a sequential enumeration, then you can use a canonical expression:</p>
<pre><code>for number in range(20):
    print(number, end='\r', flush=True)
    time.sleep(1)
</code></pre>
<p>Or if you want to use a while loop</p>
<pre><code>import time
n = 0
while n &lt;= 15:
    n += 1
    print(n, end='\r', flush=True)
    time.sleep(0.5)
</code></pre>
<p>All three loops work as intended and in almost the same way</p>

<span class="comment-copy">please add your code including loop and what is that at the bottom? a list?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Where is the output going?  To a terminal screen?  Are you using a IDE?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The canonical way of doing it is <code>for i in range(n):</code>, <code>i</code> is the number and <code>n</code> is the number of iterations.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Right, in my example the numbers are sequential in the list, so canonical expression would works, but if you notice his example is a long random list thus your approach would not work. But sure let's add it</span>
<span class="comment-copy">OP's list does not seem random at all to me, it's <code>0</code> then <code>1</code> then <code>2</code> all the way up to <code>37</code> then <code>38</code> then <code>39</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You are right. Well, if he want to use an out of order list, then he has an example to choose from. cheers</span>
<span class="comment-copy">i can confirm what @Tomothy32 said. It's literally printing all the numbers without clearing the previous ones.</span>
