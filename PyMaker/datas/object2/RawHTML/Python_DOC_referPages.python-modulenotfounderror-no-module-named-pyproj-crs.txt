<p>I tried to import pyproj, and this error occurred.</p>
<pre><code>import pyproj

<p>At first, I thought it has problem with pyproj, but after I reinstalled the latest version of pyproj,</p>
<p>this error still occurred. I also tried to import cartopy.crs and same problem happened.</p>
<pre><code>import cartopy.crs as ccrs
Traceback (most recent call last):

<p>How can I do with this problem? Is there a <em>set</em> <em>of</em> <em>coordinate</em> <em>reference</em> <em>system</em> that I can download </p>
<p>somewhere, or should I remove all about my python and reinstall? I'm really hoping to avoid that.</p>
<p>Any advice, please!</p>

<p>Some more information would be helpful. </p>
<p>It appears that you are running these in iPython, how are you launching the instance of ipython?</p>
<p>How did you install these modules?  Are you sure the module was installed to the same instance of python you are using for iPython ? (ie using <code>pip3</code> vs <code>pip</code>)</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I used spyder 3.3.1, and I installed it from anaconda prompt, using conda install !</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hmmmm... that seems like that should work but I don't have a lot of experience with Anaconda on Windows...  You mentioned the option of using a different coordinate library, I typically use pymap3d. <a href="https://github.com/scivision/pymap3d" rel="nofollow noreferrer">github.com/scivision/pymap3d</a> . Perhaps you will have better luck with that?</span>
