<p>i need to convert a csv into a list  and count the amount of 'z's in a row and print out the row headers of 5 rows with the top amount of Z's. Also links to more help would be great! thank you</p>
<p>Here is my current code</p>
<pre><code>economistData = open('C:/foo.csv','r')
economistDataList = []s
for line in economistData:
    economistDataList.append(line.split(','))


for row in economistDataList:
    rowcnt = row.count('z')
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Since you mentioned that you had to do this <strong>without using the csv module</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>z_counts = []
lines = []

with open('C://foo.csv', 'r') as f:
    lines = f.readlines() #This is your list of all the rows/lines (now populated with data)
    for index, line in enumerate(lines):
        #store the z counts and the index of the line as pairs using a tuple: `( ... )`
        z_counts.append((line.strip().split('z').count('z'), index))

    #Since you want the top 5 matches
    #Reverse is necessary since Python automatically sorts in ascending order
    print sorted(z_counts, reverse=True)[:5]
</code></pre>
<p>Using the following sample data:</p>
<pre><code>a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,j,i,p
a,e,f,g,h,d,e,g,z,g,z
z,z,z,c,x,s,e,f,d,s,f
q,e,r,s,f,t,y,y,u,i,f
e,p,l,l,k,k,z,z,q,e,r
o,i,i,j,l,s,w,e,r,q,g
w,e,r,f,g,s,v,h,d,b,z
t,r,y,e,u,i,o,p,d,f,j
</code></pre>
<p>Which, if you observe, has the following z counts:</p>
<pre><code>0
2
3
0
2
0
1
0
</code></pre>
<p>We obtain the following output (a list of tuples with the sorted corresponding z counts, and the index of that z count):</p>
<pre><code>[(3, 2), (2, 4), (2, 1), (1, 6), (0, 7)]
</code></pre>
<p>OUTPUT:</p>
<p>Let's print it out to see what it looks like:</p>
<pre><code>for tpl in sorted(z_counts, reverse=True)[:5]:
    print lines[tpl[1]]
</code></pre>
<p>Which outputs:</p>
<pre><code>z,z,z,c,x,s,e,f,d,s,f     #3 z's, line index 2 (3rd line)
e,p,l,l,k,k,z,z,q,e,r     #2 z's, line index 4 (5th line)
a,e,f,g,h,d,e,g,z,g,z     #2 z's, line index 1 (2nd line)
w,e,r,f,g,s,v,h,d,b,z     #1 z, line index 6 (7th line)
t,r,y,e,u,i,o,p,d,f,j     #0 z's, line index 7 (8th line)
</code></pre>
<p>As expected.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">it must be done in a list, i'm helping someone with school work. no csv module</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Or more politely, Python's standard lib has a module for CSV files. Is there any reason not to use it? (docs: <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html</a>). It can parse stuff into a 2d list but will escape stuff properly.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Although overkill, go look at pandas. You get get counts from a csv file in many different, much easier ways. Spend some time on it, enlighten yourself.</span>
