<p>I want to print a token that has certain character in a list.</p>
<p>For example, </p>
<pre><code>list = ["cat","lion","elephant"]
</code></pre>
<p>and I want to print a token that has 4 character, which is lion.
How can I print a token that has only 4 character?</p>
<p>it should produce lion</p>

<p>Firstly, don't call your variable <code>list</code> since that name is already used by a built-in function. </p>
<p>As for your question, you can try using <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#next" rel="nofollow"><code>next()</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; l = ["cat", "lion", "elephant"]
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; next(s for s in l if len(s) == 4)
'lion'
</code></pre>
<p>If you want all strings of length 4 as a list you can do something similar with a <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions" rel="nofollow">list comprehension</a>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; l = ["cat", "lion", "elephant", "fish"]
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; [s for s in l if len(s) == 4]
['lion', 'fish']
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>for x in list:
    if len(x) == 4:
        print x
</code></pre>
<p>I recommend learning the basics of Python before asking questions that can easily be found already with a simple <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=find%20the%20length%20of%20a%20python%20string&amp;oq=find%20the%20length%20of%20a%20python%20string&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.5914j0j9&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;espvd=210&amp;es_sm=119&amp;ie=UTF-8" rel="nofollow">google search</a></p>
<p>Be sure that in your real program you don't use <code>list</code> as your var name. It is already used in Python</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>One way to print an item that has a specific amount of characters is to use a for loop. It allows you to iterate through a list. </p>
<p>Then you can use the length function to test if the item is equal to the amount of characters. If it is, then you can print it.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>list = ["cat","lion","elephant"]

for i in list:
    if len(i) == 4:
        print i
</code></pre>
<p>Another way of doing this is to use list comprehensions, which outputs a list that you can print. This is useful if you have multiple items in the list that has 4 characters. You can then store it in a list for future use.</p>
<p>An example:</p>
<pre><code>new_list = [x for x in list if len(x) == 4]
print new_list
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">You mean you want to find the one value in the list that has length 4?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It's <code>len()</code> (as opposed to <code>length()</code>).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Oh yeah, thanks, I'll change that.</span>
