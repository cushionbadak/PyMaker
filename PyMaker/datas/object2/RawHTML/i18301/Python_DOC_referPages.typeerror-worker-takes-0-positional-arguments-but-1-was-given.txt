<p>I'm trying to implement a subclass and it throws the error: </p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Your <code>worker</code> method needs 'self' as a parameter, since it is a class method and not a function. Adding that should make it work fine.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If the method doesn't require <code>self</code> as an argument, you can use the <code>@staticmethod</code> decorator to avoid the error:</p>
<pre><code>class KeyStatisticCollection(DataDownloadUtilities.DataDownloadCollection):

    def GenerateAddressStrings(self):
        pass    

    @staticmethod
    def worker():
        pass

<span class="comment-copy">There was a boat-load of code and explanation which was completely unrelated to the very simple problem you had and hid the error.

<span class="comment-copy">First time I saw that error, I scratched my head for a long time. Then from my experience and confirmation by your answer was able to figure out that my class method with 0 arguments, at runtime, was supplied with 'self' argument, which was giving me this error.  Intricacies of python.</span>
