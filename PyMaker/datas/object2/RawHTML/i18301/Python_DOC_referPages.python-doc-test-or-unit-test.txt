<p>I have a bit trouble with python testing.
Below is a simple doctest in python. the information between """ has to be in the same file with the actual code.</p>
<p>I remembered somebody told me that I can put </p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print( 2 + 2 )
4
</code></pre>
<p>Into a separate file if the output is too much or too long. When you do the doctest, open the file and compare. </p>
<p>I just can't remember how to do that now.</p>
<p>Can any body help me?</p>
<p>thanks</p>
<pre><code>def _test():
    import doctest
    doctest.testmod()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    _test()
</code></pre>

<p>I came across this from a Google search as I had the same issue. I noticed there is an answer in the comments but the question is unanswered so adding a proper answer for future visitors. </p>
<p>From the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs</a>: </p>
<pre><code>import doctest
doctest.testfile("example.txt")
</code></pre>
<p>This allows you to specify code in a test file and run a test using this file. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">You're right about the fact that <code>doctest</code> can be used to run tests that are written out in a test file, but more or less all of your actual examples are off in different ways. Check the <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">doctest documentation</a> to see how test files work.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks!!! Test file!! that is the key word in search!!!  import doctest doctest.testfile("example.txt")  Thanks so much!!!!</span>
