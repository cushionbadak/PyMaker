<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I want to download source of webpages by providing a file which contains a list of their URLs.
For example, I have a file which has following URLs </p>
<pre><code>http://www.adobe.com/support/security/bulletins/apsb09-19.html
http://www.adobe.com/support/security/bulletins/apsb09-20.html                                                                                                
</code></pre>
<p>Can I do it using <code>urllib</code> because I want to use python modules not the unix commands (like wget)?</p>
<p>I want read this file and give each URL as input to urlopen or urlretrieve, can anyone tell me how to do that?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Try to break down the issue as best as you can. You've got a text file with each URL listed on its own line. You know that Python's got great support for reading line by line, thanks to <code>open()</code>, and you're probably familiar with <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/howto/urllib2.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>urllib</code></a> or <a href="http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>requests</code></a>, depending on your preference.</p>
<p>So all you need to do is:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><a href="http://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/inputoutput.html#methods-of-file-objects" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Open the file</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/13724964/541208">Read line by line</a></p></li>
<li><p>Use the line as an URL string</p></li>
<li><p>Send a request to the URL using <a href="http://docs.python.org/3.1/howto/urllib2.html#fetching-urls" rel="nofollow noreferrer">urllib</a> or <a href="http://www.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/quickstart/#make-a-request" rel="nofollow noreferrer">requests</a></p></li>
<li><p>Capture the output and parse it/save it</p></li>
</ol>
<p>And you're done!</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Are you having a specific problem doing this? What have you tried?</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>wget -i &lt;file&gt;</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">I don't know how to do that,not tried anything...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Wayne Werner Can u give brief description about that...?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Kummi_10 <code>man wget</code> should get you started...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Can show me how to Use the line as an URL string...?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Kummi_10 You've got the line read into Python as a string, you then need to pass that string variable to the urllib/requests methods responsible for that.  In the answer listed in <code>2.</code>, you're able to see how he reads each line and calls it 'row'. If you call yours 'url' and do <code>requests.get(url)</code>, you should be in a good place to work out the rest.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you very much............. :)</span>
