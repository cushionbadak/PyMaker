<p>Is it possible to log messages that are generated by 3rd party application in python? My code depends on a 3rd party service which is originally implemented in C++, and has python wrapper. It logs various messages through printf() to the stdout. So, when I run my python code with logging, these 3rd party messages aren't logged.</p>
<p>Moreover, I want to send all my log messages to another server through python requests framework. For the messages I log in the python file, I can immeditately send a post request, but what should I do for those 3rd party messages which get directly written to the stdout?</p>

<p>One of the simple way is to get the contents in a string and then send it to your server under a specific request. Make your server listen to that request. </p>
<p>Here's is a code to get the logs in a string:</p>
<pre><code>import logging
try:
    from cStringIO import StringIO      # Python 2
except ImportError:
    from io import StringIO

log_stream = StringIO()    
logging.basicConfig(stream=log_stream, level=logging.INFO)
</code></pre>
