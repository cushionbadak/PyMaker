<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have text file in alphabetic order looking like this in Python:</p>
<p>At 210.001 \n
Au 196.9665 \n
B  10.81 \n
Ba 137.34 \n</p>
<p>I would like to have it sorted by numbers instead of letters. I was thinking that I could make a list of each row within a list and from there sort by index one? That also means that the space between the letters and the numbers need to be a ",".</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can split it and then sort by an additional split:</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>splitlist = mylist.split('\n') # Split at new line
splitlist.sort(key=lambda line:float(line.split()[-1])) # Inline sort
</code></pre>
<p>Now <code>splitlist</code> will be sorted by the last (second) column.</p>
<p>To break it down, <code>mylist.sort()</code> is an <strong>inline</strong> sort (it changes the order of the list without making a new one). Then you can specify a <code>key</code>. The <code>key</code> must be a callable that takes <code>key(item)</code>. So I made a <code>lambda</code> function to (1) split the line [<code>line.split()</code>], (2) take the last item of the split <code>[-1]</code> and then (3) convert it to <code>float()</code> so it can be compared</p>
<p>I hope this helps</p>
<h3>Additional tip</h3>
<p>(to try to address the comment)</p>
<p>You can also make a dictionary:</p>
<pre><code>splitlines = [line.split() for line in splitlist]
atoms = {name:float(weight) for name,weight in splitlines}
</code></pre>
<p>Then you can query it by <code>atom['Na']</code> for example</p>

<span class="comment-copy">What language do you want?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sorry, I'm new here, Python!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Oh wow the sorting thing really worked! But later in I would like just call upon the atoms/the strings and the atom weight/the float. Is it possible now when I do not have the lists?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@J.Doe I added an additional tip that should help. In my original answer I assumed you wanted the lines. You could have just kept them split if you wanted the separately or, as I also suggest, use a dictionary to help speed it up</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That was very useful! Although, if I really wanted it to be lists, how do I do?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The <code>splitlines</code> object in my edit is a list of lists from your data</span>
