<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I would like to use <code>@client.event</code> to kick and ban people using commands only because I never get <code>@bot.commands</code> or <code>@client.commands</code> to work although there is no error OR bot response.
I can’t find the right code and therefore, I cannot show the code.
And if possible, make a way to sence if a user has permission.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You could do something like:</p>
<pre><code>@client.event
async def on_message(message):
  if message.content.startswith("!kick"):
  await client.kick(message.content[len("!kick"):].strip())
</code></pre>
<p>But if commands aren't working that should be the first thing you try to solve.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I do not understand why you don't want to use <code>@client.command</code>
Basically, this would be a correct command to kick or ban anyone using a command</p>
<pre><code>@client.command()
async def kick(ctx, user:discord.Member):
    await user.kick()
</code></pre>
<p>but if you do not want to use <code>@client.command</code> then I guess you can use</p>
<pre><code>@client.event
async def on_message(message):
    if message.content.startswith(f'{your_prefix_here}kick') and member.has_permissions(permission_you_want=True):
        user = message.guild.get_member(int(message.content.split()[1].replace('&lt;', '').replace('@', ''))) # You can kick with !kick @them or !kick their_ID
        await user.kick()
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Why don't you look at the documentation at <a href="https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html</a> and post when you have some code and an actual question</span>
<span class="comment-copy">sorry but I’m new</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I mean I am new to this site so I was in a rush so I didn’t write an actual question, I am not new to python in general but somewhat new to discord.py</span>
<span class="comment-copy">"I'm having trouble using a screwdriver to drive in  this screw, so how can I use a halibut to do the same thing?" -- if the right tool doesn't work, the appropriate course of action is to figure out <i>why</i> it doesn't work (asking a question here with a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve">Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example</a> showing that usage mode that didn't work would be a great way to do that), not to give up on it and use the wrong tool instead.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">but @clent.event still works even if it is not the best option</span>
<span class="comment-copy">it says str has no attribute id</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Your first command kicks someone else, but the second command always kicks the person calling it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">the reason why I don’t use @client.command is that I NEVER get it to work and I never understand why</span>
<span class="comment-copy">and also, I need to kick a mentioned member</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@PatrickHaugh, Sorry, I read OP's question wrong I thought he wanted to kick anyone using the command</span>
