<p>Is there a way to identify the number of points that were used for each cluster from python DBSCAN? </p>
<p>Like my output would be 10 pairs of coordinates and I'd like to know how many original input points were used for each of those pairs. </p>
<p>Is there a simple way to do this?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Use something like this:</p>
<pre><code>np.unique(labels, return_counts=True)
</code></pre>
<p>Spend more time reading the documentation.</p>
