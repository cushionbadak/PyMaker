<p>Im new to Python.</p>
<p>I am creating a new bot, using PRAW and Python, that comments on new posts displaying their basic account information (Username, date account was created, karma count). </p>
<p>I am trying to have it display the years, months, and days the posters account has been active but so far only have it displaying years. Is there a better way I can get it to display this information, or maybe am I able to create it with what I have setup already? What I have so far is:</p>
<pre><code>                author = post.author
                if author:
                    seconds_year = 60 * 60 * 24 * 365
                    now = datetime.datetime.now(datetime.timezone.utc).timestamp()
                    difference = now - author.created_utc
                    years = difference // seconds_year
                    author_created = datetime.datetime.utcfromtimestamp(author.created_utc)
                    author_created = datetime.datetime.strftime(author_created, "%d %B %Y")
                    print("Commenting user history")
                    comment = COMMENT_TEMPLATE % (author.name, author_created, years, author.link_karma, author.comment_karma)
                    post.add_comment(comment)
            sql.commit()
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You could use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#divmod" rel="nofollow"><code>divmod()</code> function</a> to find years, months, days:</p>
<pre><code>DAY = 24 * 60 * 60 # seconds
MONTH = 30 * DAY
YEAR = 365.2524 * DAY # Gregorian year

years, seconds = divmod(difference, YEAR)
months, seconds = divmod(seconds, MONTH)
days, seconds = divmod(seconds, DAY)
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">unrelated: you could write <code>time.time()</code> instead of <code>datetime.datetime.now(datetime.timezone.utc).timestamp()</code></span>
