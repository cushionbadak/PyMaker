<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I am fairly new to programming, and I am having trouble figuring out how to take a specific number from a list like:</p>
<pre><code>[12, 3, 4]
</code></pre>
<p>How could I take the integers and use them, like if I wanted to multiply 12 and 4 or 12 and 3? I am trying to find the first differences of the numbers, so for example 12 - 3 and then 3 - 4.</p>
<p>Note: I am just using those numbers as an example, I need the program to do any integers that the user inputs.
Thanks!</p>

<p>You can use the integers by calling their position in the list. Here's an example of adding, subtracting, and finding the sum of your list:</p>
<pre><code>example = [12, 3, 4]
print(example[0] + example[1]) #15 (12 + 3)
print(example[2] - example[1]) #1 (4 - 3)
print(sum(example)) # 19 (12 + 3 + 4)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Seems like you want something like this,</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; l = ['12', '3', '4']
&gt;&gt;&gt; def mul(num1, num2):
        if num1 in l and num2 in l:
            return str(int(num1)*int(num2))
        else:
            return 'Number you specified is not present in the list. Please try again'


&gt;&gt;&gt; print(mul(input('Print the num1 : '), input('Print the num2')))
Print the num1 : 1
Print the num2 : 7
Number you specified is not present in the list. Please try again
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(mul(input('Print the num1 : '), input('Print the num2 : ')))
Print the num1 : 3
Print the num2 : 12
36

<span class="comment-copy">Not specifically related to your question, but it's probably worth noting that <code>[12, 3, 4]</code> is a list of numbers, and <code>['12', '3', '4']</code> is a list of strings.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sounds like you want list indexing, which lets you get specific items from a list, given its position. Take a look at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#common-sequence-operations" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Common Sequence Operations</a> for more information.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Oh whoops, I'll change the question.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">How do you decide which ones get multiplied? It doesn't really make much sense what you want. If you want to know how to access an item in a list, then you should ask that question (why you want them is irrelevant)</span>
