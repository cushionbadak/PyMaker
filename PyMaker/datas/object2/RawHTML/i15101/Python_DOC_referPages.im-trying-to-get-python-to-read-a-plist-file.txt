<p>I am very new to Python and i am trying to get this code to read a .plist file from a iPhone backup however it keeps coming up with unexpected character after line continuing character. I am using python 3.4 and running it on Windows 7. 
Any advise would be much appreciated  </p>

<p>Python includes a standard library for reading <code>.plist</code> files: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/plistlib.html" rel="nofollow">https://docs.python.org/3/library/plistlib.html</a>. Does this suffice?</p>
<pre><code>import plistlib

with open(r'C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\info') as f:
    root = plistlib.load(f)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Isn't a <code>.plist</code> XML?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yeah I think it is</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Then use an XML parser: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\info</code> pass as argument</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Your code has multiple glaring issues e.g. pasting the file path into the header of the function makes no sense; PlistParser is not defined anywhere, and the way you attempt to open the file is ridiculous (look up <i>with statements</i>). I'd suggest you invest some more time into learning the language basics before attempting anything more complicated than "hello world".</span>
