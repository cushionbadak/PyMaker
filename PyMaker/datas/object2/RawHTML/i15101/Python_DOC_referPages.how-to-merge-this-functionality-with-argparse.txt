<p>I have this functionality:</p>
<pre><code>import codecs
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
with codecs.open('/Users/user/Desktop/file.txt', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    spanish_stop_words = [line.strip() for line in f]
    print spanish_stop_words

from sklearn.feature_extraction import text
my_stop_words = text.ENGLISH_STOP_WORDS.union(spanish_stop_words)

tfidf_vect= TfidfVectorizer(stop_words=set(my_stop_words))
</code></pre>
<p>I was been struggling with the argparse <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html" rel="nofollow">documentation</a> in order to understad where I can call the above "script" but I dont get how to merge it with argparse module. Also I would like to ask for the path to the user, in this line:</p>
<pre><code>'/Users/user/Desktop/file.txt'
</code></pre>
<p>How can I merge this with a simply argparse schema?. Thanks in advance guys!</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This is the simplest way to get started alongside with the <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/howto/argparse.html" rel="nofollow"><code>argparse</code> tutorial</a>:</p>
<pre><code>import argparse
import codecs
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer

parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
parser.add_argument("stop_word_list", help="The stop word list")
args = parser.parse_args()

with codecs.open(args.stop_word_list, encoding='utf-8') as f:
    spanish_stop_words = [line.strip() for line in f]
    print spanish_stop_words

from sklearn.feature_extraction import text
my_stop_words = text.ENGLISH_STOP_WORDS.union(spanish_stop_words)

tfidf_vect = TfidfVectorizer(stop_words=set(my_stop_words))
</code></pre>
<p>Run your program with <code>python program.py</code> and it prints:</p>
<pre><code>% python program.py 
usage: program.py [-h] stop_word_list
program.py: error: too few arguments
</code></pre>
<p>If you provide it with 1 argument, it is taken as a file to open as the stop word list</p>
<pre><code>% python program.py mystopwordfile.txt
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>argparse</code> isn't a script. It is a module to help you write command-line interfaces. Why don't you try out the <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/howto/argparse.html#id1" rel="nofollow noreferrer">tutorial</a> first?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I was not talking about argparse when I mentioned "script". I was talking about the lines I have previously...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Right, but to 'merge' <code>argparse</code> into that you'll still have to just import the module and use it to create the command-line interface. The tutorial shows you how.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MartijnPieters Sorry for the bad question... but I guess it was necesary to be penalized now, I understood what happened with the call to the functionality...belive me I hate doing this kind of questions...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I didn't vote on your post, but the documentation isn't <i>that</i> hard to follow, is it? People probably feel you haven't done your research here.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for the feedback, by the way I dont get where argparse is looking for the desired file?. Where does this is happening?.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks I am reading the tutorial.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">argparse is not finding your file anywhere, it just provides a filename for your script in <code>args.stop_word_list</code> which is passed to <code>codecs.open()</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ohh... I see, thank you!</span>
