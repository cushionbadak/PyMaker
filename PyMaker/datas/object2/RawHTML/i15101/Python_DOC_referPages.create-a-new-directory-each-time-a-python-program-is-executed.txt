<p>i need to create a new directory in my Python program, each time it is executed. For example, if it is executed the first time, the directory </p>
<blockquote>
<p>C:\Users\person\Desktop\Test_1 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>is created</p>
<p>If it is executed for the second time, the directory</p>
<blockquote>
<p>C:\Users\person\Desktop\Test_2 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>is created</p>
<p>and so on. How can this be achieved?</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/glob.html" rel="nofollow">Find all directories starting with <code>Test_</code></a>, find the one with the highest number, add 1 and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.mkdir" rel="nofollow">create a new directory</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>First and most simple way is just parse dir structure, get the last number of index and and than create new directory with new index.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Really, your question should be more specific. Do you have problems reading the directory names? Extracting the number from a filename? Creating a new directory?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">i'm just new to prog...your logic sounds right, thnx</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It is often helpful to include your code.  What have you tried, what were the results, what specific problems are you facing, etc.</span>
