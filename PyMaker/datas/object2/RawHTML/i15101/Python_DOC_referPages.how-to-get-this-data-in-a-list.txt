<p>I am new to Python and got the following data to work with:</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/86876232/6358.csv" rel="nofollow">https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/86876232/6358.csv</a></strong></p>
<p>The linked file is only a fraction of the entire data (the data should contain a bit over 15000 lists). First of all in what format is this data? And how do I get it from that format into lists so I can slice the volume data out.</p>
<p>When I use a module to read the csv data, I get not every list as separate list, but one big list, with every list as a value.</p>
<p>And this is how the data looks like: 4;"false";"null";"null";"Osebni avto";"20";"Pobo√Ñje";"5.0";"3-9m3  (velikost osebnega avtomobila)";"3.0";"null";"30";"10";"10";"null";"null";"null";"50";"false";"</p>
<p>And if it is better to have it in a dictionary how am I going to do this? There is no key in the data which I can assign to the value. The information consist purely of different values.</p>

<p>I'm not quite sure why this is downvoted so much? </p>
<p>Your best bet is to avoid manually reading in csv files and just use one of the default modules python has for reading them in. There's quite a lot of code snippets for using csv around the net so you should have any issues. Also I think you'll be better off with dictionaries than lists.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I am using the module you send me, already.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Robin The reasons why you're having problems were obvious to me the second I opened that csv file. Usually csv files.  They usually look like this:  #name, age (this line is optional) "Name","Age" "David","48" "Don","46" "Sue","39"  Yours looks like   data;data;data; &lt;p&gt; Some weird p tag &lt;/p&gt; data;data;data Something just randomly written in  The csv file is a mess and therefore csv.DictReader has problems reading through it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">So what should I do then?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Robin: I don't know, this is just a collection of random data basically. Someone just automatically clicked "make csv" or "export as csv" and now you have all your data in the 1st field and then just  a bunch of commas stringed to end of it so it "looks" like a csv file with n fields. Take a look at your file in a notepad, and make sure you have line wrap turned off.   You will notice that you have lines like &lt;p&gt;foobar&lt;/p&gt;,,,, and lines with some actual data "4"";""null"";",,,, The separators of this file are the commas, because the ; are commented out. Contact whoever sent you that csv file.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for your answer, I will then now contact the person, and see if this time a proper csv file can be send.</span>
