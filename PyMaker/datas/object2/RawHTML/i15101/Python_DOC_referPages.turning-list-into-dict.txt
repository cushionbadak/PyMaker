<strong>Question</strong><br/><br/>
How do I get this list object into a nice dict where each object has 1 title, 1 link and 1 date?</p>
<p>I want to be able to run:  </p>
<pre><code>for item in items:
    print(item['link'], item['title'], item['date'] )
</code></pre>
<p>and receive 1 link, 1 title and 1 date as output on each print. I suspect zip() might be helpful but cannot figure it out.</p>
<p>Very thankful for any help</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#zip" rel="nofollow"><code>zip()</code></a> to pair up elements from the three lists:</p>
<pre><code>for link, title, date in zip(items['link'], items['title'], items['date']):
</code></pre>
<p>There is no need to turn anything into a dictionary here.</p>
<p>Demo:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; for link, title, date in zip(items['link'], items['title'], items['date']):
...     print(link)
...     print(title)
...     print(date)
...     print('------')

<p>You can rebuild a dictionary for each loop iteration too:</p>
<pre><code>for values in zip(*items.values()):
    item = dict(zip(items.keys(), values))
    print(item)
</code></pre>
<p>This relies on the fact that <code>dict.keys()</code> and <code>dict.values()</code> produce their results in matching order. </p>
<p>Demo:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; for values in zip(*items.values()):
...     item = dict(zip(items.keys(), values))
...     print(item)
...

<p>I suggest to go with Martijn Pieters' solution, but if you insist on your usage, you could do:</p>
<pre><code>items = []
for i in range(len(myDict["title"])):
    items.append({"title":myDict["title"][i], "link":myDict["link"][i], "date":myDict["date"][i]})
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Is this what you mean?</p>
<pre><code>items = [{"title" : items["title"][i],
          "link" : items["link"][i],
          "date" : items["date"][i]}

         for i in range(len(items["title"]))]


import pprint
pprint.pprint(items)

<span class="comment-copy">This is a dictionary, not a list.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">From your usage, it seems you want a list of dictionaries, rather than a dictionary.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MalikBrahimi: it is a dictionary containing lists..</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MartijnPieters It's labelled turning a list to a dictionary.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks Martjin, hmm whatif I know want to save each object into the database and before saving each object I need to chack that the object which is going to save is unique and that the database do not contain its link already?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">if session.query(Presstv).filter_by(link=items['link']).first() == None:             try:                 session.add(news)   .... Hope you understand what I mean</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The link is now referenced by <code>link</code>, not <code>items['link']</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Toothfairy: I gave you an alternative option where you can use <code>item['link']</code> too. Note the name, <code>item</code> <i>singular</i>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, my idea's the same except with a list comprehension.</span>
