<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have this:-</p>
<pre><code>re.search("^[47]{2:}$", '447447')
</code></pre>
<p>... and was expecting it to return True.
But somehow it does not.</p>
<p>How come?
My understanding is that it was suppose to match any number which has any combination of 4 or 7, with at least 2 digits.
Is that correct?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>It should probably be <code>"^[47]{2,}$"</code>.</p>
<p>I visit the <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntax" rel="nofollow">regular expression syntax</a> page quite often, because I find it hard to remember all of the little tricks for building regexes.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The syntax is <code>{m,n}</code> where <em>n</em> could be omitted.</p>
<p>Fix:</p>
<pre><code>re.search("^[47]{2,}$", '447447')
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">ahhh Thx for the link. This is really helpful.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Laurent, I think you mean that <i>n</i> can be omitted : )  Of course, <i>m</i> can be omitted too, but OP is asking about at least 2 chars ...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes it's a little mistake. I fixed that.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thanks. And thanks for the link</span>
