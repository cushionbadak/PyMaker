<p>I've a list and I want to display the content with index by manually changing the value of index. I've tried to do it in two ways but it is not working.</p>
<p>way 1:</p>
<pre><code>x=['hello','how','are','you','hope','you','are','fine','I','am','doing','work','in','python']
for i,item in enumerate(x):
  print (i,item)
  if item == 'are':
    i+=2
</code></pre>
<p>way 2:</p>
<pre><code>x=['hello','how','are','you','hope','you','are','fine','I','am','doing','work','in','python']
for i in xrange(len(x)):
  print x[i]
  if item == 'are':
    i+=2
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The issue here is that both <code>enumerate()</code> and <code>xrange()</code> generate a series of values that is unaffected by external changes to <code>i</code>, which is an unconnected variable. Using @efferalgans's suggestion the best way might be to call the <code>next()</code> function twice, but this will mean storing a reference to the generator. So you want to do something like this:</p>
<pre><code>x=['hello','how','are','you','hope','you','are','fine','I','am','doing','work','in','python']
g = enumerate(x)
for i,item in g:
  print (i,item)
  if item == 'are':
    next(g)
    next(g)
</code></pre>
<p>from which I see the result</p>
<pre><code>0 hello
1 how
2 are
5 you
6 are
9 am
10 doing
11 work
12 in
13 python
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Just use a while loop. It's the simplest, clearest and most flexible solution:</p>
<pre><code>i = 0
while i &lt; len(x):
    print x[i]
    if x[i] == 'are':
        i+=1
    i += 1
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, looping over a string is simple and you are completely free to change the index on the fly -- <code>i</code> is just a normal variable. It's not clear what your code was actually meant to do, so the above does what your code would (presumably) have done if it worked: It will skip the word that <em>follows</em> the word "are".</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You can either switch to a <code>while</code> loop and increment <code>i</code> manually, or call the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#next" rel="nofollow noreferrer">next()</a> function (twice, in your case).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What is desired output?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Not sure what is the purpose; change the real index of the item or just for your own bookkeeping in one way or another?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you for your effort and time. Actually I'm new to python so I'm having these types of doubts.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you. Actually I'm new to python so I'm getting these doubts.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You're doing fine. We all have to learn.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you alexis. Actually I'm new to python and I'm learning ..</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Welcome. Since you're just getting started, let me add a suggestion: Switch to Python 3 today. It has several important advantages over Python 2.7, and it makes no sense to invest time on learning an obsolete version of the language.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you for your suggestion I'll try to shift to python 3</span>
