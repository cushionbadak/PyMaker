<p>So the following has worked for other links that have timed out and has continued to the next link in the loop. However for this link I got an error. I am not sure why that is and how to fix it so that when it happens it just browses to the next image.</p>
<pre><code>try:
    image_file = urllib2.urlopen(submission.url, timeout = 5)
    with open('/home/mona/computer_vision/image_retrieval/images/'
              + category + '/'
              + datetime.datetime.now().strftime('%y-%m-%d-%s')
              + submission.url[-5:], 'wb') as output_image:
        output_image.write(image_file.read())
except urllib2.URLError as e:
    print(e)
    continue
</code></pre>
<p>The error is:</p>

<p>OP:
Thanks!
I had these thanks to your suggestion and my problem was solved for Python2.7:</p>
<pre><code>except socket.timeout as e:
    print(e)
    continue
except socket.error as e:
    print(e)
    continue
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">I will try it now. If it occurred no error I will accept it. Also thanks for editing the question. CTL+k doesn't work for me. How do you fix the indentation?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I just manually edited it by decrementing it in a text editor. There might be some way of dealing with it from within the SO website but I'm not sure what that is.</span>
