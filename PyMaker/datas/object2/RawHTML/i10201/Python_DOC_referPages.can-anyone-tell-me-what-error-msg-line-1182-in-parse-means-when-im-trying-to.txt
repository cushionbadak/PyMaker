<p>This is the code that results in an error message:</p>
<pre><code>import urllib

<p>The error:</p>
<p><img alt="error msg screenshot" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eMKS2.png"/></p>
<p>I'm new to python. I did read documentation and a couple of tutorials, but clearly I still have done something wrong.  I don't believe it is the xml file itself because it does this to two different xml files.  </p>

<p>Consider using ElementTree's <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html#xml.etree.ElementTree.fromstring" rel="nofollow"><code>fromstring()</code></a>:</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>data</code> is a reference to the XML content as a string, but the <a href="https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html#xml.etree.ElementTree.parse" rel="nofollow"><code>parse()</code></a> function expects a filename or <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/glossary.html#term-file-object" rel="nofollow">file object</a> as argument. That's why there is an an error.</p>
<p><code>urlhandle</code> is a file object, so <code>tree = ET.parse(urlhandle)</code> should work for you. </p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The error message indicates that your code is trying to open a file, who's name is stored in the variable source. </p>
<p>It's failing to open that file (IOError) because the variable source contains a bunch of XML, not a file name. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">This is called a traceback. See <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html</a> for an explanation of what it means.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Please post the actual text of that error instead of an image. That way others can find it when searching for it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Pass the response not the content <code>tree = ET.parse(urllib.urlopen(url))</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">thankyou. this also worked for me. :-)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Great! Please accept the most helpful answer to confirm resolution.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Just a note to anyone searching this and to mzjn, this worked equally well with the other option, but I can only 'check' one response (as a complete newb, I find this odd since even with minimal experience I find there are usually multiple ways to create functional code). Anyway, this worked :-)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks Danielle. I thought the way I dealt with getting the URL, opening it and then parsing it looked clumsy, but I could not find the right way to do it.  Is there a single line syntax that can take input and then parse it as an xml?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You're using source twice, once as the filename, then clobbering it with the new file handle. Try something like inFile = open(source, "rb")</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No, this is misleading. <code>source</code> comes from the source code of the ElementTree library, not from the OP's code.</span>
