<p>This is just a portion of the game, a function that takes in the secret word and the letters guessed as arguments and tells you if they guessed the word correctly.</p>
<p>I'll be completely honest, this is from an assignment on an edX course, <strong>however</strong> I have already passed this assignment, this code works. I am just wondering if it can be written any better. Some people in the discussion forums were talking about how they solved it with 1 line, which is why I'm asking.</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>def isWordGuessed(secretWord, lettersGuessed):
    guessed = []
    l= str(lettersGuessed)
    s= list(secretWord)
    for i in l:
        if i in s:
            guessed.append(i)
            guessed.sort()
            s.sort()
    return guessed == s
</code></pre>
<p>Here is one of the test cases from the grader as an example:</p>
<p><code>isWordGuessed('durian', ['h', 'a', 'c', 'd', 'i', 'm', 'n', 'r', 't', 'u'])</code></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Something like this is pretty short:</p>
<pre><code>def isWordGuessed(secretWord, lettersGuessed):
  return all([c in lettersGuessed for c in secretWord])
</code></pre>
<p>For every character in the <code>secretWord</code> ensure it's in the <code>lettersGuessed</code>. This basically creates a list of booleans and the built-in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#all" rel="nofollow">all</a> returns <code>True</code> if every element in the array is <code>True</code>.</p>
<p>Also, FWIW: Idiomatic python would use underscores and not camel case.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">If this question is solely about code improvement, I suggest it be migrated to codereview.stackexchange.com instead. You state the code is working, so there's nothing to "solve," here, outside of improvements to existing, working code.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@not_a_robot While <a href="http://codereview.stackexchange.com/tour">Code Review</a> might be a good place to suggest going for this type of question, we should get out of the habit of sending question-askers over there. Please read <a href="http://meta.codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/5777/a-guide-to-code-review-for-stack-overflow-users">this</a> meta post for clarification.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hadn't seen that, thanks. I see it either way.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Oh I see, that's a great solution. I tried doing it this way using all but my code wasn't passing. I guess I was just using all wrong. I was using <code>all(x == lettersGuessed for x in secretWord)</code> because I'm still a beginner and that's the only way I know how to use all. Thanks for the lesson!  -- Also, I usually use underscores as well, but I'm just using the function names, arguments and variables given in the assignment description to avoid confusion.</span>
