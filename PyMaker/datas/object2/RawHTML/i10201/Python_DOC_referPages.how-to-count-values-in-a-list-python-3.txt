<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have code like this:</p>
<pre><code>winners = [red, blue, yellow]

player_1_guesses = [red, green, orange]
player_2_guesses = [red, blue, orange]
player_3_guess = [red, green, yellow]
</code></pre>
<p>I'd like to count how many times each value in <code>winners</code> appears across the three <code>player_x_guesses</code> lists. So I would expect to see something like:</p>
<pre><code>totals = {'red': 3, 'blue': 1, 'yellow': 1}
</code></pre>
<p>I'm not really sure what this kind of data analysis (?) is called or even what to google to achieve what I want. </p>
<p>Thanks for any help.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Try doing this:</p>
<pre><code>all_guesses = player_1_guess + player_2_guess + player_3_guess
dct = {i:all_guesses.count(i) for i in winners}
</code></pre>
<p>output:</p>
<pre><code>{'blue': 1, 'yellow': 1, 'red': 3}
</code></pre>
<p>Using <code>collections</code>:</p>
<pre><code>from collections import Counter

dct = Counter(word for word in all_guesses if word in winners)
</code></pre>

<p>Not sure if I'm breaking the rules here, but my approach was to search for
"python compare string arrays" and I got this: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2783969/compare-string-with-all-values-in-array">Compare string with all values in array</a></p>
<p>You have one list/array of strings that you want to compare with three other lists/arrays.</p>
<p>Assuming you want to know how many players guessed the correct colour and in the right position.  In other words player_1_guesses = [green, red, orange] would not count as a correct guess for red because it's not in the first position, for your example.</p>
<p>In my head, the logic of your code would go like this (this isn't python code by the way!):</p>
<ol>
<li>get winners[0], which is 'red'</li>
<li><p>check winners[0] against values in player_n_guesses[0] and record the outcome in a variable called red (e.g. if player_n_guesses[0]==winners[0]:red +=1)</p></li>
<li><p>use nested for loops to go through everything, then make your totals list using the format method.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>I expect there's a more efficient way that directly compares matrices - try searching for 'string matrix comparison python' or something like that.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">why don't you keep a single dictionary instead of separate variables for guesses?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You could use the <code>Counter</code> collection : <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.Counter" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.Counter</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Are those list items supposed to be strings? If so, you need to put them in quotes. As for your actual question, I agree with jobou that you should take a look at <code>collections.Counter</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, both of these will work. What is this 'topic' called so I can research it more to see how your code works?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The first one is called Dictionary Comprehension, second one's just using an existing module.</span>
