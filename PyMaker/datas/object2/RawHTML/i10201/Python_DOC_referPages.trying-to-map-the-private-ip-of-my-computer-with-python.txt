<p>I want to filter the IPv4 ips and take the one which belong to my LAN (and not to my VMware network).
I coded this thing:</p>
<pre><code>print re.findall(r'[0-255]\.[0-255]\.[0-255]\.[0-255]', str([y for y in filter(lambda x: 'IPv4 Address' in x, os.popen("ipconfig").readlines())]))
</code></pre>
<p>This part:</p>
<pre><code>str([y for y in filter(lambda x: 'IPv4 Address' in x, os.popen("ipconfig").readlines())])
</code></pre>
<p>Its for getting first the ips I have (At least the row they are in.)
So for example, just this row, will give me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>['   IPv4 Address. . . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.231.1\n', '   IPv4
  Address. . . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.233.1\n', '   IPv4 Address. . .
  . . . . . . . . : 10.100.102.8\n']</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(The first two are of the VMware)</p>
<p>When I do the Regex thing, it isnt working. 
Its intended to give me just the ips from the string I gave it.</p>
<p>How can I filter the only LAN ip ('10.100.102.8' in this case.) and insert it to a string?</p>

<p>Watch out! <code>[0-255]</code> isn't a number range in regex ! (in fact it means <em>one</em> character in the list 0,1,2,5)</p>
<p>You should use <code>\d{1,3}</code> if you want a three digit number, then extract groups if you want to check if the number is in the range.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">all addresses in your LAN should start with <code>10.</code> so try <code>10.\d{1,3}.\d{1,3}.\d{1,3}</code> or without regex <code>lambda x: 'IPv4 Address. . . . . . . . . . . : 10.' in x</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">btw: standard module <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipaddress.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">ipaddress</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@furas Are you sure? Because in here: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_network" rel="nofollow noreferrer">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_network</a> I see there is more then just one ip type. There is actually three! the two others are starting with 192\171. so....</span>
<span class="comment-copy">you ask only how to recognize <code>10.100.102.8</code>.  If you want to be sure than you have to check network adapter as @Goufalite said.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you! now. How can I know the LAN ip and throw the two other ips?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">As @furas commented, make a check using your subnet domain (10....), or at least put it in a variable. But if this information changes (generic program) you might need to parse the full <code>ipconfig</code> command to check the network adapter...</span>
