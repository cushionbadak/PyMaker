<p>I need help I am trying to open the terminal and type ifconfig and enter then read the output on a mac then il transition this later to kali but I am getting a error with the file path to terminal and I cant start it, here is my code. </p>
<pre><code>import os,sys

#opens terminal

terminal = os.open('/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app', os.O_RDWR|os.O_APPEND)

#writes ifconfig

os.write(terminal, 'ifconfig')

os.close(terminal)
</code></pre>

<p>I suggest you use <code>subprocess</code></p>
<pre><code>import subprocess

def popen(executable):
    sb = subprocess.Popen(
        '%s' % executable,
        shell=True,
        stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
        stderr=subprocess.PIPE,
        universal_newlines=True,
    )
    stdout, stderr = sb.communicate()
    return stdout, stderr, sb.returncode
</code></pre>
<p>you can pass <code>ifconfig</code> to this method and it will execute the command and return the output for you.</p>

<p>I agree with using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.check_output" rel="nofollow">subprocess</a>. To add to Amin's answer, for something this simple that you just want the output from:</p>
<pre><code>import subprocess

print(subprocess.check_output(['ifconfig']))
</code></pre>
<p>Edit: </p>
<p>What I was talking about in my comment is the new <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.run" rel="nofollow">run</a> function that returns a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.CompletedProcess" rel="nofollow">CompletedProcess</a> class that holds all the relevant information for you. That way you no longer have to have three different variables holding your stdout, sterr and returncode.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">This is an especially good idea, since <code>Terminal.app</code> isn't an executable; it is a bundle, which to the filesystem looks like a directory.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I agree with using subprocess, but that is an outdated and heavy handed example. I would suggest using the new <code>run</code> or at least <code>call</code> for something this trivial.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@CasualDemon yeah, you could also use <code>check_output</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@AminEtesamian HA, I was actually just writing out that answer and saw your message after I posted it. Agree with check_output is all you need, I  just really like introducing people to the new <code>run</code> function, as the new return class is pretty nice.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@CasualDemon I haven't used it yet. it belongs to <code>subprocess</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">nice thing about the <code>run</code>. tnx</span>
