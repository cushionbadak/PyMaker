<p>This is the current code I have, the issue is clearly that I can't divide strings by strings, but I'm unsure of how to go about editing the code to get it to run.</p>
<pre><code>def Fraction(c, s):
    #Returns the fraction of 's' formed by 'c'.
    return c / s
print(Fraction("a", "ababab"))
</code></pre>
<p>In theory, 0.5 should be printed; <code>'a'</code> forms half of all text in <code>'ababab'</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Apparently you want a ratio here; a number between 0.0 and 1.0 indicating what percentage of a larger string is using a smaller string:</p>
<pre><code>def ratio(c, s):
    return (float(s.count(c) * len(c))) / len(s)
</code></pre>
<p>Demo:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def ratio(c, s):
...     return (float(s.count(c) * len(c))) / len(s)
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; ratio("a", "ababab")
0.5
&gt;&gt;&gt; ratio("ab", "ababab")
1.0
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">could you explain why it should print 0.5?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">a makes up half (0.5) of the total string. there are 6 characters in the string and 3 of them are a.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">So you want the <i>ratio</i>, not a fraction.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That works, I was just naming it in accordance to the requirements. Works nonetheless, thanks.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The naming is rather.. confusing, because there is a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/fractions.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>fractions.Fraction()</code> type</a> in Python.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">hmm, alright, I'm still very much new to all of this and just trying to fall in line with what the function must be named.</span>
