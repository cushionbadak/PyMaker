<p>I wonder where how to get row and column of this matrix. I want to loop through each element[row][column], but I have no idea how to get these.</p>
<pre><code>imaginary_axis = 100
real_axis = 1

mixed_matrix = [[0 for j in xrange(imaginary_axis)] for i in xrange(real_axis)]

for row in mixed_matrix[0]:
    print(row)
    for column in mixed_matrix:
         print(column)
         check(mixed_matrix[row][column])
</code></pre>
<p>This throws an error. How can I get this to work?</p>
<pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"><code>TypeError: list indices must be integers, not list
</code></pre>
<p>I know why I get this error, but I do not know how I can get the column right.</p>

<p>I think, that you can use smth like <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#enumerate" rel="nofollow">enumerate()</a></p>
<p>Cause in your example your <code>column</code> is a list, but as i can see - you want the number of element in this list.</p>
<p>I edit my answer:</p>
<p>What do you want? Magic? There is no magic. You have matrix, like this:
[[1, 2, 3]]</p>
<p>There is a list inside list. 
You want to iterate by elements?</p>
<p><code>for lst in matrix:
      for element in lst:
              print(element)</code></p>
<p>Or you can zip your lists in ONE list and iterate by element in that list.</p>
<p>If you want access by index - you should use it.
You should have two loops, the number of your lists is the number of rows, the number of your elements in list - is number of columns.</p>
<p>And you need smth lile:</p>
<pre><code>for row in range(0, len(mixed_matrix)):
   # mixed_matrix[row] - is your FIRST list
   for column in range(0, len(mixed_matrix[row])):
    print(mixed_matrix[row][column])
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">"throws an error"? surely you can do better than that</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Look at it like this, you iterate <code>mixed_matrix[0]</code> which is a list, so in that case your 'row' will be an integer or whatever the contents of that list is.  Then you iterate mixed_matrix itself, which will make your <code>column</code> be a list of lists.  What you (probably) want to do is iterate like: <code>for row in range(0, len(mixed_matrix[0]))</code> and do the same with your column for loop but making use of the row index i.e. <code>for column in range(0, len(mixed_matrix[0][row]))</code>  I might have gotten this totally wrong, but that's my take on it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That wont work.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">How exactly? IS there not an easier way?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">column is a index position of inserted list?  <code>for row in mixed_matrix[0]:     print(row)     for column, list in enumerate(mixed_matrix):         print(column)         print(mixed_matrix[row][column])</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">That does not work as intended</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Please, see my answer, i edit it, cause my anseer is too long</span>
