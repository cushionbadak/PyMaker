<p>Is there any way to take the user's input in one variable and use that input in another variable?</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>def user_input():
    numb = input("Please input the number ")
    numb_process()

def numb_process():
    if numb == '1':
        print("Good")
    else:

<p>This is python 101 and the standard <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html" rel="nofollow">python tutorial</a> is a good place to learn basic concepts. In your case, simple parameter passing will do.</p>
<pre><code>def user_input():
    numb = input("Input number ") # bind result of the input function
                                  # to local variable "numb"

    numb_process(numb)            # pass the object bound to "numb"
                                  # to called function

def numb_process(some_number):    # bind inbound object to local variable
                                  # "some_number"

    if some_number == '1':        # use bound object in calculations
        print("Good")
    else:
        print("Bad")

user_input()

<p>It should work. You can call the numb_process function by giving it an argument "numb" that will move from the function "user_input" to function "numb_process".</p>
<pre><code>def user_input():
    numb = input("Please input the number ")
    numb_process(numb)

def numb_process(numb):
    if numb == '1':
        print("Good")
    else:
        print("Bad")

user_input()
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">It's called argument passing. In short, define <code>numb_process</code> as <code>def numb_process(numb):</code> and call it with <code>numb_process(numb)</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Exactly. Just continue reading whatever Python tutorial you're following for two or three more pages. You will inevitably be introduced to arguments to methods.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hey this worked however could you explain to me what you did here please?   By doing (numb) at the end did you bring the numb over to the other variable?</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>user_input</code> passes the object it got from <code>input</code> to <code>numb_process</code>. I changed the local name in the second function to make it clear that it has no idea what the object is named in other functions.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Could you explain how and/or why? The OP clearly doesn't know very much, and just dumping a working example in doesn't teach them anything.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for heads up, I am still pretty new.</span>
