<p>I would like to install both python 2.7 and python 3.5 on my Windows 10 PC. Both python executables use the same name <code>python.exe</code>.</p>
<p>Is it a good idea to change <code>python.exe</code> to <code>python3.exe</code> as a quick fix for co-existence? Are there any side-effects or other things that I need to be aware?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You don't need to rename anything for co-existence of different versions of Python.</p>
<p>The different versions of python are installed on different folders automatically.</p>
<p>When use the command prompt you can use the commands <code>py2</code> or <code>py3</code> to refer to the different versions of python. The next works too:</p>
<pre><code>C:\Users\user1&gt;py -2
</code></pre>
<p>and</p>
<pre><code>C:\Users\user1&gt;py -3
</code></pre>
<p>This also works with <code>pip2</code> and <code>pip3</code> for install new packages.</p>
<p>For more details, you can read this article: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html?#python-launcher-for-windows" rel="nofollow" title="Python Launcher for Windows">Python Launcher for Windows</a>.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You'll need to run <code>python3</code> instead of <code>python</code> if that's not obvious. This is definitely, as you described, a "quick fix" </p>
<p>My suggested fix is to use <a href="https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/" rel="nofollow">virtualenv</a> and pass in the Python executable you would like to use as so:</p>
<p><code>virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3.5 /my/virtualenv/&gt;</code></p>

<span class="comment-copy">Why are you installing both?  <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/Python2orPython3" rel="nofollow noreferrer">wiki.python.org/moin/Python2orPython3</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">I have a variant on this problem - I have both 32 bit and 64 bit versions of python (needed by different programs, for example my 64 bit Z3 can only run under 64 bit python). I would like to have both pythons on my path with different names for the exe's obviously. Any ideas?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">user16891328: If you have both installed, you can also add a <code>#!/usr/bin/env python2</code> or <code>#!/usr/bin/env python3</code> comment as the first line of your scripts and use <code>py scriptname.py</code> to have the correct interpreter executed.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@martineau This is a Windows question</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@cricket_007: I know that. <code>py</code> makes the shebang work on Windows, too.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@martineau I meant <code>#!/usr/bin/env</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@cricket_007: I understood what you meant. See <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html?#shebang-lines" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this section</a> of the documentation where it says the the <code>py</code> launcher makes the same thing work on Windows.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Well,  /usr/bin doesn't work on Windows</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You can change that to wherever your Python 3.5 exe is found.</span>
