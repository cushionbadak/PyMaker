<p>I'm using "The coder's apprentice: Learning Python with Python 3" (<a href="http://www.spronck.net/pythonbook/pythonbook.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.spronck.net/pythonbook/pythonbook.pdf</a>).</p>
<p>I'm doing this exercise: "The cover price of a book is $24.95, but bookstores get a 40 percent discount.
Shipping costs $3 for the first copy and 75 cents for each additional copy. Calculate the total wholesale costs for 60 copies."</p>
<p>This is my code: </p>
<pre><code>book_price = 24.95
book_discount = book_price / 10 * 4
bookstore_book_price = book_price - book_discount
shipping_first = 3
shipping_rest = 0.75
sixty_shipped = bookstore_book_price + shipping_first + (shipping_rest * 59)
print("A book is being sold regularly for " +str(book_price) + ".")
print("At bookstores, it's being sold with a 40% discount, amounting to " + str(book_discount) + ".")
print("This means it's being sold at bookstores for " + str(bookstore_book_price) + ".")
print("The first copy ships for " + "str(shipping_first) + ", but the rest ships for " + str(shipping_rest) ".")
print("Given 60 copies were shipped, it would cost " + str(sixty_shipped + ".")
</code></pre>
<p>For whatever reason, the word <code>the</code> in this line of code:</p>
<pre><code>(print("The first copy ships for " + "str(shipping_first) + ", but the rest ships for " + str(shipping_rest) "."))` 
</code></pre>
<p>Produces a syntax error. Given that I remove each word until I reach <code>for</code> I still get a syntax error. When only <code>for</code> and <code>but</code> are left, the error: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>EOL while scanning string literal</p>
</blockquote>
<p>is produced. I don't have a clue what to do.</p>
<p>Here's my code: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/VuKja.png" rel="nofollow">Using IDLE editor (not prompt).</a></p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Because you got an extra <code>"</code>. Instead of</p>
<pre><code>(print("The first copy ships for " + "str(shipping_first) + ", but the rest ships for " + str(shipping_rest) "."))
</code></pre>
<p>do</p>
<pre><code>(print("The first copy ships for " + str(shipping_first) + ", but the rest ships for " + str(shipping_rest) + "."))
</code></pre>
<p>You can also omit calling <code>str()</code>, from <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print" rel="nofollow"><code>print()</code></a> docs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All non-keyword arguments are converted to strings like str() does and written to the stream</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>UPD</strong></p>
<p>Also you skipped <code>+</code> at the end of error line.
And as @tobias_k mentioned you forgot closing <code>)</code> for <code>str</code> method <code>print("Given 60 copies were shipped, it would cost " + str(sixty_shipped + ".")</code></p>
<p>So for your code to work without <code>str()</code> methods:</p>
<pre><code>print("The first copy ships for ", shipping_first, ", but the rest ships for ", shipping_rest, ".")
</code></pre>
<p>Or even better with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.format" rel="nofollow"><code>format()</code></a></p>
<pre><code>print("The first copy ships for {}, but the rest ships for {}.".format(shipping_first, shipping_rest))
</code></pre>
<p>It's now more readable.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Remove the <code>"</code> in <code>"str(shipping_first)</code>. Also, missing <code>)</code> in <code>str(sixty_shipped</code> and missing <code>+</code> after <code>str(shipping_rest)</code>. Closing for typos. Also, you might want to have a look at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.format" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>str.format</code></a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Even stackoverflows syntax hightlighter shows your error :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Your quotes are not matching. you can clearly see that from the formatting of the strings in your <code>print</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Note that there is at least one more typo in the last line.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@tobias_k thanks, i believe i mentioned all the typos OP got(updated answer).</span>
