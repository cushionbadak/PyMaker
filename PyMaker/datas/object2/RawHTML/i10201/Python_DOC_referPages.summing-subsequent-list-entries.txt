<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I am a beginner with python and I want to add each entry of a list (of days in a month) to the previous entry to get a sum of total days in a year.</p>
<p>a is a list of days in each month</p>
<pre><code>a = [31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31]
</code></pre>
<p>I want b to be a list of totals like this:</p>
<pre><code>b= (a[0],a[0]+a[1],a[0]+a[1]+a[2],a[0]+a[1]+a[2]+a[3],a[0]+a[1]+a[2]+a[3]+a[4]...
</code></pre>
<p>I don't know how to make a loop to do this.<br/>
Help would be greatly appreciated!
Thanks</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You should first learn about loops. Then use that to sum up elements in a list. It's simple, really. Unfortunately Stack Overflow is not a tutorial website.</span>
