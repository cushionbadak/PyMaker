<p>I'm very new to python and trying to write some code so that the user enters something. If it's an integer it's sorted into the Numbers list, if it's a string it goes into the String list. </p>
<p>I want to be able to find the mean of all the numbers that are in the list and print out the result.
And in the String section I want to be able to print out everything within the string and its length.
User types 'save' to exit and if input is valid that's caught.</p>
<pre><code>Numbers = []
String = []

while(True):
    user_input = input("What's your input? ")
    if user_input == "save":
        break
    elif user_input.isdigit():
        Numbers.append(user_input)
        for i in range(len(Numbers)):
            Numbers[i] = int(Numbers[i])
            print(sum(Numbers)/len(Numbers)
    elif isinstance(user_input, str):
        String.append(user_input)
        print(String)
        print (len(String)-1)
    else:
        print("Invalid input.")
        break

<p>There is good thing called <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html#statistics.mean" rel="nofollow"><code>statistics.mean</code></a>:</p>

mean(your_list)

<p>You are using <code>Length</code>, which has not been defined.  I think what you wanted was</p>
<pre><code>print(sum(Numbers)/len(Numbers))

<p>and you probably don't want it inside the loop, but just after it (although that might be another typo).</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I found other more convenient way to produce the mean: Use statistics model and output the mean.</p>
<pre><code>#import useful packages
import statistics

#Create an empty list
user_list = []

#game start
while True:
    #user will input their number into a the empty list
    user_number = input("Type the number you want to input or type 'a' to get the average and quit the game:")

#help the user to get an average number
if user_number == 'a':
    num_average = statistics.mean(user_list)
    print("The mean is: {}.".format(num_average))

<span class="comment-copy">On the line <code>print(sum(Numbers)/len(Length)</code>, you appear to be missing a close bracket (<code>)</code>). Is this a typo when copying to the site?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">you don't need to convert all numbers to integers each time! And <code>len(Length)</code> must also by a typo. Should be <code>len(Numbers)</code> and be computed out of the loop. BTW won't work for negative numbers because of <code>isdigit()</code> method.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Updated the typo thank you, but still didn't fix issues, and I don't want to account for negatives just positives</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What in your posted code, or even the description of the problem, says anything out eliminating negatives?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I've been asked to do this without importing anything and just to do it through coding.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Apologies, updated the code to have the right variable, was a mistake in typing.</span>
