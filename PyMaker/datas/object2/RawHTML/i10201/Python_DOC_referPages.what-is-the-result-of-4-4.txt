<p>I need the explanation of this syntax , does this mean that (+4) is the same as (4) ? I have tried many other operands and it completely works as if I disregarded the plus sign before the number .</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Would you be confused by </p>
<pre><code>4 &gt; -4
</code></pre>
<p>The only difference between that and</p>
<pre><code>4 &gt; +4 
</code></pre>
<p>is a different unary operator </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The <code>+</code> in <code>+4</code> is the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#unary-arithmetic-and-bitwise-operations" rel="nofollow">unary plus operator</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The unary <code>+</code> (plus) operator yields its numeric argument unchanged.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So yes, because <code>4</code> is a number (an <code>int</code>), <code>+4</code> means just the same thing as <code>4</code>, as the operator returns the number unchanged.</p>
<p>The operator exists as a counterpart to the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#unary-arithmetic-and-bitwise-operations" rel="nofollow"><code>-</code> unary minus operator</a>:</p>
<pre><code>4 &gt; -4
</code></pre>
<p>Custom classes could override it using the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__pos__" rel="nofollow"><code>__pos__()</code> method</a>, making it possible to return custom results.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><em>(In addition to the points pointed out by the other answers ...)</em></p>
<p>The comparison operations in Python <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#comparisons" rel="nofollow">have lower precedence</a> than the <code>positive</code> unary operator (<code>+operand</code>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unlike C, all comparison operations in Python have the same priority,
  <em>which is lower than that of any arithmetic, shifting or bitwise
  operation</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This means that the unary plus operator applied to its operand will be evaluated prior to the comparison operator, and <code>+4</code> will result in simply just <code>4</code> prior the unary comparison operation even starting.</p>
<pre><code>4 &lt; +4
4 &lt; (+4)
4 &lt; 4
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Yes, they're effectively the same. The unary <code>+</code> operator in <code>+4</code> is applied to the <code>4</code> and <code>4</code> is the result.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>To check if your variables are the same type them into your interpreter with the == operator between them. If they are the same, this will return True.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; 4 == +4
True
</code></pre>
<p>This may seem daft or obvious in this case, but when working with more complex variables it can be more useful.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">yes, <code>+4</code> is the same as <code>4</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The <code>+</code> in Python works the same as the <code>+</code> in mathematics.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><i>I have tried many other operands and it completely works as if I disregarded the plus sign before the number</i>, did that not answer your question?</span>
