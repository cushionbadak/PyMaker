<p>I was wondering how you correctly use os.path. Basically what I'm trying to do is ask the user for a directory and after that, they type a letter (<code>N</code> in this case), and then a filename in the directory and it will combine the directory with the file.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>C:\Desktop
</code></pre>
<p>and</p>
<pre><code>N hello
</code></pre>
<p>The final result produced would be C:\Desktop\hello.</p>
<pre><code>import os
import os.path
import shutil
from pathlib import Path
</code></pre>
<p>':
        directory = input()
        search_files()
        directory1=search_characteristics(directory)
        #print(directory1)</p>
<p>What am I doing wrong?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Here, this should work.</p>
<pre><code>def search_characteristics(directory):
    interesting = input()
    interesting = interesting.split(" ")
    if (interesting[0] == 'N'):
        directory += (os.sep + interesting[1])
        print(directory)
    elif interesting.startswith('E'):
        return os.path.splitext(directory,'')
    else:
        print("Error")
        return search_characteristics(directory)
</code></pre>
<p>If you have to use os.path.join then you can replace the line with os.sep with:</p>
<pre><code>directory = os.path.join(directory, interesting[1])
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Can you explain what your overall code is supposed to do, how it is currently failing, and what exactly you expect it to do that is not behaving as you think it should. This helps narrow down the troubleshooting to provide a quicker, better answer.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@idjaw I'm slowly working on the overall code, but what N is supposed to do is  If the second line of the input begins with the letter N, the search will be for files whose names exactly match a particular name. The N will be followed by space; after the space, the rest of the line will indicate the name of the files to be searched for.   Right now, when I try to combine the paths, say <code>C:\Desktop</code> with a hello.txt in desktop, it would still show the thing like <code>C:\Desktop</code> instead of <code>C:\Desktop\hello</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You should use something like <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.walk" rel="nofollow noreferrer">os.walk</a> for searching through a directory.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@idjaw I can't use os.walk nor glob for this unfortunately.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>interesting[0]</code> is using the wrong variable the split variable is <code>interesting1</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I edited my original post as I got it to work, but ran into another problem. If I were to put <code>N hello</code> , it would show up as <code>C:\Desktop\hello' but what if the file doesnt exist say </code>N doesntexist` which I would need to check if it were a file. I added the if isfile to check if it is a file, but no matter what I do, it would say <code>Not a file</code> even if it were a file.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I tried running your code and I had no issues. What are you using for your inputs?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The code works fine, but I feel it's working in the wrong way. I feel it might be getting the "Not a file" input I put in because it's not really a file, but a directory. Basically  say I have a real file named <code>realfile.txt</code> and a file named fakefile that doesn't exist.   I would run the code. <code>C:\Desktop</code> I would input in N realfile.txt and it would return <code>C:\Desktop\reaifile.txt</code>. I run it again and put N fakefile.txt. It should say "Not a file". When I run my current code, I get "Not a file" for both. How would I fix it so the real file doesn't give "not a file" error?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sorry, I should have clarified. I checked it with a real file and a fake one and it gave the correct response in both cases. You are correct in that os.path.isfile() would return false if the entry was a directory, but as I said I don't see how your getting the directory.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What are you using for the directory or what are your inputs? I'm getting the directory from the `if <b>name</b> == '<b>main</b>'.</span>
