<p>I have not tested it, but gives you an idea.</p>

<p>For example, I want to store the word (lo) in the second line in a variable and then print that variable.</p>

<p>Use the re module in Python's builtin library:</p>
<pre><code>import re

with open("/etc/network/interfaces", "r") as file:
    content = file.readlines()

target_word = re.findall("lo()", content[3]) # save the string 'lo' into target word
print ''.join(target_word) # prints: lo
</code></pre>
<p>If you plan on trying to find more words, just add more words to the regular expression. For example, if you wanted to find the words lo and auto, you would say <code>re.findall("lo|auto", content)</code>. If you use this method, I recommend reading the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html" rel="nofollow">official documentation on the <code>re</code> module</a>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">What exactly are you asking exactly - what are you trying to do?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">For example, I want to store the word (lo) in the second line in a variable and then print that variable.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">So some parsing on the file then... just one line in particular or...? This is a bit broad at the moment...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You want to do it for all the words or only for a given number of words in your file ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Only for a given number of word, for example I have: "lo" next to the word "auto" you see it? I want to save the word "lo" in that line in a variable and after that print it. Can you help me?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you! why prints "lo" four times? and how could I save "lo" into a variable?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@AlvaroEnrique I could have misunderstood you. Do you want all occurrences of the word <code>lo</code>, or do you only want the <code>lo</code> by the word auto?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, only the lo by the word auto</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@AlvaroEnrique got you. gimme a sec to update my answer.</span>
