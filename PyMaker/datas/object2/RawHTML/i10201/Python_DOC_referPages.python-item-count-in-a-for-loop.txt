<p>I was experimenting with for loops and lists in Python earlier today, and I'm a bit stuck on this one thing that's probably very simple... Here's my code:</p>
<pre><code>animals = ["hamster","cat","monkey","giraffe","dog"]

print("There are",len(animals),"animals in the list")
print("The animals are:",animals)

s1 = str(input("Input a new animal: "))
s2 = str(input("Input a new animal: "))
s3 = str(input("Input a new animal: "))

animals.append(s1)
animals.append(s2)
animals.append(s3)

print("The list now looks like this:",animals)

animals.sort()
print("This is the list in alphabetical order:")
for item in animals:
    count = count + 1

    print("Animal number",count,"in the list is",item)
</code></pre>
<p>The count variable doesn't work for whatever reason, I've tried to search for this problem but can't find anything. It says it's not defined, but if I put a normal number or a string it works perfectly fine. (I am also sick at the moment so I can't think properly, so this might be really simple and I just didn't catch it) Would I have to make a new for loop? Because when I did this:</p>
<pre><code>for item in animal:
    for i in range(1,8):
        print("Animal number",i,"in the list is",item)
</code></pre>
<p>It just spits out each item in the list with the numbers 1-7, which is... better, but not what I want.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You need to define count first like:</p>
<pre><code>count = 0
</code></pre>
<p>Another better way to achieve what you want is just:</p>
<pre><code>for count, item in enumerate(animals):
    print("Animal number", count + 1, "in the list is", item)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You are trying to increment a value you never set:</p>
<pre><code>for item in animals:
    count = count + 1
</code></pre>
<p>Python complains about <code>count</code> because the first time you use it in <code>count + 1</code>, <code>count</code> has never been set!</p>
<p>Set it to <code>0</code> before the loop:</p>
<pre><code>count = 0
for item in animals:
    count = count + 1
    print("Animal number",count,"in the list is",item)
</code></pre>
<p>Now the first time the <code>count + 1</code> expression is executed, <code>count</code> exists and <code>count</code> can be updated with the <code>0 + 1</code> result.</p>
<p>As a more Pythonic alternative, you can use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#enumerate" rel="nofollow"><code>enumerate()</code> function</a> to include a counter in the loop itself:</p>
<pre><code>for count, item in enumerate(animals):
    print("Animal number",count,"in the list is",item)
</code></pre>
<p>See <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22171558/what-does-enumerate-mean">What does enumerate mean?</a></p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You need to initialize <code>count</code> before the loop.
Otherwise Python does not know what <code>count</code> is, so it cannot evaluate <code>count + 1</code>.</p>
<p>You should do something like</p>
<pre><code>...
count = 0
for item in animals:
    count = count + 1
    ...
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">You forgot to define <code>count</code>. Right before for loop add <code>count = 0</code>.</span>
