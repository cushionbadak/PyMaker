<p>I am trying to launch a Jupyter notebook using anaconda prompt. The browser session opens but no contents are visible on the page. </p>
<p>Does anyone have any idea how to mitigate this?  </p>

I encounter similar trouble. So I just do 3 steps:
(1) uninstall Jupyter Notebook 5.7.6
conda uninstall notebook
(2) install old version
conda install notebook=5.7.4
(3) After lauching Jupyter Notebook 5.7.4
Press CTRL+R or CTRL+Shift+R to clear the cache
Then Jupyter Notebook works normally now.
Hope it's helpful to you.</p>
