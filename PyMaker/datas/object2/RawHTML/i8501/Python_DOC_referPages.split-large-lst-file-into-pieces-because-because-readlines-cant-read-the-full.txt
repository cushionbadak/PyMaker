<p>To use a wordlist (large one "16 Gb") to crack a password issue i've downliaded a file in .lst form from: <a href="https://crackstation.net/buy-crackstation-wordlist-password-cracking-dictionary.htm" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://crackstation.net/buy-crackstation-wordlist-password-cracking-dictionary.htm</a></p>
<p>So when i try to readlines() the file to split lines it only read a 69100 line even the worlist contain more than a billion line.</p>
<p>ex:</p>
<pre><code>passwordlist = str(raw_input("\nEnter the path name of the password list file : "))
list = open(passwordlist, "r")
passwords = list.readlines()
list.close()
for password in  passwords:
        attack(password.replace("\n",""))
</code></pre>
<p>i need to split the file into txt pieces using python whithout reading lines such as spliting a video or an audio.</p>
<p>anything could help please.</p>

<p>Have you tried read in a loop? read(size) or readline()

<span class="comment-copy">@James, the tags <code>readlines</code> and <code>large-files</code> definitely seems relevant here.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">yes! thanx for trying to reminding. thats the code if you can help: <a href="https://justpaste.it/edit/15414193/a5a3d8c5" rel="nofollow noreferrer">justpaste.it/edit/15414193/a5a3d8c5</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">The problem is the 'password' variable. Instead of list.readlines() loop over the file object with readlines() and check the current line. (Or use read(size) for chuncks of data.)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I've already tried this:  <a href="https://justpaste.it/edit/15414472/f0e084a6" rel="nofollow noreferrer">justpaste.it/edit/15414472/f0e084a6</a> and when i print chuncks it keep repeating the first chunk.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Actualy readlines could read more than 69100 line cause ive tried it with another wordlist and it have read more than a million line but in this wordlist it stop when it reach 69100 line no more even that the wordlist contain more than a billion line.</span>
