<p>I've been asked to contribute to some in-production Python/Django code. I'm setting it up in PyCharm. When I run the app, I get this error message:</p>
<pre><code>File "/myApp/myVirtualEnvironment/lib/python2.7/site-packages/django/core/mail/message.py",
 line 8, in &lt;module&gt;
  from email import (charset as Charset, encoders as Encoders)
   ImportError: cannot import name charset
</code></pre>
<p>What could be causing this?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>That may be caused by the <a href="http://python-notes.curiousefficiency.org/en/latest/python_concepts/import_traps.html#the-name-shadowing-trap" rel="nofollow noreferrer">name shadowing trap</a>. </p>
<p>A cause may be that you are shadowing the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.charset.html#email.charset.Charset" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Charset class</a>, which is defined in the email.charset module, when you import <code>from email import (charset as Charset, encoders as Encoders)</code>.</p>
<p>Another probable cause, supported by <a href="https://intellij-support.jetbrains.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/206594905-SOLVED-ImportError-cannot-import-name-modname?sort_by=votes" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this issue</a>: <br/>
If you check your file tree, you may find a file named <code>charset.py</code> or <code>Charset.py</code> which shadows the above mentioned</p>
<p>Search your files and you will find what casts the shadow.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, John. Should I look for a file named email.py, or charset.py?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That is usually the problem that causes this error, something that shadows an official python module.</span>
