<p>New to coding...
i am a student and have been tasked with writing a code that asks the user to input a series of values that will i will store in a list and then to ask to input a value (continue this until user types done) and then to check to determine if it is found in the list of valid values. </p>
<p>I'm assuming this could be done with a while true loop to accomplish the input until 'done' is typed and i'm assuming a search using 'if' and 'in' would accomplish the second part. </p>
<p>I am struggling finding a while true using the list of input. i am using an integer input. what am i comparing the condition to if to continue the loop? </p>
<p>Any help is appreciated! The code below is what i wrote i test if i could store input in a list but the while true is where i'm struggling with what to compare. </p>
<pre><code>while True:
    if list_of_inputs
list_of_inputs = input("Write numbers: ").split()
list_of_inputs = list(map(int , list_of_inputs))
print (list_of_inputs)
</code></pre>

<p>Here's some code that does what you described in the comments.</p>
<p>We use two <code>while</code> loops. The first one gets lines of input, one by one, and adds them to the <code>list_of_inputs</code>. If a line consisting of the string "done" is read we break out of the loop, and we <em>don't</em> add "done" to the list.</p>
<p>The second loop gets lines of input and tests whether or not they are present in <code>list_of_inputs</code>, printing an appropriate message. If the user inputs a line that <em>is</em> present in <code>list_of_inputs</code> we break out of the loop and the program ends.</p>
<pre><code>print('Please enter values for the list, one value per line')
print('Enter "done" (without the quotes) to end the list')

list_of_inputs = []
while True:
    s = input('value: ')
    if s == 'done':
        break
    list_of_inputs.append(s)

print('Here is the list:')
print(list_of_inputs)

while True:
    s = input('Please enter a test value: ')
    if s in list_of_inputs:
        print('Yes!', repr(s), 'is in the list')
        break
    else:
        print('No', repr(s), 'is NOT in the list')    
</code></pre>
<p><strong>test run</strong></p>
<pre><code>Please enter values for the list, one value per line
Enter "done" (without the quotes) to end the list
value: abc def
value: ghi
value: jkl
value: done
Here is the list:
['abc def', 'ghi', 'jkl']
Please enter a test value: def
No 'def' is NOT in the list
Please enter a test value: ghij
No 'ghij' is NOT in the list
Please enter a test value: jkl
Yes! 'jkl' is in the list
</code></pre>

<p>Make sure indentation is proper in python codes.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Fix the code to be syntactically correct atleast as we are not write the whole code for you.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">you should read up on indentation in python if this is what you have. Unlike other languages, strict indentation rules are mandatory.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">if i remove the top two lines they are syntactically correct because i receive output in a list of what the input is. i'm asking if a while loop is the way to accomplish the input until 'done' is typed then what would i compare the 'if' to be true?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Your program specification is a bit unclear. I <i>think</i> you're saying that the program first reads in a line of values, and stores those values into a list, which is your "list of valid values". Then it goes into a loop, reading one value per line, printing out a message that says whether that value is in the list of valid values or not. When a value of "done" is read, the loop terminates. Is that correct?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">i'm using python 3.5</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Just for a better understanding... In my work outside i never created a variable 'list_of_inputs' so in what i was writing i was never able to compare that variable inside the loop. I think i understand what i was missing now!! I am only a student a miss the most simple things  for what seems the easiest assignments! Appreciate your help greatly @PM 2Ring!!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Apologies. I stumbled upon this sit while researching. I haven't fully understood all of the details of the site yet. I was thinking it was adding a reputation to the person for assistance. What does the repr module do? Again, appreciate all the help!!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@GregHarris The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#repr" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>repr</code></a> function gets the representation of an object. For a string object, it returns the string with quote marks around it, like what you'd type into a Python program to create the string. See <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#fancier-output-formatting" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Fancier Output Formatting</a> in the official Python tutorial.</span>
