<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Simple enough, off of my last question, I am trying to make a directory change to a players desktop or file that is similar for all, as in <code>C:\\Users\\USERNAME\\Desktop\\Tester File</code> but the how would I make it so that USERNAME is the username of the person's computer? I tried using %USERNAME% but I don't really know how to do that, and it didn't work, and anyway the % gave an error message (I cannot remember the message, I think it was syntax error)</p>
<p>I also tried using ~, but it proved to be ineffective, but it may be due to my lack of experience.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong>
I solved this issue, thanks to some very great help from @pstatix so thank you.</p>
<p>By using user = getpass.getuser() I was able to do something like 'C:\Users' + user + '\Documents' it made this all user friendly! Thanks!</p>

<p>Have you tried the <code>getpass</code> module? <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.1/library/getpass.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">getpass documentation here</a>.</p>
<pre><code>import getpass
usr = getpass.getuser()
print usr
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Edit: For user specified example</strong></p>
<p>You may also be interested in using the <code>os</code> module? <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.getlogin" rel="nofollow noreferrer">os documentation here</a>.</p>
<pre><code>import os
usr = os.getlogin()
path = os.path.join('..', 'Users', usr, 'Desktop', 'Tester File')
os.chdir(path)
</code></pre>
<p>Using <code>os.environ</code> for environment variables may also prove useful. <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/os.html#process-parameters" rel="nofollow noreferrer">os.environ documentation here</a> For example:</p>
<pre><code>import os

def getUserName():
    # set possible environment variables
    for name in ('LOGNAME', 'USER', 'LNAME', 'USERNAME'):
        usr = os.environ.get(name)
        if user:
            return usr #return the variable

if __name__ == '__main__':
    usr = getUserName()
    # do remainder below
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">~ is not actually the name of the directory; it is completed by the shell. If you want to use it, you'll need to tell Python to complete it for you. You can do that with <code>os.path.expanduser()</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This did work, thanks!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@RobM Do you mind specifying which example I gave worked? You can even edit your own post to specify such so that users in the future may take note. Best of luck!</span>
