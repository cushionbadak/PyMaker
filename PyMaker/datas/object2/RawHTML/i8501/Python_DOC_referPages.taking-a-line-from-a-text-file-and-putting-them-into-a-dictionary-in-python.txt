<p>I have a line in the following format:</p>
<pre><code>Liam "!#123121" 32 "University of Southern California" "1312azasdas"
</code></pre>
<p>I want to split this line in python such that for each line in a file, there is a <code>name</code>, <code>age</code> and <code>university</code>. In the above example, '32' is the age, 'Liam' is the name and 'University...' is the University name. What could be the best way to do this?</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Regular Expressions</a>! They're a little confusing to get your head around to start with, but they're awesome. Too much to explain in full here, but a brief demo on your specific example:</p>
<pre><code>import re

t = 'Liam "!#123121" 32 "University of Southern California" "1312azasdas"'

nau = re.match('([A-Za-z]+) ".*" ([0-9]+) "([A-Za-z ]+)" .*', t)
nau.groups()

&gt;&gt; ('Liam', '32', 'University of Southern California')
</code></pre>
<p>Very brief breakdown of the regular expression:</p>
<ol>
<li>Anything within round brackets is a 'group' - i.e. the bits you're interested in.</li>
<li>Anything in square brackets denotes a character set - which means 'match any of these characters', and the hyphen in A-Z means 'anything upper case between A and Z'.</li>
<li>The '+' after square brackets means that it's looking for 1 or more of the characters in the set, and only stops when it finds a character <em>not</em> in the set.</li>
<li>'.*' means match <em>anything</em>, but you'll notice that none of the .*'s I've used are in the groups - they're just used to skip irrelevant stuff <em>between</em> the groups.</li>
</ol>
<p>Hoppe that helps!</p>

<p>Use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.reader" rel="nofollow noreferrer">csv.reader</a>, set empty space as delimiter and put in <code>"</code> for your quote character. This is fairly simple, just experiment and test a bit.</p>
