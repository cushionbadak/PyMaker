<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>In the python <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/signal.html#execution-of-python-signal-handlers" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation</a>, it seems like signal sent from python side could not kill long-running C/C++ process:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A long-running calculation implemented purely in C (such as regular expression matching on a large body of text) may run uninterrupted for an arbitrary amount of time, regardless of any signals received. The Python signal handlers will be called when the calculation finishes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is there a workaround for this? Could I implement something in C/C++ side(i.e, a callback function?) to capture keyboard interruption?</p>
<p>Thanks a lot for help!</p>

<p>Found a workaround <a href="http://snakesthatbite.blogspot.com/2010/09/cpython-threading-interrupting.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>, it seems like making the long running CPython program a daemon thread is one way to handle it.</p>
