<p>I am using Django 1.10 for my project. Below is the project structure.</p>
<pre><code>project
|-accounts
|  |-forms
|  |  |-__init__.py
|  |  |-user_forms.py
|-otherapp
|  |-views.py
</code></pre>
<p>I have define <code>UserForm</code> class in <code>user_forms.py</code> file and in <code>__init__.py</code> file I imported <code>user_forms</code> as <code>from .user_forms import *</code><br/>
I am trying to use <code>UserForm</code> in <code>otherapp</code>.<br/>
I was just curious why </p>
<pre><code>from accounts.form import UserForm
form = UserForm(request.POST)
</code></pre>
<p>works but</p>
<pre><code>import accounts.forms.UserForm
form = UserForm(request.POST)
</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code>form = accounts.form.UserForm(request.POST) 
</code></pre>
<p>does not work?  Why?</p>
<p>Isn't 3rd method better than first two as it follows zen of python <code>Explicit is better than implicit</code>.</p>
<p>What is the best way to import classes from one app to other?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can't do <code>import accounts.forms.UserForm</code> because <code>UserForm</code> is a class, not a module. You can however do:</p>
<pre><code>import accounts.forms
form = accounts.form.UserForm(request.POST)
</code></pre>
<p>Personally, I prefer your first approach. As long as <code>UserForm</code> doesn't clash with another <code>UserForm</code> from <code>account.views</code> it won't cause any problems. The import shows you where it has been imported from, so I don't think 'Explicit is better than implicit' is an issue here.</p>
<pre><code>from accounts.form import UserForm
form = UserForm(request.POST)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>When we <code>import</code> anything python search for the named module not for <code>class</code> or <code>function</code>. <code>UserForm</code> is a class according to you, thats why <code>import accounts.forms.UserForm</code> is not working. You can also do it by:</p>
<pre><code>from accounts.forms import *
form = UserForm(request.POST)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Star imports like <code>from accounts.forms import *</code> are discouraged -- it makes it harder to see where imports are coming from.</span>
