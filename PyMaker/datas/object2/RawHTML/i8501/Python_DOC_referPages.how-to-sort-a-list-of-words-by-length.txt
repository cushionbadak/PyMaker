<p>I want to sort words in a list based on length.</p>
<p>The test case is <code>{'cat','jump','blue','balloon'}</code></p>
<p>When run through this method it will print something along the lines of:</p>
<pre><code>{'balloon','jump','blue','balloon'}
</code></pre>
<p>Another problem I have run into, is that the type of python we were using worked fine, however when I try to run the .py in the Python 3.5.2 shell, it comes up with errors.</p>
<p>I mainly just need to know what I did wrong, and what I can do to fix it so that it works. Any help is appreciated!</p>
<p>The .py file can be found <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6qZYcl-qhFmQVBUSmxKUmx3eE0/view?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here:</a></p>
<pre><code>def wordSort():
    words = []
    minimum = 'NaN'
    index = 0
    x = 0    
    y = 0    
    z = 1
    #How many words to be entered
    length = input('How many words would you like to enter? ')
    #Put words in the number of times you entered previously    
    while not z &gt;= length + 1:
        words.append(raw_input('Enter word #' + str(z) + ': '))
        z += 1
    while x &lt; length:
        minimum = words[x]
        #Goes through the list and finds a smaller word
        while y &lt; length:
            if len(words[y]) &lt; len(minimum):
                minimum = words[y]
                index = y
            y += 1
        words[index] = words[x]
        words[x] = minimum
        x += 1
    print words

<li><code>print</code> is a function in Python 3.5 and needs to be used as <code>print(words)</code>. Read more about it <a href="http://sebastianraschka.com/Articles/2014_python_2_3_key_diff.html#the-print-function" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a></li>
<li><p>Given a list of words this can be used to sort them according to length of string using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#sorted" rel="nofollow noreferrer">sorted</a>:</p>
<p><code>sorted(word_list , key = len)</code></p></li>

<p>Try this. It will sort the list based on length of strings in ascending order </p>
<pre><code>list_name.sort(key=len)
</code></pre>
<p>For descending order,</p>
<pre><code>list_name.sort(key=len,reverse=True)

<span class="comment-copy">This is python 2.x (presumably 2.7) code. It needs to either be run under python 2.x or adjusted for python 3.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">even better: <code>sorted(word_list, key=len)</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@hallazzang yes, that's better. Added to the code.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thanks for the revesrse argument</span>
