<p>How do you run a specific line from a csv file depending on user input.
My code asks the user to input the problem with their phone, if the user inputs water has spilled the keyword water or spilled will be identified and a   solution stored in the csv will be printed. However i stored many solutions there for different keywords.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>First re-write your dataset as:</p>
<pre><code>'turn', 'on', 'off'
put it on charger
'small', 'text'
go on settings.
...
</code></pre>
<p>Then search for the problem and print the next line.</p>
<pre><code>problems = input("What is the problem?")

with open("/path/myfile.csv") as myfile:
    file = iter(myfile.readlines())
    for line in file:
        if any(word in line for word in problems.split()):
            print(next(file))
            break
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If your problems/solutions are written in the file this way:</p>
<pre><code>Problems1\nSolution1\nProblems2\nSolution2
</code></pre>
<p>which gives:</p>
<pre><code>Problems1
Solution1
Problems2
Solution2
</code></pre>
<p>you can try this code:</p>
<pre><code>problem = input ('What is your problem ? ')

with open ('keywords.txt', 'r') as myfile:
    text = myfile.read()

list_of_problems_and_solutions = text.split('\n')

for i in range (0, len(list_of_problems_and_solutions )-1, 2):
    if problem in list_of_problems_and_solutions [i]
    print (list_of_problems_and_solutions [i + 1])

&gt;&gt;&gt; What is your problem ? Problems1
Solution1
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>list_of_problems_and_solutions</code> will be someting like <code>['Problems1', 'Solution1', 'Problems2', 'Solution2' ]</code>
The <code>for i in range (0, len(list_of_problems_and_solutions )-1, 2):</code> function will go through the list from index 0 to the end, with a step of 2.
As you see, when I type <code>Problems1</code> as my problem, Python returns <code>Solution1</code>. You only have to replace with your keywords/solutions</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">The lines in <code>keywords.txt</code> are alternating between keywords and solutions, right? Additionally, I would recommend using json as a better way of storing information: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/json.html</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@BurningKarl can you check out my other question</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@stovfl can you check out my other question</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@sufiya: Don't see any <b>other question</b>. Why have you deleted your <code>code</code>, bring it back.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thank you!!! is there anyway that the keywords 'off' for example be detected from a sentence. when i type in a sentence including the keyword off the program does not work. if i type in off by itself it works perfectly fine though :) @Tasos</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Glad it works for you! In order to work with a given sentence, an idea would be to split the sentence into words and then search for each word independently. You could replace the <code>if problems ...</code> line with <code>if any(word in line for word in problems.split()):</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">an error comes up. it says problem is not defined @Tasos</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Then you probably did a spelling error while copy parting. It's <code>problems</code> not <code>problem</code> :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">if any(word in line for word in problems.split()):     input("What is the problem?") &lt;--- i copied and pasted + i indented it on my program correctly however it still does not work</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Be careful with your <code>i += 1</code>. You can easily check that <code>for i, line in enumerate(["a", "b", "c", "d"]): print(i, end=" "); i += 1</code> gives <code>0 1 2 3</code> and not <code>0 2</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Right, range function is more appropriate here</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Please change your description as well, because reading about <code>i += 1</code> in your description without seeing it in the actual code is confusing. Also <code>liste</code> is not defined here, change it to <code>list_of_problems_and_solutions</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Oops sorry, I do it</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Guil23 can you check my other question out plz</span>
