<p>how can i convert a string ip address to a decimal number. e.g I have a data <strong>bytes= b'363,3,1778952384,7076'</strong> , here <strong>1778952384</strong> is my ip address and <strong>7076</strong> is my port. How can I convert my IP address to decimal number. below is my code, please help me to solve these problem</p>
<p>/app.py</p>
<pre><code>import socket
from tornado.tcpclient import TCPClient
from tornado import gen

@gen.coroutine
def f(self, message):

    global stream
    client = TCPClient()
    stream = yield client.connect('192.168.8.108', 2620, max_buffer_size=int(1e9))
    msg = '192.168.8.101, 8000'.encode('utf-8')
    yield stream.write(msg)
    data = yield stream.read_bytes(21)
    print("bytes=",data) #bytes= b'363,3,1778952384,7076

<p>Python has an <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipaddress.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer" title="ipaddress">ipaddress</a> module which can handle this sort of thing. It was added to the standard library in Python 3, but should be installable for earlier versions, too.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import ipaddress
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(ipaddress.ip_address(1778952384))
IPv4Address('106.8.168.192')
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(str(ipaddress.ip_address(1778952384)))
'106.8.168.192'
</code></pre>
<p>You may also be asking about splitting the string (on <code>b','</code> since it's a bytestring), getting the right field, and converting it to an <code>int</code>:</p>
<pre><code>data = b'363,3,1778952384,7076'
ipaddress.ip_address(int(data.split(b',')[2]))
</code></pre>
