<p>I'm trying to record how many times the letter Y appears in the 6th column of a .txt file and assign that to a variable. How would I go about doing that? Thx in advance!</p>
<p><strong>.txt file:</strong></p>
<pre><code>119,29/12/15,18:00,Ripley,Magnitude,Y,Magnitude               
120,30/12/15,18:00,Jenkins,Kes,Y,Kes                    
121,31/12/15,18:00,Big Boss,Ingsoc,Y,Ingsoc

124,03/01/16,18:00,Dennis,Billy Casper,, 
</code></pre>
<p>I've set the whole file to a variable and have created variables for each column in the file.</p>
<pre><code>    NextRecord = data[x]
    Number = NextRecord[0]
    Date = NextRecord[1]
    Time = NextRecord[2]
    P1Nickname = NextRecord[3]
    P2Nickname = NextRecord[4]
    Status = NextRecord[5]
</code></pre>

<p>You should try using the <code>csv</code> module:</p>
<pre><code>import csv

counter = 0
with open("data.csv","r") as fi:
    inCsv = csv.reader(fi,delimiter=',')
    for row in inCsv:
        if (row[5].strip() == 'Y'):
            counter += 1
print ("Y count: " + str(counter))
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><strong><code>csv</code></strong></a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#sum" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><strong><code>sum</code></strong></a>:</p>
<pre><code>import csv

with open(filename) as records:
    reader = csv.reader(records)
    print(sum(row[5] == 'Y' for row in reader))
</code></pre>
<p>Your data is comma separated, and Python has the <code>csv</code> module for working with delimited values (could be semicolon separated, etc, as well).</p>
<p>The reader is iterable and yields a row at a time.</p>
<p>I've used the <code>sum</code> function which takes an iterable but I've used a generator expression to yield <code>True</code> or <code>False</code> for each <code>row</code> in the file.</p>
<p>The expression <code>row[5] == 'Y'</code> evaluates either <code>True</code> or <code>False</code>. When you give a boolean value to <code>sum</code> it converts to an integer and <code>True</code> becomes <code>1</code>, <code>False</code> becomes <code>0</code>. We could have written it as:</p>
<pre><code>sum(1 for row in reader
    if row[5] == 'Y')
</code></pre>
<p>This however is slightly different. It filters out only the rows which have <code>Y</code> in the 6th column and yields the value <code>1</code> for each of those rows. It's subtly different.</p>

<p>THIS should work as expected: </p>
<pre><code>noOfY=0
for line in open("thatTextFile.txt"): 
    try: 
        if 'Y' in line.split(',')[5]: noOfY+=1
    except:
        pass
print(noOfY)
</code></pre>
<p>This gives for the text provided above: </p>
<pre><code>3
</code></pre>
<p>and works even in case of malformed lines in the input text file. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">What have you tried?  What are you stuck on?  Is the <code>Status</code> variable showing you the value(s) you expect?  What trouble are you having incrementing a counter every time it's <code>'Y'</code> inside the loop?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Status shows me the values I expect but when  I try to find all occurances of Y in the column status it gives me the value 0. I found this but it doesn't work                                                                              "amountOutstanding = Status.count('Y')"</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why <code>Status.count('Y')</code> instead of <code>Status == 'Y'</code>?  Also what are you doing with the <code>amountOutstanding</code> variable?  Are you incrementing a global counter somewhere?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">the amountOutstanding variable is just the variable i'm trying to set it to so I can easily recall it#</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Don't you mean "increment"?  If you want a <i>counter</i>, you probably want to do something like <code>if Status == 'Y': amountOutstanding += 1</code>, right?  (Making sure to set <code>amountOutstanding = 0</code> at the beginning.)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What does csv and  .reader do?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Daddy: Reads a CSV file like the one you show.  It takes a file object and gives you back an iterator to iterate over the lines.  (Your "txt" file seems to be formatted like a CSV file, so you can probably read it as one.)
