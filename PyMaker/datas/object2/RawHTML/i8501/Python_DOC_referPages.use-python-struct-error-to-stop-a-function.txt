<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I'm trying to write a small function for my programm (python) which writes some data into a csv file. The input data is from an other file. Both files are opened!
The code for actual read- and writeprocess is:</p>
<pre><code>while aux != '':
     data = f.read(4)
     data = unpack('I', data)
     data = list(data)
     writer.writerow(data)
else:
     print('done')
</code></pre>
<p>This code works fine so far, but sometimes my input data doesn't have left 4 bytes at the end for the last readprocess, so it gives me the error "struct.error: unpack requires a string argument of length 4".</p>
<p>This is totally fine for me, i don't mind some dataloss at the end but this error stops my whole programm. 
Is there a way to stop the function and return to the main programm if this error occours? Or just stop the while loop und go on with the "else:" part?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This should do it:</p>
<pre><code>try:
    data = unpack('I', data)
except struct.error as err:
    print(err)
</code></pre>
<p>This way you'll know when there is a problem, but program execution will continue.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You seem to have mixed up <code>data</code> and <code>aux</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sorry, my bad. Wrote this question in a hurry and mixed some of my variables ... fixed it in my original post!</span>
