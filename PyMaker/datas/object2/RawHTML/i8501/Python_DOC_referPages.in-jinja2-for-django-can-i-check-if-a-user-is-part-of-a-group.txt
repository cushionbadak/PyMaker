<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I want to display certain header links to students and other header links to faculty. I could do what I want by checking user group in every single view, but I'd rather do it all at once in my header.html template in jinja2. Is this possible?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You should be able to accomplish this by doing the test in the header template, as you say, and assigning the result to a variable there; then you can read that variable in other templates. <a href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/2.9/templates/#assignments" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/2.9/templates/#assignments</a></p>
<p>As an alternative, you could use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.lru_cache" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.lru_cache</a> or <a href="http://docs.repoze.org/lru/api.html#repoze.lru.lru_cache" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://docs.repoze.org/lru/api.html#repoze.lru.lru_cache</a> , which would let you avoid repeated lookups without affecting the logic flow in the rest of your code.</p>
