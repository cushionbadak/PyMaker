<p>So I installed jupyter notebook through anaconda and I am working on python 3 kernel.</p>
<p>I am trying to do Time profiling using <code>%time</code> magic command as show <a href="http://pynash.org/2013/03/06/timing-and-profiling/" rel="noreferrer">here</a>
The problem is that it only prints the <strong>Wall Time</strong> not the <strong>CPU Time</strong></p>
<p>using <code>%time</code> or <code>%%time</code> does not help</p>
<ul>
<li><code>%time</code> prints the <em>wall time</em> for the <strong>first line</strong> only</li>
<li><code>%%time</code> prints the <em>wall time</em> for the <strong>whole cell</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>I am not sure if there any specif config to print the CPU time</p>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong> </p>
<p>To clarify using <code>%%time</code> should print two metrics for the <em>whole cell</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Metric 1</strong>: CPU Times</li>
<li><strong>Metric 2</strong>: wall time</li>
</ul>
<p>my problem is that I only get wall time not CPU time.</p>
<p>You may check this <a href="http://pynash.org/2013/03/06/timing-and-profiling/" rel="noreferrer">link</a> on what is the expected output for <code>%%time</code></p>

<p>So it seems that my issue was in the environment itself. </p>
<p>Switching from Windows to Ubuntu actually helped me print the <em>CPU times</em>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">you want <code>%timeit</code> for consistent timings this will run the line of code multiple times and return the average, <code>%%timeit</code> gives the time for the cell</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@EdChum not really .. what I want is the CPU times which should be printed using <code>%time</code> .. have a look at the link above to see what I mean</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ah right, I see your issue, I don't know if you can get the specific cpu time, rather you can get the system and cpu time: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.process_time" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.process_time</a>, see related: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7370801/measure-time-elapsed-in-python" title="measure time elapsed in python">stackoverflow.com/questions/7370801/â€¦</a>. I don't see anything built-in as a magic command in ipython</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@EdChum well I see what you are trying to do, however I am sure magic command <code>%%time</code> shall show the CPU times. I actually managed to do it as it seem a windows issue. Running on Ubuntu gave the me the desired result</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That's interesting I didn't think there would be a behavioural difference between ubuntu and windows. Please post an answer as I think this would be useful for others to know</span>
