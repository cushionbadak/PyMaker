<p>Ok, so I have some code when creating a database.</p>
<p>Here's the code:</p>
<p><img alt="The code" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/i2oaj.png"/></p>
<p>So basically, the PhoneNumber is set to unique. If I enter a phone number that has already been entered the program stops and gives an error message (Because it is unique). </p>
<p>How do I get it to keep running or display a message saying "Phone number already taken please input another on" instead of ending</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>You can use <code>try catch</code> statement to do exception handle.</p>
