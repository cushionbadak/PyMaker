<p>Probably simple but I want to send a post with a color hex in it that the target is expecting but I can't set that value in the color key because it comments out everything after it.</p>

<p>You can't use <code>#</code> as part of the name of a Python variable (see <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#identifiers" rel="nofollow noreferrer">identifiers and keywords</a>), but you can put <code>#</code> followed by the color code in a string and send it as part of your payload for <code>POST</code>ing:</p>
<pre><code>var = '#42'
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>#</code> isn't a comment if it's inside a string.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Post the code you're having trouble with, so we can tell what you're doing wrong.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Barmar you're correct. I had it in a string and I tried the post and it worked fine. Nano was just comment coloring everything after it anyway.  Thanks!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">hmm....  the suggestions that were made is exactly how I'm doing it. I haven't tried the post yet because in nano(i know, but I like nano) its already showing it as commented out. Maybe I can just ignore it's colorzing in this case. I will try it and see if it succeeds.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yea it worked the way I had it. Thanks for confirming! I guess I shoulda just tried it but I didn't wanna upload anything malformed.</span>
