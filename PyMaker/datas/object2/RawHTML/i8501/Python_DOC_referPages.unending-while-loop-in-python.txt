<p>I cannot get my while loop inf the getClasses function to end when it is supposed to. Both getNum and counter are set as integers. I have also tried to do <code>while True</code> and an if statement to see if that would help, yet that just gives me an infinite loop. I know that this is a simple problem, yet I cannot figure out what it is that I am doing wrong. Please help.</p>

            break
        except:
            print("Input must be a number")
    return num

def getGrades(): #Gets the grades from the user
    counter2 = 1

    if counter2 &lt;= getNum: #If the 2nd counter is less than or equa to the number of classes...

<span class="comment-copy">When is it supposed to end?  What is getNum?</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>counter2 &lt;= getNum</code> and <code>getNum()</code>? It can't be both an integer and a function... this code likely doesn't work at all.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What is getNum???</span>
<span class="comment-copy">getNum function should return an integer.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What is the value returning from your getNum() function? The while loop iterates for the getNum() times.</span>
