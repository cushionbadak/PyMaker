<p>I'm very new to python but I've learned the basics and now how it mostly works. I've been trying to install a Django framework for a server so that it can host a webpage.</p>
<p>Basically the problem here is that when I run commands such as:</p>
<pre><code>python3 -V
</code></pre>
<p>I get the output</p>
<pre><code>Python 3.6.1
</code></pre>
<p>But for some reason when using pip3 it decides to use the pip that is version specific to Python 3.5, for example doing:</p>
<pre><code>pip3 install Django==1.11
</code></pre>
<p>installs Django in "/usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages" instead of the Python 3.6 counterpart of the dist-packages directory.</p>
<p>according to python documentations (<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html?highlight=pip#work-with-multiple-versions-of-python-installed-in-parallel" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html?highlight=pip#work-with-multiple-versions-of-python-installed-in-parallel</a>) I should be able to run this command:</p>
<pre><code>python3.6 -m pip install SomePackage
</code></pre>
<p>to use the pip that is specific to Python 3.6, but this doesn't seem to work. I get an error saying "no module named pip" or "no module named pip3".</p>
<p>I am running on a server that uses Ubuntu 16.04</p>
<p>I appreciate all help, thanks in advance! :)</p>
<p>EDIT: I have tried running</p>
<pre><code>pip3 -V
</code></pre>
<p>which gave me the output</p>
<pre><code>pip 9.0.1 from /home/user/.local/lib/python3.5/site-packages (python 3.5)
</code></pre>
<p>From this I can say that I have no problems at all using python3 with Python 3.6, but when running pip3 it uses pip 9.0.1 from Python 3.5. Also running</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt-get install python3-pip
</code></pre>
<p>gives me the output</p>
<pre><code>0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 98 not upgraded.
</code></pre>

<p>I once had the similar problem. And, I sort it out with following:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>First install pip3 in your system</p>
<pre><code> sudo apt-get install python3-pip
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Create your virtualenv</p>
<pre><code> pip3 -p python3.6 virtualenv myenv
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Then install djangon in your virtualenv after activating it.</p>
<pre><code> pip3 install Django
</code></pre></li>
</ol>
<p>You can specify the django version as:</p>
<pre><code>  pip3 install Django==1.11
</code></pre>

<p>I totally forgot about this post, I just wanna say that pip is a very dangerous tool and should be used with caution since it affects the structure of your computer/server. What I did to solve whatever mess I had created at this time was to:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Format the server.</p></li>
<li><p>To work with and only use pip/pip3 in virtualenv. What makes virtualenvs so awesome is that if something goes wrong then it only goes wrong inside that virtualenv. You will not need to format your computer/server, instead you might have to delete that virtualenv and create a new one.</p></li>
<li><p>Never use pip/pip3 on your computer/server without a virtualenv, I found out that you don't even need to install it on your root. Best way of using pip is to run a virtualenv and then install it on that virtualenv.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Hope these tips helps preventing people from making huge but easily avoidable mistakes! :D </p>

<span class="comment-copy">@Eliethesaiyan There is no problems with using any python3 commands, python3 -V proves that. But it's the pip3 specific for 3.6 that I have problems with.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for your answer, but for some reason when using      "sudo apt-get install python3-pip"  I got 0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 103 not upgraded.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Have you tried :   <code>sudo apt-get remove --auto-remove python3-pip</code> first and proceed the steps ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I tried sudo remove and then follow the steps. Step 1 reinstalled pip3 with python3.5 so I just ended up going back to where I was. I did try step 2 as well but I received "no such option: -p"</span>
