<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I made a python script in which it runs a specified terminal command.</p>
<pre><code>def main(my_list):
    for item in my_list:
        os.system("myCmd -s {0}".format(item))

    item_list = ['itemA', 'itemB', 'itemC']
    main(item_list)
</code></pre>
<p>As the terminal command I am trying to use does not accepts a list in the <code>-s</code> argument, which is the reason that I make it into a python script.
While running the script, it works but I notice that it will prompts me with the following question:
<code>Are you sure you want to continue (y/n)?</code></p>
<p>This means I will need to punch in the <code>y</code> on my keyboard, 3 times in the above example.
But in the event if my list is huge, and should I not be on my desk, is there any way that I can script to make it accept 'y' as my answer, without me to press anything on the keyboard?</p>

<p>You'd need to use a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pipes.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">pipe</a>, that way you can actually write to that pipe an answer, don't forget to close the pipe once you're done with it.</p>
<pre><code>p = os.popen("myCmd -s {0}".format(item), "w")
p.write("y\n")
</code></pre>

<p>Use the <strong>pexpect module</strong>.  It's basically <strong>expect</strong> used in shell scripts, for Python.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Awesome! That works for me!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Glad I could help @dissidia</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I did not get a chance to test this as it appears I need to install it. But I'm sure it works as well!</span>
