<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I am currently trying to create a python program that prints out specific sections of a file. I tried using file.read() and file.readline() but I can't seem to get an exact position, just either full lines or bits. Is there a better function to be using or an import I can use?</p>
<p>The problem I am running into is my files output reads</p>
<pre><code>facet normal 0.00000e+00 0.00000e+00 0.00000e+00
</code></pre>
<p>I want to take the values and put them into a variable. I would like to create an if statement that takes those three values and adds them to different variables however I don't know of a function that does that. Should I be trying to parse the file first?</p>
<p>My code to provide the output is</p>
<pre><code>f = open ('/pycharm/sphere.stl')
for line in f:
  print(line)
</code></pre>
<p>I would like to have an if statement along the lines of </p>
<pre><code>f = open ('/pycharm/sphere.stl')
for line in f:
  if line == "facet normal"
    a = nextFloat()
    if a == true
      b = nextFloat()
      if b == true
        c = nextFloat()
      if c == true
        d = a + b + c
        print (d)
</code></pre>
<p>I am trying to solve for d but I can't find a way to use the output of the file in order to input for d.</p>

<p>I think what you are looking for is something like <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/regex.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">regular expressions</a>. However you can in principle do something like <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/string_split.htm" rel="nofollow noreferrer">split</a>:</p>
<pre><code>for line in f.readlines():
  if line.split()[0] == 'fact normal':
    a = nextFloat() ## the rest of your code...
</code></pre>
<p>hope that helps you.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You mean , to read specific lines of a file.?</span>

<span class="comment-copy">It all kinda depends on the format of the file. What are "sections"? How do you know where they are. You'll get a lot further here if you have sample data, a description of the file format and your attempt at getting it to work.</span>

If nothing fits your needs, read all the file content and search inside it to identify the "section" you are talking about.</span>
