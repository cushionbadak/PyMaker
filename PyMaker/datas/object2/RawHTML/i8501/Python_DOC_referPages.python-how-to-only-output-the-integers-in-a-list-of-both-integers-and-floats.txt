<p>I think what you are trying to ask is, "How do I determine if one number is evenly divisible by another?"</p>
<p>The answer to that question is the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#binary-arithmetic-operations" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>modulo operator: %</code></a></p>
<p>The modulo operation basically returns the integer remainder after division of two numbers. So the result of <code>6 % 5</code> will be 1, <code>7 % 5</code> will be 2, etc.</p>
<p>You can check if <code>a % b == 0</code> in order to determine that yes, a is divisible by b. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">Not quite what I was asking, but thanks. I am trying to find common denominators between two numbers. I did word it wrong, though. I only want whole numbers, and it is giving me a lot of decimal numbers. any ideas on how to accomplish this?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Use <code>%</code>. When you are computing <code>a = x / i</code>, you should first check if <code>x % i == 0</code>. Because if so, you'll get an integer result when you divide <code>x/i</code>, otherwise you'll get a fractional number: <code>15 % 2 == 0</code>? no. <code>15/2 = 7.5</code> (fractional result)</span>
