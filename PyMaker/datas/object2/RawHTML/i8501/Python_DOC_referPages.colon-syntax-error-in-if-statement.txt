<p>Ok, so i'm pretty new to the whole coding scene, and i've been working on python through code academy. On the site there is an activity where you make a pig latin translator. I was able to make this just fine, but when I attempted to recreate it in the python shell I was getting some weird errors in the if statement.</p>
<pre>pyg = "ay"

original = raw_input("Enter a word bro:")\
if len(original) &gt; 0 and original.isalpha():\

    print original\


else:
    print "error"</pre>
<p>I get a syntax error on the colon ending the statement, so I assumed it was some kind of indentation error. However when I put a line space between the line previous and the if statement, it works just fine! Can anyone explain why this is??</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Ending each line with <code>\</code> is what's tripping you up. (See the documentation for <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#explicit-line-joining" rel="nofollow noreferrer">"Explicit line joining"</a>)</p>
<p><code>\</code> is the chatacter used to continue a line if you want to have a "single line" span multiple lines of text</p>
<p>The python interpreter sees it and ignores the next newline character and thus sees:</p>
<pre>pyg = "ay"

original = raw_input("Enter a word bro:")if len(original) &gt; 0 and original.isalpha():
    print original

else:
    print "error"</pre>
<p>when you add the extra space it works because the if statement is again on it's own line</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Aside: the <code>len(original) &gt; 0</code> isn't necessary, <code>isalpha()</code> will only return True if there's at least one character in the string.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why are there so many `\` and so much empty space?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">So I ran your code here <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/execute_python_online.php" rel="nofollow noreferrer">tutorialspoint.com/execute_python_online.php</a> and it looks like everything is working fine. Although, I removed the \ from the code</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I ran your code on my machine and it worked fine. I'd check not being mixing spaces with tabs (when I pasted the code it was wrongly formatted)</span>

Please leave "thanks" and other personal messages out of your question as it serves as a record for others to search in case they have your same problem in the future</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks man! Exactly what the problem was! I had been originally inputing code directly into the shell, where I was required to use them, when I switched over to using the actual program, it ended up just causing syntax errors.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Chirvin glad I could help. I'm curious what shell requires backslashes to terminate each line.. I've never heard of that before</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It was a much older version of the shell, ive updated it now. It may have never even been necessary, as I look back on it now. Probably just read something wrong somewhere lol.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Chirvin I added a bit of documentation if you want to read up more on the subject. It seems relatively simple once you know it, but it's a must-know for understanding python syntax.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Awesome! Where can I find this?</span>
