<p>I have 30,000 files in a folder. start from <code>0</code> to <code>30000</code>. I want to read from start to end with <code>10</code> interval when end number is higher than <code>5000</code>. I have created following code, </p>
<pre><code>startFile = 0
endFile = 5000

for k in range(startFile, endFile + 1):
    execfile(read_path + str(k) + ".py")
</code></pre>
<p>This code read my file <code>0</code> to <code>5000</code>. But i need it to read at an interval of 10 when <code>endfile</code> is larger than <code>5000</code>. So there must be 2 conditions, one for <code>endfile</code> less or equal to <code>5000</code> it will read <code>0</code> to <code>5000</code> and one for <code>endfile</code> higher than <code>5000</code> where the program will read with an interval of <code>10</code>. Any idea how to write it in python?</p>

<p>You can find the number of files in a directory by using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.listdir" rel="nofollow noreferrer">os.listdir</a>;</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import os
&gt;&gt;&gt; n_files = len(os.listdir(read_path))
&gt;&gt;&gt; n_files 
74
</code></pre>
<p>Once you do that, you can choose your stepsize and process every 10th file by giving step argument to range;</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; startFile = 0
&gt;&gt;&gt; endFile = 5000

&gt;&gt;&gt; step = 1 if n_files &lt;= endFile else 10

&gt;&gt;&gt; for k in range(startFile, endFile + 1, step):
&gt;&gt;&gt;     execfile(read_path + str(k) + ".py")
</code></pre>
<p>For reference <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/functions.html#func-range" rel="nofollow noreferrer">range</a> (start, stop, step) arguments. Step is the index increment size, it will pick the <strong>n</strong>'th next element if you set it as <strong>n</strong>.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; [i for i in range(0, 100, 10)]
[0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90]
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Do you mean something like 'in chunks of 10 file' or every 10th file. Latter can be easily solved by adding a 3rd argument (step) to your for loop. <code>if endfile &gt;= 500: for k in range(startFile, endFile+1, 10)</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Isn't this question about generating strings?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@umutto every 10th file. as 30000 files contain load of data i need the program to escape some file. as i can modify endFile it is better to have both condition at the same time one for endfile&lt;=5000 and one for endFile&gt;5000</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Peter Wood I am not sure about it as I am new in programming.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@TanvirHossain Okay, I think I got what you want to do and I made my comment a bit more clearer and write as an answer.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Instead of introducing n_file can I directly write,  step = 1 if endFile &lt;= 5000 else 10 for k in range(startFile, endFile + 1, step): execfile(read_path + str(k) + ".py")</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@TanvirHossain yes you can, I used n_files for easier readability. But in your comment <code>endfile &lt;= 5000</code> will always be true, since you initialized it as so. Do you want to replace <code>n_files</code> with <code>len(os.listdir(read_path))</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">actually i dont need n_file as i can define numbers according to my need. it can be 100 or 1000 or 10000. I just need to introduce my step here for two different cases to reduce simulation time.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@TanvirHossain If you know the number of files and want to explicitly present the number. You don't need to use os.listdir, I've included that so it would be a bit more dynamic. You can just do if - else check and adjust the step size accordingly.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@umotto Yes I have to define the number of start and end file. I use step=1 and it works fine but for step=10 I am getting this 'error index 70 is out of bounds for axis 1 with size 61'</span>
