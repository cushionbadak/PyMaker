<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I am trying to make it so that the while loop stops when you press c without stopping it using input.</p>
<p>The code I have at the moment is this:</p>
<pre><code>    while True:
        print("Test")
        if msvcrt.kbhit():
            if (msvcrt.getch() == "c"):
                os._exit(0)
                break
            elif (msvcrt.getch() != "c"):
                continue
</code></pre>
<p>FYI I am on windows.
Any ideas on how to do it besides the attempt I have already done?</p>

<p>The problem is in the line <code>if (msvcrt.getch() == "c"):</code>.</p>
<p>You don't use <code>getch() == "c"</code> but <code>getch() == 99</code> or but <code>getch() == ord("c")</code>.</p>
<p>Why? Because it's what <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#ord" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>ord()</code></a> returns. It returns an integer representing the Unicode code point of the only character in the string, in this case c.</p>
<hr/>
<p>By the way, Python already has <code>KeyboardInterrupt</code> that allows using <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> for interrupting code. You can also <code>try-except</code> it.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: You may also want to use 67 for if <kbd>Caps Lock</kbd> is on.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I assume you're on Python 3 since you're using <code>print</code> as a function. In this case <code>msvcrt.getch()</code> returns <code>bytes</code>, and <code>b"c" != "c"</code>. You want <code>msvcrt.getwch()</code> to get a Unicode character that Python 3 returns as <code>str</code>.</span>
