<p>I am a total novice with Raspberry Pi, I'm importing and combining a couple of programs together, working with Python 3 and VIM.  One of the programs has a code line that reads:</p>
<pre><code>import os, glob, date, time.
</code></pre>
<p>How do I import GLOB for Windows 10 so I can work on my laptop?  I'm sure I will have a few hundred more questions but this is where I think I have to start.
Thanks Gaggle,
Barry </p>

<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/glob.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">glob</a> is part of the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python Standard Library</a>, it thus comes pre-installed with Python, whether you run Python on Windows, macOS, Linux, or whatever.. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">I am confused... are you trying to be able to connect your Pi to Windows, or get Windows to run on your Pi?  I am guessing the first, but then <code>glob</code> likely does not apply, given that it appears to do with shell programming.  Anyway, you may have more luck over at: <a href="https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/">raspberrypi.stackexchange.com</a>.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">Hi Josh &amp; Gaggle:  I am running VIM on a laptop that is running Windows 10.  I wish to write my program on the laptop using VIM.  Then copy the code over to the RPi.  So, Part 1:  Can I run the program, just to see if it will run on the laptop?  Part 2: When I copy it to the RPi, and run it, it does not recognize the line:  import os, glob, date, time.</span>
