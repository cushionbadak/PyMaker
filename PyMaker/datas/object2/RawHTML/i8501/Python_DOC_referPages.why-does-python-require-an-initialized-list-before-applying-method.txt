<p>The following works just fine:</p>
<pre><code>b = [1,]
b.append([2, 3])
# returns type "list" [1, 2, 3]
</code></pre>
<p>But the following doesn't:</p>
<pre><code>[1,].append([2, 3])
# returns type "NoneType"
</code></pre>
<p>This holds true for a few of the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">list methods</a> that' I've tried. Why does Python require explicit variable declaration before applying a method?</p>

<p>You're not reading that right. <code>.append()</code> returns None in both cases. In the first case, it is <code>b</code> that results in <code>[1, 2, 3]</code>. In the second, that list is created also, but you don't have access to it becaues you didn't assign a variable name to it.</p>

<p><strong>append</strong> returns <strong>None</strong> as its value, but alters the list.  Try</p>
<pre><code>b = [1,]
output = b.append([2, 3])
</code></pre>
<p>You'll get <strong>None</strong> for <strong>output</strong>, too.</p>
