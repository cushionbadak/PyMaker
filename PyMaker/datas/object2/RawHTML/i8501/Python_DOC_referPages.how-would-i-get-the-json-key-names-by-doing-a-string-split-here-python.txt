<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have a json var:
       <code>[u'{"Average_Rating":3.75,"Number_Of_Users_Who_Have_Watched_This_Movie":90,"title":"Quiz Show (1994)"}']</code></p>
<p>And I want to get the '3.75', '90' and 'Quiz Show (1994)'. I've tried doing: </p>
<pre><code>  for i in var:
      i.split(":")[1:-3]
</code></pre>
<p>but it's not working. I'm sure this is something simple but just don't get how to use it properly! Could anyone please help?</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>Normally, I would just use the <code>json</code> library but I'm using Apache PySpark and there are a few issues around JSON - how can I do it using just string splitting?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You are trying to get information from a JSON string, you should really use <code>json</code> for this.</p>
<pre><code>var = [u'{"Average_Rating":3.75,"Number_Of_Users_Who_Have_Watched_This_Movie":90,"title":"Quiz Show (1994)"}']
import json

for i in var:
    print json.loads(i)["Average_Rating"]
</code></pre>
<h2>Per request of the original poster:</h2>
<pre><code>var = [u'{"Average_Rating":3.75,"Number_Of_Users_Who_Have_Watched_This_Movie":90,"title":"Quiz Show (1994)"}']

for i in var:
    print(i.split(":")[1].split(",")[0])
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">You don't have a JSON var, you have a list with one unicode string in it (that contains JSON).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Oh I see, thank you. How can I get the respective values out of that?</span>

<span class="comment-copy">Hi @WayneWerner, just made an edit.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@xn139 you might want to add restrictions like that in your questions, perhaps even in the form of tags. With the generic python tags you can still add 4 more if you feel that they can help localize your question.</span>
