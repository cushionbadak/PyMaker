<p>When I try and print n in the main program, it doesn't return anything. Can someone give me advice on what I'm doing wrong. I'm a bit confused on how reading txt files works..</p>
<p>Main program</p>
<pre><code>from functions import sentence_count

file_variable = 'pelee.txt'

n = sentence_count(file_variable)

print(n)

<p>You need to reset the <code>line</code> variable to the next line of the file:</p>
<pre><code>while line != "":
    for ch in line:
        if ch in '.?!':
            n += 1
    line = file.readline()
</code></pre>
<p>I would instead iterate over lines of the filelike object like this:</p>
<pre><code>f = open('example.txt', 'r')

for line in f:
    if '.' in line or '?' in line or '!' in line:
        n += 1
</code></pre>
<p>This works because Python's <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>open()</code></a> function returns an iterable object (<code>io.TextIOBase</code>) that allows you to navigate the contents of the file in a for loop. Each item returned by the iterable is the next line of the file. You can just check the char that you're looking to find in the <code>line</code> variable.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Show us your full code.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@AlexVincent Where is your main functioin then?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Show us your full, unedited code. I presume the first code snippet is in a function? Show us that entire function, including its signiture</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yeah that works. Thank you. Can you explain in more detail on how to do this in one for loop?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It will not work if you have multiple sentences in one line.</span>
