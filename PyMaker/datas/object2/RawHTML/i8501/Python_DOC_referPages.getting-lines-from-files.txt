<p>I am trying to get <code>a</code> to be the first line of the <code>file</code> and <code>b</code> to be the second. </p>
<p>This prints nothing. </p>

<p>If you want to read all the lines of a file in a list you can also use
  list(f) or f.readlines().</p>

<pre><code>lines = f.readlines()
a = lines[0]

<span class="comment-copy">not really thats just add all lines into list</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why do you have the <code>while</code> loop? What's it for?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">to read each line</span>
<span class="comment-copy">But you are also doing that with <code>readline</code>. Are you actually trying to iterate the whole file three lines at a time, or do you just want the first and second lines as you state in the question?</span>
