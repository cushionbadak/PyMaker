<p>I'm new to python and I'm trying to figure out how to ask the user for input and then use that input to select a specific card from a deck of cards. This is what I have so far   </p>
<pre><code>cardfaces = []
suits = ["Hearts", "Diamonds", "Clubs", "Spades"]
royals = ["J", "Q", "K", "A"]
deck = []


for i in range(2,11):
    cardfaces.append(str(i))


for j in range(4):
    cardfaces.append(royals[j])



for k in range(4):
    for l in range(13):
        card = (cardfaces[l] + " of " + suits[k])
        deck.append(card)


for m in range(52):
    print(deck[m])
pick=input('Pick a card 1-52 :')
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I assume your problem is that you don't know how to access the chosen card, once the player picks a number.</p>
<p>If that's the case, you're already close to the solution!</p>
<p>When the player inputs a number, you've stored it as a string in the <code>pick</code> variable. The next steps are to:</p>
<ol>
<li>convert that string to an integer, and </li>
<li>find the card at that position in the deck.</li>
</ol>
<p>Python has a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int" rel="nofollow noreferrer">built-in <code>int</code> function</a>, to convert the pick from a string to an integer.</p>
<p>Your <code>deck</code> variable is a list, and to get items out of a list in Python, you can request the item by index. The index is a number representing the position of that item:</p>
<pre><code>animals = ["cat", "dog", "fish", "pterodactyl]
print(animals[0]) # "cat"
print(animals[1]) # "dog"
print(animals[2]) # "fish"
</code></pre>
<p>Adding this to your code should do the trick:</p>
<pre><code>pick = int(pick)
card = deck[pick]
print("Your card is", card)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You're almost there!  All you need to do is to get the card out of <code>deck</code>.</p>
<pre><code>pick = input('Pick a card 1-52 :')

card = deck[int(pick)-1]

print("You chose: The {}".format(card))
</code></pre>
<p>(Psst!  remember, lists start at index <code>0</code>, that's why you have to <code>-1</code> from it)</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>It looks to me as if all you need to do is access the chosen card.</p>
<pre><code>chosen_card = deck[int(pick)-1]
</code></pre>
<p>Do you need to do more with this?  I would normally think that you'd want the deck to be a list of (suit, rank) pairs, rather than string descriptions.  You can select a card description with your current code, but <strong>deck</strong> doesn't have an easy way to turn those descriptions back into characteristics you can manipulate.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Your question isn't quite specific enough. What's wrong with the code you have so far? Are you getting an error? Is there some functionality you can't find the syntax for?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Won't this throw an IndexOutOfBounds if someone inputs 52?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Good point.  Fixed.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Now you'll get a <code>TypeError</code> :P</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Nope; 52 gives me "A of Spades", as expected.  How are you seeing a TypeError here?</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>pick-1</code> is a <code>str-int</code>, it gives me a <code>unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'str' and 'int'</code></span>
