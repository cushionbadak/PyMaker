<p>So I currently have a thread that is outputting, and I need a way to handle input while still allowing output from the thread in the meantime.</p>
<p>Currently I have something like this</p>
<pre><code>def thread_func():
    while True:
        print("Information")

threading.Thread(target=thread_func).start()

while True:
    command = raw_input("Enter a command:")
    #dostuff with command
</code></pre>
<p>My issue now is that my thread isn't printing anything.  Or if it is it isn't showing up</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>
<p>Found a solution here

<p>You want to use a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/queue.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Queue</a>. New input will go into the back of the queue, and work will be started from the front. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">I cannot duplicate this behavior. In fact, when I run this same code in Python2 it prints <code>"Information"</code> so quickly I'm unable to enter the command. Can you be more specific in the behavior you're seeing?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You're right, that does run.  I was trying to simplify the code because it's kinda complicated and very specific to what I'm working on.  Basically in the thread I'm looping over a stream and I guess for some reason that's causing the issue.  I ended up fixing the problem by looking at the answer supplied here <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22391134/exiting-while-loop-by-pressing-enter-without-blocking-how-can-i-improve-this-me/22391379#22391379" title="exiting while loop by pressing enter without blocking how can i improve this me">stackoverflow.com/questions/22391134/…</a></span>

<span class="comment-copy">Awesome I'm glad it's working! I'm closing this question as a duplicate of the linked question.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It's not clear how a queue would be implemented to solve his problem.</span>
