<p>I want to download xml file from issue tracking system one by one.It produces error message when file not exist in the repository. I include the python script to better understand my problem.</p>

<p>The problem happens on the first iteration of the loop, the url value becomes:</p>
<pre><code>https://issues.apache.org/jira/si/jira.issueviews:issue-xml/DERBY-0/DERBY-0.xml
</code></pre>
<p>which is a "dead link" and requesting it results into 404 Not Found error.</p>
<p>Start your loop with <code>1</code>:</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I do not the all xml files name. That's why, I generate all probable files name then try to download and save. If file not found then generate error. But, I need to download all files that exist and skip if not exist. Please help me if someone can.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I appreciate you answer. Thanks a lot. But, still have a problem. I found DERBY-16.xml not exist. when the loop reach at 16 then again error generate and found same stack trace.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">DERBY-16.xml does not exist on the server, but the above script just skips it and continues with the reset. You might want to put in a <code>print('downloaded: "{}"'.format(url))</code> after the <code>file.write</code> so that you can see which ones are succeeding</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for your explanation. I do not why continue (to skip exception) does not work here.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I think you are expert in python programming. I badly need the above code run properly. I will be very grateful and thankful to you. please help me.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@RejaulKarim the code I posted works for me. You'll need to edit the question to add the new code you're running along with the output (including exception)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for your answer. The problem is some files is missing with in the range. When file not found then generate error message and quit the program. How can I handle exception. Could you please help me?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@RejaulKarim ah, that's exactly what Peter's answer is about. Check it out. Thanks.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for you support. It is really help me lot</span>
