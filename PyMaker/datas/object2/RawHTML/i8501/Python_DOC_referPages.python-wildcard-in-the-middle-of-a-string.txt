<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have a directory with a number of files which all have the same basic filename format (below is a sample)</p>
<pre><code>roll_0_oe_2008-03-24_AAA.XNGS
roll_0_oe_2008-03-24_AAB.XNGS
roll_1_oe_2008-03-31_AAC.XNGS
roll_1_oe_2008-03-31_AAG.XNGS
roll_2_oe_2008-04-07_AAR.XNGS
roll_2_oe_2008-04-07_AAJ.XNGS
</code></pre>
<p>I am trying to select a file based on using:</p>
<pre><code>filename = 'roll_'+str(roll)'_'*ID
</code></pre>
<p>where roll is an int that I convert to a string and ID is a string.  I'm using the wildcard * for the _oe_date element as i don't care about this part. I however get the following error:</p>
<pre><code>TypeError: can't multiply sequence by non-int of type 'str'
</code></pre>
<p>How can I construct a filename using  wildcard in the middle?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You have to embed the wild card <em>as a character</em>, and make sure that you're file search interface accepts wild cards.</p>
<pre><code>filename = 'roll_'+str(roll)'_*'+ID
</code></pre>
<p>However, note that this does <em>not</em> identify a specific file name: to do that, you need a system command (there are several to search and fetch file names).  The Python <strong>open</strong> function does <em>not</em> accept wild cards. </p>

<p>I think you want the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/glob.html?highlight=glob#module-glob" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>glob</code></a> module, and the <code>str.format(...)</code> method:</p>
<pre><code># Don't know where this comes from.
roll = 2
id = 'AAC'

# Format: roll_2_oe_2008-04-07_AAJ.XNGS
Fn_format= "roll_{}_oe_*_{}.XNGS"

# Make a file-glob by putting the roll into format.
rolled_files = Fn_format.format(roll, id)


import glob

for fname in glob.iglob(rolled_files):
    print("Rolled file:", fname)
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You could use <code>format()</code>:</p>
<pre><code>filename = 'roll_{}_{}'.format(roll, ID)

<span class="comment-copy">Your question is hard to understand. I think you want <code>filename = 'roll_'+str(roll) + '_' + ID</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Didn't you mean <code>+</code> instead of <code>*</code> ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>*</code> needs to be in a string, at the moment you're using it as a multiplier.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks Austin, How would I add the ID element to Fn_format (I need to pass the ID (AAA or AAG etc) into the filename? Thanks</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Add another <code>{}</code> in the right place in the format string, and call <code>.format(roll, id)</code>. See <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#formatstrings" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the docs</a> for a LOT about format strings.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Probably "roll_{}_oe_*_{}.XNGS", if I understand correctly.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Edited to add <code>id</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks Jan, how would I include the date element into the filename?</span>
