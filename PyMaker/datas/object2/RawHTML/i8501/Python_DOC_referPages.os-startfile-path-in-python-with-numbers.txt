<p>I am working on a little project in python for work.
It involves opening a file with the <code>os.startfile()</code></p>
<p>And there in lies my problem :</p>
<p>the path to the file contains several numbers. And for some reason I don't understand this cause problems in locating the file.</p>
<p>Is there a work around for this? </p>
<p>Because I can't change the names of the directory or the file.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The problem is that the <code>\</code> character has a special meaning in python, e.g. <code>\n</code> is a newline etc.</p>
<p>You can either do:</p>
<pre><code>os.startfile(r"G:\EEGdatabase\6541455.docx")
</code></pre>
<p>Or:</p>
<pre><code>os.startfile("G:\\EEGdatabase\\6541455.docx")
</code></pre>
<p>To solve the problem.</p>
