<p>In Python.  r^[\w*]$</p>
<p>whats that mean?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><strong>Quick answer:</strong> Match a string consisting of a single character, where that character is alphanumeric (letters, numbers) an underscore (<code>_</code>) or an asterisk (<code>*</code>).</p>
<p><strong>Details:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The "<code>\w</code>" means "any word character" which usually means alphanumeric (letters, numbers, regardless of case) plus underscore (_)</li>
<li>The "<code>^</code>" "anchors" to the beginning of a string, and the "<code>$</code>" "anchors" To the end of a string, which means that, in this case, the match must start at the beginning of a string and end at the end of the string.</li>
<li>The <code>[]</code> means a character class, which means "match any character contained in the character class".</li>
</ul>
<p>It is also worth mentioning that normal quoting and escaping rules for strings make it very difficult to enter regular expressions (all the backslashes would need to be escaped with additional backslashes), so in Python there is a special notation which has its own special quoting rules that allow for all of the backslashes to be interpreted properly, and that is what the "<code>r</code>" at the beginning is for.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Normally an asterisk (<code>*</code>) means "0 or more of the previous thing" but in the example above, it does <em>not</em> have that meaning, since the asterisk is <em>inside</em> of the character class, so it loses its "special-ness".</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>As exhuma said, \w is any word-class character (alphanumeric as Jonathan clarifies).</p>
<p>However because it is in square brackets it will match:</p>
<ol>
<li>a single alphanumeric character OR</li>
<li>an asterisk (*)</li>
</ol>
<p>So the whole regular expression matches:</p>
<ul>
<li>the beginning of a
line (^)</li>
<li>followed by either a
single alphanumeric character or an
asterisk</li>
<li>followed by the end of a
line ($)</li>
</ul>
<p>so the following would match:</p>
<pre><code>blah
z  &lt;- matches this line
blah
</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code>blah
* &lt;- matches this line
blah
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>From the beginning of this line, <a href="http://rubular.com" rel="nofollow noreferrer">"Any number of word characters (letter, number, underscore)"</a> until the end of the line.</p>
<p>I am unsure as to why it's in square brackets, as circle brackets (e.g. "(" and ")") are correct if you want the matched text returned.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>\w refers to 0 or more alphanumeric characters and the underscore. the * in your case is also inside the character class, so [\w*] would match all of [a-zA-Z0-9_*] (the * is interpreted literally)</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>As said above \w means any word. so you could use this in the context of below</p>
<pre><code>view.aspx?url=[\w]
</code></pre>
<p>which means you can have any word as the value of the "url=" parameter</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>\w is equivalent to [a-zA-Z0-9_] I don't understand the * after it or the [] around it, because \w already is a class and * in class definitions makes no sense. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">Do you mean <code>r"^\w*$"</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Following up on Laurence's comments, this does not really have any special meaning without the quotes.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hey @S.Lott: How do you know this is homework?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is necroposting but for the sake of future readers, \w is the python equivalent of the class: [^a-zA-Z0-9_]. As you can see here , at least for Python 2.7.x to 3.4.y, <code>*</code> does not enter into that. If it did the regex class [\w*] would introduce a useless repetition of * as a literal caracter (i.e. w/ no special meaning because it is included inside the square brackets denoting a class.).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">In Python 3, the definition of <code>\w</code> takes into account Unicode character definitions by default, so it's much wider than just <code>[^a-zA-Z0-9_]</code>; see <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#module-re" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#module-re</a> for the gory details.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The quick answer is <b>highly misleading</b>. <code>re.match(r'\w', '*') == None</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MateenUlhaq I don't know what you are trying to say, but I believe you are mistaken. OP was asking about <code>\w</code> and <code>*</code> inside of a bracket expression (<code>[]</code>). Your code sample has zero relevance to the question at-hand. <code>re.match(r'^[\w*]$', '*')</code> does in fact return a match. And thank you for the downvote.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Let me rephrase:  when searching up <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=python+%5Cw" rel="nofollow noreferrer">"python <code>\w</code>"</a>, this is the first SO result. The title doesn't really give any implication that it's <code>[\w*]</code> rather than <code>\w</code>. Thus, it's really easy to get the impression that <code>\w == [a-zA-Z_*]</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Not in the above regular expression. Since the <code>*</code> is within the character class, it becomes a member of the class.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">\w only matches a single character, not an entire word. You would need a quantifier like +, * or {n,m} to actually match an entire word (i.e. more than a single character)</span>
