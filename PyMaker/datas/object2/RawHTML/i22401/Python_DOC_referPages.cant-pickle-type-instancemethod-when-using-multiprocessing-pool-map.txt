<p>I'm trying to use <code>multiprocessing</code>'s <code>Pool.map()</code> function to divide out work simultaneously. When I use the following code, it works fine:</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The problem is that multiprocessing must pickle things to sling them among processes, and bound methods are not picklable.  The workaround (whether you consider it "easy" or not;-) is to add the infrastructure to your program to allow such methods to be pickled, registering it with the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/copyreg.html?highlight=copyreg" rel="noreferrer">copy_reg</a> standard library method.</p>
<p>For example, Steven Bethard's contribution to <a href="http://bytes.com/topic/python/answers/552476-why-cant-you-pickle-instancemethods" rel="noreferrer">this thread</a> (towards the end of the thread) shows one perfectly workable approach to allow method pickling/unpickling via <code>copy_reg</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>All of these solutions are ugly because multiprocessing and pickling is broken and limited unless you jump outside the standard library.</p>
<p>If you use a fork of <code>multiprocessing</code> called <code>pathos.multiprocesssing</code>, you can directly use classes and class methods in multiprocessing's <code>map</code> functions.  This is because <code>dill</code> is used instead of <code>pickle</code> or <code>cPickle</code>, and <code>dill</code> can serialize almost anything in python.</p>
<p><code>pathos.multiprocessing</code> also provides an asynchronous map function… and it can <code>map</code> functions with multiple arguments (e.g. <code>map(math.pow, [1,2,3], [4,5,6])</code>)</p>

<p>You could also define a <code>__call__()</code> method inside your <code>someClass()</code>, which calls <code>someClass.go()</code> and then pass an instance of <code>someClass()</code> to the pool. This object is pickleable and it works fine (for me)...</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Some limitations though to Steven Bethard's solution :</p>
<p>When you register your class method as a function, the destructor of your class is surprisingly called every time your method processing is finished. So if you have 1 instance of your class that calls n times its method, members may disappear between 2 runs and you may get a message <code>malloc: *** error for object 0x...: pointer being freed was not allocated</code> (e.g. open member file) or <code>pure virtual method called,
terminate called without an active exception</code> (which means than the lifetime of a member object I used was shorter than what I thought). I got this when dealing with n greater than the pool size. Here is a short example :</p>
<pre><code>from multiprocessing import Pool, cpu_count
from multiprocessing.pool import ApplyResult

# --------- see Stenven's solution above -------------
from copy_reg import pickle
from types import MethodType

def _pickle_method(method):
    func_name = method.im_func.__name__
    obj = method.im_self
    cls = method.im_class
    return _unpickle_method, (func_name, obj, cls)

def _unpickle_method(func_name, obj, cls):
    for cls in cls.mro():
        try:
            func = cls.__dict__[func_name]
        except KeyError:
            pass
        else:
            break
    return func.__get__(obj, cls)


class Myclass(object):

    def __init__(self, nobj, workers=cpu_count()):

        print "Constructor ..."
        # multi-processing
        pool = Pool(processes=workers)
        async_results = [ pool.apply_async(self.process_obj, (i,)) for i in range(nobj) ]
        pool.close()
        # waiting for all results
        map(ApplyResult.wait, async_results)
        lst_results=[r.get() for r in async_results]
        print lst_results

    def __del__(self):
        print "... Destructor"

    def process_obj(self, index):
        print "object %d" % index
        return "results"

pickle(MethodType, _pickle_method, _unpickle_method)
Myclass(nobj=8, workers=3)
# problem !!! the destructor is called nobj times (instead of once)
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>Constructor ...
object 0
object 1
object 2

object 3
... Destructor
object 4
... Destructor

... Destructor

... Destructor
object 7
... Destructor
... Destructor
... Destructor
['results', 'results', 'results', 'results', 'results', 'results', 'results', 'results']
... Destructor
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>__call__</code> method is not so equivalent, because [None,...] are read from the results :</p>
<pre><code>from multiprocessing import Pool, cpu_count
from multiprocessing.pool import ApplyResult

class Myclass(object):

    def __init__(self, nobj, workers=cpu_count()):

        print "Constructor ..."
        # multiprocessing
        pool = Pool(processes=workers)
        async_results = [ pool.apply_async(self, (i,)) for i in range(nobj) ]
        pool.close()
        # waiting for all results
        map(ApplyResult.wait, async_results)
        lst_results=[r.get() for r in async_results]
        print lst_results

    def __call__(self, i):
        self.process_obj(i)

    def __del__(self):

        return "result"

Myclass(nobj=8, workers=3)
# problem !!! the destructor is called nobj times (instead of once), 
# **and** results are empty !
</code></pre>
<p>So none of both methods is satisfying...</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>There's another short-cut you can use, although it can be inefficient depending on what's in your class instances.</p>
<p>As everyone has said the problem is that the <code>multiprocessing</code> code has to pickle the things that it sends to the sub-processes it has started, and the pickler doesn't do instance-methods.</p>
<p>However, instead of sending the instance-method, you can send the actual class instance, plus the name of the function to call, to an ordinary function that then uses <code>getattr</code> to call the instance-method, thus creating the bound method in the <code>Pool</code> subprocess.  This is similar to defining a <code>__call__</code> method except that you can call more than one member function.</p>
<p>Stealing @EricH.'s code from his answer and annotating it a bit (I retyped it hence all the name changes and such, for some reason this seemed easier than cut-and-paste :-) ) for illustration of all the magic:</p>
<pre><code>import multiprocessing
import os

def call_it(instance, name, args=(), kwargs=None):
    "indirect caller for instance methods and multiprocessing"
    if kwargs is None:
        kwargs = {}
    return getattr(instance, name)(*args, **kwargs)

class Klass(object):
    def __init__(self, nobj, workers=multiprocessing.cpu_count()):
        print "Constructor (in pid=%d)..." % os.getpid()
        self.count = 1
        pool = multiprocessing.Pool(processes = workers)
        async_results = [pool.apply_async(call_it,
            args = (self, 'process_obj', (i,))) for i in range(nobj)]
        pool.close()
        map(multiprocessing.pool.ApplyResult.wait, async_results)
        lst_results = [r.get() for r in async_results]
        print lst_results

    def __del__(self):
        self.count -= 1
        print "... Destructor (in pid=%d) count=%d" % (os.getpid(), self.count)

    def process_obj(self, index):
        print "object %d" % index
        return "results"

Klass(nobj=8, workers=3)
</code></pre>
<p>The output shows that, indeed, the constructor is called once (in the original pid) and the destructor is called 9 times (once for each copy made = 2 or 3 times per pool-worker-process as needed, plus once in the original process).  This is often OK, as in this case, since the default pickler makes a copy of the entire instance and (semi-) secretly re-populates it—in this case, doing:</p>
<pre><code>obj = object.__new__(Klass)
obj.__dict__.update({'count':1})
</code></pre>
<p>—that's why even though the destructor is called eight times in the three worker processes, it counts down from 1 to 0 each time—but of course you can still get into trouble this way.  If necessary, you can provide your own <code>__setstate__</code>:</p>
<pre><code>    def __setstate__(self, adict):
        self.count = adict['count']
</code></pre>
<p>in this case for instance.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You could also define a <code>__call__()</code> method inside your <code>someClass()</code>, which calls <code>someClass.go()</code> and then pass an instance of <code>someClass()</code> to the pool. This object is pickleable and it works fine (for me)...</p>
