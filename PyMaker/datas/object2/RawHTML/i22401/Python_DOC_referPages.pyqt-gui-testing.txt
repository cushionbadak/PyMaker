<p>Does anyone know of a automated GUI testing package for that works with PyQT besides Squish?  Nothing against Squish I am just looking for other packages.  It would be cool if there were an open source package.  I am doing my testing under Linux.</p>

<p>It looks like PyQT4 includes a QtTest object that can be used for unit testing.</p>

<p>You should be able to use pyunit in conjunction with PyQT. </p>

<p>You can use <strong><a href="https://pytest.org" rel="nofollow noreferrer">py.test</a> with the <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytest-qt" rel="nofollow noreferrer">pytest-qt</a> plugin</strong>. There's a simple example of how it can be used <a href="https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-qt/#pytest-qt" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a></p>
<p>Another alternative is to use <strong>the built-in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">unittest</a> module together with <a href="http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtest-overview.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">QtTest</a></strong> (parts of QtTest has been built into PyQt). A longer example is given in <a href="http://johnnado.com/pyqt-qtest-example/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><strong>this article</strong></a></p>
<p>All of this is free and open source :)</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Y'know, I have a whole book on "Scripted GUI Testing with Ruby" (<a href="http://pragprog.com/titles/idgtr/scripted-gui-testing-with-ruby" rel="nofollow noreferrer">pragprog.com/titles/idgtr/scripted-gui-testing-with-ruby</a>) that I got from a Ruby User Group meeting, but I've never read it so find out what kind of tools they use.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What are you trying to accomplish with this testing?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm very curious to know the final solution you used~</span>
<span class="comment-copy">We bought Squish.  It works well and they are responsive but I love the open source python testing community and wanted to go there first.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The Python wiki has some info on this: <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/PyQt/GUI_Testing" rel="nofollow noreferrer">wiki.python.org/moin/PyQt/GUI_Testing</a> Hope this helps someone!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, WATSUP looks interesting for Windows GUI testing.  Unfortunately I need Linux PyQT GUI testing.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Kindly update the broken link</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Last news from 2007?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">While pyunit (called unittest in stdlib) is good for normal unit testing it doesn't handle GUI testing.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@PaulHildebrandt At the time of writing Python unittest works with PyQt, please see <a href="http://johnnado.com/pyqt-qtest-example/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this article</a>. Kind Regards, Tord</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Comparing these two alternatives the first combination gives you more features and a nicer API, while the second has the advantage of not adding more dependencies</span>
