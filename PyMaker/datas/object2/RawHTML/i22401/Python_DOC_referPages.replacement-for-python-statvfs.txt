<p>The <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/statvfs.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">python statvfs module</a> was marked as deprecated since python 2.6 and it's now removed since python 3.0. I haven't been able to figure out what apps are supposed to use if they want to get information about a disk, specifically how to check the capacity and free space of a given path. Anybody have any idea? This is on os x, if that makes a difference, although being cross platform would be a plus.</p>

<p>It appears that only the module that contains the constants for sequential access is being deprecated. </p>
<p>Doing</p>
<pre><code>x = os.statvfs('/')
x.f_favail 
</code></pre>
<p>will still work.</p>
<p>Sidenote: according to the docs, this function is only available on unix based platforms. So OSX and linux variants are fine, as is freeBSD and others, but windows won't be.</p>

<p>I had the same question, it's <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html?highlight=fstatvfs#os.fstatvfs" rel="nofollow">os.fstatvfs(fd)</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>As of Python 3.3, this is equivalent to os.statvfs(fd). Availability:
  Unix.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">It seems Android also doesn't support os.statvfs()</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>os.statvfs</code> was <b>removed in python3</b>. It was deprecated since python 2.6, see <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/statvfs.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">python statvfs doc</a>.</span>
