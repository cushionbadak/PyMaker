<p>It's prompting to save the login details, despite <code>~/.pypirc</code> already containing this. It then fails to upload files for a package I own, and have full write-access to.</p>

<p>Just found <a href="http://www.davidcramer.net/code/python/443/problems-uploading-packages-with-setuptools-on-os-x.html" rel="noreferrer">this page</a>, which solves the issue:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I also noticed that while it was asking me to save my login information, and I hit Y everytime, it still asked me for the username and password. It turned out that it was saving the information incorrectly as follows:</p>
<pre><code>[pypi]
username:dcramer
password:*******
</code></pre>
<p>Changing it out to this solved the problems:</p>
<pre><code>[server-login]
username:dcramer
password:********

<p>The above content goes into the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/distutils/packageindex.html#pypirc" rel="noreferrer"><code>.pypirc</code> file</a> in the user's home directory.</p>

<p>None of the changes to ~/.pypirc listed here worked for me.</p>
<p>This worked for me, with no changes to ~/.pypirc.  I added "-r <a href="https://www.python.org/pypi" rel="noreferrer">https://www.python.org/pypi</a>" to the command line:</p>
<pre><code>python setup.py register sdist upload -r https://www.python.org/pypi

<p>My ~/.pypirc looks like this</p>

<p>I have the same problem， This is my solution.</p>
<p>The python version is 2.7.7, my windows version is Windows-7-6.1.7601-SP1.</p>
<p>here is my .pypirc file</p>
<pre><code>[distutils]
index-servers=pypi

[pypi]
repository = https://pypi.python.org/pypi

[server-login]
username = user
password = password
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Notice:</strong></p>
<p>In windows, A file is not allowed named as “.pypirc”，plz，refer to：</p>
<p><a href="https://serverfault.com/questions/22626/rename-files-to-empty-filename-in-windows-vista">Rename files to empty filename in Windows</a> </p>
<p>Then put you ".pypirc" file in the same folder with "setup.py"</p>
<p>At last:</p>
<p>run : </p>
<pre><code>python setup.py sdist upload
</code></pre>
<p>or:</p>
<pre><code>python setup.py sdist register upload

<p>I hope this will be help,thank you!</p>

<p>I have this problem and solved it by putting the file .pypirc under my home directory (~/), as the last past of the first comment suggests. </p>
<p>I didn't have the need to modify the name of the section "pypi" of the file pypirc for "server-login", as suggested also in the first comment.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I changed <code>[distutils]</code> to <code>[pypirc]</code> as per the <a href="https://pythonhosted.org/an_example_pypi_project/setuptools.html#intermezzo-pypirc-file-and-gpg" rel="nofollow">docs</a> and this worked for me.</p>
<p>Here is my <code>~/.pypirc</code> file:</p>
<pre><code>[pypirc]
index-servers =
    pypi
    pypitest

[pypi]
repository=https://pypi.python.org/pypi

[pypitest]

<p>I had this problem, due to my own fault but hopefully this may help someone else who makes this same mistake.</p>
<p>I'm using python 3 on Linux Ubuntu, during registration I issued the setup command using sudo! The result was the .pypirc file in my home directory was owned by root and wasn't readable when trying to perform a module upload immediately after as a none privileged user.</p>
<p>By changing the ownership of the file to myself, the issue was resolved.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I ran into the same problem. I'm on a new OS X Sierra. Adding [server-login] entry to ~/.pypirc seemed to fix it </p>

<span class="comment-copy">Same bug is in setuptools for 2.7. Try to use Python 2.6.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">distribute doesn't help, I encounter same problem with distribute with Python2.7</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Where is that file in which it saves this info? (on Windows?)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The file is .pypirc, I found it in the root of my Users folder on Windows (which corresponded to <code>os.path.expanduser("~")</code>) but adding the info there didn't fix anything. Removing the [pypi] section caused an error in ConfigParser. Fixed it per <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3773613/pypi-issues-upload-failed-401-you-must-be-identified-to-edit-package-inform">this question</a>: you need a HOME environment variable on Windows that points to the file's folder.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The file this is in (for me) was <code>~/.pypirc</code>. Might be helpful to note.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Are you saying I need to store my password in plain text in a file?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I can't understand why, but it seems your example operated as suggests. Thank you</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It works even without having a password stored in <code>.pypirc</code>. You will be asked instead.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">worked for me. thnx!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is already mentioned in several more complete answers. Also, you answer is borderline link-only.</span>
