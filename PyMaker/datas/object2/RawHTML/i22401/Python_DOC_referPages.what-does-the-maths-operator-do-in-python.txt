<p>What does this mean in Python:</p>
<pre><code>sock.recvfrom(2**16)

<p>I know what sock is, and I get the gist of the <code>recvfrom</code> function, but what the heck is <code>2**16</code>? Specifically, the two asterisk/double asterisk operator?</p>

<p>It is the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#the-power-operator" rel="noreferrer">power operator</a>.</p>
<p>From the Python 3 docs: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The power operator has the same semantics as the built-in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/functions.html#pow" rel="noreferrer">pow()</a> function, when called with two arguments: it yields its left argument raised to the power of its right argument. The numeric arguments are first converted to a common type, and the result is of that type.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is equivalent to 2<sup>16</sup> = 65536, or <code>pow(2, 16)</code></p>

<span class="comment-copy">I suggest that you install Python, run the interactive interpreter, type in 2 ** 16, and see what the result is.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is a goofy way to do this, I'd rather see sock.recvfrom(1 &lt;&lt; 16), you don't need to do a power operation for this</span>
<span class="comment-copy">S.Lott, you're kinda a prick sometimes but a funny prick so it's o :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@S.Lott, Why so serious?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is likely to become the main result on google for this question, @S. Lott</span>
<span class="comment-copy">In Python (the scope of the OP's) question, 2 ** 16 evaluates to 65536, while 2 ^ 16 evaluates to 18. You appear to attach a strange meaning to "is equivalent to".</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@John: That is why he didn't actually post "2 ^ 16" -_-</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Pynt: You are gravely mistaken, @rossoft did actually post "2 ^ 16"; subsequent to my comment, @kaiser.se edited the answer to read what you see now, effectively 2&lt;superscript&gt;16&lt;/superscript&gt;. You can verify this by clicking on the clickable part of "edited N hours ago".</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yeah, I figured that was the case...after I had already posted my comment:P</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Exactly, thanks kaiser.se for the edit</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is true most of the time. pow will not raise a negative number to a negative fractional power, but ** will. try pow(-2,-1.668) and -2**-1.668</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>**</code> won't. Try <code>(-2)**-1.668</code>. <code>**</code> has higher precedence than <code>-</code></span>
