<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>def print_scores(name1, score1, name2, score2):
     print("\n--- SCORES\t"+ name1 + ":",score1,"\t" + name2 + ":",score2, "---")


print_scores("Ziggy",18,"Elmer",23)
</code></pre>
<p>I am trying to remove the space between score1 and "\t". It does not change the output. But the program checking the work requires that there is no space between them in the code.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Try using <code>format</code>, like this:</p>
<pre><code>print('\n--- SCORES\t{}:{}\t{}:{}---'.format(name1, score1, name2, score2))
</code></pre>
<p>Now for <code>print_scores("Ziggy",18,"Elmer",23)</code>, it prints this:</p>
<p><code>--- SCORES    Ziggy:18    Elmer:23---</code></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This is a problem with the print builtin function.
By default it sets a keyword <code>sep = ' '</code>
This can be overridden by the use of:</p>
<pre><code>print(..., sep='')
</code></pre>
<p>Hope that helps.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Since this is Python 3.7, this would work and will be the easiest way to format:</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>def print_scores(name1, score1, name2, score2):
     print(f"\n--- SCORES\t{name1}:{score1}\t{name2}:{score2}---")


print_scores("Ziggy", 18, "Elmer", 23)
</code></pre>
</div>
