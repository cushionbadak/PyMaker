<p>I recently tried to write errors to a file which I managed to do after some research. The problem now is I'm trying to write calculation results to a file, but I can't seem to get the two functions I use to work together. Can someone take a look at my code and help me?</p>
<p>(as of now have I commented out my function attempt to write the result I get from calculator() to a separate file called "result.txt") </p>
<pre><code>import sys
import logging

WRITE = "w"
APPEND = "a"
READWRITE = "r+"
fileName = "error.txt"
fileName2 = "result.txt"
logging.basicConfig(filename=fileName, level=logging.ERROR)

def main():
    checkError()
    return

def calculator():
    firstNumber = int(input("Pleas enter a number: "))
    secondNumber = int(input("Pleas enter a number: "))
    result = firstNumber / secondNumber
    print(result)
    return

def checkError():
    try:
        calculator()
    except:
        error = sys.exc_info()[0]
        logging.error(msg=error)
        print("Error logged to:",fileName )
        return

# def writeResult():
#     myFile = open(fileName2, mode= WRITE)
#     myFile.write()
#     myFile.close()
#     return

main()
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You never call the writeResult() function. You should add a parameter to writeResult() like this:</p>
<pre><code>def writeResult(string):
    myFile = open(fileName2, mode= WRITE)
    myFile.write(string)
    myFile.close()
    return
</code></pre>
<p>where str is the value that will be written to the file. Then you have to call it. I would call it in checkError() because that's where you call calculator(). To get the value that is calculated by calculator, you will need it to return it. To do that, all you have to do is add the result variable to the return statement, so the function will look like this:</p>
<pre><code>def calculator():
    firstNumber = int(input("Pleas enter a number: "))
    secondNumber = int(input("Pleas enter a number: "))
    result = firstNumber / secondNumber
    print(result)
    return result
</code></pre>
<p>Then you should call it in checkError() and pass it to writeResult() as a parameter:</p>
<pre><code>def checkError():
    try:
        writeResult(calculator())
    except:
        error = sys.exc_info()[0]
        logging.error(msg=error)
        print("Error logged to:",fileName )
        return
</code></pre>
<p>So basically the value that you get from calculator() is getting passed as a parameter to writeResult. </p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Your <code>writeResult()</code> function is the biggest problem here. The <code>write()</code> function in Python takes a string parameter, which is what it actually outputs to the file (see <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the Python tutorial</a> for an example). So, you need to put the result in that function call. In order to do that, you will have to add a parameter to your function. So it becomes:</p>
<pre><code>def writeResult(result):
    myFile = open(fileName2, mode= WRITE)
    myFile.write(str(result))
    myFile.close()
</code></pre>
<p>I used <code>str(result)</code> there because <code>result</code> will be a number type, so you need to explicitly convert it to a string. Otherwise, Python will throw an error.</p>
<p>Also note that I removed the last line <code>return</code>. In Python, you don't need to explicitly put return statements when nothing gets returned.</p>
<p>Now you have to change <code>calculator()</code> to pass the result to this function. One option is returning the result and then calling <code>writeResult</code> in your <code>main()</code> function. Another is to just call <code>writeResult</code> in the calculator function, by changing the last line to <code>writeResult(result)</code> (again, no need for the empty return statement).</p>

<span class="comment-copy">where did you call writeResults()? what were you trying to write?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You're not actually writing anything to <code>fileName2</code> in <code>writeResults</code>.. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the python tutorial</a> may be useful to you. Search for <code>f.write(string)</code> to find the relevant section.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I haven't called writeResult() yet here.  But I want to get the result from calculator() and write that to a separate file.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hey Matthew, i tried  what you said, but now it logges an error every time I run the program and still nothing is writing the file I want :/</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This won't work because <code>calculator()</code> does not return anything. It's also a bad idea to name a variable <code>str</code>, since that's the name of a Python built-in.</span>
