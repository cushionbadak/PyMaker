<p>I am using a package that has operations inside the class (? not sure what either is really), and normally the data is called this way <code>data[package.operation]</code>. Since I have to do multiple operations thought of shortening it and do the following</p>
<pre><code>list =["o1", "o2", "o3", "o4", "o5", "o6"]
for i in list:
     print data[package.i]
</code></pre>
<p>but since it's considering <code>i</code> as a string it doesnt do the operation, and if I take away the string then it is an undefined variable. Is there a way to go around this? Or will I just have to write it the long way?. </p>
<p>In particular I am using <code>pymatgen</code>, its package <code>Orbital</code> and with the <code>.operation</code> I want to call specific suborbitals. A real example of how it  would be used is <code>data[0][Orbital.s]</code>, the first [0] denotes the element in question for which to get the orbitals <code>s</code> (that's why I omitted it in the code above).</p>

<p>You can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#getattr" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>getattr</code></a> in order to dynamically select attributes from objects (the <code>Orbital</code> package in your case; for example <code>getattr(Orbital, 's')</code>).</p>
<p>So your loop would be rewritten to:</p>
<pre><code>for op in ['o1', 'o2', 'o3', 'o4', 'o5', 'o6']:
    print(data[getattr(package, op)])
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">store the operations as the object not as a string. then i will be the object instead of a string.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Use <code>getattr(package, i)</code>. With <code>getattr</code> you can retrieve attributes of objects via their names as strings.</span>
