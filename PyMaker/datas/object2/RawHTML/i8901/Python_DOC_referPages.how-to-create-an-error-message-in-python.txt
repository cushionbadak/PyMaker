<p>I want to create an error message in Python, i.e. the program should be interrupted and an (if possible coloured) error message should be printed. For instance:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If a == 0:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Error("a should be nonzero")</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>In Matlab, you can do this using the <code>error</code> instruction. How can you do this in Python? I have found <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/HandlingExceptions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this page</a> but I am not sure that is what I am looking for.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can <code>raise</code> it like so:</p>
<pre><code>if a == 0:
    raise ValueError("a should be nonzero")
</code></pre>
<p>or simply by using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-assert-statement" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>assert</code></a> as:</p>
<pre><code>assert a!=0, "a should be nonzero!"
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">This solved my question. I knew that it was a very basic one. I had not found the duplicate question myself. Can I delete my question?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You might as well leave your question - it can act as a portal to the linked question.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@PM2Ring Yes but I will continue to lose reputation as people downvote.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">On the other hand, you cannot close too many questions...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Not my downvote, but don't think <code>assert</code> should be used on user input, vaguely relevant <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/945135/6260170">stackoverflow.com/a/945135/6260170</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yeah, asserts are for catching broken program logic, not bad data. If the user sees an AssertionError they are entitled to tell you to fix the program.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">OTOH, <code>a</code> may not be user data but the result of an internal calculation that cannot possibly result in zero if the program logic is correct. And in that situation <code>assert</code> is definitely appropriate.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@PM2Ring Yes, I agree, when I made the comment, <code>a</code> was user input: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/posts/42489906/revisions">stackoverflow.com/posts/42489906/revisions</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Chris Indeed. But we don't know what it is in the OP's code.</span>
