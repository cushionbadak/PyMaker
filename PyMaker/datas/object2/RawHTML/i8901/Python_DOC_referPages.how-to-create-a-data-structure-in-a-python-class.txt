        def __init__(self,id,name,singer):

<p>I have a file 'CDs.txt' which has a list of tuples look like this:</p>
<pre><code>[
("Shape of you", "Ed Sheeran"),
("Shape of you", "Ed Sheeran"),
("I don't wanna live forever", "Zayn/Taylor Swift"),
("Fake Love", "Drake"),
("Starboy", "The Weeknd"),

......
]
</code></pre>
<p>Now in my collection class, I want to create a CD object for each tuple in my list and save them in a data structure. I want each tuple to have a unique id number, it doesn't matter they are the same, they need to have different id....can anyone help me with this? </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use simple loop with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#enumerate" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>enumerate</code></a> for this.</p>
<pre><code># I don't know what you mean by 'file has list of tuples',
# so I assume you loaded it somehow
tuples = [("Shape of you", "Ed Sheeran"), ("Shape of you", "Ed Sheeran"),
          ("I don't wanna live forever", "Zayn/Taylor Swift"),
          ("Fake Love", "Drake"), ("Starboy", "The Weeknd")]

cds = []
for i, (title, author) in enumerate(tuples):
    cds.append(CD(i, title, author))
</code></pre>
<p>Now you have all CDs in a nice, clean list</p>
<p>If your file is just the list in form <code>[('title', 'author')]</code>, then you can load it simply by evaluating its contents:</p>
<pre><code>tuples = eval(open('CDs.txt').read())
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">do you mean cds.append(CD(i ,title ,author)) ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@joe Yes, I corrected code</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It gives me a UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xc3 in position 4903: ordinal not in range(128) What does this mean?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@joe Maybe try <code>open('CDs.txt', encoding='utf-8')</code> instead?</span>
