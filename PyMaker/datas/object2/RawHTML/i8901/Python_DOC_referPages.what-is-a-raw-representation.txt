<p>I'm reading "Learn Python the hard way" (by Zed Shaw) and it says that <code>%r</code> is used for "raw representation and debugging".</p>
<p>I'm sorry for such a uninformed question, but I have no idea what does it mean. </p>

<p>So you know <code>%s</code> is used for most strings, that just calls <code>str()</code> over the variable that is formatted. </p>
<p><code>repr()</code>, on the other hand is used for <code>%r</code> and will return the "raw string", which is easiest seen on string variables. </p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print("%r vs. %s" % ('42','42'))
'42' vs. 42
</code></pre>

<p><code>'r'</code> - String (converts any Python object using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#repr" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>repr()</code></a>).<br/>
<code>'s'</code> - String (converts any Python object using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=str#str" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>str()</code></a>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When it says it is useful for "debugging", imagine you had leading/trailing spaces in a string... the "raw" format would be more clear.</p>
<pre><code>print("%r vs. %s" % ('  hello','  hello'))
'  hello' vs.   hello
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">It's the representation returned form the <code>repr</code> function. It's similar to <code>str</code> but intended for internal use rather than display. It can be useful to print an element regardless of its type. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1436703/difference-between-str-and-repr-in-python">related</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@PaulRooney You can answer below</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@cricket I'm expecting it to be shut down as a dupe at any moment, so didnt think an answer was appropriate</span>
