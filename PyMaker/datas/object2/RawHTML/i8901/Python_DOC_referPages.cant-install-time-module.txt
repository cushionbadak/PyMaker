<p>I've tried <code>pip install time</code> and <code>sudo -H pip install time</code>, but I keep getting the error: </p>

<p>Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement time (from

<p>I'm working in PyCharm, but what really doesn't make sense is that I can import time in the Python Console but not in my actual code.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html" rel="noreferrer"><code>time</code> module</a> is part of Python's standard library.  It's installed along with the rest of Python, and you don't need to (nor can you!) install it with <code>pip</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I can import time in the Python Console</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, because it's already installed.</p>

<p>but not in my actual code</p>

<p>I don't believe you.  Show us the exact error message you get when you try.</p>

<p>I think this is a PyCharm bug. I am using the time module with PyCharm and it complains that 'time' is an unresolved reference, even when I use</p>
<pre><code>import time
</code></pre>
<p>at the beginning of my file. However, there is no run-time error when I execute my program, even though PyCharm does not recognise <code>time</code> as a valid module.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Try using <code>time.sleep(secs)</code> that should work fine.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have also got the error, while referring the time on the 'requirements.txt' and pushing app to cloud foundry.</p>
<p>So the errors is expected. So, its possible on other scenarios also.
I just removed the time from the 'requirements.txt' before push my app to make it work.!</p>

<span class="comment-copy">time is a builtin module</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Did you happen to name a file <code>time.py</code> (or a folder containing Python modules <code>time</code>)? If it's in your working directory, it will shadow the built-in <code>time</code> module.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Happening to me, too: <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/8axqrcafq924fi5/Screenshot%202018-01-15%2015.49.07.png?dl=0" rel="nofollow noreferrer">dropbox.com/s/8axqrcafq924fi5/â€¦</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">How does that answer the question?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Well, he is trying to use <code>time()</code> but getting an error and thinking that he might need to install the <i>time module</i>, for that reason I suggested <code>time.sleep()</code> instead (been there, done that)</span>
