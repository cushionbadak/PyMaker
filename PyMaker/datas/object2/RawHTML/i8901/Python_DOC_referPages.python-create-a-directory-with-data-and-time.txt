<p>By using subprocess module , how can we create a directory with today's date and time as directory name ?
I can follow one process , like assigning todays date to a variable in the the python and use that variable as reference to create a directory. </p>
<p>And I am using windows as my target machine.</p>
<p>but is there any other best ways I could follow ?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>If you think that you can rely upon your system's timezone setting, you may use built in <code>date</code> command (on Unix-like systems) in a way like this:</p>
<pre><code>os.system("mkdir `date +%Y-%m-%d_%H:%M:%S`")
</code></pre>
<p>Though, there are other solutions, like to use <code>os.mkdir()</code>.</p>

<p>Try it out.</p>
<p>The following will create a folder with the current date as its name. See the 'man date' to adjust the output to your liking.</p>
<pre><code>import subprocess
p = subprocess.Popen('mkdir "$(date)"', shell=True)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Why do you want to use subprocess, rather than <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.mkdir" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>os.mkdir()</code></a>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@DanielRoseman because creating date folder is not the end of my script. Thank you</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What? How does that have anything to do with anything?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@DanielRoseman because I read that we can use subprocess more efficiently than os module. You like to "os" , and I'd like to use "subprocess" , thats all.</span>
