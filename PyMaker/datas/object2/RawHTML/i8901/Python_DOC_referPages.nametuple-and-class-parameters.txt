<p>My lecturer wrote some code and I have no idea how to read it and google isn't helping, can someone please clarify how this code interacts.</p>
<pre><code>yield Arc(tail_node, head = tail_node - 1, label="1down", cost=1)
</code></pre>
<p>Is the method call for the class</p>
<pre><code>class Arc(namedtuple('Arc', 'tail, head, label, cost')):
</code></pre>
<p>The class Arc contains no methods, and no __init. I have no clue how these two are interacting since I thought class parameters accepted another class, and it made the current class a subclass or abstract etc. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.namedtuple" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>collections.namedtuple</code></a> function is a class factory. It takes some parameters and returns a class. The class inherits from <code>tuple</code>, but its values are also accessible by name as attributes (not only by index).</p>
<p>The <code>Arc</code> class you show uses <code>namedtuple</code> to create its base class. You could equivalently write it with separate statements, giving the base class it's own name:</p>
<pre><code>Base = namedtuple('Arc', 'tail, head, label, cost')   # this creates a class
class Arc(Base):    # this class inherits from the base class
    pass
</code></pre>
<p>If the <code>Arc</code> class doesn't have <em>any</em> methods of its own, there wouldn't be much point in defining it at all (you'd just use the name <code>Arc</code> instead of <code>Base</code> for the class returned from <code>namedtuple</code>). I'm guessing there is some more code in the <code>Arc</code> class, just not anything relevant to your question. The behavior inherited from the base class is enough to create instances using positional or keyword arguments, so the <code>yield</code> statement you show doesn't need any additional code.</p>
