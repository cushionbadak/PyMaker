<p>When I am creating a <code>list</code> using below statement </p>
<p><code>a = list('jane')</code></p>
<p>Am I calling Python's built-in <code>list</code> function or instantiating <code>list</code> class.</p>
<p>My understanding is we are instantiating <code>list</code> class by passing <code>'jane'</code> as argument.</p>
<p>However, the Python's documentation <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html</a> says <code>list()</code> is built-in function.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The docs explicitly say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>class list([iterable])</code></p>
<p>Rather than being a function, <code>list</code> is actually a mutable sequence type</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can easily check that:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; type(list)
type
</code></pre>
<p>if it was a function, <code>function</code> would be the output provided by using <code>type</code>.</p>
<p>You're instantiating a <code>list</code> object the same way you'd do if you created your own class and called it. <code>type</code>'s <code>__call__</code> is essentially getting invoked and sets up your instance so, though they aren't a function per se, they are callable.</p>
<hr/>
<p>The fact that they are listed in that specific section is probably for convenience, it might be confusing but reading the description of it is supposed to disambiguate this.</p>

<p>Your question is answered by the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-list" rel="nofollow noreferrer">very documentation page you mention</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>class list([iterable])</code><br/>
  Rather than being a function, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#list" rel="nofollow noreferrer">list</a> is actually a mutable sequence type, as documented in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesseq-list" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Lists</a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesseq" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Sequence Types — list, tuple, range</a>.</p>

<p>In Python, both classes and functions are callable, so in practice, you can treat them alike. </p>
