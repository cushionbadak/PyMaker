<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The columns in my table look like this:</p>
<p>Name1 | Name2 | Weight | Height | Number1 | Number2</p>
<p>Some of the Number1 and Number2 columns are Null, and I am only trying to update the Null rows only. To do this, I have 6 lists:</p>
<pre><code>List1 contains the values in Name1, in the same order
List2 contains the values in Name2, in the same order
List3 contains the values in Name1, but in a different order
List4 contains the values in Name2, but in the same order as List3
</code></pre>
<p>Lists 5 and 6 contains the values to be inserted in Number1 and Number2 respectively, and are in the same order as Lists 3 and 4.</p>
<p>So what I am trying to do is:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>search the table for all the rows with Null values in Number1 AND Number2;</p></li>
<li><p>search Lists 3 OR 4 for values to match Name1 OR Name2, so if a match is found in list 3, the values for Number1 and Number2 should still be filled in from lists 5 and 6, respectively.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>So the code I'm thinking of looks something like this:</p>
<pre><code>for i in Name1:
    c.execute("SELECT * FROM Mytable WHERE Number1 IS NULL")
    if Name1 is List3:
        c.execute("INSERT INTO Mytable (Number1, Number2)" " VALUES (?, ?)",
(List5[i], List6[i]))
    elif Name2 is List4:
        c.execute("INSERT INTO Mytable (Number1, Number2)" " VALUES (?, ?)",
(List5[i], List6[i]))
</code></pre>
<p>However, when I run it, it adds rows to the table, but no values for Number1 or Number2. Where am I going wrong?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<blockquote>
<p>Where am I going wrong?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Probably here:</p>
<pre><code>if Name1 is List3:
[...]
elif Name2 is List4:
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>is</code> keyword tests for <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#comparisons" rel="nofollow noreferrer">object identity</a>, which isn't what you want here. And even the test for equality won't help you here, as the order in both lists are different.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = ["a", "b", "c"]
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = a
&gt;&gt;&gt; a is b
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = ["a", "b", "c"]
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = ["a", "b", "c"]
&gt;&gt;&gt; a is b
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; a == b
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = ["b", "c", "a"]
&gt;&gt;&gt; a == b
False
</code></pre>
<p>The resulting behaviour is that none of your <code>if</code> branches is executed. To achieve your goal you need to test if both lists contain the same members:</p>
<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3847386/testing-if-a-list-contains-another-list-with-python">Testing if a list contains another list with Python</a></p>
<p>However, your question is unclear about the exact condition: Are Name1/List3 and Name2/List4 supposed to contain <strong>exactly</strong> the same members, or is it sufficient for one member to be contained in the other? You might be able to figure the solution out yourself; if not I suggest you open another question on this specific problem.</p>
