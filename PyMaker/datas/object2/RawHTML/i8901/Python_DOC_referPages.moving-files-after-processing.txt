<p>Hi Trying to move logs that are finished being processed but I think I'm using shutil wrong.</p>
<pre><code>import shutil

path = '/logs/'
finDir = '/complete/'

# parse loop
def getUniquePath(path):
    for filename in os.listdir(path):
       if..processing log 
       shutil.move(filename, finDir) #moves completed files
</code></pre>
<p>I keep getting errors that file does not exist. </p>
<p>So I added a print statement after the loop and it correctly prints out the filename and the destination so I'm thinking that I am just using shutil.move incorrectly.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>You need to combine <code>path</code> with <code>filename</code> unless you are in the <code>/logs/</code> directory.</p>
<p>Otherwise, file searching is done in the current directory; which cause file not found, or wrong file manipulation (if there was the file with the same name in the current directory)</p>
<p>Using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html#os.path.join" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>os.path.join</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>import os
import shutil

path = '/logs/'
finDir = '/complete/'

# parse loop
def getUniquePath(path):
    for filename in os.listdir(path):
       ..
       shutil.move(os.path.join(path, filename), finDir)
       #           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

<span class="comment-copy">try doing <code>os.chdir(path_to_file)</code> first.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ah nice this looks great. Will shutil.move account for say.. the file exists in the destination directory? Would it make sense for me to add a "Try:" condition on the move incase there is an error I'd like it to continue on. What would be the best way for that? @falsetru</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@chowpay, Yup using <code>try: .... except ...: ...</code> sounds ok.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">its so strange. So I added <code>try: shutil.move(os.path.join(path, filename), finDir) except : pass </code> and only 1 file got moved over. If I remove the try and except everything gets moved over @falsetru</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@chowpay, Please post a separated question with the updated code.</span>
