<p>I have a string in which I would like curly-brackets, but also take advantage of the f-strings feature. Is there some syntax that works for this?</p>
<p>Here are two ways it does not work. I would like to include the literal text "<code>{bar}</code>" as part of the string.</p>
<pre><code>foo = "test"
fstring = f"{foo} {bar}"
</code></pre>
<p>NameError: name 'bar' is not defined</p>
<pre><code>fstring = f"{foo} \{bar\}"
</code></pre>
<p>SyntaxError: f-string expression part cannot include a backslash</p>
<p>Desired result:</p>
<pre><code>'test {bar}'
</code></pre>
<p>Edit: Looks like this question has the same answer as <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5466451/how-can-i-print-literal-curly-brace-characters-in-python-string-and-also-use-fo">How can I print literal curly-brace characters in python string and also use .format on it?</a>, but you can only know that if you know that the format function uses the same rules as the f-string. So hopefully this question has value in tying f-string searchers to this answer.</p>

<p>Although there is a custom syntax error from the parser, the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/5466451/674039">same trick</a> works as for regular strings.  </p>
<p>Use double curlies:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; foo = 'test'
&gt;&gt;&gt; f'{foo} {{bar}}'
'test {bar}'
</code></pre>
<p>It's mentioned in the spec <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0498/#specification" rel="noreferrer">here</a> and the docs <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#formatted-string-literals" rel="noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
