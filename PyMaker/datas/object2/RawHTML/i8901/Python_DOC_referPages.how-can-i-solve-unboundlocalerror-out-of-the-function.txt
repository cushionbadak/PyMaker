<p>I got a popular error in python like <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/faq/programming.html#why-am-i-getting-an-unboundlocalerror-when-the-variable-has-a-value" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a></p>
<pre><code>x = 10
def foo():
    x += 1
    print(x)
foo()
</code></pre>
<p>If it runs, we got this error like the followings</p>
<pre><code>UnboundLocalError: local variable 'x' referenced before assignment
</code></pre>
<p>But in my case, the function is not the one I made but It's included in the library. In this case, how can I solve this problem without declaring the variable with global keyword in the function? I think it is not good idea to modify the function in the library. </p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Since you can not control the function, it would be better to rename your variable. May be name it something different? </p>
<p>And yes. </p>
<ul>
<li>Using global inside the function scope is bad. </li>
<li>Since you didn't create the library, you probably can't modify it <strong>easily</strong> (the next update would rewrite your changes).  </li>
<li>Even if you can modify it, using <code>global</code> would be bad</li>
</ul>

<span class="comment-copy">If that function is in a library, the library is broken.  There's no way such a function can work.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You should contact the maintainer of this library</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The variable is declared in the function so that I can't rename it neither.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The variable outside the function. You can rename that one, no?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@mansun No, I can't rename the variable and the problem is that it needs to be initialized before it is assigned. Replacing the variable name can not be a solution..</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You can not change the function, you can not rename the variable, you can't make it global - In that case I am out of solutions :(</span>
<span class="comment-copy">ok. I think I have to give up using the library. Because, the place where the function is called is also in the library so that I can't declare a global keyword, neither</span>
