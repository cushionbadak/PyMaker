<p>I have 3 lists, and if say the player chose <code>'x'</code> on certain parts of the list it will print out <code>'Congrats X won!'</code> ... but somehow it says invalid syntax:</p>
<pre><code>    elif list1 [0] , list2 [0] ,list3[0] == 'x':
                   ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

<p>If you want to test whether <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#any" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><strong>any</strong></a> of the list elements equal <code>'x'</code>:</p>
<pre><code>elif any(s[0] == 'x' for s in (list1, list2, list3)):

<span class="comment-copy">the correct syntax would be <code>elif list1[0] == 'x' or list2[0] == 'x' or list3[0] == 'x'</code>, more cleaner <code>elif 'x' in (list1[0], list2[0], list3[0])</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">instead of or should be and I think :) @dnit13</span>
<span class="comment-copy">so in list will not work correct :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I managed to make 2 players take turn playing but it stops after the 2nd player entered her answer. I want to do the While loop however I seriously ran out of idea how to. I get it in my mind like I want the two players to keep playing until 3 position of 0s or Xs are filled but putting it in code I really need help.</span>
