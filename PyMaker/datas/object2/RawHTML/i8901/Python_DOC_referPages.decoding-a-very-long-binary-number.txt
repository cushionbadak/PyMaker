<p>I have a very long binary number (200 digits 0's and 1's long) which I would like to decode. I do not know if this is in Binary 2, Binary 8, Binary 16 or any other (just a long list of 0 and 1)
How can this be decoded (hopefully into some meaningful text) </p>
<p>Is it through some program (say in Python)  or any tools that this could be achieved?</p>

<p>Wait I didn't think of what TigerhawkT3 mentioned.</p>
<p>Are you talking about UTF-8, UTF-16?</p>
<p>You might be able to use Python codecs module.</p>
<p>"codecs.getreader(encoding)</p>
<p>Look up the codec for the given encoding and return its StreamReader class or factory function.</p>
<p>Raises a LookupError in case the encoding cannot be found."
This <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/codecs.html#module-codecs" rel="nofollow noreferrer">link</a> might help.</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">If you don't know the correct encoding for bytes representing text, the best you can do is guess.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">btw, what is Binary 2, Binary 8, Binary 16?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">powers of Binary 2? =)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@WasiAhmad - I'm guessing UCS-2, UTF-8, UTF-16, etc.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Just to clarify, this is not a string of ones and zeros, right?  It's really just a collection of bits?  And this is supposed to represent what? Some sort of text?</span>
