<p>I'd like to be able to read binary data from stdin with python.</p>
<p>However, when I use <code>input = sys.stdin.buffer.read()</code>, I get the error that <code>AttributeError: 'file' object has no attribute 'buffer'</code>.  This seems strange because the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.stdin" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs</a> say that I should be able to use the underlying buffer object - how can I fix / work around this?</p>
<p>Notes:  I've checked out the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2850893/reading-binary-data-from-stdin">last time</a> this was asked, but the answers there are all either "use -u", "use buffer" (which I'm trying), or something about reading from files.  The first and last don't help because I have no control over the users of this program (so I can't tell them to use particular arguments) and because this is stdin - not files.</p>

<p>Just remove the buffer for python2:</p>
<pre><code>import sys

input = sys.stdin.read()
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">You are reading the documentation for Python 3, but using Python 2.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You can just use <code>sys.stdin.read()</code>. It's already a binary stream.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This solution was mentiond in the comments of the question you linked to: <code>sys.stdin = os.fdopen(sys.stdin.fileno(), 'rb', 0)</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@tavnab sure, but that is reading in text mode, which if that's the case, doesn't the OP really just want <code>raw_input</code>? Have I just not slept enough?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@juanpa.arrivillaga you're right, it's opened in text mode by default. The <code>-u</code> would still be needed to read it in unbuffered &amp; binary mode. If the OP's expecting to read unbuffered (i.e. no waiting for the newline) from the keyboard though (e.g. writing a game), they'll probably also need to enable "raw" mode on the tty</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you!  I thought I'd have to do something special for this and I am pleasantly surprised that that was not the case.</span>
