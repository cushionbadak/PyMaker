<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>int(x) for x in range(3)
</code></pre>
<p>I know this for loop is absurd,but bear with me.Here in this block of code what i think is happening is (Correct me if i am wrong)-X is assigned with the 0 value at first and will return,Okay this is fine.</p>
<pre><code>[1 for x in range(3) if a[x] &gt; b[x]]
</code></pre>
<p>In this case what is happening is if the statement is correct it is returning 1 and if it isn't it is returning nothing.
Am i getting this right, Is saying for loops have return values right?
ThankYou.</p>

<p>What you have posted seems like part of a list comprehension (you probably removed the outer []-braces).</p>
<p>Have a look here: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions</a></p>

<p>A good way to see the execution of a Python script is to use <a href="http://pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=edit" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this tutor</a>. But you need to indicate what <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are (lists ? strings ?).</p>
<pre><code>a = [4,5,6,8]
b = [1,2,3,4]

print([1 for x in range(3) if a[x] &gt; b[x]])
</code></pre>
<p>Output :</p>
<pre><code>[1,1,1]
</code></pre>
<p>This is equivalent to :</p>
<pre><code>tmp = []
for x in range(3):
    if a[x] &gt; b[x]:
        tmp.append(1)
print(tmp)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Loops are not functions. They don't have return values. It is possible that you are confusing comprehensions and loops.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>int()</code> and <code>range()</code> are functions that <code>return</code> values, your list comprehension (or a <code>for</code> loop) is just a way of iterating over these</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes,I got the answer i must be looking for list comprehension in google.Thanks guys.</span>
