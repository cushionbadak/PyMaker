<p>How can I autocomplete the inner element of a list in pycharm and only the inner element ? Not a mixure of methods of the list and the inner element but only the inner element's methods ?</p>
<p>example:</p>
<p>a = list()</p>
<p>a.append(1)</p>
<p>a[0].___ (I want this to only show methods for integers and not both of integer and list)</p>

<p>You you are using Python 3.6 or newer you should be able to use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.6.html#pep-526-syntax-for-variable-annotations" rel="nofollow noreferrer">variable annotations</a>:</p>
<pre><code>from typing import List

a: List[int] = []
</code></pre>
<p>This tells PyCharm that <code>a</code> is a list containing <em>only</em> integer objects.</p>
<p><em>Caveat</em>: I don't know if the current PyCharm 2016.3 release actually supports PEP 526; the <a href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/pycharm/2016/09/pycharm-2016-3-eap-is-available-with-initial-support-for-python-3-6/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Early Access Programme release 2016.3</a> certainly included support but I don't follow the release cycle.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Maybe you know of a way to do the same thing inside a lambda ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@HashWizard: perhaps you need to post a new question about that; 'inside a lambda' is rather vague. Are you passing in the list? Then annotate the arguments of a <i>function</i> (as you can't annotate a <code>lambda</code>, see <a href="//stackoverflow.com/q/33833881">Is it possible to type hint a lambda function?</a>).</span>
