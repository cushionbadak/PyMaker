<p>Our teacher has told us to make a program that validates a postcode as a Northern Ireland postcode. That means it must have the letters "BT" in it and must equal 8 characters. In the code below I managed to get the letters part working. However, he did not go into detail on how to make the input equal 8 characters. He mentioned using .length() and validation(try and except), but I'm unsure how to use .length() to get 8 characters. Here's my code:</p>
<pre><code>postcode = input("Please enter an Northern Ireland postcode:")
BT = "BT"
while BT not in postcode:
    postcode = input("That isn't a Northern Ireland postcode. Try again:")
print("This is a Northern Ireland postcode")
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>To get the number of characters in a String, you can use <code>len(postcode)</code>.</p>
</div>

<span class="comment-copy">That seemed to work, thanks</span>
