<p>I'm trying to figure out how to copy CAD drawings (".dwg", ".dxf) from a source directory with subfolders to a destination directory and maintaining the original directory and subfolders structure.</p>
<ul>
<li>Original Directory: H:\Tanzania...\Bagamoyo_Single_line.dwg</li>
<li>Source Directory: H:\CAD\Tanzania...\Bagamoyo_Single_line.dwg</li>
</ul>
<p>I found the following answer from <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/355230/martineau">@martineau</a> within the following post: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35155382/copying-specific-files-to-a-new-folder-while-maintaining-the-original-subdirect">Python Factory Function</a></p>
<pre><code>from fnmatch import fnmatch, filter
from os.path import isdir, join
from shutil import copytree

def include_patterns(*patterns):
    """Factory function that can be used with copytree() ignore parameter.

    Arguments define a sequence of glob-style patterns

    def _ignore_patterns(path, names):
        keep = set(name for pattern in patterns
                            for name in filter(names, pattern))
        ignore = set(name for name in names
                        if name not in keep and not isdir(join(path, name)))

    return _ignore_patterns

# sample usage

copytree(src_directory, dst_directory,
         ignore=include_patterns('*.dwg', '*.dxf'))

<p>Updated: 18:21. The following code works as expected, except that I'd like to ignore folders that don't contain any include_patterns('<em>.dwg', '</em>.dxf')</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>shutil</code> already contains a function <code>ignore_pattern</code>, so you don't have to provide your own. Straight from the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html" rel="noreferrer">documentation</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>from shutil import copytree, ignore_patterns

copytree(source, destination, ignore=ignore_patterns('*.pyc', 'tmp*'))
</code></pre>
<p>This will copy everything except <code>.pyc</code> files and files or
  directories whose name starts with <code>tmp.</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's a bit tricky (and not strictly necessairy) to explain what's going on: <code>ignore_patterns</code> returns a function <code>_ignore_patterns</code> as its return value, this function gets stuffed into <code>copytree</code> as a parameter, and <code>copytree</code> calls this function as needed, so you don't have to know or care how to call this function <code>_ignore_patterns</code>. It just means that you can exclude certain unneeded cruft files (like <code>*.pyc</code>) from being copied. The fact that the name of the function <code>_ignore_patterns</code> starts with an underscore is a hint that this function is an implementation detail you may ignore.</p>
<p><code>copytree</code> expects that the folder <code>destination</code> doesn't exist yet. It is not a problem that this folder and its subfolders come into existence once <code>copytree</code> starts to work, <code>copytree</code> knows how to handle that.</p>
<p>Now <code>include_patterns</code> is written to do the opposite: ignore everything that's not explicitly included. But it works the same way: you just call it, it returns a function under the hood, and <code>coptytree</code> knows what to do with that function:</p>
<pre><code>copytree(source, destination, ignore=include_patterns('*.dwg', '*.dxf'))
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">That code is already demonstrating how to do it. You pass the patterns to <code>include_patterns</code>, and the return is a callback that you pass to <code>copytree</code>. <code>copytree</code> does the work of passing paths and names to the resulting <code>_ignore_patterns</code> function as it traverses the tree.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hi @ShadowRanger I now understand how the following works. I need to amend the following only to copy the tree if there is a match based on my include_patterns so that I don't end up with empty directories.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hi @Jan , the following function is to generate a dynamic ignore list based on files that I want to keep i.e. CAD ("<i>.dwg", "</i>.dxf"), so all other file types are then ignored. I've got the following working, my last hurdle is to exclude folders that have no files within them based on the include_patterns("<i>.dwg", "</i>.dxf").</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Where is the include_patterns method defined?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@AK47 include_patterns is defined in the OP.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Oh...............</span>
