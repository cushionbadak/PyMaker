<p>I have a simple Python snippet here which copies Macros Excel sheet into csvs. The snippet blows up for some odd reason. I used to run this snippet with <code>Python 2.7</code> and had no problem with it. I recently downloaded <code>Python 3.6</code>. How can I fix this issue?</p>
<pre><code>import csv
import xlrd

workbook = xlrd.open_workbook('P:/LFC Lots and Sales-NEW.xlsm')
for sheet in workbook.sheets():
with open('{}.csv'.format(sheet.name), 'wb') as f:
    writer = csv.writer(f)
    writer.writerows(sheet.row_values(row) for row in range(sheet.nrows))
print ("Sheets copied")
</code></pre>
<p>Traceback:</p>
<pre><code>writer.writerows(sheet.row_values(row) for row in range(sheet.nrows))
TypeError: a bytes-like object is required, not 'str'
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Got it! All I needed to do was change the <code>wb</code> to <code>w</code>.</p>
<pre><code>import csv
import xlrd

workbook = xlrd.open_workbook('P:/LFC Lots and Sales-NEW.xlsm')
for sheet in workbook.sheets():
with open('{}.csv'.format(sheet.name), 'w') as f:
    writer = csv.writer(f)
    writer.writerows(sheet.row_values(row) for row in range(sheet.nrows))
print ("Sheets copied")

<span class="comment-copy">With python 3, you'll also want <code>newline=''</code> in your open -- see the docs <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.writer" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a> and read footnote #1.</span>
