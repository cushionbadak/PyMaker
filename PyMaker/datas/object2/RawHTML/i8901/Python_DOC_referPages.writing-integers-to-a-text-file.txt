<p>New to Python, I am writing integers to a text file for a program, but once the numbers go above 10 the program fails to work. Therefore, I want to add a space after every integer, I have tried a few ways to do this but however it's not been working.</p>
<p>Here is one way in which I tried to do so:</p>
<pre><code>positions = int(uq_words.index(i) + 1, (" "))
</code></pre>
<p>I added the <code>(" ")</code>.</p>
<p>I realise that this is probably a really basic problem to solve.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>try something like <code>" ".join(uq_words)</code> and then write to file</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">not clear what you want. to write to file you use <code>with open('filename', 'w') as f:</code> and then f.write('whatever you want to write')</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ahh, I want to write the contents of the variable <code>positions</code> - however, whenever I try to write the integers to the text file, I get an error saying <code>TypeError: 'str' object cannot be interpreted as an integer</code> I'm not sure how to fix this.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You need to learn about <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.format" rel="nofollow noreferrer">string formatting</a>. Also see <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#fancier-output-formatting" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/tutorial/â€¦</a> But in the mean time you can do <code>positions =  str(uq_words.index(i) + 1) + ' '</code>, assuming that <code>uq_words.index(i) + 1</code> is the integer you want to print or save to the file, then <code>positions</code> will contain the desired string.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">a=2 this is int; str(a) will become string; you can check using type() function</span>
