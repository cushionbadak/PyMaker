<p>I'm using PyMySQL to ping a Database and get the values back. I am doing that like so:</p>
<pre><code>   cursor.execute(/*SQL Statement*/)
   result = cursor.fetchone()
   print (result)
</code></pre>
<p>I tested this and it works fine. Now the problem is I'm trying to get just the first element in the tuple <code>result</code> and I tried doing this like so:</p>
<pre><code>   cursor.execute(/*SQL Statement*/)
   result = cursor.fetchone()[0]
   print (result)
</code></pre>
<p>However that just give me the following error:</p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "myFile.py", line 20, in &lt;module&gt;
    result = cursor.fetchone()[0]
KeyError: 0
</code></pre>
<p>I can't find much documentation on PyMySQL but that look right to me and it also makes sense so I'm not sure why it's not working. Here is the <a href="https://github.com/PyMySQL/PyMySQL/blob/40f6a706144a9b65baa123e6d5d89d23558646ac/pymysql/tests/test_issues.py" rel="nofollow noreferrer">example</a> I was following.</p>

<p>When you using <code>.fetchone()</code> it returns a single dictionary with each value mapped to a specific key which will usually be the name of the column in your SQL database. So your code should look something like this:</p>
<pre><code> cursor.execute(/*SQL Statement*/)
 result = cursor.fetchone()
 print (result[key])
</code></pre>
<p>If you don't know what the key is then just <code>print (results)</code> and it will print out the whole dictionary with all the keys and their corresponding values.</p>
<p>Also, note that if your query returns more than one row you should be using <code>.fetchall()</code> which returns a list of dictionaries so you will first need to select a tuple and then give it a key.</p>
<pre><code> cursor.execute(/*SQL Statement*/)
 result = cursor.fetchone()
 print (result[index][key])
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">You are mistaken. <code>cursor.fetchone()</code> isn't return a tuple, but a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><i>dictionary</i></a>. As to why this is, I'm not exactly sure.</span>
