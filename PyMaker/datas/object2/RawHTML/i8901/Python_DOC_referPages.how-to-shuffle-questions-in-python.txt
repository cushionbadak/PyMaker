<p>You can't shuffle them the way they are hard-coded. Store the questions is a list, and use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.shuffle" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>random.shuffle</code></a> function on that list. You could do something like</p>
<pre><code>validation = False
while validation ==False:
    # input age
    if age &gt; 16:
       validation = False

    questions = [
       ('question 1 text', 'A'),

<p>First make a list (or a dict) with your questions and answers:</p>
<pre><code>Q = [

    "When you get an email from someone you do not know, what should you do?", #This one is 1
    "How secret should you keep your passwords?", # 2
    "When an online contact who frightens you asks to meet you in person what should you do?", #And so on
    "If an email asks you to enter your bank account details because of a problem with your account what should you do?"

    "A:Reply to the email/B:Contact the bank to check if they sent the email/C:Enter your bank account details",
    ]

<p>Define a list to keep track of the shown questions:</p>
<pre><code>QAsked = []

<p>Make a definition for selecting a question:</p>

    if QProposed in QAsked: #If already asked
        SearchQ()           #Search again

        print(Question: Q[QProposed])
        print(Answer: A[QProposed])
        CheckIfOK(QProposed)
</code></pre>
<p>Remember to <code>from random import randint</code>.</p>
<p><code>CheckIfOK(Question)</code> is something like:</p>
<pre><code>if Question == 1:
    ans = input("Answer: ")
    if ans.capitalize() == "A":
        print("WELL DONE")
        score = score + 25
    elif ans.capitalize() =="B":
        print("Wrong Answer")
    elif ans.capitalize() =="C":
        print("Wrong Answer")
    else:
        print("That's not an answer")
if Question == 2:
    ans = input("Answer: ")
    if ans.capitalize() == "C":

        score = score + 25

<span class="comment-copy">@HurAli: edited</span>
<span class="comment-copy">still confused as this our coarse work we need to use while loop or functions to do it and also need to use validations.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@HurAli: re-edited</span>
<span class="comment-copy">questions = [        ('question 1 text', 'A'),        ('question 2 text', 'C')...]      random.shuffle(questions)      for question_text, correct_answer in questions:         user_input = input(question_text)          if user_input.capitalize() == correct_answer:            score += 5            print("well done")         else:            print("wrong answer")                                                               iam just confused in this part can you explain this.</span>
