<p>What have you tried so far?</p>
<p>You can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html?highlight=input#input" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python's <code>input()</code></a> to receive input, however that won't write over dots.
If you wanted to create an interface similar to the linked screenshot, you will need to use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#module-curses" rel="nofollow noreferrer">curses module</a>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Can't you just initialize the field with a bunch of dots?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That won't work because it will either all go away when the user starts typing or the user will end up actually submitting a string of dots following the real text.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">ive been researching but i haven't had much luck :( , thank you for the swift help! Do you have an idea of a summary of code that would needed?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I haven't used the curses module yet but it looks like there's a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/curses.html#curses-howto" rel="nofollow noreferrer">good tutorial in the Python docs</a> and another on <a href="http://www.tuxradar.com/content/code-project-build-ncurses-ui-python" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Tuxradar</a>.</span>
