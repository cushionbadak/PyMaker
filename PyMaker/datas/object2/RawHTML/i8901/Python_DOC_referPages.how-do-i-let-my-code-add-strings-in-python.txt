<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>So for a project of mine I need to have my code generate a number of strings.</p>
<p>For example: </p>
<pre><code>a = input("What is your favourite colour?")
b = len(input)
</code></pre>
<p>How do I generate <code>b</code> strings?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Did you mean this,</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = raw_input("What is your favourite colour?") 
What is your favourite colour?5
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = ['c{}'.format(i) for i in range(1, int(a)+1)]
&gt;&gt;&gt; b
['c1', 'c2', 'c3', 'c4', 'c5']
</code></pre>
<p>PS: Use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>input</code></a> in Python3 (<a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#raw_input" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>raw_input</code></a> for Python2).</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Welcome to SO Steven. Can you elaborate on what you are trying to do? What do you expect to get as "b strings"?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">if len would be 5 for example, i'd like to get the strings : c1 c2 c3 c4 c5. if it would be 10 i'd like to get the strings c1 c2 c3 c4 c5 c6 c....</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@steven what are you going to do with those strings? Do you want them to be empty strings? Letters of the colour?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I want them to be a letter of the colour</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@steven, you want the user to only input 1 color? and then the <code>c</code>'s would be the letters of the color string? for example, if the user enters <code>blue</code>, then <code>c1</code> would be assigned to <code>b</code>, <code>c2</code> assigned to <code>l</code>, and so on like that?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why are you giving him code he already knows?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@m_callens, sorry for the misinterpret. Just updated my answer.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I think that OP might have meant, for example: What is your favourite colour? Yellow, and then generate 6 (<code>len("Yellow")</code>) strings. It is not really clear what those strings are supposed to be, so at this point you may as well do something as simple as <code>strings = [""]*len(a)</code>.</span>
