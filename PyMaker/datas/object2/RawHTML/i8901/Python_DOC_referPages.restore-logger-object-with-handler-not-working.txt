<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Could I store the <code>logger</code> object which contains  and restore it? As an example:</p>
<pre><code>class A:
    def __init__(self):
        self.logger = logging.getLogger('a')
        ...add a console handler and a file handler

    def function(self):
        logger = self.logger
        logger.info("INFO")
</code></pre>
<p>And the console output works well but no output in file. Only the log in the <code>__init__</code> will be outputted to the file but not the log in <code>function</code>.</p>
<p>Any help is appreciated. </p>

<p>I guess it's an configuration issue of the logger. Especially the log level. The default is 'WARNING'. So your logger.info(..) get's ignored. You have to configure the logger.

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for answer, but I just omit the configuration code. And as I say, it works in <code>__init__</code> but not in <code>function</code> and works with console output handler but not file output handler. So this is exactly not a problem of configuration.</span>
