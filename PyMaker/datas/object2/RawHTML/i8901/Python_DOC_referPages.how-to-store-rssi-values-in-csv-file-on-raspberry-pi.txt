<p>Have you had a look at PyBluez: <a href="https://github.com/karulis/pybluez" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://github.com/karulis/pybluez</a>? I'm sure you can find what you need in regard to the Bluetooth component of your question in one of their examples.</p>
<p>In regard to writing a csv file, have a look at the documentation here:
