<p>I want to download the pdf and store it in a folder on my local computer.
Following is the link of pdf i want to download <a href="https://ascopubs.org/doi/pdfdirect/10.1200/JCO.2018.77.8738" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://ascopubs.org/doi/pdfdirect/10.1200/JCO.2018.77.8738</a></p>
<p>I have written code in both python selenium and using urllib but both failed to download.</p>
<pre><code>import time, urllib
time.sleep(2)
pdfPath = "https://ascopubs.org/doi/pdfdirect/10.1200/JCO.2018.77.8738"
pdfName = "jco.2018.77.8738.pdf"
f = open(pdfName, 'wb')
f.write(urllib.urlopen(pdfPath).read())
f.close()
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>It's much easier with requests </p>
<pre><code>import requests 

url = 'https://ascopubs.org/doi/pdfdirect/10.1200/JCO.2018.77.8738'
pdfName = "./jco.2018.77.8738.pdf"
r = requests.get(url)

with open(pdfName, 'wb') as f:
    f.write(r.content)

<span class="comment-copy">I saw that answer, Made this since my URL doesn't have filename ending with extension '.pdf' So i was trying more of selenium python implementations.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I just use your information is given and, with given link and file name to be, just used a solution written there and added a link there  and problem solved.</span>
