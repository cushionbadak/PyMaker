<p>I have these functions below where I am placing the letter "b" at a certain location within a matrix. (I'm making minesweeper and these "b" represents where the bomb is located in the matrix). I must put 'z' bombs into the function, but where the bombs are placed cannot occur more than once. I know how to place them inside the function, but finding if they are repeating is what I can't figure out</p>

<p>Perhaps I don't understand the question, but why not just check whether "b" is already there?</p>

<span class="comment-copy">This is a fair question, but you should describe your problem in the actual body of the question, not just the title (I think this is why you are being down-voted).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If the grid is completely filled with mines, you'll get a <code>RuntimeError</code> because you recursed too far.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you, this is very close to what I am looking for. But when doing it, it reprints the matrix over and over until finally mat[y][x] != "b"</span>
