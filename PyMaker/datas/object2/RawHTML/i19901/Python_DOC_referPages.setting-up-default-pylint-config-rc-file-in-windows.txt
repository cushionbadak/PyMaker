<p>I'm using Pylint under Windows, and it's not reading my pylint-config.rc file.
Is there a way to set up a default .rc file for Python within windows so that I don't have to keep typing it into the command line?
Thanks.</p>

<p>I don't have a windows box at hand to test, but the code uses <code>os.path.expanduser('~')</code> to find the current user's home directory, and looks for a file calle <code>.pylintrc</code> in that directory. </p>
<p>According to the <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html?highlight=expanduser#os.path.expanduser" rel="noreferrer">python documentation</a>, on Windows, <code>expanduser</code> uses HOME and USERPROFILE if set, otherwise a combination of HOMEPATH and HOMEDRIVE. So my advice is to check in a Python interactive session what the following script outputs:</p>
<pre><code>import os
print os.path.expanduser('~')
</code></pre>
<p>and put the configuration file as <code>.pylintrc</code> in that folder.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if you want to use different configuration files on a per project basis, you should know that if there is a file called <code>pylintrc</code> (without a leading dot) in the current working directory, then Pylint will use this one. If there is a file called <code>__init__.py</code> in the current working directory, Pylint will look in the parent directory until there is no such file and then look for a <code>pylintrc</code> configuration file. This is done so that you can maintain a per project config file together with you source code, and lauch Pylint from any directory in your source tree. </p>

<p>Since creating a file beginning with a dot is not allowed from Windows file explorer, you can create a template using:</p>
<pre><code>pylint --generate-rcfile &gt; .pylintrc
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>There are two possible ways to do this.  One way is to edit the file <code>C:\Python\Scripts\pylint.bat</code> changing the line</p>
<pre><code>python "%~dpn0" %* 
</code></pre>
<p>to</p>
<pre><code>python "%~dpn0" %* --rcfile="C:\path\to\pylint.rc" 
</code></pre>
<p>Another way is to go to add an environment variable.  Do this by going to <code>Start-&gt;Control Panel-&gt;System</code> then going to the <code>Advanced</code> tab and clicking <code>Environment Variables</code>.  Then click <code>New</code> and create a variable named PYLINTRC with the value of <code>C:\path\to\pylint.rc</code>. </p>
