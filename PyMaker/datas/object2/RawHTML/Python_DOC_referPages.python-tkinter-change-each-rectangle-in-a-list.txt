<p>I am trying to change the color of each rectangle in a list to be a different color and draw them all.
But for some reason it either changes all the rectangles to the same color or stay the same.</p>
<p>Here is the code:</p>
<pre><code>def draw(newAuto,canves):
    colorMap = {
        "0":"green",
        "1":"blue",
        "2":"red"
    }
    i=0
    for elem in canves.find_withtag("my_tag"):
        canves.itemconfig(elem, fill=colorMap[str(newAuto[i])])
        i+=i
    canves.after(100, canves.update())
</code></pre>
<p>I am not sure how to debug it since I can't find where the rectangle element is,
any ideas why it's like that? Perhaps the use of update/after is incorrect?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You are not incrementing <code>i</code> properly, it should be <code>i+=1</code>. Also you haven't said what <code>newAuto</code> is but I guess the line should read <code>canves.itemconfig(elem, fill=colorMap[str(i)])</code>. Hope this helps.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">What is the value of <code>newAuto</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">the problem was the i+=1, tnx! the conclusion is never code at 4am..</span>
