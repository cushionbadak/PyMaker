<p>I don't know whether I understand the question correctly. In case your application is using logging object (ref. <code>https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html</code>) then your output could either be in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Console: from which the application was started</li>
<li>File: in case that you specified the logging output to a file</li>
</ul>
<p>It depends on your configuration and on the logging level as well. Some applications (like Django) use their own configuration to log. </p>
