<p>So, I joined just to make this. How can I do the square root with a variable?</p>
<p>Here is the code.</p>
<pre><code>    ##Algebra 2 Radicals Calculator
import math

input("Before we start, put frations in parentheses. It should look like (3/5). Press any key to continue.")

a = input("If the base is just x, type 1. If the base has a number and a variable, type 2. If the base has just a number, type 3. ")
if a == "1":
    x = input("What is the base? ")
    y = input("What is the Exponent's Numerator? ")
    z = input("What is the Exponent's Denominator? ")
    print(y,"√",x,"^",z)

if a == "2":
    b = input("What is the number in the base? ")
    e = input("What is the variable? ")
    c = input("What is the Exponent's Numerator? ")
    d = input(" What is the Exponent's Denominator? ")
    X = sqrt(b)
    if b == (X).is_integer():
        print(X, c,"√",e,"^",c)
    elif b != (X).is_integer():
        print(c,"√",b,e,"^",d)

<p>First of all, <code>input()</code> returns a string, not a number, but <code>math.sqrt()</code> requires its argument to be a number. So you need to do:</p>
<pre><code>b = float(input("What is the number in the base? "))
</code></pre>
<p>and similar for all the other inputs (use <code>int()</code> instead of <code>float()</code> if the input should be a number without any fractional part, such as the numerator and denominator of a fraction).</p>
<p>Then to calculate the square root, you need to call <code>math.sqrt()</code>, not just <code>sqrt()</code>:</p>
<pre><code>X = math.sqrt(b)
</code></pre>
<p>Then your <code>if</code> statements are wrong.</p>
<pre><code>if b == (X).is_integer():
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>is_integer()</code> method returns <code>True</code> or <code>False</code>, but <code>b</code> is the number the user entered, not a truth value. If you want to tell if <code>b</code> is equal to the integer part of <code>X</code>, it should be:</p>
<pre><code>if int(b) == int(X):
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>elif</code> test should just be <code>else:</code>, since it's just testing the opposite condition.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Welcome to SO. Please read <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve">Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example</a> and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/how-to-ask">How to Ask</a>.  You are probably getting an exception for <code>X = sqrt(b)</code> because <code>b</code> is a string at that point - but you didn't tell us that so we don't know what problem you are having. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>input</code></a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">I strongly recommend that you look up and use "incremental programming" for a while.  You've made some errors several times without testing your code; this gets you into deeper trouble.</span>
