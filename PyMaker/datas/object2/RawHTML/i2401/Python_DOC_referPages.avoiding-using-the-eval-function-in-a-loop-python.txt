<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have a certain function (Quash) which i want to use to run over a list of variables e.g. a list called 'list'. Is there a way I can run this over the list of numbers without using eval?</p>
<p>NB: I have put the QUash function here only for the sake of simplicity. The really function is more complicated with lots of strings. </p>
<p>Is there an alternative to using the eval function in this loop to have the value extracted? </p>
<pre><code>list = [1,2,3,4]

def stringfunction(Var): 
    AnalysisVar = "Quash.(" + str(Var) + ")"
    return AnalysisVar

CompleteNames = [stringfunction(i) for element in list]

for i in CompleteNames:
    eval("%s" %CompleteNames[i])
</code></pre>
<p>Thanks in advance. </p>

<p>First, it's a bad idea to name your list "list" as that name is already used in Python. Second, just update your list comprehension:</p>
<pre><code>my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]

CompleteNames = [Quash(str(i)) for i in my_list]
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>[stringfunction(i) for element in list]</code> is not going to work.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes@ Klaus D. the thing is I can't put the details of the entire function online. I have just put this in to simplify this as far as possible.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You have simplified the question to the point of unanswerability.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You have to add enough code to allow to reproduce the problem directly.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ok Will use Map then . Thanks</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you for that @Aaron Hampton but the function is a bit more complicated than that. I put a simple string over here for the sake of simplicity. Is there another way to do this as well without using the eval function? Really appreciate your help though</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Feedback noted. Also will name my list something better than list.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You should update your question with a more detailed description of what you want to do then.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Can you provide a more realistic example? I'm not sure what would make it too complicated for this to work, so there might be better options if I have more info. You could use the built in map function: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#map" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#map</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, what Aaron said.</span>
