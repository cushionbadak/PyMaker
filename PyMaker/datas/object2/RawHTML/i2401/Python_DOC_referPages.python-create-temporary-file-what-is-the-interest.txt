<p>I've recently started working with python. In another topic, I read that someone had to create temporary files, has he had to create file (also in python).</p>
<p>So my question is, what is the interest of working with temp files ?</p>
<p>To me it would be, not to have too many (unneeded files, that can be removed later).</p>
<p>In my project, I have a main file</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>main.dat</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In which I extract 2 blocks,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>main_first_block.dat</strong></p>
<p><strong>main_second_block.dat</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then I combine <strong><code>main_second_block.dat</code></strong> and <strong><code>main_second_block.dat</code></strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>final_file.dat</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So it makes a total of <strong>4 files</strong>. </p>
<p>And at the end, I dont need <strong><code>main_first_block.dat</code></strong> and <strong><code>main_second_block.dat</code></strong> anymore.</p>
<p>I only need to keep <strong><code>main_file.dat</code></strong> and <strong><code>final_file.dat</code></strong></p>
<p>So my question is, should I create tmp files, or delete the unneeded files at the end of my script ?</p>
<p>Thanks guys for your enlightenment ;)</p>

<p>There is not really that much a difference in lines of code. 
Yet, tmp files indicate that they are not made to stay. Therefore they bring more clarity to your code.</p>
<p>When using tmp files make sure to avoid the mktemp()-function 
as it is highly vulnerable to attacks.</p>
<p>Hope I could help in some way.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Quoting the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/tempfile.html#tempfile.TemporaryFile" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs</a>: <i>The file is created using mkstemp(). It will be destroyed as soon as it is closed</i></span>
<span class="comment-copy">good point about mktemp()</span>
