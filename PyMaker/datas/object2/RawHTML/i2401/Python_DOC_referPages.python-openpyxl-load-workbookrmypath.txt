<p>i want to use this piece of code openpyxl.load_workbook(r"mypath") but the only difference is that mypath is a varialbe path i change everytime depending on a loop of different folders.</p>
<pre><code>PathsList = []
for folderName, subFolders, fileNames in os.walk              
                fileNamesList.append(os.path.basename(fileName))
                PathsList.append(os.path.abspath(fileName))

or i in range(len(fileNamesList)):
    j = 1
    while j &lt; len(fileNamesList):
        if(first3isdigit(fileNamesList[i])) == (first3isdigit(fileNamesList[j])):
            if(in_fileName_DOORS in str(fileNamesList[i]) and in_fileName_TAF in str(fileNamesList[j])):
                mypath = PathsList[i]
        File = openpyxl.load_workbook(r'mypath ')
                wsFile = File.active
</code></pre>
<p>mypath is not readable as a vairable , is there's any solution!
Edit 1:i thought also about </p>
<pre><code>File = openpyxl.load_workbook(exec(r'%s' % (mypath))
</code></pre>
<p>but couldn't since exec can't be inside brackets</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This code</p>
<pre><code>File = openpyxl.load_workbook(r'mypath ')
</code></pre>
<p>Tries to pass the raw string <code>'mypath '</code> as an argument to the <code>load_workbook</code> method.</p>
<p>If you want to pass the contents of the <code>mypath</code> variable to the method, you should remove the apostrophe and the r tag.</p>
<pre><code>File = openpyxl.load_workbook(mypath)
</code></pre>
<p>This is basic python synthax. You can read more about it in the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Please let me know if this is what you needed.</p>
<p>Edit:
If the slashes are a concern you can do the following:</p>
<pre><code>File = openpyxl.load_workbook(mypath.replace('\\','/')
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">it didn't work , it needs this r before mypath  what i am searching for is how to  File = openpyxl.load_workbook(r mypath) insteadof  File = openpyxl.load_workbook(r'C:\spam\spam\spam\text.xlsm')</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MahmoudElnahal I have edited my answer. Let me know if it works. Also, add <code>print(mypath)</code> before this line and edit your question, so we can see what filepaths are formed.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">it works thanks alot !</span>
