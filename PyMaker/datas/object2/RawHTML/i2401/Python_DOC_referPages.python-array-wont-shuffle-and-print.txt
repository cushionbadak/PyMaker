<p>I have not gone through your logic. Just corrected your code syntactically. You had passed the list without initializing it. Had created an infinite loop( never decremented the param d)</p>

<p><strong>FYI</strong> there's a predefined <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.shuffle" rel="nofollow noreferrer">shuffle</a> function in the random package</p>
<pre><code>import random
array = [1, 2, 3, 4]
random.shuffle(array) # shuffles in place

<p>For your case, you need to define the array, before passing it to the function</p>

<pre><code>(xenial)vash@localhost:~/python/stack_overflow$ python3.7 shuffle.py 
Shuffle: [5, 2, 3, 4, 1]
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>First thing first:</p>
<pre><code>def shuffle(ary):

    ary = [1,2,3,4,5]
</code></pre>
<p>You are decalring <code>ary</code> inside the function we need to move that outside so we can pass it into the function using <code>suffle(ary)</code></p>
<pre><code>d=len[ary]
b=d-1
</code></pre>
<p>This should be one line <code>d = len[ary] - 1</code></p>
<pre><code>while (d &gt; 0):
</code></pre>
<p>Now the good stuff :) First we have <code>while(d &gt; 0)</code>, if you want to use this we have to add something that eventually end this loop so after each run lets add in a <code>d -= 1</code>, but even so you should be using a <code>for loop</code> instead which would be <code>for i in range(mixes)</code> no need to use <code>d</code> here since the amount of cycles is really up to you, the higher you go the more randomization we will get. In this example lets pass <code>mixes</code> along with our array.</p>
<p>Next our Shuffling:</p>
<pre><code>    x=random.randint(0,d)
</code></pre>
<p>In context of your code this would have been a random between <code>0</code> and <code>5</code>, since <code>lists</code> start at a <code>0</code> index your current <code>ary</code> has indexes from <code>0-4</code>
so we want a random int in that range, in your code this would have been <code>b</code> since <code>b</code> was <code>d - 1</code>.</p>
<pre><code>if x == d:
</code></pre>
<p>This if says that <code>if the random int == 5</code> which is out of the range of indexes, lets though for the sake of it assume you meant <code>4</code>, all this would do only ever give us a index of <code>4</code> which isn't what we want for shuffling we want a random index throughout so lets get rid of that.</p>
<p>Lets instead grab another random variable to swap with so we always swap two random numbers</p>
<pre><code>y = random.randint(0, b)
while y == x:
    y = random.randint(0, b)
</code></pre>
<p>Here we generate another random number for an index but also make sure its not equal to the one we are swapping with</p>
<p>And finally we swap:</p>
<pre><code>ary[b],ary[x]=ary[x],ary[d]
</code></pre>
<p>Again if we use this method we would only ever swap the last digit, with a random digit, and not to mention again that <code>d</code> would be out of range`</p>
<pre><code>some_ary[x], some_ary[y] = some_ary[y], some_ary[x]
</code></pre>
<p>Instead lets swap two random positions</p>
<p>And then we can either:</p>
<pre><code>results = shuffle(ary, 10)
print(results)
</code></pre>
<p>or </p>
<pre><code>print(f"{shuffle(ary, 10)}")
</code></pre>
<p>Hope this helps ! :)</p>

<span class="comment-copy">you have quiet a bit going on here that needs to be fixed, but for starters, you are attempting to pass a variable that you defined in your function into your function</span>
<span class="comment-copy">your while loop never exits, you have while <code>d &gt; 0</code> when will <code>d</code> not be greater than 0?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">that gives me the error                                                                                          TypeError: 'builtin_function_or_method' object is not subscriptable</span>
<span class="comment-copy">using the standard function or yours ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@carlosvelasquez glad to assists! If this solved your problem would appreciate if you checked solved, cheers!</span>
