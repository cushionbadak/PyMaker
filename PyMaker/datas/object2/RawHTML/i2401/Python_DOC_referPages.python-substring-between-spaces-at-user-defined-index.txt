<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I am new to Python, have been watching videos on Youtube and trying to learn.</p>
<p>I am trying to <code>substring</code> a text between two spaces from a line. Let me explain, what exactly I am trying.</p>
<p>1) I have a text like mentioned below:</p>
<p><code>CREATE TABLE DATABASENAME.TABLENAME AS SELECT ....</code></p>
<p>2) Now from the above text I want to retrieve only <code>DATABASENAME.TABLENAME</code></p>
<p>3) So I want to extract text between second space and third space, ie. I want to extract text between index numbered 13 and 35, but on basis on spaces.</p>
<p>Can anyone help? Please.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can split the string into list of words based on spaces then get the elements by index in this case it's 2.</p>
<pre><code>s = 'CREATE TABLE DATABASENAME.TABLENAME AS SELECT'
print(s.split(' ')) #['CREATE', 'TABLE', 'DATABASENAME.TABLENAME', 'AS', 'SELECT']
print(s.split(' ')[2]) #DATABASENAME.TABLENAME
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>string='CREATE TABLE DATABASENAME.TABLENAME AS SELECT'
extract=string.split(' ')[2]
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can split a python string by space with <code>string.split()</code>. This  will break up your text into 'words', then you can simply access the 3rd word like this:</p>
<pre><code>word_3 = string.split()[2]
</code></pre>
<p>For more complex patterns, you can use regex, which is a powerful string pattern finding tool.</p>
<p>Hope this helped :)</p>

<span class="comment-copy">check out <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Regular Expression</a> Another good site to test your expression is <a href="https://regex101.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a> . It is hard in the beginning but once you get it they are very useful.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Please post your attempt</span>
<span class="comment-copy">str.split() splits on spaces</span>
<span class="comment-copy">mystring  = "CREATE TABLE DABASENAME.TABLENAME AS SELECT ..." mylist = mystring.split(" ") print(mylist) print(mylist[2])  This is what I have till now.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">whitespace is by default, so split() is enuff</span>
<span class="comment-copy">it's not default.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@CSMaverick yes it is - <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#str.split" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Of course you can use it in Python2 but not in 3 you will end up with <code>ValueError: empty separator</code></span>
