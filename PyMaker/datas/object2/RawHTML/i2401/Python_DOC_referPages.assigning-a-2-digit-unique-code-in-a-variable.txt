<p>can you please show me how to add a 2-digit unique code in every user's input.</p>
<p>The problem scenario is, if the program takes 4 inputs from the user (input1, input2, input3, input4), the program should also assign a unique 2-digit code in every input.</p>
<p>this is just a small part of my assignment, but if you could guide me through how to get it, it will be a great help for me. You may give me a hint if you feel don't want to give the real answer, but this one's quite important for me as once I've got this I can get through all the rest of the codes :)</p>
<p>here's what I have done so far:</p>
<h1>I want to utilise the numbers generated by this for loop. But, they should be used once only.</h1>
<pre><code>for i in range(99):
    rnd = print(f'{i:02}')
</code></pre>
<h1>Asking a user input.</h1>
<pre><code>Input1 = print(input("enter your first input: "))
Input2 = print(input("enter your second input: "))
Input3 = print(input("enter your third input: "))
Input4 = print(input("enter your fourth input: "))
</code></pre>
<p>here is the example output:</p>
<pre><code>45 Input1
90 Input2
88 Input3
10 Input4
</code></pre>
<p>Thanks very much</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can get the codes from using <code>random.sample</code> of <code>4</code> within <code>range(10, 100)</code>, and save the inputs to a dict indexed by the codes:</p>
<pre><code>import random
inputs = {}
for code in random.sample(range(10, 100), 4):
    inputs[code] = input('Input%d: ' % (len(inputs) + 1))
print(inputs)
</code></pre>
<p>Sample input and output:</p>
<pre><code>Input1: hello
Input2: world
Input3: foo
Input4: bar
{60: 'hello', 21: 'world', 55: 'foo', 10: 'bar'}
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Your question isn't clear at all. Add the code you have so far and explain what's missing.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>from random import sample; sample(range(10, 100), 4)</code>? see <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html?highlight=choice#random.sample" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>random.sample</code></a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Make a dictionary, have the key be a random number between 00 and 99 and the value be the input</span>
<span class="comment-copy">apology for vague question. and thank you for all your hints, I will work that out from here :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">this one's works for me, I actually need 6 digit random numbers, but it'll guide me through as a basis. Thank you very much</span>
