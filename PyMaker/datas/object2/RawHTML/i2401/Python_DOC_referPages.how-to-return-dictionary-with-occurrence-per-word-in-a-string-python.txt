<p>How can I make a function (given a string sentece) that returns a dictionary with each word as key and the number of occurrence as the value? (preferably without using functions like .count and .counter, basically as few shortcuts as possible.)</p>
<p>What I have so far doesn't seem to work and gives a key error, I have a small clue of why it doesn't work, but I'm not sure what to do to fix it. This is what I have for now:</p>
<pre><code>def wordCount(sentence):
    myDict = {}
    mySentence = sentence.lower().split()

    for word in mySentence:
        if word in myDict:
           myDict[word] += 1
        else:
           myDict[word] = 1

    return myDict
wordCount("Hi hi hello")
print(myDict)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You have been mixing up variables <code>mySentence</code> and <code>myDict</code> at one point.<br/>
You can also not use local variables outside of their scope. The following will work:</p>
<pre><code>def wordCount(sentence):
    myDict = {}
    mySentence = sentence.lower().split()
    for word in mySentence:
        if word in myDict:
           myDict[word] += 1
        else:
           myDict[word] = 1
    return myDict

d = wordCount("Hi hi hello")  # assign the return value to a variable
print(d)  # so you can reuse it
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">In <code>if word in mySentence:</code> probably you meant <code>if word in myDict:</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Also, if this is not a programming exercise, you can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.Counter" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>collections.Counter</code></a> to solve this problem: <code>Counter(sentence.lower().split())</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, I changed that, but it still doesn't work though:/</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What exactly does not work? Do you call the function in your actual script within the function itself? I was assuming you just had the indentation wrong there.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Now i get an error saying "NameError: name 'myDict' is not defined", I call it outside the script, but still get an error</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Charlotte <code>myDict</code> is a local variable in your function. You cannot use it outside! I updated my answer.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks a lot! it's solved now :)</span>
