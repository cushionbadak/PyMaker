<p>I have been looking for a way to split a string by digits, for instance: </p>
<pre><code>st = "abc4ert"
from string import digits
st = st.split(digits)
--&gt; st = ['abc','ert']
</code></pre>
<p>Is there a way to do that (without including the numbers in the list)?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Use Regex.</p>
<p><strong>Ex:</strong></p>
<pre><code>import re

st = "abc4ert"
print(re.findall(r"[A-Za-z]+", st))
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>
<pre><code>['abc', 'ert']
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.split" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>re.split</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>import re

st = "abc4ert"
st = re.split(r'\d+', st)
print(st)
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>['abc', 'ert']

<span class="comment-copy">I think the question is not a duplicate. Isn't the situation in the linked question different?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It would be great if you explain this one liner <code>re.findall(r"[A-Za-z]+", st)</code>. It would be helpful to understand how it works for a larger audience reading your answer now and in the future</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That's very basic regex literacy.<code>[...]</code> matches a single character which is one of the characters defined between the square brackets, and <code>A-Z</code> and <code>a-z</code> are character ranges whose semantics should be obvious.  The <code>+</code> matches a sequence of one or more matches on the immediately preceding expression.</span>
