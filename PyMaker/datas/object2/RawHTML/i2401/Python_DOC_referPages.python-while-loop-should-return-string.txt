<p>Again I'm somewhat stuck with a task. This time my while loop should return a string of comma separated numbers. I do get the comma separated numbers out when I print them but the whole thing should be inside a string, and that's where I fail.</p>
<p>The code I use:</p>
<pre><code>a = 7
b = ""

while a &lt;= 20:
    b += (str(a) + ", ")
    a = a + 3

ANSWER = b          # Same result with str(b)
</code></pre>
<p>This produce: <code>7, 10, 13, 16, 19,</code> and not <code>"7, 10, 13, 16, 19,"</code>
I don't think I should hard code it in... Any pointers on this?</p>
<p>Regards</p>

<p>If you want the surrounding quotes, try <code>repr()</code>:</p>
<pre><code>b = "7, 10, 13, 16, 19,"
print(repr(b))
</code></pre>
<p>Output (single quotes only, this relies on <code>str.repr()</code>, you can change it):</p>
<pre><code>'7, 10, 13, 16, 19,'
</code></pre>
<p>Or explicitly wrap them up or change <code>repr()</code>'s output to use double quotes:</p>
<pre><code>print('"{}"'.format(b))
print('"{}"'.format(repr(b)[1:-1]))
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>"7, 10, 13, 16, 19,"
</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#repr" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>repr()</code></a> gives <em>a string containing a printable representation of an object</em>, and for most types, the result of <code>repr()</code> would be suitable for <code>eval()</code>, or to be put in your source code.</p>

<p>This is actually a String. You can test this by printing the value of type:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print(type(b))  
&lt;class 'str'&gt;

ANSWER = f'"{b}"'
print(ANSWER)

<span class="comment-copy">That <i>is</i> a string, <code>print</code> won't show the quotes.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Note - you can do this using: <code>print(*range(7, 20, 3), sep=', ')</code> if you only really want to print it - but I imagine you're supposed to be using <code>range</code> if possible here</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Note this answer requires Python 3.6 or newer (for the f-string).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@iBug Nice catch, I only began coding at Python 3.7 I forget that others may be using a previous version, will keep that in mind with future posts</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That's fine. It's usually recommended to use newest version of softwares / code on newest platforms. But it's also important to know the difference between older versions. Good luck.</span>
