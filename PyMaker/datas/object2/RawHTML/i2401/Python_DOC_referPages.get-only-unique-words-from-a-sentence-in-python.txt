<p>Let's say I have a string that says "mango mango peach". How can I print only the unique words in that string. 
The desired output for the above string would be [peach] as a list
Thanks!!</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>seq = "mango mango peach"
[x for x in seq if x not in seq[seq.index(x)+1:]]
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Python has a built in method called count that would work very well here    </p>
<pre><code>text = "mango mango peach apple apple banana"
words = text.split()

for word in words:
    if text.count(word) == 1:
        print(word)
    else:
        pass
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>(xenial)vash@localhost:~/python/stack_overflow$ python3.7 mango.py 
peach
banana
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Using list comprehension you can do this </p>
<pre><code>[print(word) for word in words if text.count(word) == 1]
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>First - split you string with empty space delimiter (split() method), than use Counter or calculate frequencies by your own code.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.Counter" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>Counter</code></a> to find the number of occurrences of each word, then make a list of all words that appear only once.</p>
<pre><code>from collections import Counter

phrase = "mango peach mango"

counts = Counter(phrase.split())

print([word for word, count in counts.items() if count == 1])
# ['peach']
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Which part are you struggling with?  Splitting the sentence into words, or finding the unique words?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">finding the unique words.. i can use to set function to filter out the duplicate words but that would mean that my output will be [mango,peach]</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Look more carefully at the expected output.  They're looking for those words that only appear once in the input.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">whoops, fixed, thanks</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This worked!! Thanks so much</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Your welcome, Cheers :)</span>
