<p>I have a script in which I'm having difficulty testing for a new line character coming from stdout of a remote command.</p>
<pre><code>  OUT  = stdout.readlines()
  print OUT

  if ['\n'] in OUT:
    print "/disk/var/log/app directory deleted"
  else:
    for line in OUT:
      print line.strip()
</code></pre>
<p>The result of OUT is ['\n'] if a directory is deleted.  No matter what I try I can't get it to recognize ['\n'] in the if statement.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Right now you are checking if the list <code>['\n']</code> (i.e. the list containing only one element, <code>'\n'</code>) is contained in <code>OUT</code></p>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.IOBase.readlines" rel="nofollow noreferrer">readlines()</a> returns a list of strings. It will never return a list which contains lists, so <code>['\n'] in OUT</code> shouldn't ever evaluate to true. You likely want to either do</p>
<p><code>if OUT == ['\n']:</code></p>
<p>OR</p>
<p><code>if '\n' in OUT:</code></p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>if '\n' in OUT:</code> or <code>if ['\n'] == OUT:</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@G_M, if ['\n'] == OUT: worked.  Thank you.</span>
