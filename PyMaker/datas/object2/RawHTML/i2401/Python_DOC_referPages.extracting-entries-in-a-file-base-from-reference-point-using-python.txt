<p>Could you provide me an example in python how to extract text entries using starting reference and the end reference point?  For example the file "test.txt" has content as follows:</p>
<p><strong>* start123
1234567
abcdefg
xyz1234
*</strong> end123</p>
<p>I want python to search for "<strong>* start123" once found, look for end point "*</strong> end123" then any entries in between are extracted and saved into a new file "test2.txt" as is. I know it can be done in grep or awk but if you could provide me a sample in python, I could reuse that to accomplish my next step.</p>

<p>In this case, I'd use regex. Try using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>import re</code></a> for text matching in general.</p>

<p>The easiest way is to use <code>str.find()</code>. This method returns the index where the substring was found or -1 if it wasn't found. I'll leave the I/O and error checking for you to implement. Thus you will have the substrings occurrences in the line and you can slice your string to get just the content between them.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; string = "* start123 1234567 abcdefg xyz1234 * end123"
&gt;&gt;&gt; st = string.find('* start123')
&gt;&gt;&gt; ed = string.find('* end123')
&gt;&gt;&gt; string[st+len('* start123 '):ed-1]
'1234567 abcdefg xyz1234'
</code></pre>
<p>Just make sure to deal with the case in which the substrings aren't found.</p>
