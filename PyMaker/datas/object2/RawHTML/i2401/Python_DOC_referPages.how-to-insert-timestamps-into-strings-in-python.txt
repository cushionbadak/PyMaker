<p>I have a program that I need to copy files from one location to another, then rename the copied file to include a timestamp at the end of the name. So when a file gets copied, the time it was copied gets rewritten to the end of the file name. Currently, my code is a massively roundabout trip to nowhere so I see no point in even posting it. Any ideas? Thank you in advance.</p>

<p>To format timestamps you want to look at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.date.strftime" rel="nofollow noreferrer">strftime</a>. </p>
<p>e.g. <code>a = "{}".format(datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%H:%M:%S"))</code></p>
<p>This will take the string, and format it with a timestamp in the H:M:S format.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Well you should probably rename the file <em>before</em> you send it over. That way you don't have to deal with finding the new file after you've moved it. </p>
<p>The following python code will take any string and append the current timestamp to it. This timestamp is in ISO format, meaning that it has the following form. YYYY-MM-DD with the hour - minutes - seconds appended to it. </p>
<p>import datetime
import time
import calendar</p>
<pre><code>def append_timestamp(filename):

     timestamp = calendar.timegm(time.gmtime())
     human_readable = datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(timestamp).isoformat()
     filename_with_timestamp = filename + "_" + str(human_readable)
     return filename_with_timestamp

print(append_timestamp("FILENAME"))
</code></pre>
<p>prints "FILENAME_2018-09-20T12:48:45"</p>
