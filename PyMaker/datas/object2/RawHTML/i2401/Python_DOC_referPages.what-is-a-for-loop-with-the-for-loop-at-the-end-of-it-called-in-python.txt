<p>I've seen some snippets of python code in which a loop was written as follows:</p>
<pre><code>someList = g.db.execute('SELECT title, body FROM posts')
posts = [dict(title=x[0],body=[1]) for x in someList.fetchAll()]
</code></pre>
<p>What is this kind of loop refered to as?</p>
<p>I realize it could be just refered to as a for loop, but the syntax it quite different from a c-based language (shorter and more productive), so I just wondered if have some other name written like this.</p>

<p>This is list comprehension, these are equivalent: </p>
<pre><code>[dict(title=x[0],body=[1]) for x in someList]

for x in someList:
    dict(title = x[0], body = [1])
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Please note it is defintely <i>not</i> a loop, but rather a single expression, called a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">list comprehension</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Generally, I see this type loops under comprehension, such as list comprehension or set comprehension.</span>
