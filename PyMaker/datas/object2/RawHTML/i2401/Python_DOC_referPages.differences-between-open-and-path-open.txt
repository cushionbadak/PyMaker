<p>Regarding the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>pathlib</code></a> module in the standard library, is the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path.open" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>path.open()</code></a> method is just a "wrapper" for built-in <code>open()</code> function?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you read the <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Lib/pathlib.py#L1167" rel="nofollow noreferrer">source code</a> of <code>pathlib.Path.open</code> you'll find that it simply does:</p>
<pre><code>return io.open(str(self), mode, buffering, encoding, errors, newline, opener=self._opener)
</code></pre>
<p>and according to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.open" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>io</code>'s documentation</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>io.open(file, mode='r', buffering=-1, encoding=None, errors=None, newline=None, closefd=True, opener=None)</code></p>
<p>This is an alias for the builtin <code>open()</code> function.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So you are correct that <code>pathlib.Path.open</code> is just a wrapper for the built-in <code>open</code> function.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">@MikahilZakharov, are you referring to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path.open" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this</a> library?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@toti08 Yes, you are right.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Open the file pointed to by the path, <i>like the built-in open() function does</i> â€“ does that answer your question? Whether you consider it as a wrapper, you can decide by looking at the source code of pathlib.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@mkrieger1 I have read the doc, you are quoting and actually my question was inspired by exactly this remark. Yes, I can look into sources and, but I thought maybe someone already knows the answer without looking into the code.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thank you very much, sir!</span>
