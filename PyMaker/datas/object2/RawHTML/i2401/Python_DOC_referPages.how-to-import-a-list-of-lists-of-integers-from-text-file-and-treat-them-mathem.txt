<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have data in text.txt file</p>
<pre><code>[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
[[10, 11, 12], [13, 14, 15], [16, 17, 18]]
</code></pre>
<p>and so on
I want to read each line of the text file and treat them as integers e.g. plot these points in 3d space. When I import the file by</p>
<pre><code>with open('text.txt') as f:
    content = f.readlines()
    for x in content:
        print(x)
</code></pre>
<p>it takes it as:</p>
<pre><code>'[','[','1' etc...
</code></pre>
<p>So I am confused what to use as separator for split() function. Will appreciate some suggestions.
Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>You can use the built in function <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#eval" rel="nofollow noreferrer">eval()</a> to interpret python lists from files:</p>
<pre><code>with open('file.txt') as fp:
    for line in fp:
        pylist = eval(line)
        print(pylist)
</code></pre>
<p>If you are not 100% sure about the nature of this file or if it would contain data that another user manually generated, as pointed out by @G_M, you should use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html#ast.literal_eval" rel="nofollow noreferrer">ast.literal_eval</a> that will only evaluate a python literal:</p>
<pre><code>import ast

with open('file.txt') as fp:
    for line in fp:
        pylist = ast.literal_eval(line)
        print(pylist)
</code></pre>
