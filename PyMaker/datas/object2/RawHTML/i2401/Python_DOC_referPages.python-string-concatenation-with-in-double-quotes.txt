<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I am using Python and reading values from properties file as shown below,</p>
<pre><code>print config.get('DeviceSection', 'Device1.name');
d1=config.get('DeviceSection', 'Device1.name') 
print d1
</code></pre>
<p>My JSON is</p>
<pre><code>{
    "device-id":"system",
    "open-config":{  
        "port":32767
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now, I want to set device-id with the value i was getting from config file. 
What I tried was,</p>
<pre><code>{
    "device-id":"+d1+",
    "open-config":{  
        "port":32767
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>But value of <code>d1</code> is not substituting inside the string. Any idea what I am missing?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>That isn't a concatenation: you're not appending this to anything else.  It's only a value substitution.  Thus, you should (1) use the variable name, rather than a string; (2) leave out the concatenation attempt.</p>
<pre><code>     "device-id": d1,
</code></pre>
<p>This should substitute the desired value of <em>varibale</em> <code>d1</code>.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Thats not how strings work in python. You could do <code>"device-id":d1,.....</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Actually i came from java back ground and searching for python help.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It is better to read <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str" rel="nofollow noreferrer">official docs</a> before asking here and then maybe referencing to it what you can not understand.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Ammad thats cool. just letting you know thats not how they work. My other comment and the answer posted show how you can do what you're after</span>
