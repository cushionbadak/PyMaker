<p>I'm a beginner with python so you can think that am i asking a stupid question, but i really can't understand why mine function is removing previous data in csvfile instead of adding new in to this file. That's how it looks like:</p>
<pre><code>def writein():
    with open('employee data.csv', 'w') as employeeData:
        writeby = csv.writer(employeeData, delimiter = ',')
        writeNEN = input('Add name of new emp: \n')
        writeNESN = input('Add surname of new emp: \n')
        writeNEP = input('Add position of new emp: \n')
        writeNEBD = input('Add date of birth of new emp: \n')
        writeby.writerow([writeNEN, writeNESN, writeNEP, writeNEBD])
</code></pre>
<p>Have you guys any idea how to make program adding new data instead of replacing it?</p>

<p>When you open a file in write-mode (i.e. <code>open('file.txt', 'w')</code>), the contents are cleared before things are added. The fix to your problem would be to open the csv file in append-mode:</p>
<pre><code>def writein():
    with open('employee data.csv', 'a') as employeeData:
                             #      ^
                             # a for append
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Use the below code
<code>with open('employee data.csv', 'a')</code></p>
<p>parameter 'a' instructs to append. </p>
