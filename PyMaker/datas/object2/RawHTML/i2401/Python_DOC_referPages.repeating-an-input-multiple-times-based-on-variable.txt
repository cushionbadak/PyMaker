<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>So I'm new to python and having a complete mental block as to how I can elegantly repeat this input for the product name based on the value of num_qc.</p>
<p>So for example if num_qc = 4
I would want the user to enter nam_prod1, nam_prod2 etc... 
As far as my understanding goes, I wouldnt want to pre-define these variables as the user could only enter 1 for num_qc or 50?</p>
<pre><code>#report info
num_qc = input('Total QC open: ')
nam_prod = num_qc  * input('Name of unit %s: ' % num_qc)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>you have to use a for loop or another <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_for_loops.asp" rel="nofollow noreferrer">loop cycle</a> ,
what you want is:</p>
<pre><code>num_qc = int(input('Total QC open: '))
for x in range(0,num_qc):
    nam_prod = input('Name of unit %s: ' % (x+1))
</code></pre>
<p>the name_prod variable will be overwritten with each cycle,
you can use a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">list</a>:</p>
<pre><code>num_qc = int(input('Total QC open: '))
nam_prod = []
for x in range(0,num_qc):
        nam_prod.append(input('Name of unit %s: ' % (x+1)))
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">I am needing to keep each variable so the second code block will keep the variable? I intend to write this information to a txt file or excel at the end of the program</span>
<span class="comment-copy">of course, each data will have its own index in the list, with which you can read it (es. nam_prod[0], nam_prod[1], nam_prod[2], ....   )  you can use a loop cycle to read all the list. look at the link to learn more about the lists <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html</a></span>
