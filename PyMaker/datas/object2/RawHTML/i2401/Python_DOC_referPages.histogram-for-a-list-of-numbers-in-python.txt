<p>What is wrong with my numbers?</p>

<p>You used the function <code>input</code>. This function is meant for getting user input. It can only take 1 or 2 parameters. So in other words you are using it wrong.</p>
<p>What you want to store your data in is probably a list like this:
<code>numbers = [1,2,6,23,5]</code></p>
<p>You can fill up that list with multiple separate <code>input</code>calls. Or just use the list as it is, if you do not really need user input.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Here are two examples of the different methods you are combining, choose one or the other    </p>
<pre><code>numbers = input("Enter numbers: ").split(',')
bins = int(input("Enter bin: "))

print(numbers)
print(bins)
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>(xenial)vash@localhost:~/python/stack_overflow$ python3.7 league.py
Enter numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
Enter bin: 4
['1', ' 2', ' 3', ' 4', ' 5']
4
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
bins = 4

print(numbers)
print(bins)
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
4
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>After speaking and touching your code it should look like this :</p>
<pre><code>import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 
import tkinter

def histogram(numbers,bins): 
    for i in numbers:
        try: 
            numbers=list(map(float,numbers)) 
            plt.title("Histogram") 
            plt.xlabel("Value") 
            plt.ylabel("Frequency") 
            plt.show() 
            plt.close('all') 
        except: 
            print('Please Input Numbers Only') 

numbers = input("Enter numbers: ").split(',')
bins =  int(input("Enter bins: "))
histogram(numbers, bins) 
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Still not good, please type in your code so we can copy it. A image is making this harder as it needs to be.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The answer to your question is in <code>help(input)</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">There is many issues here, you are using <code>input</code> incorrectly, there is a way to enter all those numbers using <code>input().split(',')</code> but if you are typing them into your code there is no need for <code>input</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">You should start with something like <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/tutorial</a>  - you are using python the wrong way. SO does not teach you a language, it is no tutorial-site. This <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/index.html</a> is a good starting point for API searches if you try to understand new commands...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I am sorry I forgot to mention that there was a function that I run first to load : def histogram(numbers,bins):     numbers=numbers.split(',')     try:         numbers=list(map(float,numbers))         import matplotlib.pyplot as plt         plt.hist(numbers,bins)         plt.title("Histogram")         plt.xlabel("Value")         plt.ylabel("Frequency")         plt.show()         plt.close('all')     except:         print('Please Input Numbers Only')</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That's okay the issue is revolving around your <code>input</code> process if you just fix your <code>input</code> by selecting either/or of the above methods you will be able to pass those values into <code>histogram(numbers bins)</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for telling me that! But I just get a bunch of numbers instead of the histogram</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I uploaded a full code, I don't use histogram or matlib but this will run, and will open a histogram, after that you are on your own sorry bud :/ but this will get you moving , cheers :)</span>
