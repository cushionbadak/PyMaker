<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Is it possible to use assertRaises with multiple types of exceptions. Some thing like</p>
<pre><code>assertRaises(RuntimeError, "error message")
assertRaises(Exception, "exception message")
</code></pre>
<p>both these errors occur in my code at different places with the same call.</p>
<p>How can I write a singel assertRaises statement to handle both. </p>
<p>As you can imagine the unit test case fails when only one of the execptions is mentioned.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Straight from the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestCase.assertRaises" rel="noreferrer">docs</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Test that an exception is raised when callable is called with any
  positional or keyword arguments that are also passed to
  assertRaises(). The test passes if exception is raised, is an error if
  another exception is raised, or fails if no exception is raised. <strong>To
  catch any of a group of exceptions, a tuple containing the exception
  classes may be passed as exception.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, your code should look like </p>
<pre><code>assertRaises((RuntimeError, IndexError), "error message")
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">It suggests to me that there is too much code within the test method, and this should be split to 2 different tests.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This doesn't really make sense. A single call can only result in one single exception, because when it is raised the code will exit.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">A catch block can catch multiple exceptions but logically only exception would be raised and during testing that would be tested.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@wim the flow tested by the case can cause error at two different places, so if one is caught the other can still come from the other point. I think these situations are common.</span>
