<p>I just installed python on VS Code and I can't run any python code using <code>python</code> command.</p>
<h2>python command:</h2>
<p>It seems to use the <code>python</code> command by default and it does not recognize it.</p>
<p>When I right click and choose <code>Run Code</code> it complains:</p>
<p><code>'python' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file</code></p>
<p>Same goes for manually running <code>python main.py</code>.</p>
<p>When I open an elevated PowerShell and run <code>python</code>, it complains:</p>
<pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"><code>python : The term 'python' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program.
Check the spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path is correct and try again.

    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : CommandNotFoundException
</code></pre>
<h2>py command:</h2>
<p>It doesn't try to use <code>py</code> command but it recognizes it. <strong>And when I manually call <code>py main.py</code>, it works</strong>.</p>
<p>When I manually do <code>&gt;py main.py</code> it writes my <code>Goodbye, World!</code></p>
<h2>Question:</h2>
<p>How can I make it compile/run in VS Code simply by using the CodeRunner's right-click feature (<code>Run Code</code>)?</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>I already have both Python folder and its Scripts folder in PATH.</em></p>
<p>I'm using <code>VS Code 1.27.2</code> and I have installed <code>python 3.7.0</code> on my machine and have checked its installer checkbox for adding the environment variables automatically. (PATH is ok)</p>
<p>I also installed : <code>ms-python.python</code> and <code>tht13.python</code> and <code>formulahendry.code-runner</code> extensions on the VS Code.</p>
<hr/>
<p>This is my <code>main.py</code> code:</p>
<pre><code>print("Goodbye, World!")
</code></pre>

<p>The Windows installer for Python does not put <code>python</code> on your path by default (there's a checkbox during installation to add it). Make sure that you selected an interpreter that's installed by running <code>Select Interpreter</code> and choosing the interpreter you want (the extension will find them through the registry).</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>It turned out that I just had to <strong>restart my computer</strong> after I installed <code>ms-python.python</code> and <code>tht13.python</code> and <code>formulahendry.code-runner</code> extensions on the VS Code and added python's <code>Scripts</code> folder in <code>PATH</code>.</p>
<p>Now both <code>py</code> and <code>python</code> commands work from anywhere like <code>cmd</code> or <code>Run Code</code> in the right click menu.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">What happens if you call <code>python main.py</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@martineau it says <code>'python' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">That sounds like Python isn't installed correctly. This is strange because if <code>py</code> works, so should <code>python</code>. Have you read <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Using Python on Windows</a>? You may need to manually run one or more command-line utilities to get the registry set up correctly. Although it's a bit dated, see <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/5586761/355230">this</a> answer I once wrote for an example of what I am talking about.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@martineau I found the problem, it needed a restart, but thanks for the useful information</span>
<span class="comment-copy">in my version of python, it didn't provide that option, it turned out the problem was a restart issue, but thanks for the info</span>
