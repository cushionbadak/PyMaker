<p>I've written a sort in Python2, I'm trying to convert it into Python3 which asks for a key and says no more cmp function is available :</p>
<pre><code>test.sort(lambda x, y: cmp(x[2],y[2]) or cmp(x[4], y[4]) or cmp(y[9], x[9]))
</code></pre>
<p>Any advices ?</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The official python 3 documentation <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/sorting.html#the-old-way-using-the-cmp-parameter" rel="nofollow noreferrer">explains in this section</a> the proper way of converting this from python 2 to 3.</p>
<p>The original <code>cmp</code> function simply does something like</p>
<pre><code>def cmp(x, y):
   if x == y:
       return 0
   elif x &gt; y:
       return 1
   else:
       return -1
</code></pre>
<p>That is, it's equivalent to <code>sign(x-y)</code>, but also supports strings and other data types.</p>
<p>However, your problem is that the current function of <code>sort</code> doesn't work with a comparison function with two arguments, but with a single <code>key</code> function of one argument. Python provides <code>functools.cmp_to_key</code> to help you convert it, so, do something like</p>
<pre><code>test.sort(key = functools.cmp_to_key(
    lambda x, y: cmp(x[2],y[2]) or cmp(x[4], y[4]) or cmp(y[9], x[9])
)) 
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Purely out of curiosity - what's that sort supposed to do? You're always going to end up with whatever the last comparison of elements 2, 4 or 9 aren't equal (either -1 or 1) or just 0 for equal... at the end... that seems almost randomly sorting to me. I have a feeling that's not a sort you wanted even if you could use it... are you sure what you're after as a key isn't just <code>key=lambda L: (L[2], L[4], L[9])</code> so you get some sort of "order" there?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">There are two separate problems here: 1) Finding a replacement for the <code>cmp</code> function, and 2) Making the <code>sort</code> work with a <code>key=</code> function. Those two separate problems have two separate answers, so in the future please ask about each problem individually.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What's the structure of <code>test</code>? Eg, is it a list of lists, or a list of tuples?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">test is created into a loop like that :  test.append((id, sexe, nom, prenom, date_naissance, telephone, sejour_id, etat, type, valeur))</span>
