<p>I'v done a code challenge and one of the extras was write a line of code that prints the previous result (which I have done)</p>
<pre><code>print(str(year)*int(number))
</code></pre>
<p>but it also says to put a line break between each returned value.
So for example the var 'year' returns an int and that int gets printed a certain
amount of times depending on what the users input is.</p>
<p>I just can't figure out where the '\n' will go in this line of code.</p>
<pre><code> print(str(year)*int(number)) 
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You could use a simple loop:</p>
<pre><code>for _ in range(number):
    print(year)
</code></pre>
<p>This will insert the <code>\n</code> by default - as each print is a seperate command and the default <code>end=\n</code> parameter to print applies.</p>
<p>Patrick Haugh beat me by 50sec to use the print-commands parameter <code>sep</code> that lets you specify what to put between printed values: </p>
<pre><code>print(1,2,3,4,sep="\n") 
</code></pre>
<p>This prints a newline between each of the numbers - by default it prints a single space.</p>
<p>You could put the collected numbers in a list, decomposit the list in its element and print them with a \n seperator:</p>
<pre><code>year = 18
number= 3
print( *[year]*number ,sep="\n")
</code></pre>

<p>You can print a separator character between separate arguments to <code>print</code> that will appear between them instead of a space</p>
<pre><code>print('a', 'b', sep='\n')
</code></pre>
<p>We can use argument unpacking to provide <code>number</code> many arguments to <code>print</code>, and separate them with <code>'\n'</code></p>
<pre><code>year = 2000
number = 5
print(*[year]*number, sep='\n')
</code></pre>
<p>prints</p>
<pre><code>2000
2000
2000
2000
2000

<span class="comment-copy">Where did you try to put it? What did not work? A -returned- value, is something different then a printed value.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">just print the year in a loop? its unclear exactly what you're looking for.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Are you restricted to editing the line you've given, or are you allowed to write it differently?</span>
