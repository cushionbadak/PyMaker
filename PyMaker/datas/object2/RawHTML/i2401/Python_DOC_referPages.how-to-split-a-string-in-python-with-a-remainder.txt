<p>In python3 I have e.g. the following string</p>
<pre><code> 433 65040    9322 /opt/conda/envs/python2/bin/python -m ipykernel_launcher 
</code></pre>
<p>which I want to split in four parts: the first three elements (the numbers) and the remainder as one string. Of course its possible to do it the following way:</p>
<pre><code>text = " 433 65040    9322 /opt/conda/envs/python2/bin/python -m ipykernel_launcher"
pid,rss,etime,*remainder = text.split()
cmd = ' '.join(remainder)
</code></pre>
<p>but maybe there is a more pythonic way to do that?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.split" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>split</code></a> with the <code>maxsplit</code> parameter:</p>
<pre><code>text = " 433 65040    9322 /opt/conda/envs/python2/bin/python -m ipykernel_launcher"
text.strip().split(maxsplit=3)  # max 3 splits
# ['433', '65040', '9322', '/opt/conda/envs/python2/bin/python -m ipykernel_launcher']
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">you could consider using <a href="https://psutil.readthedocs.io/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">psutil.readthedocs.io</a> . that does not help with string splitting but with process info in python...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I don't think that is a good duplicate for this question, that is not what the OP is asking</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Its pythonic already.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@CoryKramer Isn't it? As I see it, it's exactly the same question with <code>maxsplit=1</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Now that I think about it yeah you're right that's a good solution, but with <code>maxsplit=3</code>, then that would do the trick</span>
