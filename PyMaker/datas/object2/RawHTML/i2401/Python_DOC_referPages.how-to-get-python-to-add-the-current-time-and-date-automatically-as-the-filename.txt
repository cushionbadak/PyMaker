<p>I am trying to get python to automatically add the current time and date as a filename after it finishes with running the report its designed to.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Get current date from <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">datetime</a> module using <code>datetime.date.today()</code>, use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#strftime-strptime-behavior" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>strftime()</code></a> to parse it to your required format and add it to your filename string.</p>
<pre><code>import datetime
filename = 'XYZ Report {0}.txt'
current_date = datetime.date.today().strftime('%d %b %Y')
filename = filename.format(current_date)
# filename = XYZ Report 19 Sep 2018.txt
with open(filename) as file_obj:
# File writing logic

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<h1>Answer is:</h1>
<pre><code>    import time
    import xlwt
    import csv

    date_string = time.strftime("%Y%m%d %H.%M")
</code></pre>
<h3>if saving to CSV document</h3>
<pre><code>    data_output = []
    with open('C:\\Users\\Desktop\\File Name' + date_string + '.csv', 'a+') as f:

<h3>if saving to Excel document</h3>
<pre><code>    df.to_excel('C:\\Users\\Desktop\\File Name' + date_string + '.xlsx')

<span class="comment-copy">Have you tried anything yet?  It should be simple to generate a time stamp string.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I have been trying...I got it to save the report as soon as the report is finished but I need to add the name of the folder, which should be something like - XYZ Report 19 Sept 2018...that bit I cant figure</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The problem is adding the current date automatically to the file name once the report had finished and before its saved</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Post your code please, it will help us help you</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The call to <code>format</code> isn't strictly necessary; you could just define <code>filename</code> directly with <code>filename = datetime.date.today().strftime('XYZ Report %d %b %Y.txt')</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Alternatively, you can pass the <code>date</code> object directly to <code>format</code>, skipping the call to <code>strftime</code>: <code>"XYZ Report {0:%b %d %Y}.txt".format(datetime.date.today())</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">perfect...thank you</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Please Explain more  about your answer and code</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I wanted to have a datafile to be saved after my script finished running in a way that it was easy to identify the file and contect. I run my script a few times a day yielding different outputs. This way I can have  an automatic filing system. Hope this helps</span>
