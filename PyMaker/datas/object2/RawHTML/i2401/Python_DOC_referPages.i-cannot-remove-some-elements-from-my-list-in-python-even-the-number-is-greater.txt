<p>I have this list : <code>l = [2, 8, 1, 9, 11, 12, 3]</code>. I want to remove elements that is greater than 5 in my list. </p>
<p>My code look like this:</p>
<pre><code>l = [2, 8, 1, 9, 11, 12, 3]
for x in l:
    if x &gt; 5:
        l.remove(x)
print(l)
</code></pre>
<p>But I am getting output as : <code>[2, 1, 11, 3]</code>
I am using anaconda IDE. Please refer to image for more detail. </p>

<p>As said in the comments, it's not the safest way to do it. Try this instead:</p>
<pre><code>l = [2, 8, 1, 9, 11, 12, 3]
m =[]
for x in l:
    if x &lt;= 5:
        m.append(x)
print(m)
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>[2, 1, 3]
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">You should not be altering the list length while iterating over it. Instead you should build a new list with the items you want to keep</span>
<span class="comment-copy">you are removing elements from the list you are iterating over! that is rarely a good idea! have a look at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html?highlight=comprehension#list-comprehensions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">list comprehensions</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">A side note, Anaconda is not an IDE. It is a distribution of Python. Spyder is the IDE that comes with Anaconda.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The funny thing is that this question is a duplicate of a question that is a duplicate of a question that is a duplicate of a question XD</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@SembeiNorimaki yep, this particular dupe is pretty circular. I just go for one that I think is a decent starting point in the loop. IIRC I did find the bottom of the spiral and it wasn't particularly great, better to start somewhere higher up and the OP can work their way through</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>m = [n for n in l if n &lt;= 5]</code> seems way more pythonic...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">you're right, somehow I thought of correcting OP's code only</span>
