<p>I have a simple pythono code that parses json file and returns it as dictionary. I have to write this in to CSV file but only with the LF as a line terminator. However, Carriage return appears anyway even using newline=''. wb mode is not an option as i receive this error </p>
<p><strong>return self.writer.writerow(self._dict_to_list(rowdict))
TypeError: a bytes-like object is required, not 'str'</strong></p>
<p>My code for CSV writing:</p>
<pre><code>with open(statsFilePath,'w+', newline='', encoding='utf8') as f:
  writer = csv.DictWriter(f, header , delimiter = '|')
  for row in result:
    writer.writerow(row)
</code></pre>
<p>And here is the screenshot of what i see in Notepad++</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE, SOLVED</strong></p>
<p>The DictWriter used the default line terminator. Changing the code to this, solved the issue:</p>
<pre><code>with open(statsFilePath,'w+', newline='', encoding='utf8') as f:
    writer = csv.DictWriter(f, header , delimiter = '|', lineterminator="\n")
    for row in result:
        writer.writerow(row)  
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The csv <code>Dialect</code> decides which line terminator to use and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.Dialect.lineterminator" rel="nofollow noreferrer">by default it is <code>\r\n</code></a>.</p>
<p>You need to specify <code>lineterminator</code> when defining the writer:</p>
<pre><code>writer = csv.DictWriter(f, header , delimiter = '|', lineterminator='\n')
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Try this:</p>
<pre><code>with open(statsFilePath,'w+', newline='\n', encoding='utf8') as f:
</code></pre>
<p>Please remember that <code>LF</code> is probably not what you are looking for. You are looking for <code>CR</code> as your line separator (UNIX's default).</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Your answer is right, but posted just a minute after i found it, Thank You anyway!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Unfortunately, tried \n as well and got the same result</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Note that a value of <code>\n</code> does <b>not</b> mean that only LF will be used in the output. It is equivalent to just the empty string <code>''</code> and it means that <i>no translation is performed</i>. This means that if the strings you write contain <code>\r\n</code> then it will write <code>\r\n</code> instead of <code>\n</code>. It is possible that <code>DictWriter</code> uses <code>os.linesep</code> by default which would cause what the OP is describing?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">BTW: CR is not used by linux nor by MacOS. They both use LF i.e. <code>\n</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">You are right, DictWriter used default linesep, just found that I can change it using "lineterminator". Thank You</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@AlexShangin I just found that out too and took the time to post an answer. Why did you accept an answer that was not useful in this situation?</span>
