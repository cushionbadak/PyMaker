<p>In Python3, if we want to print all elements in a list, we can simply do </p>
<pre><code>lst = ['a','b', 'c']
print(lst)
</code></pre>
<p>In this way, we can print out all elements in a list. 
Suppose now I use logging to log everything, instead of print it out to the screen, for a debug purpose, how to log all elements in a container ( i.e list, or tuple) ?</p>
<p>I can think of something like :</p>
<pre><code>for it in lst:
     log.info("element is {i}".format(i = it))
</code></pre>
<p>but this is too ugly. Any suggestion?</p>
<p>I also refer <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Howto</a> , but did not get much input.</p>

<p>I have figured out. Yes, just like@Patrick Haugh said, we can just use <code>loog.info(lst)</code> to log all elements in the list, just works similarly to <code>print</code>.</p>
<p>Thank you all!</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Is it the code that you consider too ugly, or the log message that's produced?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">what about <code>log.info("element is {}".format(",".join(map(str,lst))))</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">The <code>print</code> example outputs the entire list, the <code>log</code> example outputs each element. Which do you need?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What's wrong with <code>log.info(lst)</code>?</span>
