<p>I'm trying to scrape reviews from a website and store them to a csv using Python (3.7) &amp; BeautifulSoup.  It seems the scrape is successful, but when I write to the file, only one column contains full data, and the rest just the first character.</p>
<p>Any hints would be greatly appreciated, and sorry if it's glaringly obvious - it's a fresh hobby :)</p>
<pre><code>from urllib.request import urlopen as uReq
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup as soup

#URL to scrape
my_url = "https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Capital-One/reviews?fcountry=ALL&amp;lang="

#open connection, grab page
uClient = uReq(my_url)
page_html = uClient

#html parsing
page_soup = soup(page_html, "lxml")

#grab all reviews on page
containers = page_soup.findAll("div",{"cmp-review-container"})
uClient.close()
#write to csv
filename = "indeedreviewtest.csv"
f=open(filename, "w")

headers = "review_id, review_score, role, review_text\n"

f.write(headers)

#loop through each review, collect review ID, rating, role &amp; verbatum
for container in containers:
    reviewid_container = container.div["data-tn-entityid"]
    reviewid = reviewid_container[0]
    score_container = container.div.div.div.meta["content"]
    reviewscore = score_container[0]
    role_container = container.find("span", attrs={"class":"cmp-reviewer- job-title"}).text
    reviewerrole = role_container[0]
    reviewtext_container = container.find("span", attrs={"class":"cmp-review-text"}).text
    reviewtext = reviewtext_container

    f.write(reviewid + "," + reviewscore + "," + reviewerrole.replace(",", "|") + "," + reviewtext.replace(",", "|") + "\n")

f.close()

<p>Thanks!</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Maybe you mixed up <code>find()</code> and <code>findAll()</code>.</p>
<p><code>find()</code> stops when finding the first element which matches the criteria, while <code>findAll()</code> brings all of them. </p>
<p>By using <code>role_container[0]</code> you're getting the first character from that element text.</p>
<p>You can try just:</p>
<pre><code>reviewerrole = container.find("span", attrs={"class":"cmp-reviewer-job-title"}).text
reviewtext = container.find("span", attrs={"class":"cmp-review-text"}).text
</code></pre>
<p>Besides that, consider using the <code>csv</code> module for reading/writing CSV files. More info:<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.writer" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.writer</a></p>
