<p>I want to call a webservice from a Databricks Notebook through Python. The needed library for this seems to be http.client.</p>
<p>I have already found a code snippet to test this but when i try to execute it i get the following error:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ImportError: No module named http.client</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is correct cause i have no module installed yet.</p>
<p>In the next step i go to a folder within my Databricks, select Import -&gt; Import Notebooks dialog click on <code>(To import a library, such as a jar or egg, click here)</code> -&gt; Select in the <code>Language</code> DropDown <code>Upload Python Egg or PyPI -&gt; in pyPI name type</code>http.client` and click on Install Library.</p>
<p>Then i select <code>Attach automatically to all clusters</code>.</p>
<p>I receive the following error:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Error: java.lang.RuntimeException: Installation failed with message:

  that satisfies the requirement http.client (from versions: ) No
  matching distribution found for http.client You are using pip version
  9.0.1, however version 18.0 is available. You should consider upgrading via the 'pip install --upgrade pip' command. Could not find

<p>How can i fix this?</p>
