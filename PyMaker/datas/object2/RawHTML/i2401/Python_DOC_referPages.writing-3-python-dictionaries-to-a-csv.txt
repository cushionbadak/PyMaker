<p>My current approach is to write them into 3 different csv files and then merging them,I want to merge them according to a common first row(ID_row).
But I am unable to figure out how to merge 3 csv files into a single csv file. Also , Is there any way which I can write all the 3 dictionaries into a single csv without writing them individually.</p>
<p>Output required-</p>

<p>You can merge them all first, then write them to a csv file:</p>

<p>I suggest you to transform your three dicts into one list of dicts before write it to a csv file.</p>
<p>Example</p>
<pre><code>rows = [
    {"Score_Id": "...", "Post_Id": "...", "Comment_Id": "..."},
    {"Score_Id": "...", "Post_Id": "...", "Comment_Id": "..."},
    {"Score_Id": "...", "Post_Id": "...", "Comment_Id": "..."},
    ...
]
</code></pre>
<p>And then use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.DictWriter" rel="nofollow noreferrer">csv.DictWriter</a> class to write all the rows.</p>
<p>Since you have commas in your values (are you sure it's a good behaviour? Maybe splitting them in two different columns could be a better approach), be careful to use tabs or something else as separator        </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I suggest writing all three to the same file</p>
<p>You could get common keys by doing something like:</p>
<pre><code>common_keys = set(score_dict.keys()+post_dict.keys()+comment_dict.keys())
for key_ in common_keys:
    val_score = score_dict.get(key_, some_default_value)
    post_score = post_dict.get(key_, some_default_value)
    comment_score = comment_dict.get(key_, some_default_value)
    # print key and vals to csv as before

<span class="comment-copy">Okay,I am able to form a single dictionary from it, Now will writing to a csv will be same as writing any other dictionary,Also is this the best approach to do it as I am new to this and I don't have any before experience with it</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'd suggest that getting your data correct in python first, for instance by doing merging, is a preferable approach than adjusting it after in csv files. YMMV though.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Could you tell me how to write it into csv as what I am getting a dictionary of dictionary after using this.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What format do you need the data in?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Maybe I'll just cut to the chase slightly; I'm not going to write <i>all</i> of your code for you. You presumably already have a way of writing csv files, so all you need to do is take the data in the format it is here, and put it into the format you need</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes,I am not sure what's the correct approach as I am new to this and still developing my thinking over it, any leads on how to tackle such kind of problems would be appreciated</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Okay,I got the keys ,Now how to proceed further like how to write further values in it and then to csv</span>
