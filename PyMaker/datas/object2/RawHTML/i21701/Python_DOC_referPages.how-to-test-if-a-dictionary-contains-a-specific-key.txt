<p>What's the cleanest way to test if a dictionary contains a key?</p>
<pre><code>x = {'a' : 1, 'b' : 2}
if (x.contains_key('a')):
    ....
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>'a' in x

<span class="comment-copy">@Steven - I believe duplicates are helpful, because they make this question easier to find. I did search before I posted, and didn't find what I'm looking for.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ripper234: This closed question will indeed make it easier for future searches to find the answered question, but that doesn't make the question all that valuable in and of itself.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Steven - "all that valuable" - valuable enough not to get -1 votes, even if not valuable enough for +1. That's just IMHO of course, you're free to vote as you wish :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@StevenRumbalski "you didn't search hard enough" -- why do you want to make people search harder?  I vote for easier searching over harder searching every time.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It may be obvious to some, but you can use this with <code>if 'a' in x:</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>'a' in x</code> or <code>'a' not in x</code> is good.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ripper234 just came across this and it helped a lot, but I was wondering - are you able to accept the answer now, 4.5yrs later?:) Or it can't be marked anymore due to the duplicate label?</span>
