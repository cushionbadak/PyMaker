<p>This is two questions really:</p>
<ul>
<li>how do I resize a curses window, and</li>
<li>how do I deal with a terminal resize in curses?</li>
</ul>
<p>Is it possible to know when a window has changed size?</p>
<p>I really can't find any good doc, not even covered on <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/curses.html" rel="noreferrer">http://docs.python.org/library/curses.html</a></p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Terminal resize event will result in the <code>curses.KEY_RESIZE</code> key code. Therefore you can handle terminal resize as part of a standard main loop in a curses program, waiting for input with <code>getch</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I got my python program to re-size the terminal by doing a couple of things.</p>
<pre><code># Initialize the screen
import curses

screen = curses.initscr()

# Check if screen was re-sized (True or False)
resize = curses.is_term_resized(y, x)

# Action in loop if resize is True:
if resize is True:
    y, x = screen.getmaxyx()
    screen.clear()
    curses.resizeterm(y, x)
    screen.refresh()
</code></pre>
<p>As I'm writing my program I can see the usefulness of putting my screen into it's own class with all of these functions defined so all I have to do is call <code>Screen.resize()</code> and it would take care of the rest.</p>

<p>It isn't right.  It's an <code>ncurses-only</code> extension.  The question asked about <code>curses</code>.  To do this in a standards-conforming way you need to trap <code>SIGWINCH</code> yourself and arrange for the screen to be redrawn.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">This is right, but only when ncurses is compiled with --enable-sigwinch. In particular, the libncurses in Debian and Ubuntu doesn't have that turned on; I'm not sure why.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@thepaul: at least in my Ubuntu 12.04 I do get <code>curses.KEY_RESIZE</code> code when I resize the terminal emulator window.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Good, I'm glad they fixed that.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Could you add whatever is needed to make this code self-contained?  For example I'm not sure what "screen" is.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@DonHatch Hopefully that is what you are looking for.  Here is a good little tutorial also if you are wanting it. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/curses.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/howto/curses.html</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">He meant that your code doesn't work if you just copy and past to test it as there are many things missing.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is talking about Python's curses library which actually wraps the ncurses library.</span>
