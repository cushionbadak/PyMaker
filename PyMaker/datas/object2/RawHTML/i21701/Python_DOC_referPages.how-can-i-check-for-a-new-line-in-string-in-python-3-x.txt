<p>How to check for a new line in a string?</p>
<p>Does python3.x have anything similar to java's regular operation where direct <code>if (x=='*\n')</code> would have worked?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you just want to check if a newline (<code>\n</code>) is present, you can just use Python's <code>in</code> operator to check if it's in a string:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; "\n" in "hello\ngoodbye"
True
</code></pre>
<p>... or as part of an <code>if</code> statement:</p>
<pre><code>if "\n" in foo:
    print "There's a newline in variable foo"
</code></pre>
<p>You don't need to use regular expressions in this case.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Yes, like this:</p>
<pre><code>if '\n' in mystring:
    ...
</code></pre>
<p>(Python does have regular expressions, but they're overkill in this case.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A manner of interpreting text streams in which all of the following are recognized as ending a line: the Unix end-of-line convention '\n', the Windows convention '\r\n', and the old Macintosh convention '\r'. See PEP 278 and PEP 3116, as well as str.splitlines() for an additional use.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I hate to be the one to split hairs over this (pun intended), but this suggests that a sufficient test would be:</p>
<pre><code>if '\n' in mystring or '\r' in mystring:
    ...
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">I was hoping for solutions to checking for <i>any</i> kind of newline not just unix style.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">note: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.splitlines" rel="nofollow noreferrer">there are multiple Unicode characters that may be recognized as newlines</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ThorSummoner: Python uses universal newline mode by default i.e., platform-specific newline such as <code>'\r\n'</code>  is translated to <code>'\n'</code> on input and in reverse <code>'\n'</code> is translated to <code>os.linesep</code> on output. If you don't care about Unicode newlines; <code>'\n'</code> is all you need in most cases.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">as a complement if you want to know if the string ends with '\n' you should do if "\n" == foo[-1]</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you. It worked.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@XavierCombelle: <code>foo.endswith('\n')</code> is more readable.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@J.F.Sebastian you are right</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yeah i realized when u read the doc..</span>
