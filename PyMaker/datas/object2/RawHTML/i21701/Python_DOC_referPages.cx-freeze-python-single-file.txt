<p>I've been using cx_Freeze for a while now and there is one thing I've really wanted to do: put ALL files into ONE executable that I can distribute. It's not really user-friendly to send around a folder filled with 30 files, all in the same directory. How can I accomplish this?
Thanks.</p>

<p>Isn't this what <code>bbfreeze</code> does?</p>

<p>It's actually not that hard to roll your own with Python zipimport <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/zipimport.html" rel="nofollow">http://docs.python.org/library/zipimport.html</a></p>
<p>You may prefer to use something like UPX which is a more general solution, not Python only. <a href="http://upx.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">http://upx.sourceforge.net/</a></p>

<p>It is not supported in cx_freeze. There was discussion about it on mailing list. As I recall, the author stated that others (PyInstaller, Py2Exe) use some dirty hacks to achieve that. Some anti-virus programs can consider that behavior as a virus also.</p>
<p>I used PyInstaller for some time, but went back to cx_freeze because of Python 2.7 support. I pack everything using <a href="http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php">Inno Setup</a>, so it is easy to distribute. Depends if you use Windows or not.</p>

<p>You can use 'bdist_msi' instead of 'build'. This will create a dist folder in the directory with a <strong>single setup application</strong>.</p>

<p>According to the <a href="https://cx-freeze.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html#single-file-executables" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>cx_Freeze does not support building a single file exe, where all of the libraries for your application are embedded in one executable file.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The documentation gives some options to obtain a single file.</p>
<p>A further option under Windows is to use the <code>bdist_msi</code> command to create a single Microsoft Installer file (<code>.msi</code>) for your application, as mentioned by @QuaziRabbi. This command has few <code>cx_Freeze</code>-specific options documented <a href="https://cx-freeze.readthedocs.io/en/latest/distutils.html#bdist-msi" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a> to customize the installer. This command overloads the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/distutils/apiref.html#module-distutils.command.bdist_msi" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>bdist_msi</code></a> command of the <code>distutils</code> package which itself brings some more options to customize the installer. The available options are not documented, one need to look at the source code of the <code>distutils</code> package. Interesting examples are <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/15734703/8516269">Use cx-freeze to create an msi that adds a shortcut to the desktop</a> and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/51656310/8516269">cx_freeze bdist_msi: create registry entries?</a></p>
<p>Another option is to use another tool to create a more customizable single-file installer for the frozen application after the <code>cx_Freeze</code> build step. The script-based tool <a href="https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Main_Page" rel="nofollow noreferrer">NSIS (Nullsoft Scriptable Install System)</a> allows one to create a very customizable installer and the use of a script means that this step can be completely automatized. @Fenisko's answers mentions another tool, and there are many more.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">PyInstaller does this. I'd like to know how to do it with cx_freeze as well.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'd never heard of PyInstaller, and it looks awesome! Thanks for the suggestion.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Could you maybe put a little more effort into this answer?  No summary of how to do it, not even a link to <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/bbfreeze" rel="nofollow noreferrer">pypi.python.org/pypi/bbfreeze</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Unfortunately <code>bbfreeze</code> does not support Python3.</span>
