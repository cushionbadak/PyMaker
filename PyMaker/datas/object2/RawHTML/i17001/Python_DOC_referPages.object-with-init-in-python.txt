<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have written some python code:</p>
<pre><code>class key(object):
    def __init__(self,name):
        object.__init__(self,age)
        this.name = name
        this.age = age

    def somefunction(self):
        print "yay the name is %d" % self.name

baby = key('radan',20)
baby.somefunction()
</code></pre>
<p>When I create an instance of <code>key</code> with <code>baby = key('radan',20)</code>, I got a TypeError. I don't know why I am getting this error. Is it because of <code>object.__init__(self,age)</code>?</p>
<p>If yes, please help me in explaining why we use <code>object.__init__(self,age)</code> and what the purpose of that is and help me solve this code.</p>

<p>Your code contains several errors:</p>
<pre><code>class key(object):
    def __init__(self, name, age): # where's your age?
        self.name = name  # no need to call object.__init__
        self.age = age    # there is no such thing called "this", use self

    def somefunction(self):
        print "yay the name is %s" % self.name  # use %s as the comment says

baby = key('radan', 20)
baby.somefunction()
</code></pre>
<p>output:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; baby = key('radan', 20)
&gt;&gt;&gt; baby.somefunction()
yay the name is radan

<p>Some pointers:</p>
<pre><code>class Key(object): # in Python, classes are usually named with a starting capital

    def __init__(self, name, age): # name all your arguments beside self

        self.name = name # use self.name, not this.name
        self.age = age

    def somefunction(self):

        print "yay the name is %s" % self.name

baby = Key('radan',20)
baby.somefunction()
# output: yay the name is radan
</code></pre>
<p>Actually, you can can name the <code>self</code> instance parameter whatever you like in Python (even <code>this</code>), but it makes the code harder to read for other people, so just use <code>self</code>.</p>
<p>You don't have to use <code>object.__init__(self, name, age)</code> here. If you remove that line and implement the changes above, your code will work just fine.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>When you do <code>baby = key('radar', 20)</code> you are actually passing <strong>three</strong> arguments: the instance, the <code>name</code> and the <code>age</code>. However your initialiser is defined to take exactly two arguments so you get a <code>TypeError</code>.</p>
<p><code>self</code> is the argument implicitly passed when referring to an instance of an object. </p>
<p>For your <code>__init__</code> function, I would just do:</p>
<pre><code>def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age
</code></pre>
<p>So we can assign the arguments passed as attributes to the current instance, conventionally called <code>self</code>.</p>
<p>It makes no sense here to call <code>object.__init__</code> at all, just remove that line.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Apart from that, everything works fine (except use <code>%s</code> instead of <code>%d</code>).</p>
<p>Testing:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; baby = key('radan', 20)
&gt;&gt;&gt; baby.somefunction()
yay the name is radan
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>%d</code> in string formatting expects a number, but <code>self.name</code> is a string... you probably want to use <code>%s</code> instead.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">i have tried it with %s too ..But i get the same error</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Oh, missed that. It makes no sense here to call <code>object.__init__</code> at all, just remove that line.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user3517846 There you go, see my answer- happy to help.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">can you tell me the use of object.__init__(self, name, age)...in which situation we use it ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">why downvote???</span>
<span class="comment-copy">can you tell me the use of object.__init__(self, name, age)...in which situation we use it ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user3517846 If your class is directly inherited from <code>object</code>, then you'll never need to call <code>object.__init__()</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">can you give me a link or something or can you please explain more its use ..in some code i have seen using object.__init__(self) ..i didnt understand its usage ..Please help me</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user3517846 After searching for a while, my answer is still "NO, there is no such usage". I think what you saw is that people are using the  word <code>object</code> to refer to general class instances, for instance you'll find it in the official doc:  <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__init__" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__init__</a>, but that doesn't mean to write <code>object.__init__(self...)</code>, it means object is an instance whatever type it is. my email is laike9m@gmail.com in case you want to know more.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">can you tell me the use of object.__init__(self, name, age)...in which situation we use it</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Maybe <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/625083/python-init-and-self-what-do-they-do">this explanation</a> will be of help to you.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">so its not necessary to use object.__init__(self, name, age) ..right ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No, that's not necessary. I don't understand why you would want to initialize <code>object</code> in the first place. Class <code>Key</code> inherits from <code>object</code> (all classes do), but there is no need to initialize <code>object</code>. <code>object</code> is what classes come from, it is the most base type of thing. When a class inherits from <code>object</code> it means it just inherits the standard special methods like <code>__init__</code>, <code>__doc__</code>, <code>__str__</code>, etc. I have yet to encounter an example where <code>object</code> is initialized the way you say, so please post the original code.</span>
