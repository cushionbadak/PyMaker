<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I was wondering if there was something inside python io, so that when a file is opened in say a+ you could set the pointer to a specific point and start writing</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>What you want is <code>f.seek(position)</code> (docs for <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#file.seek" rel="nofollow">Python2</a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.IOBase.seek" rel="nofollow">Python3</a>):</p>
<pre><code>with open('file.txt', 'a+') as f:
    f.seek(10)
    f.write("New data")
</code></pre>
<p>Here, you skip over the first 10 bytes and then write the new data. Note that there is also an optional second argument <code>whence</code> that allows you to specify whether <code>position</code> should be relative to the beginning of the file, the current location within the file, or the end of the file. See the documentation links above for more information.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">What do you mean by "specific point"? <code>a+</code> will read from the start but write to the end.</span>
