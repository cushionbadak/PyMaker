<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number" rel="nofollow">Complex numbers</a> use "i" to denote the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imaginary_unit" rel="nofollow">imaginary unit</a>.</p>
<p>Does anyone know, why <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/cmath.html" rel="nofollow">Python</a> uses "j" instead?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In some disciplines, in
  particular electromagnetism and electrical engineering, j is used
  instead of i, since i is frequently used for electric current. In
  these cases complex numbers are written as a + bj or a + jb.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The python complex number standard follows the <em>Engineering</em> standard where a <code>j</code> is used instead of an <code>i</code> to represent the square root of 1.</p>
<p>Also, check <a href="http://www.johndcook.com/blog/2013/04/23/why-j-for-imaginary-unit/" rel="nofollow">this resource</a> for an alternate explanantion.</p>
<p>It states that <code>j</code> is preferred when referring to complex numbers due to <code>i</code>'s multiple other uses which might lead to confusion.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The symbols <strong>i</strong>, <strong>j</strong>, and <strong>k</strong> are used for unit vectors in the directions of the x, y, and z axes respectively. That means that “i” has two different meanings in the real plane, depending on whether you think of it as the vector space spanned by i and j or as complex numbers. But if you use j to represent the imaginary unit, its meaning does not change. Either way it points along the y axis.</p>
<p>Said another way, bold face i and italic i point in different directions But bold face j and italic j both point in the same direction.</p>

<p>Complex numbers are a.o. heavily used in electronics for phase computations. An i denotes current there. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">Not only Python. I've seen other notations (even in books) that prefer italicized <i>j</i> to bolded <b>i</b>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Electrical engineering uses <a href="http://www.johndcook.com/blog/2013/04/23/why-j-for-imaginary-unit/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">j for imaginary units</a> too. Matlab support both <code>i</code> and <code>j</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Did you read the Imaginary Unit wiki page which you've specifically linked to in the question?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@hjpotter92 Yes. How does it specifically relate to Python?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">We <i>don't know this</i>. Don't just copy my findings from the comments and present them as if Python follows that standard deliberately.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><i>iota</i> is not <b>i</b>.</span>
