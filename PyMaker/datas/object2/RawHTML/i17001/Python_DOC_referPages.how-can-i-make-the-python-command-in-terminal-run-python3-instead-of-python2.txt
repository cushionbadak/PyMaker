<p>I'm just starting to learn Python and did search around a little, so forgive me if this has been asked and answered.</p>
<p>When running scripts through the command line/terminal, I have to type "python3" to run the latest version of Python. With Python 2.X I just use "python". </p>
<p>Is there a way to run Python 3 just using "python"? 
It may seem a little lazy, but I'm mostly just curious if it is possible or if it will break anything unnecessarily if I could in fact do it. </p>

<p>If you're using Windows then you can use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#python-launcher-for-windows" rel="noreferrer">Python Launcher For Windows</a>.</p>
<p>This will allow you to use the <code>py</code> command to select different python installations such as:</p>
<pre><code>py -2.7 # Runs Python 2.7
py -3.3 # Runs Python 3.3
py -2 # Runs the latest version of Python 2.x (so if you have 2.6 and 2.7 it will run 2.7)
</code></pre>
<p>Similarly you can set a shebang in your python files as demonstrated below:</p>
<pre><code>#! python3
print('Hello World!')
</code></pre>
<p>If you now run that file (let's call it <code>test.py</code>) with <code>py test.py</code> it will automatically run with Python 3. It gets the Python installation to use from the shebang at the beginning of the line.</p>
<p>What you probably want is to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#customizing-default-python-versions" rel="noreferrer">customise the default python version</a> though. This will allow you to set the default actions if you just call <code>py</code> on it's own.</p>

<p>If you are using Linux, add the following into into ~/.bashrc
<code>alias python=python3</code> 
Restart the shell and type python and python3 should start instead of python2.</p>

<p>Sounds like you have python 2 and 3 installed and your pythonpath is pointed at python 2, so unless specified it uses that version. If you are using python I would suggest setting up a virtual environment (virtualenv) for each project, which means you could run whatever version you'd like in that project and keep all dependencies contained.</p>

<p>Once you installed python 3 in your Mac, "python3" command will be registered into the environment variable automatically. So if you need to run your python 3 file just do that:</p>
<pre><code>python3 your_file_name.py
</code></pre>
<p>I hope this help you.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0394/" rel="nofollow">PEP-394</a>,<br/>
"<code>for the time being, all distributions should ensure that python refers to the same target as python2</code>".<br/>
On *nix systems, there are three links to executables of python command line interpreter named
<code>python</code>, <code>python2</code> and <code>python3</code> in directory <code>/usr/bin</code>. The <code>python</code> link points to <code>python2</code> according to the PEP, but you can change it to point to <code>python3</code> by creating a new link to <code>python3</code> and renaming it to <code>python</code>. Also, you have to delete the old <code>python</code> link.</p>

So I'll try and do that. Thanks very much for the answer though, I'm sure it will be very helpful for Windows users with the same query.</span>
