<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I wish to have a function, <code>subset(("A","b","C","D"),3)</code>, which gives the following output:</p>
<pre><code>("A","b","C")
("A","b","D")
("A","C","D")
("b","C","D")
</code></pre>
<p>How might I do this in python 3?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The <code>itertools.combinations</code> function was built explicitly for this purpose:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from itertools import combinations
&gt;&gt;&gt; list(combinations(("A","b","C","D"), 3))
[('A', 'b', 'C'), ('A', 'b', 'D'), ('A', 'C', 'D'), ('b', 'C', 'D')]
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>From the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.combinations" rel="nofollow">docs</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>itertools.combinations(iterable, r)</code></p>
<p>Return <code>r</code> length subsequences of elements from the input <code>iterable</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<span class="comment-copy">technically <code>def subset(elements, size): return '\n'.join(list(itertools.combinations(elements, size)))</code> :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@AdamSmith Probably intentional to be concise. This isn't about writing code on the behalf of other people, to be fair.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@AlexThornton I was honestly surprised no one asked him what his budget was before writing code for him :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@AdamSmith - The important part here was showing the OP how to generate the combinations he wants.  After that, it would be trivial to put the code in a function <code>subset</code>.  Also, it is somewhat unclear what the output is supposed to be.  <i>Is</i> it a string?  Or simply an example of the combinations he wants?  Because of the ambiguity, I decided to leave the definition of <code>subset</code> to the OP. :)</span>
