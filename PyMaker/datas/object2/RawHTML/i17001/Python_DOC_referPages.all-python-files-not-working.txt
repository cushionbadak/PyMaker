<p>A week ago all my py files were working just fine, but now everything has gone haywire. All python files/games don't work, with most errors being "Traceback error" and that same code used to work just fine before. Here's an example of code that doesn't work:</p>
<pre><code>print("Hello")
input()
print(Goodbye)
input()
</code></pre>
<p>It says hello, then when I press enter, it just says "traceback error". Most problems are associated with the enter key (with inputs). Also tkinter doesn't work. I use: <code>from tkinter import *</code> and it says <code>import error</code>. I tried again with a capital T, and that magically worked for some reason, though, but that shouldn't be the case. Right now I'm using python 3.3.5, and I had python 2.7.6 previously installed, but I deleted all of that. Please help!</p>

<p>In the above example you forgot to put <code>'Goodbye'</code> in quotes, but this is not the wider issue. There were significant (including many syntactic) changes between Python 2 and 3, such as using <code>print</code> (it is now a function rather than a statement) and the name of the <code>Tkinter/tkinter</code> library.</p>
<p>You need to port all of your code to make it work, or better still just leave your old Python  installed and then run such programs in that interpreter.</p>
<p>If you are insistent on moving on to another version, then you should convert all of your scripts using the built-in <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/2to3.html" rel="nofollow"><code>2to3</code></a> tool. For future Python 3 programs, see <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.0/whatsnew/3.0.html" rel="nofollow">what is new in Python 3</a>.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>
<p>To convert Python 3 code to Python 2, see the <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/3to2" rel="nofollow"><code>3to2</code></a> tool. It is not built-in, but it should make your life easier.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">it just says "traceback error": I don't think so. It as well gives a traceback with meaningful content.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Python 2 has <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/tkinter.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>Tkinter</code></a>, Python 3 has <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>tkinter</code></a>. Note the change from <code>T</code> to <code>t</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Please create a new script containing only this line: <code>print(__import__('sys').version)</code>. Run it and let us know the output.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I really don't think the OP needs to learn about how to now fix their Python 3 code to run on Python 2 instead. They need help unscrewing their system instead, which is why I am sending them to <i>Super User</i> instead. There is not enough info in this post to diagnose the problem anyway, and we <i>do not know how damaged the Python 2 setup is</i> either.</span>
