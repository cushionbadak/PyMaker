<p>There is an error in my code - <code>IndexError: list index out of range, at rates[row[0]] = row[1]</code>:</p>
<pre><code>def change():
    # read file into dictionary
    with open('exchangeRate.csv', 'r') as in_file:
        echRdr = csv.reader(in_file)
        for row in echRdr:
            rates[row[0]] = row[1]
</code></pre>
<p>it is because there  are empty lines in my file due to editing and the easiest way to solve this is to make it skip these lines, how would i do that?</p>

<p>A simple condition in the for loop may solve the issue.</p>
<pre><code>def change():
    # read file into dictionary

            pass

<span class="comment-copy">Have you tried printing <code>row</code>? Looks like it could provide some insight.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">similar to comments above.  one of your rows has less than 2 entries.  you could skip such rows with <code>if len(row) &gt; 1:</code>  but probably best to understand the fail case first</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Note that if you're using Python 3, you should use <code>'r', newline='')</code>, not merely <code>'r'</code>, as explained in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.reader" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the docs</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">the file does have line with nothing in them and that will stay this way due to editing, so it would be much easier to allow this here, how would that be done?</span>
