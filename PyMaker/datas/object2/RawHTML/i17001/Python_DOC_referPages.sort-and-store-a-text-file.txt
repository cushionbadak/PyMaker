<p>I am trying to sort and store the following information, which will be read from a txt file:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>"Michael Jordan, 2/17/1963, basketball, Bulls
Alex Rodriguez, 7/27/1975, baseball, Yankees
Emmitt Smith, 3/15/1969, football, Cowboys"
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is the code I have thus far:</p>
<pre><code>def main():
    athletes = []
    file = input("Please enter a file name: ")
    fn = open(file,mode='r')
</code></pre>
<p>I know I need to fill the array, but how would I go about splitting the txt file since there are both spaces and commas? I want the array to hold <code>[first name, last name, birthday, sport, team]</code></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Easy answer:</p>
<p><strong><code>string.split()</code></strong></p>
<pre><code>for line in fn:
    name, dob, sport, team = line.split(', ')
</code></pre>
<p>More complicated answer:</p>
<p>Use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html" rel="nofollow">csv</a> module. It's a bit more complicated to start out with, but will get you further. </p>

<p>I would recommend numpy!</p>
<pre><code>import numpy as np
my_array = np.genfromtxt('my_file.txt', dtype='str', delimiter=',')
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I figured it out. I filled the list, then split name.</p>
<pre><code>for line in fn:
   x = line.split(', ')
   fullName = x[0]
   birthday = x[1]
   sport = x[2]
   team = x[3]

   fullNameSplit = fullName.split(" ")
   firstName = fullNameSplit[0]
   lastName = fullNameSplit[1]
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">What do you need to sort by?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">FWIW, [] is a list, not an array.  In Python, an array is something different.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I want the list to hold the first name, last name, birthdate, sport,and team name</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@dstromberg thanks for pointing that out. I need to re phrase</span>
<span class="comment-copy">He also needs to split <code>name</code> by space to get first name and last name.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I inserted that line and got the following error.      ValueError: need more than 1 value to unpack  Is there a way I could use a list with this, or no?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Then apparently you have a line with no comma on it. Try adding this: <code>print('line: &lt;{}&gt;'.format(line))</code> above the <code>.split()</code> line. Then you'll be able to see the value of the line that's causing your error.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">the spacing was off in the text file. I fixed the spacing and ran it again, but got the following error instead: ValueError: too many values to unpack (expected 4)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@anana any suggestions? I do need to split by space to get first name and last name in addition to every other attribute</span>
<span class="comment-copy">We haven't been introduced to numpy</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I can only recommend it, it is one of the most popular python scistack packages. You can simply get it via pip</span>
