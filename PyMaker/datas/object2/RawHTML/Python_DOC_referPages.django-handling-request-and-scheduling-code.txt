<p>Writing a scheduler is a pretty daunting task. Instead of reinventing the wheel, use the facilities of your operating system to call into your application. For instance, almost every Unix system has <code>cron</code> or <code>atd</code> that will let you run commands at a known interval.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you may use a library such as <a href="http://www.celeryproject.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Celery</a>. It is designed as a task queue, for executing tasks asynchronously and retrieving results later. It includes a cron-like task scheduler.</p>
