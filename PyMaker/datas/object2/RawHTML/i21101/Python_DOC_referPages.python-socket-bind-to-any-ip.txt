<p>I have a small one sided message sender that works while I specify the IP to connect to in code, however, I am having trouble allowing the socket to accept connections from any IP. Here is the line that is the problem.</p>
<pre><code>mySocket = socket.socket ( socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM )
mySocket.bind ( ( '', 2727 ) )
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>''</code> is for localhost, and it works if I manually enter IP, eg <code>'192.168.1.106'</code>, however, how can I leave it open to all? Or am I using the wrong connection type for this?</p>

<p>If you want to bind to all available IPv4 addresses, specify <code>0.0.0.0</code> as your IP address. If you're behind a router and wish to have your socket internet-accessible, rather than just available on your LAN, you'll need to set up a port forwarding rule so that users outside your LAN can access the service.</p>
<p>See the following ServerFault question for more info on <code>0.0.0.0</code>: <a href="https://serverfault.com/questions/78048/whats-the-difference-between-ip-address-0-0-0-0-and-127-0-0-1">https://serverfault.com/questions/78048/whats-the-difference-between-ip-address-0-0-0-0-and-127-0-0-1</a></p>

<p>Binding to <code>''</code> has the same effect as to <code>'0.0.0.0'</code> makes the transition to IPv6 easier.</p>
<p>Depending on the OS, opening a <code>socket.AF_INET6</code> socket listens to IPv4 and IPv6.</p>

<p>Binding to 0.0.0.0 will allow it to accept connections from any IPv4 address that can route to it.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Is it possible to bind to completely custom ips like 152.64.87.9?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@CMCDragonkai Only if your system has an interface with that address.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">So I would need to create these interfaces prior to binding to them. And creating virtual interfaces would be loopbacks right?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Would that be IPv4 only? What about binding on all available IPv6 addresses?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Python bug report to make the docs more explicit about this: <a href="https://bugs.python.org/issue33921" rel="nofollow noreferrer">bugs.python.org/issue33921</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">According to the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html#socket-families" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs</a>, <code>''</code> is <b>not</b> compatible with IPv6: <i>This behavior is not compatible with IPv6, therefore, you may want to avoid these if you intend to support IPv6 with your Python programs.</i></span>
