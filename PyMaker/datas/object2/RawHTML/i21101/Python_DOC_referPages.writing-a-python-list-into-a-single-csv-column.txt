<p>I have a list of numbers that I want to put in a single column in a .csv file. The code below writes the values across a single row. How can I change the code so that Python writes the each value on a separate row? Thanks.</p>
<pre><code>        with open('returns.csv', 'wb') as f:
            writer = csv.writer(f)
            writer.writerow(daily_returns)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>with open('returns.csv', 'wb') as f:
    writer = csv.writer(f)
    for val in daily_returns:
        writer.writerow([val])
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><strong>Alternate solution:</strong> Assuming daily_returns is the name of the list you wish to write as a column in a CSV file, the following code should work:</p>
<pre><code>with open('return.csv','w') as f:
    writer = csv.writer(f);
    writer.writerows(zip(daily_returns));
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Just for the record:  </p>
<p>I'm using Python 3.2 and I could only get the following to work</p>
<pre><code>with open('returns','w')as f:
    writer=csv.writer(f,lineterminator='\n')
    for val in returns:
        writer.writerow([val])
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>For writing a single column, I would recommend avoiding the <code>csv</code> commands and just using plain python with the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.join" rel="nofollow noreferrer">str.join() method</a>:</p>
<pre><code>    with open('returns.csv', 'wb') as f:
        f.write("\n".join(daily_returns))
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">ISTM a CSV file with only column doesn't need a csv.writer.  Just use <code>f.writelines([ret + '\n' for ret in daily_returns])</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@RaymondHettinger: Perhaps this is farfetched, but the <code>ret</code> values could contain <code>'\n'</code> characters or delimiters that would need quoting.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I think the open call should only be <code>open('returns.csv', 'w') as f:</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks. I tried the same code, but my last line read writer.writerow(val) and I got the error "Sequence Expected." I didn't realize I needed the brackets.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Casey: I would tend to agree, but since the OP wrote it, I assume he knows what he's doing.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@unutbu, Casey: See <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1170214/pythons-csv-writer-produces-wrong-line-terminator/1170297#1170297" title="pythons csv writer produces wrong line terminator">stackoverflow.com/questions/1170214/â€¦</a>  ... the OP has evidently read the docs :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This was the only solution that worked for me in Python 3.x.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">In Python 3, you should open files using the <code>newline=''</code> parameter, as explained in <a href="http://docs.python.org/3.2/library/csv.html#csv.writer" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the docs</a>.</span>
