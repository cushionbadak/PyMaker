<p>I am importing csv file to django model with below commands:</p>
<pre><code>if request.method == 'POST' and request.FILES['csv_file2']:
    myfile = request.FILES['csv_file2']
    fs = FileSystemStorage()
    filename = fs.save(myfile.name, myfile)
    data = csv.reader(fs.open(filename, mode='r'))
</code></pre>
<p>The problem that I am having that I can't see turkish characters. I searched at stackoverflow  and I need to add utf-8 encoding while reading the csv file ,I tried several examples that I found but I couldn't make it work anywhere I tried to add encoding in my codes. Where should I add ?</p>

<p>You need to modify as per below:</p>
<pre><code>            path = fs.path(filename)
            with open(path, encoding='utf-8') as f:
                data = csv.reader(f)
                for row in data:
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Yes, but that's with the built-in <code>open</code>, not <code>fs.open</code>, which apparently doesn't take an encoding parameter. You could try to get the path to the file and open it with built-in open, passing the encoding. I'm not used to working with <code>FileSystemStorage</code> directly, so I'm not sure about how it's usually done.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, you can get the path with <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/ref/files/storage/#django.core.files.storage.Storage.path" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>fs.path</code></a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@İlkemÇetinkaya use <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/io.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/2/library/io.html</a> by setting the encoding in Python 2 if it's python 3, then that's the default.   <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@İlkemÇetinkaya The way to use <code>fs.path</code> would be: <code>path = fs.path(filename)</code> and then <code>csv.reader(open(path), encoding='utf8')</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sorry, that was a typo, the encoding is passed to <code>open</code> and not <code>csv.reader</code>. It's correct in ahmet's answer.</span>
