<p>I have the same question as <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13745648/running-bash-script-from-within-python">here</a> with python 3.x. I tried the solution provided but it does not work for me.  </p>
<p>Python does not wait bash script to finish and prints "end" before bash script to be terminated. </p>
<p>I am on windows and have cygwin isntalled.</p>
<p><strong>callBash.py:</strong></p>
<pre><code>import subprocess
print("start")
subprocess.call("sleep.sh",shell=True)
print("end")
</code></pre>
<p><strong>sleep.sh:</strong></p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
sleep 10
</code></pre>

<p>You never check the return value of <code>subprocess.call</code>, so it's likely that your script doesn't even start properly, maybe because of invalid PATH / CWD or permissions or something else.</p>
<p>Use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.check_call" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>subprocess.check_call</code></a> instead, so that an exception is raised if your script fails to run. Exceptions are not so easy to miss.</p>
<p>Also if you have Python 3, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.run" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>subprocess.run(..., check=True)</code></a> is newer and generally easier to work with.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">since your script is doing... nothing, are you sure you're even <i>running</i> the script? try <code>check_call</code> instead.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It is running. I see the console that waits 10 seconds and then it closes.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You’re on Windows? How are you running bash scripts in the first place? If it’s through Cygwin, this won’t work without the Cygwin version of Python. If it’s through MSYS, you probably want to explicitly call the MSYS <code>bash</code> with <code>sleep.sh</code> as its argument (and without <code>shell=True</code>).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">oh you're using windows... which program .sh files are associated to? Try "cmd /c sleep.sh" in a console, see if that blocks...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You should have specified "windows" in your question. Reading <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/subprocess.html#windows-popen-helpers" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the docs</a>, you'll see a section <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/subprocess.html#windows-popen-helpers" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Windows Popen Helpers</a> which talks about creating a "startupinfo" object to pass to the Popen constructor. Looks like your code is going to get more complicated</span>
<span class="comment-copy">same idea here. But OP says it's running, detached/background from current process. not my DV BTW. But not the answer either.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Oh, I misunderstood that part. In that case I'll leave the answer here as a semi-related suggestion.</span>
