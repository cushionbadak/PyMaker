<p>I've been use C# for more then one year and begin to learn Python 3. 
I have the question: What is the best way to save data (collection/list) in Python 3?</p>
<p>I have class and collection/list which is store this class objects.</p>
<p>I made seriazation method, which is serialize my collection any time if i add new member to my collction/list. The problem is that i am not sure that it is fast method.</p>

<p>Take a look at the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/shelve.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">shelve</a> module.
If you are just looking for serialization, see <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html#module-pickle" rel="nofollow noreferrer">pickle</a></p>
