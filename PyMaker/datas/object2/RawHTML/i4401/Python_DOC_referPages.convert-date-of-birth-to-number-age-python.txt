<p>Thanks Everyone, im close.  Im using Python within a survey software tool called Decipher, so it may appear a little different.  My issue now is I need to "pipe" in the age based on a respondents answer, that would be your_date_string.  But when I put that in my dob variable I get an error from the system: ValueError: time data 'your_date_string' does not match format '%Y,%d,%m', but printing the your_date_string returns the exact value needed.  Not sure how to fix this.</p>
<pre><code>from datetime import date

your_date_string = str(2003 - (scr_q2c.c1.val)) +","+ str(scr_q2b.c1.val + 1) +","+ str(scr_q2a.c1.val + 1)
year, day, month = [int(f) for f in your_date_string.split(',')]
your_date = date(year, month, day)

dob = datetime.datetime.strptime('your_date_string', '%Y,%d,%m')
today = datetime.date.today()
age = today.year - dob.year - ((today.month, today.day) &amp;lt; (dob .month, dob .day))

print your_date_string
print age
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You first need to convert your string to a date object:</p>
<pre><code>from datetime import date

your_date_string = '1982,14,4'
year, day, month = [int(f) for f in your_date_string.split(',')]
your_date = date(year, month, day)
</code></pre>
<p>And then use that date object to compute the number of years. A quick and easy way to do that is to rely on <code>dateutil</code> third-party library that you can install using <code>pip install dateutil</code>. Here is an example:</p>
<pre><code>from dateutil.relativedelta import relativedelta

difference_in_years = relativedelta(date.today(), your_date).years
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, <code>difference_in_years = 35</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>check the month and day, if today less than date of birth than minus one from year difference</p>
<pre><code>import datetime
dob = datetime.datetime.strptime('1982,14,4', '%Y,%d,%m')
today = datetime.date.today()
print today.year - dob.year - ((today.month, today.day) &lt; (dob .month, dob .day))
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">What have you tried so far? What does your actual date format look like? Are the strings all formatted the same?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">dob = str(2003 - (scr_q2c.c1.val)) + "," + str(scr_q2b.c1.val + 1) + "," + str(scr_q2a.c1.val + 1)   from datetime import date     age = date.today()-date(dob) print(age)   print dob</span>
<span class="comment-copy">use <code>datetime</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Could you add that to your question? It's hard to read in a comment</span>
