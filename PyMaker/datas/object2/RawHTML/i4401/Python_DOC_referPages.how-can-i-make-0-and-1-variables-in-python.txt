<p>in C# it was Possible to Use a Code Like This:</p>
<pre><code>Console.WriteLine ("hello{0}" ,Hello); 
</code></pre>
<p>i Want to do Same Thing in Python,i Want to Call Variable With {0} and {1} Way.
How Can I Do This ?</p>

<p>You can use the <code>str.format</code> function:</p>
<pre><code>"Hello {0} {1}".format(firstname, lastname)
</code></pre>
<p>You can also leave the space in between the <code>{}</code> blank to automatically pick the next argument:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; "{}, {}".format("one", "two")
one, two
</code></pre>
<p>You can also use a prettier "f string" syntax since python 3.6:</p>
<pre><code>f"Hello{Hello}"
</code></pre>
<p>The variable inside the <code>{}</code> will be looked up and placed inside the code.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use <code>format</code> for the same </p>
<pre><code>"hello {0}".format("Hello") 
</code></pre>

<p>You can use place holders to format strings in Python. So in this example, if you want to use a place holder such as {0}, you have to use a method called .format in Python. Below is a mini example.</p>
<pre><code>name = input('Please enter your name: ')

with open('random_sample.txt', 'w') as sample:
      sample.write('Hello {0}'.format(name))
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, I ask the user for a name and then store that name in a variable. In my string that I write to a txt file, I use the place holder, and outside of the string I use the .format method. The argument that you enter will be the variable that you want to use. </p>
<p>if you want to add another variable {1} you would do this:</p>
<pre><code> sample.write('Hello {0}. You want a {1}').format(name, other_variable))
</code></pre>
<p>so whenever you use a placeholder like this in Python, use the .format() method. You will have to do additional research on it because this is just a mini example. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">care to explain the downvote? On both of these answers?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">and what if i want to use more variables like {0} {1} {2} {3}.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I've shown you this in the second snippet, simply add more arguments to format</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Makaveli You can. When each argument to format is used only once, and in left-to-write order, you can omit numbers from the placeholders. (That is, <code>format</code> has an algorithm for inferring the next number to use with <code>{}</code>.)</span>
