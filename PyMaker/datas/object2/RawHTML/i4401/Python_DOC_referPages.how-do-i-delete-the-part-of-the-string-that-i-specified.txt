<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>how should I delete everything on the string that starts with the letter I specify?</p>
<p>Let's say:</p>
<pre><code>PHP/USD
</code></pre>
<p>I want to delete everything that starts with '/'  so what's left would be 'PHP'</p>
<p>and how do I do the reverse? Starts so that USD would be the only one left?</p>
<p>I only found answers on deleting the middle or deleting string that starts with something, but no a PART of the string. What is the better approach on this? </p>
<p>is it something with <code>oldstr.replace()</code> replace documentation that I have misread?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Use <code>re.sub</code> and replace the pattern <code>/.*$</code> with empty string:</p>
<pre><code>import re
input = "PHP/USD"
line = re.sub(r"/.*$", "", input)
print line
# prints PHP
</code></pre>
<p>If you wanted the reverse, then use the pattern <code>^.*/</code>.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Can't you just split the string on the desired character? <code>first, second = myString.split("/")</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Tried <code>.split('/')[0]</code>?</span>

<span class="comment-copy">I agree with cricket_007, use <code>"PHP/USD".split("/")[0]</code> to get PHP and <code>"PHP/USD".split("/")[-1]</code> to get USD.</span>
