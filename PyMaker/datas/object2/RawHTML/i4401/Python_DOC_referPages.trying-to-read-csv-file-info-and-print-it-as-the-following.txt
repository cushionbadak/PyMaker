</code></pre>
<p>So I have to get the information from row 2 and make it print as such</p>
<pre><code>0 Company
1 Booth
2 Full-Time
3 Full-Time Visa Sponsor
4 Part-Time
5 Internship
6 Freshman
7 Sophomore
8 Junior
9 Senior
10 Post-Bacs
11 MS
12 PhD
13 Alumni
</code></pre>
<p>I am not sure how you can make it print line by line, and with the numbers on the left side. This is my code that I've tried doing so far</p>
<pre><code>import csv
filename = "Spring.csv"                     #I assigned the file to a variable
f = open(filename)                          #I couldn't leave it default due to UTF-8 error from orginial
reader = csv.reader(f)

output = []


with open( 'Spring.csv', 'r') as t:
    rows = list(reader)
    output.append(rows[2])


print(output)
</code></pre>
<p>My output right now is the following</p>
<pre><code>[['Company', 'Booth', 'Full-Time', 'Full-Time Visa Sponsor', 'Part-Time', 'Internship', 'Freshman', 'Sophomore', 'Junior', 'Senior', 'Post-Bacs', 'MS', 'PhD', 'Alumni']]
</code></pre>
<p>I <strong>CAN'T</strong> use pandas module for this either. It's for an introductory COSC class. :) </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I also think I am going to have to assign values to that table later
  with questions. </p>
<p>I don't want to make the question any more confusing, but I think
  that's referring to indexing it.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Use <code>enumerate</code></p>
<p><strong>Ex:</strong></p>
<pre><code>import csv
filename = "Spring.csv"                     #I assigned the file to a variable
f = open(filename)                          #I couldn't leave it default due to UTF-8 error from orginial
reader = csv.reader(f)

output = []


with open( 'Spring.csv', 'r') as t:
    rows = list(reader)
    for i,v in enumerate(rows[2]):           #----&gt;enumerate
        print(i, v)
</code></pre>
<p><strong><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#enumerate" rel="nofollow noreferrer">enumerate</a></strong></p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Why are you opening <code>f = open(filename)</code> but then also opening <code>Spring.csv</code> and <b>not use it</b>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yeah the second row has the information needed to make that table though.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That's the 3rd row, by the way. You don't need to read the whole file to get that info. Just skip the first two rows (<code>next(reader)</code> takes one and returns it, so call that twice to skip lines).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Oh wow! That worked. Will this save into my output=[]?  I am so sorry, I am just new and trying to make sense of it all.   Thanks so much though</span>
<span class="comment-copy">: is missing in for loop for i,v in enumerate(rows[2])  code will not work by simple copy paste.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@PKPython. You are welcome.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yeah I saw he missed out on the :</span>
