<p>I wrote this code for my homework. But when I'm running it, its result is always same even I have used import random. Ironically, in other computers, like friend's computer, code get different result but it repeat again. What's wrong in my code?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>random.seed(n)</code> starts the random number generator off from the same point each time the program is run. </p>
<p>That is you get the same sequence of random numbers. It is like taking a video of a dice being thrown and then playing it back each time - the numbers are random (pseudo random to be accurate) but you are playing back the sequence.</p>
<p>This is useful for testing, for example: you can run different versions of your program with the same random numbers, so you are sure differences in your results are only due to the program, not to chance.</p>
<p>Take random.seed out and you will get a sequence that starts at a random location. <em>(On most computers, if you don't specify a seed, the clock time the program started is implicitely used as seed.)</em></p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>When you write </p>
<pre><code>random.seed(1)
</code></pre>
<p>You are saying to always use the same sequence of randomly generated numbers, therefore you always have the same results. 
It happens when I run it on my computer too.</p>
<p>Simply remove the line and you should have different randomly generated numbers every time.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Remove your random.seed() call.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">do you have the same python version on your friend's computer ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you run it twice on the same computer of your friend, does it twice give the same result?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I tried it and it also always give me the same lists at every run, it is not computer dependent. As hinted above, it is due to the seeeding of the random number generator</span>
