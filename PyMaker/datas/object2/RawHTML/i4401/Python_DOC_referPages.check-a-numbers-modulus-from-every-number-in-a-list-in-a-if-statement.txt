<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I'm trying to make a program that involves checking if a number's modulus is zero for every number in a list, and then, if it's modulus of all of them is zero, it adds it to the list. Like this:</p>
<pre><code>nums = [1,2,3,5]
if( var1% *Everything in nums* ==0):
    nums.append(var1)
</code></pre>
<p>If you're wondering, It's for calculating primes. Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>There is a function called <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#all" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>all</code></a> for this kind of thing.</p>
<pre><code>nums = [1,2,3,5]
if all(var1%n==0 for n in nums):
    nums.append(var1)
</code></pre>
