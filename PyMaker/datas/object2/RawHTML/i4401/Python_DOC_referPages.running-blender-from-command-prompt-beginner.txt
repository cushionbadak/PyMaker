<p>I am new to <code>Blender</code>.  I have created a simple project where I have added a text variable to it. The text I added here in <code>Test</code>. See image below.</p>
<p>Now, I want to call this script from the command line by to call this particular project file and pass in parameters like the text variable to display the text <code>james</code> instead of <code>Test</code>. </p>
<p>For example, typing the following command should give me video generated with the text james.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>blender proj1.blend variable=james</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Use python script, like</p>
<pre><code>blender proj1.blend --python-expr "import bpy; bpy.data.curves['Text'].body = 'james'"
</code></pre>
<p>(if your text curve object called "Text")</p>
<p>Argument order is important - you want script to be executed after file is loaded.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can find the arguments used to start blender listed in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.argv" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>sys.argv</code></a>, the same as if you were running a normal python script. Blender will ignore any arguments after <code>--</code>, your script can then find the <code>--</code> argument and process any options after that.</p>
<pre><code>blender -b --python maketext.py -- James
</code></pre>
<p>Then the contents of <code>maketext.py</code> would start with -</p>
<pre><code>import bpy
import sys

idx = sys.argv.index('--') + 1
string_to_use = sys.argv[idx]

text_data = bpy.data.curves.new('txt', 'FONT')
text_data.body = string_to_use
text_obj = bpy.data.objects.new('text', text_data)
bpy.context.scene.objects.link(text_obj)
# animate and render
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Can you point me to a tutorial that will guide me with the steps ? Sorry but i am a beginner.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I honestly don't know, I just happen to have a bit of experience with it. What are you interested in, is my example not clear enough or you want to learn more?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">When you say use python script. Did you mean for me to add the code in a <code>test.py</code> file and then execute it. Sorry , I am still trying to understand this.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Script is already in example - <code>--python-expr</code> executes given expression, so <code>import bpy; bpy.data.curves['Text'].body = 'james'</code> is a said script.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I don't know why But, i get this error <code>'blender' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.</code> I have already added blender.exe to my path variable as well.</span>
