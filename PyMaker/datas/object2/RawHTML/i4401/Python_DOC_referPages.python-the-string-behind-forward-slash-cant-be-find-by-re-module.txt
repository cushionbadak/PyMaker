<p>It seems a very simple problem, but this has taken me a few hours:</p>
<pre><code>mystr='link/123'
pattern = re.compile(r'123')
print(pattern.match(mystr))
</code></pre>
<p>And result is <code>None</code>.<br/>
As I known, '/' is just a ordinary char, and I have no idea why <code>re</code> does not work?</p>

<p><code>match</code> will only match at the beginning of the string.</p>

<p>Use <code>search</code> instead.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Hint: Replace <code>pattern.match</code> with <code>pattern.search</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>match</code> matches the start of the string. Did you want <code>search</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">its simple string why regex you can split the string by '/'</span>
