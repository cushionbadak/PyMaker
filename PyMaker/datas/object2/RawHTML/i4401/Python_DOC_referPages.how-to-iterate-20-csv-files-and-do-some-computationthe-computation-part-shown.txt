<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If <code>df2</code> is static and you just want to loop through this for the 20 files, then you can make use of <code>os</code> and <code>re</code> to reduce the amount of code you need to write.</p>
<pre><code>import pandas as pd
import os
import re

path = "C:/Users/amulya/Desktop/graves lab/Mani/HIDDEN WORDS/"
df2 = pd.read_csv("C:/Users/amulya/Desktop/graves lab/words.csv")

files = [file for file in os.listdir(path) if 'Hidden_word_' in file]

for file in files:
    num = re.search('.*_(\d{1,2})', file)[1]
    df1 = pd.read_csv(path + file)
    df3 = df1[df1.col1.isin(df2.col1)]
    df3.to_csv(path+'out'+num+'.csv')
</code></pre>
<p>This assumes that the only files in your path that have <code>'Hidden_word_'</code> in their name are the ones you want to analyze, but if that's not the case, you can either modify the list creation or think about file naming and organization a bit more to facilitate things like this.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">i want to run this code for "Hidden_word_4.csv" and get output "out4.csv" like that for hidden_word 1,Hidden_word 2......till 20 and get out1,out2....till 20. Thanks!!!</span>

<span class="comment-copy">In a loop; construct a string for the input and output files using either string concatenation or string formatting; place your code in the loop and operate on the variables that you have assigned your strings to.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">wow!! Thanks ! Perfect</span>
