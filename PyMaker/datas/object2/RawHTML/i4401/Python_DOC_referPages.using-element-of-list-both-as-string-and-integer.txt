<p>Is there a way to use the elements of a string-list first as strings and then as int?</p>
<pre><code>l = ['A','B','C']

for n in l:
    use n as string (do some operations)
    convert n to int(element of NG)
    use n as int
</code></pre>
<p>I tried to Play around with range/len but I didnt come to a solution.</p>
<p>Edit2:</p>
<p>This is what I have:</p>
<pre><code>import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

NG = ['A','B','C']

l = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
b = [6,5,4,3,2,1]

for n in NG:
    print(n)
    dflist = []
    df = pd.DataFrame(l)
    dflist.append(df)
    df2 = pd.DataFrame(b)
    dflist.append(df2)
    df = pd.concat(dflist, axis = 1)
    df.plot()
</code></pre>
<p>The Output are 3 figures that look like this:
<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/z4E1n.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img alt="enter image description here" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/z4E1n.png"/></a></p>
<p>But I want them to be in one figure:</p>
<pre><code>import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

NG = ['A','B','C']

l = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
b = [6,5,4,3,2,1]

for n in NG:
    print(n)
    dflist = []
    df = pd.DataFrame(l)
    dflist.append(df)
    df2 = pd.DataFrame(b)
    dflist.append(df2)
    df = pd.concat(dflist, axis = 1)
    ax = plt.subplot(6, 2, n + 1)
    df.plot(ax = ax)
</code></pre>
<p>This code works, but only if the list <code>NG</code> is made out of integers <code>[1,2,3]</code>. But I have it in <code>strings</code>. And I Need them in the Loop.</p>

<p><strong>How to access both the element of list and its index?</strong></p>
<p>That is the real question as I understood mainly from <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49727251/using-element-of-for-loop-both-as-string-and-int#comment86469134_49727251">this comment</a>. And it is a pretty common and straightforward piece of code:</p>
<pre><code>NG = ['A', 'B', 'C']

for i in range(len(NG)):
    print(i)
    print(NG[i])
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Here is my 2 cents:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; for n in l:
...     print ord(n)
...     print n
... 
65
A
66
B
67
C
</code></pre>
<h1>To convert back to char</h1>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; chr(65)
'A'
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><em>I think integer mean here is ascii value of character</em>
so you can use again your ascii value to play with characters 
my solution is you have to type cast  your variables like this ,
and use <strong>ord()</strong> function to get ascii values</p>
<pre><code>l = ['A','B','C']
for i in range(0,len(l)):
    print("string value is ",l[i])
    # now for integer values
    if type(l[i]) != 'int':
        print("ascii value of this char is ",ord(l[i]))
    else:
        print("already int type go on..")
</code></pre>
<p>as because there is no meaning of having a int value of characters , int value of character generally refers as ascii value may be <em>some other formats</em> </p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#enumerate" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>enumerate</code></a> to iterate both on the indices and the letters.</p>
<pre><code>NG = ['A','B','C']

for i, n in enumerate(NG, 1):
    print(i, n)
</code></pre>
<p>Will output:</p>
<pre><code>(1, 'A')
(2, 'B')
(3, 'C')
</code></pre>
<p>In your case, because you don't need the letters at all in your loop, you can use the underscore <code>_</code> to notify coders in your future about what your code do - it uses the len of <code>NG</code> just for the indices.</p>
<pre><code>for i, _ in enumerate(NG, 1):

<span class="comment-copy">what you mean by <i>"first as strings and then as int"</i> ? Can you post a sample o/p ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Do you mean the index when you say <code>as int</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Do you need the intergers equivalent to the ascii table? That mean A = 65</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sorry, I made it unclear. First I Need the string of the list. Then I Need the string's index for the plot.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, that was what I was looking for. Sorry for the poorly written question</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Is there a way to convert the strings to their index?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">care to explain? I didn't get your question.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I Need the string as well as its index (of the list). Example: I Need the 'B' as well as its index -&gt; 2</span>
<span class="comment-copy">&gt;&gt;&gt; for index,c in enumerate(str):      ...     print(c,index)      ...       ('H', 0)      ('E', 1)      ('L', 2)      ('P', 3)      &gt;&gt;&gt;</span>
<span class="comment-copy">you can use list (i.e. l) as well instead of string(i.e. str)</span>
