<p>I have a class with string data, and I'm supposed to calculate hash of the whole object using <code>hashlib.sha256()</code> . 
I was not directly able to get hash with 
block c for example</p>
<pre><code>Hash = hashlib.sha256(c.encode()).digest()
</code></pre>
<p>I want to calculate hash of the whole object,I was suggested to have a function in the class such that it returns hash of data inside it . Is it same as has of whole block ? What is better implementation?</p>

<p>You need to implement magic method <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__hash__" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>__hash__</code></a> for you class. And then you may use instance of your class, for example, as key of dictionary. And if you just need to get hash it simple to use built-in function <code>hash</code>:</p>
<pre><code>   c = MyClass()
   c_hash = hash(c)
</code></pre>
