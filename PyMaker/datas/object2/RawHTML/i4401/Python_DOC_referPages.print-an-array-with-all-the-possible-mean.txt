<p>Suppose I have a list 'a'. Now, I want to print a list with all the possible mean(only integers) from all the possible pairs of list 'a'.For example:</p>
<pre><code>     a = [0,0,3,4,1,2,9]
</code></pre>
<p>Now, I want to print a list b such that;</p>
<pre><code>     b = [0,2,1,2,1,2,6,3,5]
</code></pre>
<p>If (a,b) is taken as a pair then (b,a) wont count. But it would count if there are duplicates of a and b present.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You could use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.combinations" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>itertools.combinations()</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>import itertools
a = [0,0,3,4,1,2,9]  
av = [int(sum(i)/2) for i in itertools.combinations(a, 2) if sum(i)%2 == 0]
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>[0, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 6, 3, 5]
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You have a few tasks to accomplish:</p>
<ol>
<li>Given the input, output the combinations</li>
<li>Given the combinations output their means</li>
<li>Given the means, filter out the non-integers</li>
</ol>
<p>Using functional programming style you can use function composition to put each step inside the other.</p>
<pre><code>from itertools import combinations
from statistics import mean
a = [0,0,3,4,1,2,9]
b = list(filter(lambda x: isinstance(x, int), map(mean, combinations(a, 2))))
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Do you want to round the non-integer means, or not include them</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I haven't included the mean which are float. for eg : mean of 0 and 3 is not included.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you. summed up. can this be done without itertools?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, you could just implement your own combination function, but using itertools is much easier.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">yes, you'd just need to create a function that spits out all the combinations. Try it out and see what you come up with. Share what you did and post again if you get stuck.
