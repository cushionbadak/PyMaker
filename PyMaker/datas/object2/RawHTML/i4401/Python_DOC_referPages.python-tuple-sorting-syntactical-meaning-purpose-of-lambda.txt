<p>Can someone explain that the importance of <strong>lambda</strong> in this format of sorting tuples? Further, what exactly does each element of this sorting method mean? </p>
<pre><code>sorted(authorlist, key = lambda tup: tup[0], reverse = True)
</code></pre>
<p>I know that reverse <code>=</code> True allows for the list of tuples to be sorted in decending order, the <code>tup[0]</code> indicates what index you want to sort by, and that the first parameter is the tuple/list, but what does <code>key = lambda</code> mean and why is tuple referred to as <code>tup</code>?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>lambda is just a syntax shortcut to put a function as a parameter without defining it explicitly on the lines above.  Lambdas are restricted Lambdas are restricted to a single expression.  So for longer functions you do have to define them separately</p>
<p>The code above could be re-written as</p>
<pre><code>def getKey():
   return tup[0]

sorted(authorlist, key = getKey, reverse = True)
</code></pre>
<p>This code is functionally equivalent to the one you posted in the question. The purpose of lambda is to extract the first field from the tuple that you are sorting.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">From the docs for <code>sorted</code>:  <i>"<code>key</code> specifies a function of one argument that is used to extract a comparison key from each list element"</i>. So the lambda here is the one argument function.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">Yes, you are right.  Thank you for pointing that out.</span>
