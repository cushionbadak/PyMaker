<p>I'm trying to to build a program that should process a data which was acquired since 1830. I made a reference date <code>datetime(1970, 1, 1)</code> to compute the timedelta.</p>
<p>The timedelta works good and I get some negative numbers which is normal. The problem occurs when I want to reconvert the dates to plot data in a proper way using <code>datetime.datetime.utcfromtimestamp(t)</code>. So  here "t" is negative. </p>
<p>Looking for this on internet I found that it's a Python bug or limitation under Windows. I have the 3.5 version and windows 10. I found nothing which can be helpful. So if you know a solution to that or an alternative way using panda library I will be very thankful.</p>
<p>The error it returns to me is : <code>OSError: [Errno 22] Invalid argument</code></p>

<p>This seems indeed to be a bug on your machine. On my machine (Python 3.6.3 in Ubuntu 17.10) negative numbers work correctly as UTC time-stamp.</p>
<p>As a workaround you can try <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.date.toordinal" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>datetime.datetime.toordinal</code></a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.date.fromordinal" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>datetime.datetime.fromordinal</code></a>. The ordinals start on January 1, 0001 and should therefore be able to cover your date range using only positive numbers:</p>
<pre><code>import datetime

start = datetime.datetime(1830, 1, 1)
event_1 = datetime.datetime(1835, 2, 10)
diff = (event_1 - start).days
# 1866

datetime.datetime.fromordinal(start.toordinal() + diff)
# datetime.datetime(1835, 2, 10, 0, 0)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Thank you for your answer. I moved to panda it's more simpler for handling dates. There is no need for a date0. It's like MATLAB you can easily parse dates and display it in the x_label.  I used <code>pandas.read_csv() </code></span>
