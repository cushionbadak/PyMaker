<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have a usertable with a column 'routes' that has values like <code>'[{"407": "410"}, {"410": "408"}]'</code>. I need to select all rows that have values 408"}, so I'm using like keyword in 
MySQL to achieve this. The query looks as below
select routes from usertable where routes like <code>'%408"}%'</code></p>
<p>This query works in MySQL Workbench, but when I take this to Python its not working, my query looks like below in Python
<code>(select routes from usertable where routes like</code>'%{1}"}%').format(routes)`</p>
<p>The error I see is as below:</p>
<pre><code>    "Single '}' encountered in format string"
</code></pre>
<p>I did try using escape characters i.e. <code>\"</code> and <code>}}</code> but still getting the same error.</p>
<p>Please suggest how to fix this.</p>
<p>Thanks,
Seema</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>'%{1}"}%'.format(routes)'</code> should be <code>'%{1}"}}%'.format(routes)'</code> (note the double <code>}}</code>).</p>
<p>that is how you can convice <code>format</code> not to try and fill a value but to return just one <code>}</code>. as stated in the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#formatted-string-literals" rel="nofollow noreferrer">doc</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The parts of the string outside curly braces are treated literally,
  except that any doubled curly braces '{{' or '}}' are replaced with
  the corresponding single curly brace.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You should duplicate <code>}</code> and <code>{</code> if you intend to use formatting.</p>
<p>In your case, edit your string so it looks like that <code>'%{1}"}}%').format(routes)</code>. This will give results you expect.</p>
<hr/>
<p>As for</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I did try using escape characters</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems you tried to escape characters you use for format, not the ones you don't mean to touch.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Try using following query</p>
<pre><code>select routes from usertable where routes like '%%{{\"{1}\"%%'".format(routes))
</code></pre>
<p>The <strong>%</strong> that you are using is <strong>escape character</strong> you can use %% for instead of <strong>%</strong> (similarly instead of <strong>{</strong> use <strong>{{</strong> and add \ before " ).</p>
<p>This will help you.</p>
