<p>I am currently working on a project in which I am trying to read some files by only knowing their name, and not the directory in which they belong. The script file might be in the same or in a different folder than the text files (text file directories are unknown).</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><strong>Warning: The following code will run for days, but you asked for it.</strong></p>
<pre><code># If you would like to limit your search to something reasonable
# replace "/" with your subdirectories.
res = os.subprocess.check_output(["find", "/", "-name", f]).decode("utf-8").split("\n")
for candidate in res:
    with open("candidate", YOUR_FLAGS):
        ... do something
</code></pre>
<p>... where <code>f</code> is your file name, and <code>YOUR_FLAGS</code> is whether you want to read it(<code>"r"</code>) or write(<code>"w"</code>), append, etc.</p>
<p>The reasoning behind using <code>os.subprocess</code> for this is that <code>os.walk</code> on giant file systems are not efficient. The overhead of creating a process is alleviated by the <code>fts</code> backend from <code>find</code>, and it will end up costing much less as the number of files scale.</p>

<p>If you're asking how to <em>search</em> for a file with a given name, you can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.walk" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>os.walk</code></a> and check the names match what you're looking for.  Naturally, there may be multiple files with the name you're looking for.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This is impossible in one line, but you can use the os module to search for a file in all directories, for example using os.walk().</p>
