<p>I work with language codes, especially with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-3" rel="nofollow noreferrer">ISO 639-3</a> standard, which uses three letter codes to represent languages (<code>eng</code> for English, <code>jpn</code> for Japanese, etc).</p>
<p>However, codes in the range of <code>qaaâ€“qtz</code> are <em>not</em> proper language codes but are just empty ones that the user has to define.So, <code>qaa</code>, <code>qab</code>...<code>qaz</code>, <code>qba</code>, and so on.</p>
<p><strong>I was wondering how to write code that would be able to detect if a code is part of this series?</strong> In these codes, the last letter goes all the way through a-z, then starts at a new sequence in the second letter. Kind of like a three digit number, except instead of 0-9 digits, it's a-z letters. </p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can do this easily with a regular expression matching for the pattern 'q[a-t][a-z]'</p>
<pre><code>    import re
    a = ['abc','qaa','qbc','qtz','q12','qua','qabx']
    for i in a:
        if re.match('q[a-t][a-z]',i) and len(i) == 3:
            b = 'MATCH'
        else:
            b = 'NO MATCH'
        print('{} : {}'.format(i,b))
</code></pre>
<p>edit: forgot to do a length check. Without it the regex would find a positive match on 'qabx' which doesn't fit the pattern you are wanting.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">A regular expression could handle this trivially. See the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>re</code> module</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This seems trivial, even without knowing anything about regex: <code>code[0] == 'q' and 'a' &lt;= code[1] &lt; 'u'</code>, or, if you're already converting from codes to numbers, something like <code>num in range(code_to_num('qaa'), code_to_num('qua'))</code>. Is there some reason the obvious possibilities don't work for you?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Also, aren't there libraries for this on PyPI already? It seems like a common enough thing that there would be.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@abarnert There is <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/iso-639" rel="nofollow noreferrer">one</a> but it's outdated (about three years old).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What about <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pycountry/18.2.23" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>pycountry</code></a>? As far as I can tell, the one you linked to is a fork of (part of) <code>pycountry</code> by someone who didn't like one of the changes they may about 3 years ago (and it's also relicensed from LGPL to AGPL, which could be a problem if your main program is not AGPL-compatible).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No need for a length check, just put <code>^</code> at the front of your pattern and <code>$</code> at the end.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Much thanks to the both of you! Works great.</span>
