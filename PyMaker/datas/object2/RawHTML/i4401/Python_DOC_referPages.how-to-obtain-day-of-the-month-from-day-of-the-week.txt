<p>I'm trying to get python to return the date of the month when a day of the week is inputed e.g:
1st Sunday of April 2018 returns 1
or 3rd Thursday of April 2018 returns 19</p>
<p>Are there python libraries or mathematical algorithms that do this? I've looked at Zeller's congruence but it seems like it does the opposite.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>From your Input string separating all the values and then takes all the dates of that day from that month in that year. </p>
<p>Here a big try :</p>
<pre><code>import calendar
import re

c = calendar.Calendar(firstweekday=calendar.SUNDAY)

string = "1st Sunday of April 2018"
string.split().pop(2)
string_list = string.split()
year = int(string_list[4])
month = list(calendar.month_name).index(string_list[3])
day_num = list(calendar.day_name).index(string_list[1])
which = int(re.search(r'\d+', string_list[0]).group())

monthcal = c.monthdatescalendar(year,month)
date = [day for week in monthcal for day in week if \
            day.weekday() == day_num and \
            day.month == month][which-1]

print(date.day)

<span class="comment-copy">Find with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.date.weekday" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>date.weekday</code></a> the weekday for the first of the month. Add value for difference in weekdays. Add 7*n for difference in weeks. Voila.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Damn how did I miss that. Thanks @MrT!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Most of the stuff you have to do with dates can be found in the <code>datetime</code> or (lesser known) <code>calendar</code> library.</span>
