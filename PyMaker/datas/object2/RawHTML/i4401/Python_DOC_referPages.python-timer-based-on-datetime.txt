<p>I'm trying to program for a simple game. I want the countdown to be printed like 10, 9, 8, ... for seeing how much time is left to collect items. when the timer runs out I want the program to close.
This is the error:</p>
<pre><code>int() argument must be a string, a bytes-like object or a number, not 'datetime.timedelta'
</code></pre>
<p>can sombody correct it or better send me a working timer concept?
Thanks</p>
<pre><code>import time
import datetime

now = datetime.datetime.now()
later = datetime.datetime.now()
diff = int(later - now)
#countdown in sec
tcount = 10 

countd = tcount - diff
countd = str(countd)

while diff &lt; tcount:
    print("countdown:" + countd)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>As the error message says, <code>later - now</code> is a <code>datetime.timedelta</code>.  If this were assigned to a variable, say <code>diff_delta</code>, then <code>diff_delta.total_seconds()</code> would give you its value in seconds.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>A good way to get time that has passed is by using time.time()</p>
<pre><code>import time
now = time.time()
# do some stuff
elapsed time = int(time.time() - now)
</code></pre>
<p>In terms of measuring a second, maybe have it pool time time using time.time(), and then have a loop to check when the current time minus that pooled time is greater than 1. That will be one second. Repeat for as many seconds as needed. </p>
<p>Edit:
Or duh, just use time.sleep() like a comment suggested. time.sleep(1) will sleep for 1 second. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">Have a look at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.sleep" rel="nofollow noreferrer">time.sleep()</a> to wait a little in your loop.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">even with this error fixed, your main issue is that your are producing an infinite loop. you have to update "diff" in the loop.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">total_seconds is a function so it must be called to produce result</span>
