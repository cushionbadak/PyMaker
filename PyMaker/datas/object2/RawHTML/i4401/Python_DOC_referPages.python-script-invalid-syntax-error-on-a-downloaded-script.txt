<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>i want to try a script from a GameStateIntegration </p>
<pre><code>def sendHealthStatus(health): # Send health status to arduino
  if health == 100:
    arduino.write('h')
    arduino.write(str(health))
  if health &lt; 100 and &gt;= 10:
    arduino.write('h0')
    arduino.write(str(health))
  if health &lt; 10 and &gt;= 0:
    arduino.write('h00')
    arduino.write(str(health))`
</code></pre>
<p>but i get an invalid syntax for </p>
<pre><code>if health &lt; 100 and &gt;= 10:
</code></pre>
<p>in fact of the '=' sign, when I remove it , it tells me that the '&gt;' is the error</p>
<p>what is wrong with that script ?</p>

<p>Replace the line with this:</p>
<pre><code>if health &lt; 100 and health &gt;= 10:
</code></pre>
<p>(you need a value on each side of a comparison)</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Well, that is invalid syntax. So apparently you downloaded a script that doesn't work. Not your fault, but you'll probably want to avoid trying to learn from examples that don't actually work.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Anyway, it's pretty easy to guess at what the code is <i>trying</i> to do: <code>if health &lt; 100 and health &gt;= 10:</code>. Although really, that would be better written as <code>if 10 &lt;= health &lt; 100:</code>. Or, even better, <a href="https://gist.github.com/abarnert/10e8ec80cbd6d51ce17e20bc556199c1" rel="nofollow noreferrer">as an <code>if/elif/elif</code> chain so you don't need to keep checking the upper bounds</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Meanwhile, can you link to where you downloaded this from? If it's somewhere important, like the Arduino documentation, someone ought to file a bug report or equivalent. If it's just some random pastebin somewhere, just ignore it; there's lots of useless broken code in random pastebins.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">There i got this code from : <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/4xt9rf/csgo_game_state_integration_arduino_project/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/4xt9rf/…</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Python allows chained <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#comparisons" rel="nofollow noreferrer">comparison operators</a>, so you can just as well write <code>10 &lt;= health &lt; 100</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">okay the script works fine now ( i see the gamestate in the python command window) - the arduino flashes also at RX , but the LED wont work :( damn troubleshooting on "finished" scripts</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@BjörnBräucker I seriously advise you to throw it out, it looks terrible.</span>
