<p>why do I get an invalid syntax on except TypeError and how do I fix it?</p>
<pre><code>Try:
score=float(raw_input("What is your score?"))
If score&gt;100 or score&lt;0:
print "please enter a score between 100 and 0"
except TypeError:
print "Please enter your score in digits"
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>    score = float(input("What is your score?\n"))
    try:
        if score &gt; 100 or score &lt; 0:
            print("please enter a score between 100 and 0")
        elif score &gt;= 80:
            print("GPA is 8.0 and Grade is A+")
        elif score &gt;= 70:
            print("GPA is 7.0 and Grade is A")
        elif score &gt;= 65:
            print("GPA is 6.5 and Grade is B")
        elif score &gt;= 60:
            print("GPA is 6.0 and Grade is C")
        elif score &gt;= 55:
            print("GPA is 5.5 and Grade is D")
        elif score &gt;= 50:
            print("GPA is 5.0 and Grade is E")
        else:
            print("GPA is 0 and Grade is O")
    except TypeError:
        print("Please enter your score in digits")
</code></pre>
<p>except should be exactly under 'try'. You didn't add under try so got invalid syntax</p>
