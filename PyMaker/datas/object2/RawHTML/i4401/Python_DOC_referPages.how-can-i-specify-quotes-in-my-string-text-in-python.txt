<p>The command I want to run from my python script is:</p>
<pre><code>tool-manager-cli -a "somexml.xml" -c "another.xml"
</code></pre>
<p>My python code is:</p>
<pre><code>command1 = """ tool-manager-cli -a "somexml.xml" -c "another.xml" """
subprocess.Popen(command1)
</code></pre>
<p>However when I run my py script, I get SyntaxError: invalid syntax as my error for this line.</p>
<p>How can I specify quotes(" ") in my string text without closing it or invalid syntax?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Try using single quotes to differentiate like so </p>
<pre><code>command1 = """ tool-manager-cli -a 'somexml.xml' -c 'another.xml' """
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use format method to structure your command:</p>
<pre><code>command1= "{} {} {} {} {}".format("tool-managel-cli","-a", "somexml.xml","-c","another.xml")
subprocess.Popen(command1)
</code></pre>
<p>You can also concat by <code>+</code> , but its tedious ofcourse</p>
<pre><code>command1 ="tool-manager-cli"+" -a"+ " somexml.xml" + " -c "+" another.xml"
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Use single quotes <code>'</code> on the outside instead. Or escape your double quotes with blackslashes <code>\"</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Adding onto Loocid you can also specify that your string is rawtext by putting an r in front of the string, which will escape all the quotes inside</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Loocid putting single quotes dosent seem to work when I have 2 file paths using " ".  Can you show me what you eman with backslashes in my code?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Yubi <code>command1 =  "tool-manager-cli -a \"somexml.xml\" -c \"another.xml\""</code> However theres no reason the single quotes wouldnt work, they work fine for me. You must be doing something wrong.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Voting to close as typo based on OP's last comment.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It wont work, getting OSError: [WinError 87] The parameter is incorrect error...the xml file path need to be in double quotes.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">So this is a quick guess, ill look further into the issue and come back, but try replacing the single comma with &amp;quot; so &amp;quot;another.xml&amp;quot;</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yeah... @quot; does not work either.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">My bad I had another syntax error while using the single quotes, my bad. It works now thanks :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">There's no reason whatsoever why &amp;quot; should or could work in this context. This is not HTML, &amp;quot; will always be interpreted as just 6 normal characters, not as the quotation mark. The escape sequences in python strings are listed here <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#string-and-bytes-literals" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/reference/â€¦</a> - \" or \x34 or using it unescaped if the string is surrounded with singlequotes would all work.</span>
