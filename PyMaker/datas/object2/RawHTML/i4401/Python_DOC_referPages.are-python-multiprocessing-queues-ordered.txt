<p>Forgive me if this is obvious, but I can't tell from the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/queue.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation</a> whether the output when using a queue is ordered. That is, if the inputs are <code>[1, 2, 3]</code> will the outputs be <code>f(1), f(2), f(3)</code>, or can they be out of order?</p>
<p>Edit: I understand that the inputs are handled in FIFO. But does FIFO retrieval necessarily guarantee that the results are also returned in order?</p>

<p>In a FIFO queue, the first tasks added are the first retrieved</p>

<p>Yes, multiprocessing queue are FIFO (first in, first out).</p>

<p>Multiprocessing queue is never been out of order. From the docs it's clearly mentioned of 3 types. <code>FIFO</code>, <code>LIFO</code> and priority queue(a way to customize the order). The default order ie. <code>class Queue.Queue</code> is using <code>FIFO</code></p>

<p>So considering that,  yes multiprocessing queue maintain the order.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Their support threading/process concurrently. So yes.</span>
