<p>I have a python class ReportGenerator which needs temporary directory to store intermediate files.
Once object of ReportGenerator is destroyed my code is required to delete temporary folder.</p>
<p>Where to place directory removal code to make sure that once object is not referenced, the temp folder will be deleted. </p>
<p>In C++ it is obvious to delete folder in destructor of class. In python there is a <code>__del__</code> but as I understand from other posts it is not recommended to use it in such situation. So in general what is a right way in python so one object can own a resource and release once it destroyed?</p>

<p>Have a look at the  <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/tempfile.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><em>tempfile</em> module</a> . Using the <em>tempfile.TemporaryFile</em> function seems to fit your need.</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/tempfile.html#tempfile.TemporaryDirectory" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>tempfile.TemporaryDirectory</code></a> in a <code>with</code> context does what you want. this is from the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/tempfile.html#examples" rel="nofollow noreferrer">examples for <code>tempfile</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code># create a temporary directory using the context manager
&gt;&gt;&gt; import tempfile
&gt;&gt;&gt; with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as tmpdirname:
...     print('created temporary directory', tmpdirname)
&gt;&gt;&gt;
# directory and contents have been removed
</code></pre>
<p>when you exit the with block, the directory and its contents are recursively removed.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">This may solve my issue right now. Thanks for that. However, there may be other type of resources for which such modules will not be available</span>
