<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I get a small code in the form of a string.</p>
<pre><code>"IF 'Physics'
 then
   'Passed in physics'
 else IF 'Chemistry'
 then 
    'Passed in Chemistry'
 ENDIF
</code></pre>
<p>ENDIF". </p>
<p>I need to break this string into multiple values based on the IF and ENDIF.
My output should be </p>
<p>1) IF 'Physics' then 'Passed in Physics' </p>
<p>2) IF 'Chemistry' then 'Passed in Chemistry'.</p>
<p>The string which I get will have nested IF, so need to identify and break it into multiple values.</p>
<p>Thank you

<p>Learn how to use if statement in python:<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#if-statements" rel="nofollow noreferrer">if statement</a></p>
<p>If you need to convert a String into if-else statement, learn how to use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html?highlight=regex" rel="nofollow noreferrer">regex</a><br/></p>
<p>so first put your string into a variable like <strong>var</strong><br/>
var should contains a line break like "\n", thus  <br/></p>
<pre><code>var = var.replace("\n","").replace("else","\n").replace("ENDIF",".")
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">I think usually the best is to build a small <i>parser</i> for this (from a <i>context-free</i> grammar).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sheesh... Formatted code please!!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Okay, but what exactly is your question? Do you expect us to just provide you with the Python code with the functionality you described? What have you tried so far, and why hasn't it worked?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I don't need python code. I need guidance to start with. With the guidance, I will write the code.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hi Church,Here is the formatted code... IF 'Pyhsics'    'Passed in physics' else   IF 'Chemistry'     IF 'Practicals' 	   'Passed in Chemistry' 	else 	    'Filed in Chemistry'   	ENDIF   else     'Passed in all'   ENDIF	 ENDIF</span>
