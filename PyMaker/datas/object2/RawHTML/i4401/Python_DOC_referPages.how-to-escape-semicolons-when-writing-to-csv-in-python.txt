<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have a list of lists in python that represents data to be written in a csv file. My code for that is :</p>
<pre><code>for n, d, p in zip(names, dates, posts):
        writer.writerow([i, n, d, p])
</code></pre>
<p>However, some of the strings in posts contain semicolons, and this creates new cells in the csv. I've looked online and tried</p>
<ol>
<li>setting quoting=csv.QUOTE_ALL</li>
<li>wrapping each post string inside double quotes</li>
<li>wrapping the semicolons inside double quotes</li>
<li>using normal python write instead of csv.writer</li>
</ol>
<p>Nothing's worked so far. Any help, every online answer to escaping comma's I've found involves (1) or (2) which doesn't work for me. Please help!</p>
<p>Edit: Here's an example of what I mean</p>
<p>When I write the row ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd;e'], the d and e get put into different cells, like:</p>
<pre><code>a | b | c | d | e
</code></pre>
<p>As opposed to what I want, which is:</p>
<pre><code>a | b | c | d;e
</code></pre>

<p>I will recommend using pandas for converting data into CSV as it's much easier and you don't need to care about handling characters.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; arr = [{"a":1,"b":2,"c":3},{"a":2,"b":3,"c":4}]
&gt;&gt;&gt; dataFrame = pd.DataFrame(arr)
&gt;&gt;&gt; dataFrame
   a  b  c
0  1  2  3
1  2  3  4
&gt;&gt;&gt; dataFrame.to_csv("test.csv",index = 0)
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>You can use tab as a delimiter. </p>
<p>You can write the file and open later using <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">pandas</a> or <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">csv</a>, setting delimiter as <code>“\t”</code>. </p>
<p>It works for opening in Excel or similar programs too. </p>
<p>Example using csv for writing:</p>
<pre><code>import csv

with open(&lt;filename&gt;, "w") as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file, delimiter="\t")
</code></pre>
<p>Example using csv for reading:</p>
<pre><code>import csv

with open(&lt;filename&gt;, "r") as file:
    reader = csv.reader(file, delimiter="\t")
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Please provide a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve">Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example</a>. What do you mean "creates new cells"??</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for the tip @juanpa.arrivillaga, made an edit hopefully makes more sense now</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That is not a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve">Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example</a>. You need to provide data and the code you wrote to actually reproduce the problem. You are using pipe-character <code>|</code> as a delimiter? I cannot reproduce your problem with semicolons. Indeed, I still don't understand what, exactly, your problem is.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for the response--tried using a dataframe but run into the same issues with semicolons, it creates a new cell (i.e. in your example, if (0, c) contained value 3;5 it would add the 5 into a new cell on the right, essentially creating a new column after c).</span>
