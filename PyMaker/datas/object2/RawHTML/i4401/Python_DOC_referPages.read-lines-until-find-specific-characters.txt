<p>I'm trying to read a file (reading every line in this file, with letters, numbers and characters). The script needs to work generally and the files will be similar but with some changes.</p>
<p>Now it reads when it finds a line looks like this: "**HWCOLOR COMP 1066 30". I need that the script read all lines until it finds " **HW ". The script below is working for first problem explained.</p>
<p>How can the script be written to read the file until it finds "**HW" and stops there?</p>
<p>I tried to replace '**HWCOLOR COMP 1066 30" with **HW" but it won't work, because all characters don't match.</p>
<pre><code>data = [] 

with open('valvebody_nodes_rec.txt') as f:
    # Skips text before the beginning of the interesting block:
    for line in f:
        if line.strip() == '*NODE, SYSTEM=R':
            break    

    # Reads text until the end of the block:
    for line in f:
        if line.strip() == '**HWCOLOR COMP       1066    30':
            break
        data.append([x.strip() for x in line.split(',')])   #intersect text
</code></pre>

<p>I'd recommend using a regular expression instead of string match.
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html</a></p>
<pre><code>match = re.search('your regex here', line)
if match:
    ...
</code></pre>
<p>If you aren't familiar with regular expressions, go find a tutorial and once you know the basics play some <a href="https://alf.nu/RegexGolf" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Regex Golf</a>.  Regular expressions are extremely powerful and useful, so I'd strongly recommend learning them.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you could also do something like</p>
<pre><code>if line.strip().startswith('**HW'):
</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code>if '**HW' in line:
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">did you try using : if line.startswith("**HW"): as the condition</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Do the lines <i>begin</i> with the strings you are looking for? Are they the only content on the line?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Kenstars Never thought about it. I will try.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@pstatix Only content on the line. That line will always start with "**HW ...".</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The second part of your answer worked for me. I will look forward with your recommendation. Thanks.</span>
