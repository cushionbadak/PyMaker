<p>I am looking for a method of doing the equivalent of the command below using Python:</p>
<pre><code>openssl rsa -aes256 -in serverKey.pem -out newkey.pem
</code></pre>
<p>I am trying to find out if this is possible in Python since Python meets my cross platform requirements and find a Python built in! Thanks!!</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>There are many ways to do this, but I'm pretty sure the subprocess (more info available at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html</a> ) module is best due to it being intended as a replacement for older ways of doing this such as <code>os.system()</code>. 
For me, if I don't need to capture output and want to keep things looking clean, I use <code>subprocess.call()</code>. You can check for OS using <code>sys</code></p>
<pre><code>import subprocess
import sys
if sys.platform == 'win32':
    cmd  = "windows alternative command"
else:
    cmd = "openssl blah"
subprocess.call(cmd, shell=True)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">I'm looking for a Cross platform method.  Hopefully a built in.  I don't believe that openssl is available on Windows.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Keith ah I understand now. The code I posted is for running command-line commands - if you figure out a way to do it on windows I will update my answer to use the correct command on Windows</span>
