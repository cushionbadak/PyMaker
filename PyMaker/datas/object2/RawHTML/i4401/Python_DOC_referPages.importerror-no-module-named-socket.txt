<p>I am trying to execute a small python code from CPP environment(Visual studio 2008) for test automation.  When I try to add the following code in python script <code>import socket</code>. The python code is not getting imported. I am getting the below error.</p>
<pre><code>Py_initialize succeededTraceback (most recent call last):
  File "E:\Code\MSVC\PythonTest\Proj\Pythoncheck\Debug\main.py", line 2, in &lt;module&gt;
    import socket
  File "C:\Python27\Lib\socket.py", line 47, in &lt;module&gt;
    import _socket
ImportError: No module named _socket
</code></pre>
<p>But when i execute the python script alone(<code>python main.py</code>), there is no such issue in importing socket. The python script is getting executed fine. Has anyone faced this earlier? Could anyone help me with the solution?</p>
<p>The code <code>main.py</code> contains</p>
<pre><code>import sys
import socket

print"santhosh"

def startmain():

    while True:
        time.sleep(5000)


pingcount = 0
print "InstartMain"
</code></pre>
<p>Regards,
Santhosh</p>

<p>The environment where you are launching python might not be the same as the environment where you are launching your CPP program. Try setting <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONHOME" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PYTHONHOME</a></p>
<p>[I know this won't help the original poster, but I ran into this issue trying to use pythonnet from C# in 2018]</p>
