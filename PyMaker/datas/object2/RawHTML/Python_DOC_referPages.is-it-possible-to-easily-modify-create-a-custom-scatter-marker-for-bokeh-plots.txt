<p>I am relatively new to python and bokeh plotting.  What I am trying to do is to use scatter plot to display wind speed and its direction.  I wanted to use the triangle marker and use the rotation to indicate wind speed.  However, since bokeh default triangle is a equilateral triangle, the wind direction actually gets confusing (you can't tell which is head which is tail).</p>
<p>Is there any way I can change/create my own triangle that is Isosceles instead? this is so that I can tell which is head which is tail in the triangle.</p>
<p>here is a sample of what I have:

<p>Just to be clear here is a quick sketch of what shape marker I am looking fore:

<p>EDTI:</p>
<p>Here is a sample dataset.  I have also used the arrow as suggested by J'e. Here is a sample result:</p>

<p>This works ok but is not perfect.  Because I plan to embed this plot and stretch it (sizing_mode="stretch_both"), the angles will look off.  I don't think this was a problem when using rectangles and angles to draw.</p>

<p>There doesn't seem to be anything in the API that will do this directly.  Using <code>bokeh.models VeeHead</code>, you can draw a VeeHead arrow </p>
<pre><code>import numpy as np
from bokeh.plotting import figure, show, output_file
from bokeh.models import ColumnDataSource
from bokeh.models import Arrow, VeeHead

# Create a sin wave of x/y coordinates 
N = 300
x = np.linspace(0, 4*np.pi, N)
y = np.sin(x)

source = ColumnDataSource(data=dict(x=x, y=y))
TOOLS = "pan,wheel_zoom,box_zoom,reset,save"

# create a new plot and add a renderer
p = figure(tools=TOOLS, width=700, height=700, title=None)
p.line('x', 'y', source=source)


for i in range(N-1):
    p.add_layout(Arrow(end=VeeHead(size=25,fill_alpha=0.5), x_start=x[i], y_start=y[i], x_end=x[i+1], y_end=y[i+1])) 
show(p)
</code></pre>

<p>Rather than having virtually no tail like in the first example, you you add one like in this example.  Note that the tail has it's own style which I didn't set in this example. </p>
<pre><code>import numpy as np
from bokeh.plotting import figure, show, output_file
from bokeh.models import ColumnDataSource
from bokeh.models import Arrow, VeeHead

# prepare some date
N = 300
x = np.linspace(0, 4*np.pi, N)
y = np.sin(x)

source = ColumnDataSource(data=dict(x=x, y=y))
TOOLS = "pan,wheel_zoom,box_zoom,reset,save"

# create a new plot and add a renderer
p = figure(tools=TOOLS, width=700, height=700, title=None)
p.line('x', 'y', source=source)

for i in range(11, N-1):
    m = (y[i]-y[i-1])/(x[i]-x[i-1])
    Y = m*(x[i]-x[i-10]) # not point slope
    p.add_layout(Arrow(end=VeeHead(size=25,fill_alpha=0.5), x_start=x[i-10], y_start=Y, x_end=x[i], y_end=y[i]))

<span class="comment-copy">To clarify, you want a plot with a number of triangles that each "rotates" to indicate the wind direction for the given lon/lat?  It may be helpful to add an image to your post.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, I can easily create a plot with markers and rotate each one based on wind direction.  However, with a triangle of equal length sides, it become difficult to distinguish which way the triangle was actually rotated (see pictures added to comments)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you like the look but are concerned with the stretch changing the angle, perhaps thinking about the problem in terms of limits would help make your Delta X, Delta Y values very very small.  There is no realistic amount of resizing that would change the angle. - If you're happy with the VeeHead, don't forget to accept the answer. You will also get reputation points for doing so.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The only issue with arrows are that they take two points in order to be drawn (not an angle).  it's is easily done if  both the x and y axis are of the same unit and same size.  It get's more complicated when x is time based and y is mph.  Now if there was a way I could get the "length" of x axis and "length of y axis to figure out proportions, then i could used this.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">can you add a couple rows of you data to your original question?  I think this can still be done</span>
