<p>new to scrapy just trying to figure it out to see if I can use it to scrape a web serial I'm reading so I can read it offline on the way to school and I can't figure out how to fix this error I keep getting.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TypeError: parse_wordpress() missing 1 required positional argument: 'response'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think this means the website isn't corresponding properly but I can't think of a way to fix the issue.</p>
<pre><code>    import scrapy
from scrapy.spiders import CrawlSpider, Rule
from scrapy.selector import HtmlXPathSelector
from scrapy.linkextractors import LinkExtractor

class BlogrollSpider(CrawlSpider):
    name = 'BLOG ARCHIVER'
    allowed_domains = ['blogroll.com', 'wordpress.com', 'blogspot.com']
    start_urls = ['https://parahumans.wordpress.com/2011/06/11/1-1/']
    rules = (
        Rule(LinkExtractor(allow=(),
        restrict_xpaths=('//p[@title="Next Chapter"]',)),
        callback="parse_wordpress",
        follow= True),
        )

    def parse_wordpress(self, response):
        hxs = HtmlXPathSelector(response)
        paragraphs = hxs.select("//p")
        for paragraphs in paragraphs:
            paragraph = paragraphs.select("a/text()").extract()
            print (paragraph)

        return item
blog1 = BlogrollSpider()
blog1.parse_wordpress()
print ("code is reaching here")

<p>this is the website/web serial I'm trying to download : '<a href="https://parahumans.wordpress.com/2011/06/11/1-1/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://parahumans.wordpress.com/2011/06/11/1-1/</a>'</p>

<p>You shouldn't call your parse function directly. It is called automatically when Scrapy gets a response.</p>
<p>Instead, use the <a href="https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/commands.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">command line runner</a>.
For example, if you have a full project:</p>
<pre><code>scrapy crawl "BLOG ARCHIVER"
</code></pre>
<p>Or if you have only a spider file:</p>
<pre><code>scrapy runspider my_spider.py
</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively, write a <a href="https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/practices.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">custom runner script</a>.</p>
<p>As an aside, I would suggest you work through the <a href="https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/intro/tutorial.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">official tutorial</a> as it covers how to run a spider.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">blog1.parse_wordpress() you don't have to call this directly. Try to delete the line and call the script with <code>scrapy runspider &lt;file.py&gt;</code></span>
