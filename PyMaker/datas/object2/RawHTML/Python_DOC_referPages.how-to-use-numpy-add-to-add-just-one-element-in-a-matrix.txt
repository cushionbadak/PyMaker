<p>I would like to increment part of an array in python as fast as possible. I use a simple loop :</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; test = [0,0,0,0,0]
&gt;&gt;&gt; for i in xrange(1, 3):
    test[i] += 1

&gt;&gt;&gt; test
[0,1,1,0,0]
</code></pre>
<p>In my program the test list contains several millions elements. Maybe numpy could be the solution ?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>NumPy is indeed a solution:</p>
<pre><code>import numpy as np
arr = np.array(test)
arr[1:3] += 1
</code></pre>
<p>You can use <code>arr.tolist()</code> if you really need to go back to a <code>list</code> but better would be to use a NumPy array right from the start, wherever you get your data.</p>
