<p><img alt="Screenshot" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2Uqxx.png"/> Is there a <em>simple</em> way to have your programm open an input windows after the last one was closed? I want to input 200 parameters and the programm should not open 200 windows at the same time but only one at a time.
(I just started Python, so if this is to complicated, just tell me)</p>

<p>Oh I see the error now. You are creating multiple Tk() windows in a while loop and then running <code>mainloop()</code> at the end, which will show the windows that have been created all at once.</p>
<p>The easy solution would be to include the mainloop inside the while loop. Like this:</p>
<pre><code>while i &lt; 9:
    master = Tk()
    # setup the window
    mainloop()
</code></pre>
<p>So when you close the window, mainloop will finish and the loop will start again and create a new window.</p>
<p>There's another issue though, your check for <code>l == i</code> will always be false (on the first run <code>i</code> will be <code>0</code> and <code>l</code> will be 1, so i will never increment and <code>i &lt; 9</code> will always be true and the while loop will continue infinitely). Why don't you use a range instead?</p>
<pre><code>for i in range(9):
    master = Tk()
    # setup the window
    mainloop()
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Hi, what GUI toolkit/library are you using? Can you post the part of the code that opens the input window?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@solarc I use JetBrains PyCharm Community Edition 2018.3.5. I will add a screenshot to the original post.</span>
