<p>I am using both ImageJ and scikit-image to analyze 3D images. 
My original image is 16-bit and it is very big. I converted 16-bit image to 8-bit image in imageJ so that I can work easily.<br/>
Now when I am reading the image with scikit-image module both 16-bit and 8-bit image showing 16-bit only. Can anyone suggest how to read images as 8-bit in scikit-image module?</p>
<pre><code>from skimage import io,color
image = io.imread(files)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can perform the conversion through integer division (<code>//</code>) or bitwise right shift (<code>&gt;&gt;</code>) followed by type casting.</p>
<pre><code>image = np.uint8(io.imread('Image8bit.tif') &gt;&gt; 8)
</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code>image = np.uint8(io.imread('Image8bit.tif') // 2**8)
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Hi, Thanks for your answer. I am sharing small sample of 8bit 3d image got from ImageJ in this google drive link. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VFL-C6Jk9JKUYE40uzHu9bAlNLiwdSPE/view" rel="nofollow noreferrer">drive.google.com/file/d/1VFL-C6Jk9JKUYE40uzHu9bAlNLiwdSPE/view</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">When I am reading this image from skimage it is showing as 16 bit. Can you suggest how to read as it is as 8 bit.</span>
