StackOverflow is not a design, coding, research, or tutorial resource.  The bracket notation is introductory Python syntax for indexing (e.g. a list).  Work through the applicable tutorials.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I know square bracket is used for indexing. But, this one is not covered in my study materials. I have searched for the whole day. And, I could not find the answer. If I was able to find the answer that easily I would have not stated this post.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I suggest you clarify your last statement. Neither of the first two kinds of indexing (using lists of indexes) work with Python lists, lists only accept individual indexes or slices as indexes. Numpy arrays accept more.</span>
