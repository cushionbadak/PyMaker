<p>Note: Tried the same command after using "conda clean --packages". But still the issue persists.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://github.com/conda/conda/issues/6057" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this GitHub issue</a> about the same problem (transaction also fails on <strong>automat</strong>), there are a few things that seem to get it working:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Cleaning</strong>. You've already tried <code>conda clean --packages</code>, so maybe you can ignore this one, but the thread also suggests <code>conda clean --all</code>. Personally, I think that's a bit blunt.  The users who it worked for may have only needed <code>--packages</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Update Conda</strong>. Many seem to get around this by updating Conda, <code>conda update -n base conda</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Update Anaconda</strong>. Some said it worked to run <code>conda update anaconda</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Freeze installed packages</strong>. Some users noticed that it only happens when planned transactions include updating other packages. One can prevent other packages from updating by using <code>conda install --freeze-installed ecos</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Issue with latest Automat</strong>. One user reports the issue is specific to the recent 0.7.0 version of Automat. They report having a successful transaction by explicitly requesting the previous Automat version, e.g., <code>conda install ecos automat=0.6.*</code></p></li>
</ol>
<h2>Recommendation</h2>
<p>I would try <strong>(2)</strong> first. </p>
<p>Something I find strange in all this is that everyone reporting this is on Windows, but Conda attempts to install the <strong>noarch</strong> version (as indicated by the <code>py_1</code> in the tarball). Nothing particularly wrong with that, but on OSX, Conda specifically tries to install the <strong>osx-64</strong> version. Hence, I would attempt to explicitly install the <strong>win-64</strong> version of 0.7.0 and see if that works. That is,</p>
<pre><code>conda install conda-forge/win-64::automat
</code></pre>
<p>If that doesn't work, I suppose I would try <strong>(4)</strong> or <strong>(5)</strong> next.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">According to (<a href="https://anaconda.org/anaconda/ecos" rel="nofollow noreferrer">anaconda.org/anaconda/ecos</a>) you must run <code>conda install -c anaconda ecos</code> to install that package I guess</span>
