<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I built a CNN model for image classification using the Keras library. However training takes many hours. Once I trained my model, how can I use it without training once more? I mean after I trained my model, I want to use it many times. 
Because I will use my model in android studio. 
Any help is appreciated</p>
<p>Thank YOU </p>

<p>You can easily save your model after the training process by using:</p>
<pre><code>model.save('my_model.h5')
</code></pre>
<p>you can later load that model by using:</p>
<pre><code>model = load_model('my_model.h5')
</code></pre>
<p>for more details have a look at the documentation: <a href="https://keras.io/getting-started/faq/#how-can-i-save-a-keras-model" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://keras.io/getting-started/faq/#how-can-i-save-a-keras-model</a></p>

<span class="comment-copy">I could not find it before I post my question, after you wrote I realized that. Sorry</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you very much, it really helped.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Is there any documentation for the using the model inside of the mobile application. Because ı need to use my model in mobile phone. Thank you</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@GhostDede I couldn't find a detailed documentation, but there are many examples how to use it on mobile. You will have to build a tensorflow model out of your keras model first.
