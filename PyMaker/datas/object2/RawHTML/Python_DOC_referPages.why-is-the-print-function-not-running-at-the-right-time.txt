<p>Here is my code:</p>
<pre><code>import time as t

print('hello', end=' ')
t.sleep(1)
print('hello', end=' ')
t.sleep(1)
print('hello', end=' ')
t.sleep(1)
</code></pre>
<p>My problem is that all the print commands are executed after the sleep commands, and that's not my intended output.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>It's because of output buffering. The buffer isn't flushed until a newline is printed. Since you used <code>end=' '</code>, there's no newline after each word, so the buffer isn't flushed until the script ends.</p>
<p>You can use the <code>flush=True</code> option to force it to flush immediately.</p>
<pre><code>import time as t
import sys

print('hello', end=' ', flush=True)
t.sleep(1)
print('hello', end=' ', flush=True)
t.sleep(1)
print('hello', end=' ', flush=True)
t.sleep(1)
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Where are you printing to? I cannot reproduce, but there is a buffer for <code>stdout</code> and likely it's not getting flushed.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I mean, have you directed stdout somewhere? This should print fine to a console.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Do you mean that it takes three seconds then prints hello three times? Because it printed hello three times with a one second break between for me</span>
<span class="comment-copy">There is an optional <code>flush</code> parameter to <code>print()</code> in Python 3. If you add <code>flush=True</code>, <code>print</code> should print immediately.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">This won't give the desired behaviour though, I don't think. I can get the output fine and on a single line being sequentially built</span>

<span class="comment-copy">Gotcha @Barmar.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">print('hello\n', end=' ') why this one work correct? what does new line work in print??</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Because you're writing a newline to the output buffer @mohamadmahdireisi, causing it to be flushed.</span>
