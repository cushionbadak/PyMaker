<p>My logger looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>import logging

logfile = 'name.log'

formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s\t%(message)s')


def setup_logger(name, log_file, level=logging.INFO):


    handler = logging.FileHandler(log_file)
    handler.setFormatter(formatter)

    logger = logging.getLogger(name)
    logger.setLevel(level)
    logger.addHandler(handler)

    return logger

logger = setup_logger('first_logger', logfile)


logger.info("Col1: {}\t : Col2 {}\t Col3: {}".format(a, str(b), c))
</code></pre>
<p>The output looks like:</p>
<pre><code>2018-01-01 19:03:23,126 Col1:106 Col2:"some string"  Col3: 12
2018-01-01 19:03:24,127 Col1:7676 Col2:"some string"  Col3: 80
2018-01-01 19:03:10,12  Col1:2 Col2:"some string"  Col3: 7
</code></pre>
<p>I would like to write the logger so that I get such an output format:</p>
<pre><code>Timestamp Col1 Col2 Col3
2018-01-01 19:03:23,126  106 "some string" 12
2018-01-01 19:03:24,127 7676 "some string"  80
2018-01-01 19:03:10,12  2 "some string"  7
</code></pre>
<p>So instead of logging key-values I would like to print the keys (column names) as a header.</p>
<p>Is it possible do to so? </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I agree with Norrius that the logging might not be the right tool, but if you insist for whatever reason, you can log the header first, and then log only the values:</p>
<pre><code>logger.info("Col1 Col2 Col3")

logger.info("{}\t {}\t {}".format(a, str(b), c))
</code></pre>
<p>Although this would log the timestamp at the header as well, so you need to play with the format between lines.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Sounds like an <a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/66377/what-is-the-xy-problem">XY problem</a> honestly. Why do you need this? Are you trying to log a table?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Norrius, well yes, I would like to log a table.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I have some doubts if <code>logging</code> is the right tool for the job. If this is the main output of your program, using <code>print</code> would be easier. However, you can probably achieve what you want via <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/6847862/1983772">changing the formatter</a> temporarily.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Norrius, as you mentioned it might be not the right tool for this. I wanted to avoid writing into a csv file, but might be the easiest way. Thanks for your comment though.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>csv</code></a> makes it fairly easy.</span>
