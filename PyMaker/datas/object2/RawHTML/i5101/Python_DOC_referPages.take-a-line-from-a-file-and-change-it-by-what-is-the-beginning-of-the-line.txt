<p>So I want to look in the file something and when I read a line that begins with # I want to print something in the front of the line and in the end of it.</p>
<pre><code>file = open("something.py","r")
infile = file.readlines()

for line in infile:
    if line.find("#") !=-1:
        index = line.find("#")
        print("BLABLABLA",the line that begins with #,"BLABLABLA", end="")

<p>How about this:</p>
<pre><code># Open file for reading
with open("infile.txt", "r") as infile:
    # Open another file for writing
    with open("outfile.txt", "w") as outfile:
        # Read each line from the input file
        for line in infile.readlines():
            # Check if line begins with keyword "Hello"
            if line.startswith("Hello"):
                # If it does, prepend and append something to the line
                line = "Prepend! &gt;&gt;&gt; " + line.strip() + " &lt;&lt;&lt; Append!"
            # Finally, write the line to outfile
            outfile.write(line + "\n")
</code></pre>
<p>Input:</p>
<pre><code>Hello, this is a line.
Hello, this is another line.
Goodbye, these were all the lines
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>Prepend! &gt;&gt;&gt; Hello, this is a line. &lt;&lt;&lt; Append!
Prepend! &gt;&gt;&gt; Hello, this is another line. &lt;&lt;&lt; Append!
Goodbye, these were all the lines

<p>Simple &amp; short. The last two lines will change depending on your flag and what you want to actually do with the line read.</p>

        if line.startswith('#'):

<span class="comment-copy">What's wrong with the code you have?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You should start with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.startswith" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>.startswith()</code></a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">do you have to do it in same file or can write in new one?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Am I supposed to put index in the place of  "the line that begins with# #"??</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I want the entire line that begins with # to be between my two BLABLABLA not just #.</span>
