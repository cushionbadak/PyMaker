<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I am writing a data in a file using append method of file handling but it is not being shown in a file.
Also while reading a file it shows a Null byte error.</p>
<pre><code>with open("filename.txt",'a') as f_ro_panel:
    f_ro_panel.write('\n'+str(vl)+'\t'+str(op_minute)+'\t'+str(bcc)+\
           '\t'+str(temp)+'\t'+str(tds2)+'\t'+str(tds1)+'\t'+str(pfr)+\
           '\t'+str(rfr)+'\t'+str(rwpc)+'\t'+str(hppc)+'\t'+str(twv)+\
           '\t'+str(rwv)+'\t'+str(uvst)+'\t'+str(tsc)+'\t'+str(tlv))
    f_ro_panel.close()
</code></pre>
<p>This is the code of writing.</p>
<p>while reading I am using this program</p>
<pre><code>with open("filename.txt", 'rU') as my_file:
    reader = csv.reader(my_file, delimiter='\t')
    my_list = list(reader)
    ListLen = len(my_list)
    my_file.close()
</code></pre>
<p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Few things you can check:</p>
<ol>
<li>Variables v1, op_minute have correct values assigned to them</li>
<li>Check if you are able to read the current content of the file without appending anything (if the file already contains some data).There might be some issue with the delimiter.</li>
</ol>
<p>I tried to run your code and it works fine for me.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Don't call <code>.close()</code> ath the end of your with block. The file is automatically closed when the <code>with</code> ends</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Jsut to be clear, when you open the file with an editor you also don't see your printed text?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Reading from the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.reader" rel="nofollow noreferrer">brochure</a> brother:  <code>If csvfile is a file object, it should be opened with newline=''.</code> You have an example of use there too.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I see no issue with code which is doing <code>write</code> operation, can you close while write operation is going on and once it is completed then open and check?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">how do i check if the data is written or not in programming</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This belongs to a comment, not to an answer.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">while reading it shows file contains NULL byte error</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@AkashAgarwal Did you check the above points?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I checked by reading the content in file and i found one gap between two line and find the data which i was trying to write</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Please tell me what is the problem</span>
