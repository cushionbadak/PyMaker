<p>I am trying to install <code>ffmpeg</code> in order to use it on OpenAI to record videos. I have installed it using <code>brew install ffmpeg</code> but somehow when I compile my code I get the same error, it is like the package is not recognized by my <code>virtualenv</code> where I am working.</p>
<p>Error on Python console:</p>
<pre><code>raise error.DependencyNotInstalled("""Found neither the ffmpeg nor avconv executables. On OS X, you can install ffmpeg via `brew install ffmpeg`. On most Ubuntu variants, `sudo apt-get install ffmpeg` should do it. On Ubuntu 14.04, however, you'll need to install avconv with `sudo apt-get install libav-tools`.""")
</code></pre>
<p>However, when I execute which <code>ffmpeg</code> I got the following path <code>/usr/local/bin/ffmpeg</code>.</p>
<p>It seems like that <strong>Anaconda</strong> for example needs a specific command to install this package into its environment, it is the same for <strong>virtualenv</strong>?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>This is not possible. FFmpeg is a separate application. If you need to use ffmpeg in python, you either need to <code>pip install</code> a wrapper for python (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/kkroening/ffmpeg-python" rel="nofollow noreferrer">ffmpeg-python</a>, <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ffmpy/0.2.0" rel="nofollow noreferrer">ffmpy</a>, etc). But those wrappers does not use the full power of FFmpeg. </p>
<p>Instead what I suggest is to execute command line FFmpeg command in python using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>subprocess</code></a>.</p>

<p>This is possible. A conda recipe for <code>ffmpeg</code> is available via the <code>menpo</code> or <code>conda-forge</code> channels. Try using this command:</p>
<pre><code>conda create -n newenv -c conda-forge ffmpeg
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">You said:"seems like that Anaconda for example needs a specific command to install this package into its environment". What is that specific command on Anaconda? In Anaconda, installing ffmpeg is a disaster. It doesn't work in my environments at all.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yeah you can use <code>pip</code> to install it into you <b>anaconda environment</b>. <code>/anaconda/envs/your_env_name/bin/pip install ffmpeg</code> with the name of you <b>environment</b> as your_env_name.</span>
