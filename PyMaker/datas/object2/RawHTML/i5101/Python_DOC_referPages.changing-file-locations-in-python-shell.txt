<p>When using the python shell, how can I change to lets say, C:\etc.? I have a batch file that changes to the shell, and I want a way to change it back.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The Python interpreter has a file path pointing to the location where Python is installed unless you launch it from another location (i.e. from terminal/batch-file/file explorer/application) then it will take the location of that instead.  If you want to go to a file location you must program it.  </p>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>os</code></a> module can do what you want.  It provides extensive file/folder manipulation including changing dictionary using <code>os.chdir()</code>.  Both full paths and relative paths are supported.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt;import os
&gt;&gt;&gt;os.getcwd()
'C:\\Users\\Username\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python36-32'
&gt;&gt;&gt;os.chdir('C:/ect')
&gt;&gt;&gt;os.getcwd()
'C:\\ect'
</code></pre>
<p>You can delete and rename files using this module as well.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">What do you mean by "change"? Change the working directory? Run a subprocess? Exit the python interpreter?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Python does nothing to change the working directory at startup. It depends <i>entirely</i> on how it was run, such as a shortcut or .py script run from a file explorer window, or running <code>python</code> in a command-line shell. The working directory is set when a process is created via <code>CreateProcess</code>. If not set explicitly, then it's implicitly set to the working directory of the parent process.</span>
