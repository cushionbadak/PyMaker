<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I am trying to <code>pip install importlib</code> with python 3.6, but I get an Import Error saying: 'NO Module named "importlib.util"'. This also comes up when I try to <code>pip install imagescanner</code>, which is my real intention. Building an App that connects to Image Scanner Devices, but that's another problem...
Thanks for any help!</p>

<p><code>importlib</code> is builtin with Python 3 (at least for me), you can import it directly without installing anything.</p>
<p>The error from pip install is possibly due to <code>importlib</code> is builtin and there's no distribution that's publicly available.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Seems to me that <code>importlib</code> is built-in so you do not need to install it by <code>pip</code>: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Have you tried using <code>pip3 install imagescanner</code> or <code>python3 -m pip install imagescanner</code>?  You may be using the python3 version of <code>pip</code> instead</span>
<span class="comment-copy">'python3 -m pip install imagescanner' tells me the command python3 does not exist and pip3 gives me a 'newConnectionError'...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">so what am I supposed to do ? taking the line 'import importlib.util' out doesn't help</span>
<span class="comment-copy">so the lines of the error are: File "C:\ .....\zipfile.py", in line 9, in &lt;module&gt; import importlib.util --&gt; Import Error: No Module named "importlib.util". What you are saying is that I can leave this line out ?</span>
