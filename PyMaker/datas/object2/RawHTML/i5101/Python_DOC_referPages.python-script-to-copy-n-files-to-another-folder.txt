<p>I'm looking for a python script that would took for example first 5000 files and copy them to another folder. Then after another run, it would took next 5000 files and copy them.</p>
<p>I tried using <code>shutil</code> but couldn't make it work, no matter what I tried. </p>
<p>Can you please help, or guide me on the right direction?</p>

<p>What you may be looking for is a combination of  os.walk() <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">HERE</a> and shutil.copy() <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/shutil.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">HERE</a></p>
<p>Building a script based on sample provided on those two links looks pretty straight forward.</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">What went wrong?  That is what you should use</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Can you show us what you tried and how it failed?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">My recommendation when moving/copying/deleting: Start by printing the origin path and destination path in one line. Then move on to doing the operation. Show us the code! :)</span>
