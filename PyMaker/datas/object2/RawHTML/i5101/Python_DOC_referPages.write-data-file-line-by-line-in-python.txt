<p>My code generates a 2 dimensional array, which I want to save into a file. This can be easily done using numpy.savetxt as shown in the sample code. But I wish to do something different. In the following code I generate random walks for 5 walkers. For each walk, I generate positions of the walker for some time and store the positions in a list. After each walk is completed , I add the whole list containing walker's positions, as a new row to an already existing array S_data. At the end of the next walk (or iteration), I add the list of position for the next walker and so on.. So by the end of each walker's  iteration, a new row is added to S_data. At the end of all walks , this S_data is finally saved to an external file using numpy.savetxt . </p>
<pre><code>import numpy as np

no_of_walkers = 5
t_max = 10

S_data=np.zeros(t_max)

for R in range(no_of_walkers):
    position = []
    x = 0.0
    for t in range(t_max):
        x = x + np.random.randint(-1, 2)
        position.append(x)
    S_data = np.vstack([S_data, position])

S_data = np.delete(S_data, obj=0, axis=0)

np.savetxt('data_file.txt', S_data)
</code></pre>
<p>What I wish to do is, at the end of each walk, instead of adding the position list to S_data, I want to write it to an external file. Again at the end of next iteration, I will add the position list for the next walker as a new line to the external file, and so on. I want to do this because, I will have to run this code for large number of walkers and also for longer times, so then my code will consume lot of RAM, which I want to avoid. Is there a pythonic way to export lists to the same external file at the end of each iteration, without overwriting the previous data?</p>

<p>If I understand correctly, it seems like you are trying to append to a file after each iteration (if your data file already exists), if so use: </p>
<p><code>f = open("data_file.txt", "a+")</code> </p>
<p>The <code>"a+"</code> indicates you wish to append with any subsequent calls to <code>write</code>. Docs <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>. If you are doing a bunch of iterations, be sure to open the file outside of any loops.</p>
<p>Of course you could also loop to write each element of the new row after each iteration and then just write a newline with something like this:</p>
<pre><code>#open file
for item in newRow:
  #Your formatting will determine the specifics of this write
  f.write(item)
f.write("\n")
</code></pre>
<p>Something like this does what I think you are getting at:</p>
<pre><code># Use with for file safety
with open('output.txt', 'w') as f:    
    for R in range(no_of_walkers):
        x = 0.0
        for t in range(t_max):
            x = x + np.random.randint(-1, 2)
            f.write(str(x) + ' ')
        f.write('\n')
</code></pre>
<p>output.txt</p>
<pre><code>1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 -1.0 -2.0 -2.0 
0.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 -1.0 0.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 1.0 
-1.0 -1.0 -1.0 -2.0 -1.0 -1.0 -2.0 -1.0 -2.0 -3.0 
-1.0 -1.0 0.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 1.0 2.0 1.0 
1.0 0.0 -1.0 -2.0 -1.0 -1.0 0.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 
</code></pre>
<p>As for efficiency, I'm pretty sure the way you were originally trying to write is better. See this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27384093/fastest-way-to-write-huge-data-in-file">post</a>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You can give <code>savetxt</code> an open file object, instead of the file name.  Or you can use a file file directly.  <code>savetxt</code> just loops through the rows of <code>S_data</code>, formating each and using a plain file write.  If you can print the data line by line (with desired formatting) you can write to a file line by line.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks @David Owens, I took your advice, and kept my original code. I just have a small query. Its about the first method you discussed , i.e. using <code>f = open("data_file.txt", "a+")</code> , this does write the rows in a file, but add them as list within brackets. Is there a way to get rid of the brackets?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">How are you writing the rows?</span>
