<p>I am building a web scraper that stores data retrieved from four different websites into a tuple array. I later iterate through the tuple and save the entire lot as both CSV and Excel.
Are tuple arrays or arrays in general, limited to the processor's RAM/disc-space?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>According to the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">doc</a>, this is given by <code>sys.maxsize</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>sys.<strong>maxsize</strong></p>
<p>An integer giving the maximum value a variable of type Py_ssize_t can
  take. Itâ€™s usually <code>2**31 - 1</code> on a 32-bit platform and <code>2**63 - 1</code> on a
  64-bit platform.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And interestingly enough, this the Python3 doc about data model gives more implementation details under <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__len__" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>object.__len__</code></a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>CPython implementation detail:</strong> In CPython, the length is required to
  be at most <code>sys.maxsize</code>. If the length is larger than sys.maxsize
  some features (such as <code>len()</code>) may raise <code>OverflowError</code>.</p>

<p>I believe tuples and lists are limited by the size of the machine's virtual memory, unless you're on a 32 bit system in which case you're limited by the small word size.  Also, lists are dynamically resized by...  I believe about 12% each time they grow too small, so there's a little overhead there as well.</p>
<p>If you're concerned you're going to run out of virtual memory, it might be a good idea to write to a file or files instead.</p>
