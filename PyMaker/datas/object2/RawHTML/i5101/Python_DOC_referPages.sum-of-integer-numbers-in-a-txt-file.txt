<p>I have two txt files that contain only numbers (number per line), so I want to add line 1 + line 1 so in succession to the last line of each file. Each file has the same line number.</p>
<p><strong>I'm trying this way, however I can only print the first line</strong></p>
<pre><code>arq = open ("List1.txt")
arq2 = open ("List2.txt")

x = [linha.strip() for linha in arq]
arq.close()
y = [linha.strip() for linha in arq2]
arq2.close()

for linha in x:
    index = 0
    while index&lt;len(x):
       result = (int(x[index]) + int(y[index]))
       index += 1
    print result
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can achieve this easily using <code>zip</code>.</p>
<p>Change the relevant lines of code to:</p>
<pre><code>for x, y in zip(arq, arq2):
    result = int(x) + int(y)
    print(result)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>While you should probably use <code>zip</code> like mentioned above, if you want to keep on using your way of doing things your problem is here</p>
<p>when you <code>for</code> loop in python, it's a foreach, so when you do</p>
<pre><code>for linha in x:
    print linha
</code></pre>
<p><code>linha</code> will be the value of <code>x[n]</code> where n is the iteration of the loop</p>
<p>anyways, to fix your code you'd do</p>
<pre><code># no need for the for loop, pull everything back
index = 0
while index&lt; min(len(x), len(y)): # make sure you check for both lengths in case they are not the same
    result = (int(x[index]) + int(y[index]))
    index += 1
    print result # you want to print the result inside the loop so you don't lose it on the next iteration
</code></pre>
<p>the proper way to do it though would be</p>
<pre><code>for n,p in zip(x,y):
    print int(n) + int(p)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>First I would get a numpy array and concatenate</p>
<pre><code>import numpy as np
file1 = np.genfromtxt('file1')
file2 = np.genfromtxt('file2')
file3 = np.concatenate((file1, file2), axis=1)
</code></pre>
<p>then save however you see fit</p>

<span class="comment-copy">@MrT He has mentioned in the question that both the files have same length</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MrT Apology accepted. :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">yes, both files have the same amount of rows so there are no problems. Thanks for the answer. @nisemonoxide</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sure thing. (y)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I understood my mistake, thanks for the help.</span>
