<p>Sorry for the weird title, but I don't really know how to explain this. Basically, I have this code that grabs from an API, however, if the numeric value is trying to display low. (Let's say 0.0008 or lower) it will display as a bunch of numbers and an e at the end. </p>
<p>Example: 8.888e-5 or something random.</p>
<p>How can I make it display as a number? Like: 0.00084BTC per PLSR. </p>
<p>(Python 3.6.4) It MUST Be kept as a String to work!</p>
<p>Why this is not a Duplicate: Although another thread found a similar answer to what I want, it doesn't exactly explain how to incorporate it into my code where I have already converted it into a string. Would I just overlay it overtop after its been converted to a string or..?</p>
<p>Code:</p>
<pre><code>import requests
import discord
import asyncio

url = 'https://cryptohub.online/api/market/ticker/PLSR/'
response = requests.get(url)
data = response.json()['BTC_PLSR']

client = discord.Client()

@client.event
async def on_ready():
print('Logged in as')
print(client.user.name)
print(client.user.id)
print('------')

price = print('PLSR Price:', data['last'])
pulsar = str(data['last'])

await client.change_presence(game=discord.Game(name="PLSR Price: " + pulsar))
</code></pre>

<p>You are seeing scientific notation.  8.888e+2 means 8.888x10<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>You need to use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#formatspec" rel="nofollow noreferrer">String Formatting Mini-Language</a> if you don't like the defaults.  Python has gone through some gyrations with formatting.  Here are some options:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; value = .000008888  
&gt;&gt;&gt; value                           # default display of small number
8.888e-06
&gt;&gt;&gt; print('%.8f' % value)           # old, deprecated format.
0.00000889
&gt;&gt;&gt; print('{:.8f}'.format(value))   # newer format.
0.00000889
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(f'{value:.8f}')           # newest format in Python 3.6.
0.00000889
</code></pre>
<p>Note that <code>.8f</code> means "8 places after decimal, fixed floating point".</p>

<p>Per your comment, you could format a string in scientific notation with:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; pulsar = '8.888e+2'
&gt;&gt;&gt; f'PLSR Price: {float(pulsar):.2f}'
'PLSR Price: 888.80'
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>When numbers get big or small enough, Python refers to them using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_notation#E-notation" rel="nofollow noreferrer">scientific notation</a>. This doesn't mean the value is incorrect or "weird", it's just displaying in a different format.</p>
<p>To force it to display, for example, 8 digits, you would need to format it to do so:</p>
<pre><code>print('%.8f' % value)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">This helps explain things but how would I implement it into my code? It can't be done this way since I converted a List to a String, and doing this gives me errors.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">Added it, although it was really hard to figure out.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">await client.change_presence(game=discord.Game(name=f'PLSR Price: {float(pulsar):.2f}'))  - This won't return in the correct format. Did I do something wrong?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I eventually got it to work, thank you.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">@BlakeXavier convert your string to a float first: <code>print('%.8f' % float(value))</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">It gives a similar error. <a href="https://i.imgur.com/Eq66NtY.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer">i.imgur.com/Eq66NtY.png</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@BlakeXavier remove the <code>print</code> and the surrounding <code>()</code> in this line: <code>x = print ('%.8f' % float(pulsar))</code>. You are also converting from (presumably) a <code>float</code> (<code>data['last']</code>) to a <code>string</code>, and back to a <code>float</code> now. Skip converting it to a <code>string</code>.</span>
