<pre><code>sevens = range(7, 1000000, 7)

if x in sevens:
    print("{} is divisible by seven.".format(x))

<p>My question is why do I get the following as output? Why 3510 as the starting number when the ranges begins with 7?</p>
<pre><code>3510, 83517, 83524, 83531, 83538, 83545, 83552, 83559, 83566, 83573, 83580, 83587, 83594, 83601, 83608, 83615, 83622, 83629, 83636, 83643......
</code></pre>
<p>Does the error has to do something with the computer memory or is the problem in my IDE(Pycharm Jetbrains)?</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>To test if a number is fully divisible by another number use the <code>%</code> (aka Modulo) operation that gives you the rest of said division: </p>
<pre><code>x = int(input("Please enter a positive number less than one million: "))

if x%7 == 0:
    print("{} is divisible by seven.".format(x))
    print("It fits {} times.".format(x//7))
else:
    print("{} is not divisible by seven - theres a rest of {}.".format(x,x%7))

<p>This is your IDE (Pycharm) problem. Update your IDE. I ran the same code and I have the output starting from 7,14,... and so on.</p>
