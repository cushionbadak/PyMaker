<p>What I currently have written I can find specific numbers starting with but I need numbers ending with.</p>
<p>The data file looks like this:</p>
<pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"><code>1231231234
1231231234
1231231234
etc...
</code></pre>
<p>My code:</p>
<pre><code>import re
with open("test.txt") as f:
   with open("testoutput.txt", "w") as f1:
       for line in f:
           if re.match("^123", line):
               f1.write(line)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Its not clear why you're using <code>^123</code> to match your number.</p>
<p>In regex paradigm, "ending with something" translates to "something + end of line". Which is <code>something$</code> in most regex dialects. Take a look into <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntax" rel="nofollow noreferrer">official python doc</a> on this.</p>
<p>Not regarding actual question, hint: you can write multiple context managers in one line, like</p>
<pre><code>with open("test.txt") as f, open("testoutput.txt", "w") as f1:
    ...
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>No regex needed, you could very well use <code>endswith</code>:</p>
<pre><code>string = """
1231231234

1231231234

1231231234
888
"""

numbers = [line 
    for line in string.split("\n") 
    if line and not line.endswith('1234')]
print(numbers)
</code></pre>
<p>Which yields</p>
<pre><code>['888']
</code></pre>
<p><hr/>
Or, the other way round:</p>
<pre><code>string = """
1231231234

1231231234

1231231234
888
"""

numbers = [line

    if line and line.endswith('1234')]
print(numbers)
# ['1231231234', '1231231234', '1231231234']
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Hint: check out what <code>$</code> does.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Please correct your indent</span>
<span class="comment-copy">$ did not shoot an error but did not extract and write any numbers to the file.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I am aiming to pull the full number with any number matching the last 3 numbers. The reason I was using ^123 is because I was using this script to pull numbers starting with but now I need to pull numbers ending with.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I guess, <code>\d+123$</code> should help</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That did it!!! Thank you!!!!!</span>
