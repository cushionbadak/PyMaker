<p>I'm using Python 3.6 in Windows and using PyCharm. I have a .py file that is using packages installed on a venv which is in a different folder to the .py file.</p>
<p>I'm trying to run this .py from command line and when I do it gives me a ModileNotFoundError. The file works fine from PyCharm just not from the command line because the packages are in the venv.</p>
<p>How can I get the file to run without errors from command line and keep the packages in the venv?</p>
<p>Many thanks</p>

<p>You need to activate the virtual environment by callling the activation script:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;path to your environment&gt;\Scripts\activate.bat
</code></pre>
<p>as indicated <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>. Then you will automatically use all the packages installed in this environment when calling your script. Your pycharm is probably set up to automatically use your virtual evnironment</p>
