<p>For some reason, whenever I try to open a python script that has around ~450 lines of code, IDLE's windows simply appears empty and when I try to run it doesn't run anything either... However, if I try to run a smaller program it works for some reason. Does anybody know how I am able to run a python script on my Mac besides IDLE or how to fix the IDLE window being blank whenever I open a file?</p>

<p>To learn how to run Python Python programs on a Mac, read Chapters 1 and 4 of <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/using/index.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python Setup and Usage</a>.  Running from an IDLE editor is just one way.</p>
<p>IDLE uses the tkinter module which wraps the tcl/tk GUI framework.  Did you read and follow the instructions of how to replace the <a href="https://www.python.org/download/mac/tcltk/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">buggy tcl/tk</a> that Apple supplies?  Read the entire page before starting!  Ignoring this page is the most common reason people have problems with IDLE on the Mac.  There are a few others, but I do not remember one that matches your description.</p>
