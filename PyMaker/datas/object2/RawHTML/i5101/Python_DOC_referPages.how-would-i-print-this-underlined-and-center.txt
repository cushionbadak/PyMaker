<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>How would I make the following display center and underlined in the shell (if I can)</p>
<pre><code>print ("Award show",datetime.date.today().strftime("%Y"))
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>First you would need to add this code</p>
<pre><code>print  '  ' +   '\033[4m' + 'Text here' +  '\033[0m'
</code></pre>
<p>first part is to add spaces, </p>
<p>second part is making it underline, </p>
<p>3rd part is text 4th part is end of the whole thing</p>
<p>Then to center just add spaces to the first </p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Idk if you can underline ik you can add spaces to the front to make it centered</span>
