<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>RandomList = []

def endless():

    x = input("x: ")
    RandomList.append(x)
    print(RandomList)

endless()
</code></pre>
<p>I want to make a list where Input() gets appended to RandomList, and the numbers gets to stay there for ever even if I close the file. I don't really know whether it can be done or not. Thank you.</p>

<p>So to make objects persistent, one module you could use would be the pickle module.</p>
<p>One example would be:</p>
<pre><code>import pickle

RandomList = []

with open('randomlist_persistence', 'wb') as outp:
    pickle.dump(RandomList, outp)
</code></pre>
<p>This would save the RandomList list object to a file. To then access it again, you can use:</p>
<pre><code>with open('randomlist_persistence', 'rb') as inp:
    RandomList = pickle.load(inp)
</code></pre>
<p>Bear in mind, opening the file in write-mode will overwrite the list, so if you want to <em>ammend</em> a list, ensure you open the file in read mode <strong>first</strong>, save the list to a variable <em>and then</em> open it again it write-mode and re-write it.</p>
<p>I.e. </p>
<pre><code>with open('randomlist_persistence', 'rb') as inp:
    RandomList = pickle.load(inp)

...... do any modifications here ......

with open('randomlist_persistence', 'wb') as outp:
    pickle.dump(RandomList, outp)
</code></pre>
<p>Hopefully this helps. More information on the pickle module can be found here:

<span class="comment-copy">You should add some loop to make input and store process truly endless. In each loop you need to add code to save the list to a file. Search for "loops in python" and "saving to file in python".</span>
