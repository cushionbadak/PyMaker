<p>hello  i have made a python script that tells me my usage of my disk on my nas over ssh but everytime i run the program i get this.</p>
<pre><code>size b'442G' used b' 401M' available b'419G'
</code></pre>
<p>i want to get rid of the b and the quotes around the 422G and the others.</p>
<p>here is my code</p>
<pre><code>import sys, paramiko
import os
import time



username = "alex"
hostname = "192.168.1.91"
password = "alex"
command = "df /dev/sda3 -h"
port = 22
client = paramiko.SSHClient()

def updateTimeMenu():
    time_menu.delete(0, "end")
    time_menu.add_command(label=time.ctime())


def ssh():
    client.load_system_host_keys()
    client.set_missing_host_key_policy(paramiko.WarningPolicy())
    client.connect(hostname, port=port, username=username, password=password)
    menu()




def menu():
    stdin, stdout, stderr = client.exec_command(command)
    output = stdout.read()
    print("Size", output[65:69], ", Used", output[70:75], ", Available", output[77:81]) #should output hdd info (size, used, avalable)
    time.sleep(4)
    ssh()
ssh()
</code></pre>

<p>That is because you retrieve a <em>binary</em> string, since a program can send all types of bytes through a channel, we can <code>decode</code> it to a string with <code>.decode('ascii')</code>:</p>
<pre><code>print("Size",
      output[65:69]<b>.decode('ascii')</b>,
      ", Used",
      output[70:75]<b>.decode('ascii')</b>,
      ", Available",
      output[77:81]<b>.decode('ascii')</b>)</code></pre>
<p>Note that we here thus use the <em>ASCII "codec"</em>, since that seems the one used, but there are of course several ways to encode a string in raw bytes.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">If that code is unedited, you may want to consider choosing a better password!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">i know the password is not secure but it only gets access to 450gb partition on my NAS</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thank you this has helped me so much. i have been working on this code for hours trying to decode it</span>
