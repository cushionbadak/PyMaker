<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Got "AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'find_all'" when trying to scrape through following python code.</p>
<pre><code>from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests
page = requests.get("https://deathtimeline.com/")
soup = BeautifulSoup(page.content, 'html.parser')
deaths_list = soup.find(id="main-list")
deaths = deaths_list.find_all(class_="episode-deaths")
episode1 = deaths[0]
print(episode1.prettify())
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The reason you are not getting main-list is because the site("<a href="https://deathtimeline.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://deathtimeline.com/</a>")
 is JavaScript loaded. if you check the content of page.content or view source of the site you can only see JS code. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>BeautifulSoup does not execute Javascript, so any data delivered or
  rendered via JS will not be available to you if you scrape with
  BeautifulSoup.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can try using <strong><a href="http://www.seleniumhq.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">selenium</a></strong> to get JS loaded pages</p>
