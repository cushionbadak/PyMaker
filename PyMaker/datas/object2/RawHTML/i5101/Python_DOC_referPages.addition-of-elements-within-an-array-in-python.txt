<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have a numpy array full of numbers which I want to add to each other. </p>
<p>For example, if the array is:</p>
<pre><code>my_list =np.array([2,3,4,5,6]). 
</code></pre>
<p>I want to add 3 to 2 (index 1 to 0) and the 4 to 3 (index 2 to 1) and so on. </p>
<p>Any help or ideas for this would be great as I'm quite new to python and coding and am rather stuck.</p>

<p>One way to do it is to use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools-recipes" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>itertools</code> recipe pairwise</a>:</p>
<pre><code>from itertools import tee

def pairwise(iterable):
    "s -&gt; (s0,s1), (s1,s2), (s2, s3), ..."
    a, b = tee(iterable)
    next(b, None)
    return zip(a, b)

nums = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
sums = [a + b for a, b in pairwise(nums)]
print(sums)
# [5, 7, 9, 11]
</code></pre>
<p>Another is to use the built-in <code>zip</code>:</p>
<pre><code>sums = [a + b for a, b in zip(nums, nums[1:])]
</code></pre>
<p>And finally, as requested in the comments by <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/1672429/stefan-pochmann">@StefanPochmann</a>, if you are using <code>numpy</code>:</p>
<pre><code>import numpy as np
nums = np.array([2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
sums = nums[:-1] + nums[1:]
</code></pre>
<hr/>
<p>As for speed, the <code>numpy</code> solution is basically unbeatable, as long as your input array is already a <code>numpy.array</code>. If not, then casting it to an array, the <code>zip</code> and the <code>pairwise</code> one are about equally fast. Tests done with Python 3.6.3.</p>
<p>Test input:</p>
<pre><code>import random
x = [random.sample(range(1000), n) for n in range(1, 1000, 50)]
</code></pre>

<p>In the end, <code>numpy</code> also has <code>O(n)</code> behaviour (note that the length of the array is 100 more than before), its constant is just way lower:</p>

<p>Here is a solution:</p>
<pre><code>nums = [2,3,4,5,6]
sums = []


for i in range(0, len(nums)):
    if(i!=0):
        sums.append(nums[i] + nums[i-1])

print(sums)
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>[5, 7, 9, 11]
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">I'm not sure I understand what you want to do. Could you post the expected result for your <code>[2,3,4,5,6]</code> list ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Does it have to be a while loop?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Do you have an array or a list? And why a while loop? That's pretty much the most wrong way to do that.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">@ downvoter I am happy to fix my post if there is anything wrong with it</span>
<span class="comment-copy">(not the downvoter, just late to the party) I like your answer, but think the question had a bug in that since it refers to numpy the nums should already been in an array, so fixed that. Still think this answer is valid.</span>
