<p>I was playing around with the Python round function when I noticed something weird. See for yourself:</p>
<p>CMD output:</p>
<pre><code>1.5
2.5
0.5
2
2
0
</code></pre>
<p>Code: </p>
<pre><code>a = 1.5 
b = 2.5
c = 0.5
print(a)
print(b)
print(c)
print(round(a))
print(round(b))
print(round(c))
</code></pre>
<p>What's going on?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>a = 1.5 
b = 2.5
c = 0.5
print(a)
print(b)
print(c)

print(round(c,0))
</code></pre>
<p>You can try it</p>

<span class="comment-copy">"if two multiples are equally close, rounding is done toward the even choice" â€” <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#round" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#round</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Okay, so what <i>is</i> the weird thing you notice? Perhaps it's something else than we all seem to be assuming. (Use <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/posts/48769357/edit">edit</a> to add it into your question.)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">though technically the <i>question</i> is not a duplicate persay...  the answer from Mark Dickinson does answer this question when giving word of caution  in the other question</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is thoroughly addressed in the second answer on the duplicate question - <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/22155830/146077">stackoverflow.com/a/22155830/146077</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">This displays <code>2.0</code>, <code>2.0</code>, <code>0.0</code> on my Python 3. How exactly is that better? The added <code>.0</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sorry.  You try this int(float(round(a,0))</span>
