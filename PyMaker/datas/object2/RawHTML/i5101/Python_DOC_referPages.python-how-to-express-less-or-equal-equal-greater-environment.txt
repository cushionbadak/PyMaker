<p>I want to do the following example in python:</p>
<pre><code>x = 10 
y = 8

if x-5 &lt;= y &lt;= x+5:
     print(y)
</code></pre>
<p>I see that this is working, but I would like to know if it's "ok" like this, if there is a better solution or something I have to consider doing it like this.</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#comparisons" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Chained expressions</a> are acceptable in Python:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Comparisons can be chained arbitrarily, e.g., <code>x &lt; y &lt;= z</code> is equivalent
  to <code>x &lt; y and y &lt;= z</code>, except that <code>y</code> is evaluated only once (but in both
  cases <code>z</code> is not evaluated at all when <code>x &lt; y</code> is found to be <code>False</code>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In fact, because <code>and</code> is lazy and the syntax is cleaner, they are <em>preferable</em>.</p>
<p>Just be aware that chained expressions take priority. For example, see <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6074018/why-does-the-expression-0-0-0-return-false-in-python">Why does the expression 0 &lt; 0 == 0 return False in Python?</a>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Yes, it's perfectly OK. Python is one of the few languages that allows this syntax.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Don't try it in C, Javascript, PHP, though....</span>
<span class="comment-copy">See <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/reference/expressions.html#comparisons" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the official documentation</a>. <code>x-5 &lt;= y &lt;= x+5</code> is equivalent to <code>(x-5 &lt;= y) and (y &lt;= x+5)</code>, but less ugly.</span>
