<p>I want to cat txt files from a folder and cat results should be shown in terminal (Obviously). I have tried using listdir() it but it doesn't work. Required some help!</p>

<p>a simple implementation uses <code>glob</code> to generate absolute paths to files with <code>.txt</code> extension, in a loop which reads the file and prints it on standard output:</p>
<pre><code>import glob,sys
for filepath in sorted(glob.glob("path/to/directory/*.txt")):
    with open(filepath) as f:
        sys.stdout.write(f.read())
</code></pre>
<p>using <code>fileinput</code> allows to read all the files, and line by line, probably less memory intensive and shorter:</p>
<pre><code>import glob,sys,fileinput

for f in fileinput.input(sorted(glob.glob("path/to/directory/*.txt"))):
    sys.stdout.write(f)
</code></pre>
<p>note that <code>sorted</code> is better to ensure that the files are processed in deterministic order (some filesystems don't respect that order)</p>
<p><code>sys.stdout.write(f)</code> still writes line by line, but as suggested by comments you could improve performance and not use so much memory by using <code>shutil.copyfileobj(f,sys.stdout)</code></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Just use the command in terminal "cat *"</p>
<p>Or if you want to do it in python:</p>
<pre><code>import os
allTextFileContents = os.popen("cat *").read();
print(allTextFileContents);
</code></pre>
<p>You can also do other things with the contents since its stored as a variable!</p>

<span class="comment-copy"><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.listdir" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>listdir</code></a> returns a list of filenames. Why did you expect it to print the file contents?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">using cat with each file name is a tough task when I have 50 plus text files. So I wanted to open all and cat results in terminal.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Please include in your question the code you have tried to use, and please explain in more detail in what way it did "not work".</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thanks for the reply I have one more doubt that what if the files are not in .txt extension but are grep able files. How would it work then?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Got it for grep we will only use * and trim the extension :) thanks for the help!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">For memory concerns, without worrying about line-by-line behaviors, you can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html#shutil.copyfileobj" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>shutil.copyfileobj</code></a>, replacing <code>sys.stdout.write(f)</code> with <code>shutil.copyfileobj(f, sys.stdout)</code> (it performs a block by block copy with a fixed size block, so it's not concerned with line endings at all).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ShadowRanger excellent suggestion. Just when I thought I wouldn't learn anything by answering that :) well, I know <code>copyfileobj</code> just wouldn't have the idea of using it</span>
