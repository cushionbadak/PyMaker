<p>Hello so I am making a python socket server and client and I am trying to figure out how I can make it so when the server sends a message to the client using arguments(I am not good with explaining myself) but basically my issue is this</p>
<p>Server Console:</p>
<pre><code>Command: &gt;senddata 127.0.0.1 32
</code></pre>
<p>Clients Response:</p>
<pre><code>Command Accepted!
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:\Users\Goten\Desktop\client\client.py", line 18, in &lt;module&gt;
    ip = sys.argv[1]
IndexError: list index out of range
</code></pre>
<p>I am sending 32 bytes of data(I think) to 127.0.0.1 and it wont work</p>
<p>This is my clients code:</p>
<pre><code>import socket
import sys

socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

host = "127.0.0.1"
port = 8888

socket.connect((host, port))

while True:
    msg = socket.recv(1024)

    if "&gt;senddata".lower() in msg:
        print("Command Accepted!")
        ip = sys.argv[1]
        datasize = sys.argv[2]

        data = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)

        port = 80
        data.sendto(datasize, (ip, port))
        print("Sent")
</code></pre>
<p>I seriously cannot figure out what I am doing wrong</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You are reading from msg, not sys.argv.</p>
<pre><code>    if "&gt;senddata".lower() in msg:
        print("Command Accepted!")
        ip = msg.split(" ")[1]
        datasize = msg.split(" ")[2]
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>the server sends the entire message in the form of a continuous string byte, not in discreet form of array. in order to get the ip address and the data size, you have to parse the msg string byte.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">sys.argv is a list of command arguments that was used when starting your application.  It looks like what you want to do is get the ip and datasize from the message sent over your socket?  sys.argv isn't going to help you with that.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">mateo what should i do then</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Are you expecting the ip and data size to be in msg?  If yes then you could split the msg up. with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes.split" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes.split</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">what im trying to do is make my server tell the client to do something like that though I am not trying to do it directly to the client</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It is about the error "IndexError: list index out of range"</span>
<span class="comment-copy">btw im not using linux im using windows and &gt;senddata is the command I type in the server for the client to recieve</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ah ok, now I get you. You didn't expain well hehe. I will edit my post</span>
<span class="comment-copy">haha I did say im not good at explaining XD</span>
<span class="comment-copy">how would i do that</span>
<span class="comment-copy">i would be able to help you better if you could upload the server code also.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">dont need to it was fixed by Sinkmanu</span>
