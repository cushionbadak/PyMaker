<p>I have two files first_file and second_file in the same directory dir.
When I am trying to import second_file in first_file using</p>
<blockquote>
<p>from dir import second_file</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am getting ImportErorr.
I have also tried using </p>
<blockquote>
<p>from . import second_file</p>

<p>in the first_file but still I am getting that error.
I am using Python 3.6
How to import correctly?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You are importing wrongly.  To get a file that is in the same dictionary use:</p>
<pre><code>import second_file
</code></pre>
<p>Assuming the following structure:</p>
<pre><code>dir -|
      -  __init__.py
      -  first_file.py
      -  second_file.py
</code></pre>
<p>You will also need an <code>__init__.py</code> file (<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/448271/what-is-init-py-for">see why here</a>)</p>
<p>The command:</p>
<pre><code>from dir import second_file
</code></pre>
<p>Will import second_file from a package (or sub-folder) with the following structure:</p>
<pre><code>main_folder |-
              |-  first_file.py
              |-  dir  |-
                         |-  __init__.py
                         |-  second_file.py
</code></pre>
<p><code>from . import second_file</code> will have this structure:</p>
<pre><code>main_folder |-
              |- __init__.py
              |- second_file.py
              |- dir |-
                       |- first_file.py
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Does <code>dir</code> contain an <code>__init__.py</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">How are you running this? Command line?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">have you tried <code>import second_file</code>? if they are in the same directory it should be fine just to call an import.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes the directory contains <b>init</b>.py</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I have run this from pycharm run configuration as well as from the terminal using py filename.py still getting the same error.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks that makes sense why isn't it working.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@SriDivya  Hmmm What is your file structure?  Also what does your <code>__init__.py</code> contain?  This is certainly the way to import without more details it is not apparent why it is not.</span>
