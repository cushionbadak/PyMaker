<p>I am learning python pandas.
I see a tutorial which shows two ways to save a pandas dataframe.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><code>pd.to_csv('sub.csv')</code> and to open <code>pd.read_csv('sub.csv')</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>pd.to_pickle('sub.pkl')</code> and to open <code>pd.read_pickle('sub.pkl')</code></p></li>
</ol>
<p>The tutorial says <code>to_pickle</code> is to save the dataframe to disk. I am confused about this. Because when I use <code>to_csv</code>, I did see a csv file appears in the folder, which I assume is also save to disk right?</p>
<p>In general, why we want to save a dataframe using <code>to_pickle</code> rather than save it to csv or txt or other format?</p>

<p>Pickle is a serialized way of storing a Pandas dataframe. You are basically writing down the exact representation of your dataframe to disc. This means the types of the columns are the same and the index is the same. If you simply save a file as a csv you are just storing it as a comma separated list. Depending on your data set, some information will be lost when you load it back up.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">So you mean, to_pickle should be more preferable when saving a pandas dataframe, i.e., it preserves the original dataframe? Are there any advantages of to_pickle? for example, in terms of loading speed?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@KevinKim, you may want to check <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37010212/what-is-the-fastest-way-to-upload-a-big-csv-file-in-notebook-to-work-with-python">this comparison</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">The main advantage of saving in CSV would be having a standardized format that can be opened with a wide range of software/languages</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MaxU Thanks! So if my original data set is a large csv file, I guess it would be good to first load it into pandas and then store it using to_pickle. Hence, next time when I need to load this dataframe again, I can use read_pickle to load it must faster, is that correct?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Alessandro yes, that makes sense, I agree with you</span>
