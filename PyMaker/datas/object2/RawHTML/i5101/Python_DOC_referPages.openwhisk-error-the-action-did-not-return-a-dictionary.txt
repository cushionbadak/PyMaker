<p>when trying to invoke an openwhisk action, I'm getting a 400 error with the following result and log:</p>

<p>The action used to work correctly until now, which makes me think that the error could be related to specific issues accessing the API. Any ideas on how I could get around this issue?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>You'll need to create that action as a <a href="https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk/blob/master/docs/webactions.md" rel="nofollow noreferrer">webaction</a>. The error hints to the fact that <code>__ow_method</code> is not present, which is only present if your action is a webaction.</p>
<p>Does your action do anything with that field? If you want to write your action conditionally (as in: detect if it's actually a webaction) you'll need to check if the field is actually present. In python, you'd use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict.get" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>get()</code></a> to either get the key or <code>None</code>.</p>
<p>In terms of not returning anything meaningful: Seems like your action crashes randomly without doing anything with that error. Potentially the runtime itself could be updated to catch any uncaught errors and return something more meaningful. An issue against the repository might be warranted in that case.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">If it's not returning a dictionary, what is it returning? And why?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Doesn't seem to be returning anything other than an plain "error" message when calling the HTTP handler ow_method. This is what I get when inspecting the console: Failed to load resource: net::ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED</span>
<span class="comment-copy">the function is crashing - if this key is missing <code>datos_usuario["__ow_method"] </code> the method will throw an exception. Instead, check <code>if "__ow_method" in datos_usuario</code> first.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks! I just did, apparently the problem was with the API route link. Fixed now.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks Markus, apparently the problem had to do with the API route, which has been fixed now.</span>
