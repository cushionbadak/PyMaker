<p>What space complexity does the python sort take? I can't find any definitive documentation on this anywhere</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Python's built in sort method is a spin off of merge sort called Timsort, more information here - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timsort" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timsort</a>.</p>
<p>It's essentially no better or worse than merge sort, which means that its <strong>run time</strong> on average is <code>O(n log n)</code> and its <strong>space complexity</strong> is <code>Î©(n)</code></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Space complexity is defined as how much additional space the algorithm needs in terms of the <code>N</code> elements. And even though according to the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#list.sort" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs</a>, the <code>sort</code> method sorts a list in place, it does use some additional space, as stated in the <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Objects/listsort.txt" rel="nofollow noreferrer">description</a> of the implementation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>timsort can require a temp array containing as many as N//2 pointers, which means as many as 2*N extra bytes on 32-bit boxes. It can be expected to require a temp array this large when sorting random data; on data with significant structure, it may get away without using any extra heap memory.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Therefore the worst case space complexity is <code>O(N)</code> and best case <code>O(1)</code></p>

<span class="comment-copy">... that doesn't answer the question.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">Well, you sure are sorting something that takes space in memory.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yeah you certainly are, but space complexity is measured in additional memory needed so not the array itself. Nevertheless, I took a look at the implementation description and turns our they do use some more additional space for implementing the algorithm. My answer is updated accordingly</span>
