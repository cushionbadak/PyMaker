<p>I was given a file that contained a list of countries and the continents they're located on. The instructions for the assignment were to use a try and except function to produce a dictionary with keys of continents and the corresponding countries to each continent would be the values. I managed to use for loops to solve this problem, but I don't how I would go about using try and except functions. I've tried doing it, but I have received lots of error messages when testing the program out. I was wondering how a try and except function should be implemented to solve the problem in the assignment.</p>
<p>The list given to us outputs the country info as such:</p>
<pre><code>print(countries[0])
</code></pre>
<p>Here, Andorra has been selected and the output is:</p>
<pre><code>{'timezones': ['Europe/Andorra'], 'code': 'AD', 'continent': 'Europe', 
'name': 'Andorra', 'capital': 'Andorra la Vella'}
</code></pre>
<p>My code:</p>
<pre><code>from countries import countries
from pprint import pprint


continent_countries = {}
i=0

for country in countries:
#try:  
    continent_inputter = {country['continent']:[]}
    continent_countries.update(continent_inputter)
#except KeyError:
# print("TESTING. NONE. TRY AGAIN. ")

for country in countries:
    if 'Europe' == country['continent']:
        continent_countries['Europe'].append(country['name'])

    elif 'Oceania' == country['continent']:
        continent_countries['Oceania'].append(country['name'])

    elif 'Africa' == country['continent']:
        continent_countries['Africa'].append(country['name'])

    elif 'North America' == country['continent']:
        continent_countries['North America'].append(country['name'])

    elif 'South America' == country['continent']:
         continent_countries['South America'].append(country['name'])

    elif 'Asia' == country['continent']:
          continent_countries['Asia'].append(country['name'])
    i+=1

print(continent_countries)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>for country in countries:
    continent = country['continent']
    if continent_countries.get(continent) is None:
        continent_countries[continent] = [country['name']]
    else:
        continent_countries[continent].append(country['name'])

<span class="comment-copy">Try/Except <b>clauses</b> are used to account for exceptional conditions that would normally halt/break your program.
