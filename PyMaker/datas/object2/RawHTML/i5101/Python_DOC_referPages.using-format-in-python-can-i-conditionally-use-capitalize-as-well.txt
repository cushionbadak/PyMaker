<p>Okay, so that might be a bit cryptic.</p>
<p>I have a list of food, which I randomly select items from. I use this in another list to talk about the selected food, but those strings can have the food-name both at the beginning of the sentence, and the end of the sentence.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>default breakfast_food_list = ['pancakes','bacon and eggs','scones','sandwiches','beans and bacon','quiche','cereal','muffins']

default breakfast_nice_list = [
            ['I love your {0}',2,'fm_rel'],
            ['Ah, I just love those {0}',2,'fm_rel'],
            ['{0} is fine',1,'fm_rel'],
]

$ breakfast_select = random.randint(0,len(breakfast_food_list)-1)
$ breakfast_nice = breakfast_nice_list[breakfast_nice_select][0]
</code></pre>
<p>I'm displaying these like this:</p>
<pre><code>$ breakfast_reply = breakfast_nice.format(breakfast_food)
</code></pre>
<p>Now, I could just slap .captialize() on the end there, but that will make it capitalized even when it's at the end or middle of the sentence.</p>
<p>So, I'm looking for a solution where it gets capitalized when it's the first word in the sentence and only the first word...</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I've updated answer from input in comments on the question (and this answer). <strong>//EDIT</strong></p>
<p>You could try something like this:</p>
<pre><code>from random import choice

default breakfast_food_list = ['pancakes','bacon and 
     eggs','scones','sandwiches','beans and bacon','quiche','cereal','muffins']

default breakfast_nice_list = [
    ['I love your {0}',2,'fm_rel'],
    ['Ah, I just love those {0}',2,'fm_rel'],
    ['{0} is fine',1,'fm_rel']]

words = choice(breakfast_nice_list)[0]
food = choice(breakfast_food_list)
output = words.format(food).capitalize()
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you're on Python3.6, you might be able to do some rearranging and use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.6.html#pep-498-formatted-string-literals" rel="nofollow noreferrer">f-strings</a>. Like</p>
<p><code>breakfast_choice = breakfast_food_list[breakfast_select]</code></p>
<p><code>breakfast_reply = f"{breakfast_choice.capitalize()} is fine"</code></p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Why not just add the line <code>breakfast_reply[0].upper()</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Might I also suggest a simplification by using <code>from random import choice</code> to get a random element from a list? <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/random.html#random.choice" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Docs</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">I meant <code>breakfast_reply = breakfast_reply[0].upper()</code>, and good suggestion Thomas Fauskanger.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Or simply <code>breakfast_reply = breakfast_nice.format(breakfast_food).capitalize()</code>, I'm not sure if I'm missing a requirement there</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes sorry, got my call mixed up, meant <code>.capitalize()</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">While slightly less efficient but perhaps more readable, just call <code>.capitalize()</code> after the format, e.g. <code>output = words.format(food).capitalize()</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">That there is of course the right answer... I blame my utter complete tiredness for making this way more complicated than it actually was. Adding <code>.capitalize()</code> after is of course exactly what's needed.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for sharing, I was not aware of this, and I am primarily on 3.6. The question, however, is tagged with Python2.7 :P</span>
