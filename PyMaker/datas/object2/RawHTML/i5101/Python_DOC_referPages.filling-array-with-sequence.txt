<p>I am having number N and i want to make amount of arrays .for example with N=2
I need</p>
<pre><code>(0,0),(0.5,0),(0,0.5),(1,1) ,(1,0.5), (0.5,1)
</code></pre>
<p>for <code>N=3</code> its like</p>
<pre><code>(0,0,0),(0.5,0,0)...(0.5,0.5,0)....(1,0.5,0.5)...(1,1,1) 
</code></pre>
<p>which are contain all combinations of <code>0, 0.5, 1</code>.</p>
<p>I tried to use cycle for ,but didn't find the way to solve the problem with any N.I prefer python <code>numpy</code> or java if its real.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.product" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>itertools.product</code></a> to generate all the combinations.</p>
<pre><code>def f(n):
    return list(itertools.product((0, .5, 1), repeat=n))

print(f(2))
# [(0, 0), (0, 0.5), (0, 1), (0.5, 0), (0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 1), (1, 0), (1, 0.5), (1, 1)]
</code></pre>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p>If you only want the combinations of adjacent elements, we can use the <code>pairwise</code> recipe from the <code>itertools</code> documentation.</p>
<pre><code>from itertools import tee, chain, product

def pairwise(iterable):
    "s -&gt; (s0,s1), (s1,s2), (s2, s3), ..."
    a, b = tee(iterable)
    next(b, None)
    return zip(a, b)

def f(n):
    values = (0, .5, 1)
    return list(chain.from_iterable(product(x, repeat=n) for x in pairwise(values)))

print(f(n))
# [(0, 0), (0, 0.5), (0.5, 0), (0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 1), (1, 0.5), (1, 1)]
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Doesn't seem to be anything to do with Java. Please remove the [Java] tag.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You should start with some idea, before starting to type the code.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sorry,it was missclick,removed</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Tnank you,everything works correctly.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I thought of it, but OP's example is not having <code>(0, 1)</code> in it. OPs example seems to have the adjacent elements only</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I will try to use other itertools things,they are giving for types of combinations.</span>
