<p>how to split "180101051436_Radmin_VPN_1.0.3448" into two strings in python .I want output as "180101051436_" one string and "Radmin_VPN_1.0.3448" second string</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can split after the first underscore:</p>
<pre><code>s = "180101051436_Radmin_VPN_1.0.3448"

index = s.find("_") + 1  # get the position just after the first underscore (13)

s1 = s[:index]  # get everything in the string *before* index
s2 = s[index:]  # get everything in the string *after* index
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You need to use the optional maxsplit argument to the str.split function.</p>
<p>x.split('_', 1)</p>
<p>Result: ['180101051436', 'Radmin_VPN_1.0.3448']</p>
<p>This does not preserve the underscore that was used to split the string, but it is easy to add that back if you need it.</p>

<p>You can use regular expressions in case you have to fetch number and rest of the string.</p>
<p>Here is the example:</p>
<pre><code>import re

s = '180101051436_Radmin_VPN_1.0.3448'
res = re.search(r'(\d*_)(.*)', s)
print res.groups() # ('180101051436_', 'Radmin_VPN_1.0.3448')
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Hi I tried to split at "<i>" (underscore) but the string is splitting wherever "</i>"(underscore) present.so I am not getting required string.Please help me</span>
<span class="comment-copy">1. Use regex. 2. If you have a fix number of numbers, use slicing. 3. If you have a variable number of numbers, count them, and slice considering the result.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>str.split</code> takes a 2nd argument specifying max number of splits. You can use that. <code>str.split([sep[, maxsplit]])</code> -- look at python docs for more details.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thank you I am able to get the right string.Can you please tell me the logic ,I am not getting. why index is added with +1</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@chetan I added some explanation to the answer</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@chetan <code>s.find("_")</code> gets the index of the first underscore. If you split there, then the underscore will be in the second string, but you indicated that you wanted it in the first string, so we add <code>1</code> to split just after the underscore. Hope that helps.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thanks @ikac this way also i am getting the right string</span>
