<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I want to print the "permissions" from a Android Manifest file. I have already reverse engineered the apk and got the Android Manifest file and want to extract the permissions by using Python.</p>
<pre><code>import string
test=string.printable
f=open('AndroidManifest.xml', 'r').read()
x=""
for n in f:
    if n in test:
     x+=n
    print (x)
</code></pre>
<p>This is my Python Script by which I can parse the XML file. How can I find the permissions and print it. Can anyone help me with this?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>XML parsing is a very common task and by writing a module to do that you are reinventing the wheel only to end up with a rough non-circular design.</p>
<p>Python provides a much better designed, rounded wheel for that: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>xml.etree.ElementTree</code></a>. You can use this module to effortlessly parse XML files.</p>
<pre><code>import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

root = ET.parse("AndroidManifest.xml").getroot()
permissions = root.findall("uses-permission")

for perm in permissions:
    for att in perm.attrib:
        print("{}\t:\t{}\n".format(att, perm.attrib[att]))
</code></pre>
<p>This will print all the attributes of the <code>&lt;uses-permission&gt;</code> tag. Refer to the link above for more details.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">See <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/manifest-intro.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/manifest-intro.html</a> . The permissions needed by an app are given by the <code>&lt;uses-permission&gt;</code> tag(s).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MichaelButscher Sir, I want to find all the permissions and print it using python. The code given here is already printing the whole AndroidManifest.xml file, but I want to print only the permissions used in the AndroidManifest.xml file</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Subhasis We can't do the work for you. I have provided some details about the ElementTree module in my answer.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@AbhishekKumar Sir, I am not asking to do the work. I am just asking the ways I can do it. I tried various ways after googling, it didn't work. That's why I came here.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Subhasis Sir, please see my answer and see if it works.</span>
