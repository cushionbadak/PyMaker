<p>You have a couple of lists of variable lengths, each starting where the previous one finished:</p>
<pre><code>list_a = list(range(0,100)) # -133 from 233
list_b = list(range(100,150)) # -183 from 233
list_c = list(range(150,200)) # -183 from 233
list_d = list(range(200,600)) # +167 from 233
</code></pre>
<p>These lists should be transformed so that their range is from their start number to +233, but keeping the same number of elements: list_a 100 elements, list_b 50 elements etc.</p>
<p>So in the end the lists should look like:</p>
<pre><code>list_a = list(range(0,233))
list_b = list(range(233,466))
list_c = list(range(466,699))
list_d = list(range(699,932))
</code></pre>
<p>I can't just change the first and last members of the list, because the difference must be spread evenly between members of the list.
So <code>list_a</code> must look like this because it's last member is lower than 233:</p>
<pre><code>[0, 1+some_value, 2+some_value, 233]
</code></pre>
<p><code>list_d</code> has more than 233 members so we should subtract:</p>
<pre><code>[699, 670 - some_value, 671 - some_value, 932]
</code></pre>
<p>Any idea how to calculate the some_value for all lists?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>If you want to evenly space <code>X</code> points between two endpoints you can use <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/reference/generated/numpy.linspace.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">numpy.linspace</a>:</p>
<pre><code>np.linspace(start_point, end_point, num=X)

<span class="comment-copy">@wwii that question is more related to a student task. This one, imo, is pretty common with plots, for example I you want to reduce the indexes to a certain range.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Are you asking a maths question? - how to evenly space x numbers between two endpoints?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@wwii yes. that is a better formulation of my question. i can't find the right formula</span>
