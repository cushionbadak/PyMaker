<p>how to insert newDF in my <code>mysql</code> Database at one time using executemany</p>

<p>I'm not familiar with executemany. However, I've used pandas.dataframe.to_sql successfully. You can find that <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.to_sql.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>. In my case, I was using sqlalchemy and pymysql libraries to accomplish this.</p>
<p>This is not real code, but should be a reasonable outline; consider m to be the dataframe:</p>
<pre><code>import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import pymysql as mysql
import sqlalchemy
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from pandas.io import sql

engine=create_engine('mysql+pymysql://username:password@host:port/db_name')
m.to_sql('table_name', engine, if_exists='append')
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Hey, just letting you know, use the <code>%s</code> operator is a bad practice, if one of you inputs is poisoned you could be having a bad day(here is a comical example: <a href="https://xkcd.com/327/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">xkcd.com/327</a>). In Python you can use the <code>?</code> operator for all the <code>execute</code> like functions to avoid sql-injection exploits: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html</a> (it is near the top)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You need to write an actual question in the body of your question, not just in the title.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">how can I check sequence of  field like insert into table (field1,field2)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I believe that it matches by column names. In your case, it would match x &amp; y to the table. I believe it will also create a new table if there is not currently one matching the name.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thanks its works perfectly</span>
