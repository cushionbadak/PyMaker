<p>The title is kind of misleading, but I can't really describe it in one line.</p>
<p>I have a list that looks like this.</p>
<pre><code>a = [(4, 2), (4, 3), (2, 1), (1, 0), (1, 4)]
</code></pre>
<p>The list was already sorted by the first term of the tuple, using this code.</p>
<pre><code>a.sort( key = lambda x: x[0], reverse = True )
</code></pre>
<p>(I am just saying that the list is already sorted, so there's no need to sort)</p>
<p>Assume that the first term of the tuple is the score of a Poker player, and second term is the name of each Poker player. So, the list above is the same as this:</p>
<p>[ ( score = 4, player 2 ), ( score = 4, player 3 ), (score = 2, player 1 ), (score = 1, player 0), (score = 1, player = 4) ]</p>
<p>There are 5 players, and the score of each players could be the same, or different. </p>
<p>I want to evaluate the players based on their score, and want to print result in case of ties (when . So,</p>
<pre><code>Player 2 ties
Player 3 ties

Player 0 ties
Player 4 ties
</code></pre>
<p>Player 2 and 3 had the same score (score = 4)  and they tied. Also, Player 0 and 4 ties, but since their score ( score = 1) was lower than that of Player 2 and 3, they were printed below player 2 and 3.</p>
<p>How can I do this in Python? </p>
