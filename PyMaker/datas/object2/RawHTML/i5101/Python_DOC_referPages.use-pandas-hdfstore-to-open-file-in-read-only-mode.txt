<p>I needed compatibility between Pandas versions, so pickle was not enough, and I stored a bunch of dataframes like this:</p>
<pre><code>import pandas as pd

hdf = pd.HDFStore('storage.h5')
hdf.put('mydata', df_mydata)
</code></pre>
<p>...and brought them back like this:</p>
<pre><code>df_mydata = hdf.get('df_mydata')
</code></pre>
<p>Thing is, in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#reading-and-writing-files" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python</a>, you can usually open a file read-only like this:</p>
<pre><code>f = open('workfile', 'r')
</code></pre>
<p>I saved the dataframes for local use as it takes too long and stresses out a server to pull them out of SQL otherwise. How can you open these <code>.h5</code> files so as to not accidentally alter them? </p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Try:</p>
<pre><code>hdf = pd.HDFStore('storage.h5', 'r')
</code></pre>
<p>this class comes from pytables. You can read the doc here:<a href="https://www.pytables.org/index.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">pytables</a></p>

<span class="comment-copy">this might come off as sarcastic, but I mean it with all sincerity. If you don't want to alter the file, don't write code that could. Or you can copy the file and open the copy?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Do I trust myself not to write code that would alter it?.. Linux has read-write-execute permissions, and Python has this read-only mode, but maybe they are all superfluous features, like seatbelts..</span>
<span class="comment-copy">In the <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.read_hdf.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs</a>, what is meant by <b>mode='r' Ignored if path_or_buf is a pd.HDFStore</b>? Would <code>read_hdf</code> always refer to a pd.HDFStore object?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I don't know @Evan but it certainly breaks the KISS principle, and makes you less confident trusting the argument <code>mode</code> . I find myself needing read only again a few weeks later, will just put <code>mode='r'</code> and hope it doesn't ignore it.</span>
