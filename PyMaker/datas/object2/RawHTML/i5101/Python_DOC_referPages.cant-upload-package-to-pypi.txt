<p>I've been trying to upload a package to PyPi. I receive this error every time.</p>
<pre><code>Upload failed (403): Invalid or non-existent authentication information. 
error: Upload failed (403): Invalid or non-existent authentication information. 
</code></pre>
<p>I googled first and found that there was several issues for this on GitHub. I followed what everybody said was working and no dice.</p>
<p>I made a ~/.pypirc file in the same directory as my setup.py file with the following contents like everybody said</p>
<pre><code>[distutils]
index-servers =
pypi

[pypi]
username: shadeyg56
password: 
</code></pre>
<p>I did fill in the password part but obviously I'm not going to share that
Then I ran
    python setup.py sdist upload
in the correct dir and it returned this</p>

<p>Maybe double check that the .pypirc files is actually in the same directory as setup.py, since in your question you have called it '~/.pypirc'. The '~/' indicates that the file is in your home directory, which I assume is not where you want it to be.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">you may want to try <a href="https://github.com/pypa/twine" rel="nofollow noreferrer">twine</a> instead -- there were some recent changes around how uploads work and it's possible the legacy <code>setup.py upload</code> no longer works</span>

<span class="comment-copy"><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/distutils/packageindex.html#pypirc" rel="nofollow noreferrer">The home directory is actually where <code>.pypirc</code> belongs.</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">So we're both wrong then :)</span>
