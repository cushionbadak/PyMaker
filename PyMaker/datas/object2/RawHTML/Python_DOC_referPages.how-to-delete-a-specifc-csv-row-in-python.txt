<p>I have many thousands of lines in a CSV file.</p>
<pre><code>1|row1
2|row2
3|row3
4|row4
</code></pre>
<p>etc.</p>
<p>I read in row1 and then do some operation.</p>
<p>I then want to delete row1 so my CSV file is now:</p>
<pre><code>1|row2
2|row3
3|row4
</code></pre>
<p>All of the solutions I have found seem to relate to skipping the header which is not what I'm trying to do. On the next iteration I would be deleting row2 and then the next iteration row3.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Try this:</p>
<pre><code>import pandas as pd

# Read csv file into data frame
df = pd.read_csv('file.csv')

# Perform your operation on row1
row1 = df.iloc[0,:]

# Delete row 1 from the data frame
df = df.iloc[1:,:].reset_index(drop=True)

# df now contains everything in the csv except row 1

# Save new csv as desired
df.to_csv('file.csv') # This will overwrite the original csv file
</code></pre>
<p>You can loop the code above and it will delete the new first row of the csv each time.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can just put all the lines of your csv file in a list via <code>readlines()</code> and then delete the line you want. For example:</p>
<pre><code>f = open("mycsvfile.csv")
l = f.readlines()

for i in l:
    ...  # do some operation

    del l[i]  # delete the line
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">are you writing out to the file after each operation? if not why not just process the file and then delete the file afterwards?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">OP says <code>on the next iteration i would be deleting row2 and then the next iteration row3</code> so this answer is not correct</span>
<span class="comment-copy">actually this is fine as row2 would be the new row1</span>
<span class="comment-copy">please format your code, also this deletes it from a list that you read in, not the actual CSV file itself</span>
