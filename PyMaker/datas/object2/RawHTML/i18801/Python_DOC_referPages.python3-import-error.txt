<p>I have been confusing Python 3's difference from Python 2 about import. </p>
<p>If I have such a directory like this...</p>
<pre><code>module_test/ -&gt;
  a/hello.py
  lib/mad.py
</code></pre>
<p>And I want to import hello module from lib/mad.py</p>
<p>So I wrote code like this..</p>
<p>lib/mad.py</p>
<pre><code>import a.hello
</code></pre>
<p>And I call python lib/mad.py ,but it happend ImportError.</p>
<p>I don't know why it happen like this.</p>
<p>Do you have any idea? I want to solve this question.</p>
<p>Sample repository is <a href="https://github.com/okamurayasuyuki/module_test/tree/master/lib" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/okamurayasuyuki/module_test/tree/master/lib</a> . ##Thanks in advance. </p>

<p>Your problem is that by running <code>mad.py</code> from the <code>module_test</code> directory, you guessed that Python would use your current directory as base for finding module <code>b</code>. To prove that it doesn't work, do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Edit your <code>mad.py</code> script and add the following to the beggining of the script:</p>
<pre><code>import sys
print(sys.path)
exit()
</code></pre>
<p>This will just print the search path Python uses to find modules you try to import and then exit.</p></li>
<li><p>Open the terminal, go to folder <code>/module_test</code> and run the following:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; python lib/mad.py
</code></pre>
<p>Now you should see the path dumped to the terminal. Note that the first entry in the list is the folder 'module_test/lib' not 'module_test' as you would have thought.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>So, how do you solve the problem? </p>
<p>Simple: you just have to tell Python the correct directory it should be using to look for your modules. To do that, you must set the PYTHONPATH enviroment variable:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/module_test
</code></pre>
<p>Now if you try to run your script, it should import <code>a.hello</code> as expected!</p>
<hr/>
<p>PS: You should read the official Python tutorial, specially chapter 6 which explains the concept of modules and packages:</p>
<p><a href="http://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html" rel="nofollow">http://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html</a></p>
<p>That should give you a basic understading and help you solve your problem.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Looks like the <code>a</code> directory might not be on your Pythonpath. Post your exact stacktrace or you're not going to get any more useful help.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for your answer! It works.</span>
