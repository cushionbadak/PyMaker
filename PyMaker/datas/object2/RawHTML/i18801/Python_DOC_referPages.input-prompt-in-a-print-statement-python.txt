<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>in the following example</p>
<pre><code>print ("How old are you?" , input("please input"))
</code></pre>
<p>when executing it, why is it that it asks for input propmpt before printing "How old are you?"?
What is the order of execution of sections of print statement?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Whatever you pass to the <code>print()</code> function has to be executed <em>first</em>. How else would Python know what to pass to the <code>print()</code> function?</p>
<p>Generally speaking, in order for Python to call a function, you need to first determine what values you are passing into that function. See the <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#calls" rel="nofollow">Calls expression documentation</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All argument expressions are evaluated before the call is attempted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Calling <code>print()</code> you are passing in a string (<code>"How old are you?"</code>), and the <em>result</em> of calling <code>input("please input")</code>. Python has to execute those sub-expressions first before it can call <code>print()</code>.</p>
<p>In this specific case, just use <code>How old are you?</code> as the <code>input()</code> prompt:</p>
<pre><code>age = input("How old are you? ")
</code></pre>
<p>and don't bother with <code>print()</code>.</p>
<p>If you did want to print <code>How old are you?</code> on a separate line first, call <code>print()</code> with <em>just</em> that string, then on a separate line, call <code>input()</code>:</p>
<pre><code>print("How old are you?")
age = input("please input")
</code></pre>
<p>Note that <code>input()</code> returns whatever string the user entered, you want to store that somewhere. In my examples, <code>age</code> is that 'somewhere'.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">as a general rule, it is not a good habit to use expressions with side-effect (like <code>input()</code>), or expressions whose values depends on the order of evaluation, inside other expressions (like print).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">but while executing the (print()) function, it passes ("How old are you?") first right? so isnt that supposed to print first?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user2524557: No, you are passing two arguments to <code>print()</code>. They <i>both</i> need to be evaluated before calling <code>print()</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user2524557 what you are looking for is called <a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Lazy_evaluation" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Lazy evaluation</a>. very few languages has this feature.</span>
