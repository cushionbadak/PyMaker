<p>I'm stuck on something that might be very simple, but I can't find a solution. I'm using Python since few days and I need to use regex to get part of a file.</p>
<p>I put the result of a <code>git log -p</code> into a file, and now I want to extract some informations. The only thing I can't extract is the comment block.</p>
<p>This block is between : a date line AND (a diff line OR the end of the list).</p>
<pre><code>...
Date:   Wed Jul 3 22:32:36 2013 +0200

    Here is the comment
    of a commit

    and I have to
    extract it

diff --git a/dir.c b/dir.c
...
</code></pre>

    Here is the comment
    of a commit

    and I have to
    extract it
</code></pre>
<p>So I tried to do this :</p>
<pre><code>commentBlock = re.compile("(?&lt;=Date:.{32}\n\n).+(?=|\n\ndiff)", re.M|re.DOTALL)
findCommentBlock = re.findall(commentBlock,commitBlock[i]) # I've splited my git log everytime I find a "commit" line.
</code></pre>
<p>Problems are :</p>
<ul>
<li>the length of the date line can change. It can be <code>Date:.{32}</code> if the date is between the 1st to 9th or <code>Date:.{33}</code> if the date is 2 numbers long.</li>
<li>I don't know how to say : "the comment block stops when a line starts by <code>diff</code> OR when it's the end of the list (or the file)".</li>
</ul>
<p>P.S. I'm working on Python 3.x and I almost finished my script so I don't really wanna use a specific tool like <code>GitPython</code> (that only works on 2.x)</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Here's one way to do it:</p>
<pre><code>rgx = re.compile(r'^Date: .+?\n+(.+?)(?:^diff |\Z)', re.MULTILINE | re.DOTALL)
comments = rgx.findall(txt)
</code></pre>
<p>A few notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>I don't think you need to worry about the length of the Date line.</li>
<li>Capture the part you care about. This has two implications. (1) To ignore the Date line, just consume (non-greedily) everything through the first newlines. (2) You don't need a lookahead assertion; a non-capturing group <code>(?:...)</code> will work fine.</li>
<li>It's probably a good idea to make the captured wildcard non-greedy as well: <code>.+?</code>.</li>
<li>You can indicate the end of a string in a regex with <code>\Z</code>. Thus, the non-capturing group means: (a) a line beginning with "diff " or (b) end of string.</li>
<li>More details on regex features can be found in the excellent <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html" rel="nofollow">Python docs</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Though the date may change in length, it is definitely terminated by a new-line, so why limit the number of characters at all?</p>
<p>Anyway, you should be able to do something like <code>{32,33}</code> to capture the range.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Give this a try:</p>
<pre><code>re.findall('Date:.+?\n\s*(.+?)\s*(?:diff|$)', text, re.S)
</code></pre>
<p>This should return a list of comment entries, assuming that all of the log entries follow the same pattern you have laid out here.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">It works perfectly for the end. How can change your code to extract only the comment block ? I don't want to get the date line. Thanks for your notes ! :D</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Great, thanks ! I stil have a problme though. I've this : <code>('Date:   Wed Jul 3 22:32:36 2013 +0200\n\n    my comment block', ' my comment block ')</code>. How can I just get the second part ? (dunno if I'm clear)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">indeed, my bad ! Thank you very much FMc :D</span>
<span class="comment-copy">you're right about the length. With FMc solution, it doesn't work when I write <code>^Date:.{32,33}\n\n.+?(?=^diff |\Z)</code>  Sorry, I'm still very confused with regex</span>
