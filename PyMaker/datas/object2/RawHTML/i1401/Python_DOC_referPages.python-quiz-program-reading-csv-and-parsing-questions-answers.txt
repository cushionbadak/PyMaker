<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have a simple quiz in Python that's having issues. It reads a comma-separated text file in "question,answer" format. The program is reading the quiz fine and outputs the questions, but I can't get the questions to randomize and the "CorrectAnswer" variable to read the correct answer.</p>
<p>For instance, if the question is, "What is the capital of California?" and the answer is "Sacramento", the CSV file has it written like this: "What is the capital of California,Sacramento". But the program can't reference the answer, only the first part before the comma.</p>
<p>What am I doing wrong?</p>
<pre><code>def quiz():
    score=0
    questionsRight=0
    fileName = input("Please enter the name of the quiz file: ")
    quizFile = open(fileName,"r")
    quizData = quizFile.readlines()
    questionno=1
    for x in range(10):
        for x in quizData:
            data = x.split(",")
        random.shuffle(quizData)
        questions = data[0]
        CorrectAnswer = data[1]

        print("Question #",questionno)
        print(questions)
        answer = input("What is your answer? ")
        if answer == CorrectAnswer:
            print("Correct!")
            score=score+1
            questionsRight=questionsRight+1
            questionno = questionno+1

        else:
            print("Incorrect.")
            questionno = questionno+1

    totalScore = (score / 10) * 100

<p>There's a stdlib library for this: <code>csv</code>.</p>
<pre><code>import csv

with open("path/to/your/quizfile.csv") as f:

    quiz_qas = list(reader)  # this could get *very* large -- take care if you have a large file.

<ul>
<li>Use <code>csv</code> module. See <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/53567646/3129414">Adam Smith's answer</a>. </li>

<span class="comment-copy">I checked your code, on my sample data it works <i>almost</i> fine - the problem is that <code>x.split(",")</code> output end of the line <code>\n</code> symbol as well. For example, <code>data=['q1', 'a1\n']</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yeah I saw that too. Any suggestions on how to write it so the \n symbol is ignored?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@spiritoffire224 see my answer for a more comprehensive solution, but the minimal solution is to simply write <code>CorrectAnswer = data[1].rstrip()</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Awesome that's exactly what I was looking for! However, I need to have the user specify an input. fileName = input("Please enter the name of the quiz file: ")</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@spiritoffire224 that's fine -- you can replace that placeholder string <code>"path/to/your/quizfile.csv"</code> any way you like, including prompting the user for it first.</span>
