<p>I'm having some issues where whenever I make a call to one of my classes methods it's requiring me to specifically send the containing class with the call, where I would expect it to already know about it self. I'm sure this is user error but can not track it down.</p>
<p>I've referenced <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53218211/python-self-required-positional-argument">python - self - required positional argument</a> but i think i've got that covered.</p>
<pre><code>class SpeechEngine():

def __init__(self):
    self.conn = sqlite3.connect('../twbot.db')
    self.c = self.conn.cursor()

@staticmethod
def choose(choice):
    num_choices = len(choice)
    selection = random.randrange(0, num_choices)
    return selection

def initial_contact_msg(self, userId, screenName):
    hello = self.c.execute("SELECT text, id FROM speechConstructs WHERE type='salutation'").fetchall()
    tagline = self.c.execute("SELECT text, id FROM speechConstructs WHERE type='tagline'").fetchall()
    c1 = self.choose(hello)
    c2 = self.choose(tagline)
    msg_string = str(hello[c1][0]) + ' @' + screenName + ' ' + tagline[c2][0]
    # print(msg_string) # For Testing Only
    # print(hello[c1][1]) # For Testing Only
    return msg_string
</code></pre>
<p>And then I would expect to call</p>
<pre><code>SpeechEngine.initial_contact_msg(0, 'somename')
</code></pre>
<p>But that returns the following</p>
<pre><code>missing 1 required positional argument: 'self'
</code></pre>
<p>Where as if i do it implicitly </p>
<pre><code>SpeechEngine.initial_contact_msg(SpeechEngine, 0, 'somename')
</code></pre>
<p>It returns the expected results no questions asked.
I should also point out the same happens when i would assign it as follows.</p>
<pre><code>test = SpeechEngine
test.initial_contact_msg(0, 'somename')
</code></pre>

<p>Since initial_contact_msg is a method, you need to call it from an instance, not the Type. Your last attempt is almost right. To instantiate it, you need to do the following:</p>
<pre><code>test = SpeechEngine()
test.initial_contact_msg(0, 'sometime')
</code></pre>
<p>"SpeechEngine" is the type class. When you create a new instance you need to call it like a function. This is similar to using the "new" keyword in other languages.</p>
<p>When you have a static method, this can be called directly from the Type object:</p>
<pre><code>SpeechEngine.choose()
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">You probably want to create an instance of <code>SpeechEngine</code>. <code>speech_engine = SpeechEngine()</code> and then call the methods on <code>speech_engine</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Aha, in your last exanple, you're missing <code>()</code> on <code>test = SpeechEngine</code>. Without <code>()</code> at the end, you just end up binding the class to another name rather than creating an instance</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for the help, this was indeed the problem!</span>
