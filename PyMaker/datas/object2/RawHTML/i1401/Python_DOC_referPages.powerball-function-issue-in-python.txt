<p>My function stops working at the <code>if matches in ticket</code> line, immediately after the <code>matches</code> point, listing the error as invalid input. What is the reason for this, and how can I fix it? I'm very new to Python, so any help is very much appreciated. Additionally, this function is still a work in progress, and I recognize that it is currently highly inefficient, but I am attempting to fix this error before anything else is changed.</p>

<p>Some things I am picking up as I am reading your code:</p>
<ol>
<li>Your indentation is still all over the place, some places you use 2 spaces, others you use 4 - you <strong>need</strong> to fix this, python relies heavily on indentation to compile.</li>
<li>In your function <code>winner</code> you are not doing anything, the double equals sign is a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#comparisons" rel="nofollow noreferrer">test operator</a> and will not do any assignment, it will simply <em>check</em> if the value in win1 is equal to the randomly generated number.</li>
<li>In the same function, you make a variable <code>winner</code> that holds a string with the characters <code>win1 win2 ...</code> in it, I can only assume you are trying to create an object that holds these win1 variables, for that you can use a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists" rel="nofollow noreferrer">list</a>, like so:
<code>winners = [win1, win2, win3, win4, win5, win6]</code></li>
<li>In that same function you are not returning anything, so the function is useless, in order to <em>send</em> the output of the function back to what called it you must use <code>return(winners)</code></li>
</ol>
<p>I have no idea what you're trying to do in your largest <code>playPowerBall</code> function, so I will just discuss some things that are clearly confusing you: </p>
<ol start="5">
<li><code>def</code> as a keyword <em>defines</em> a function, but does not execute it, you must call that function for it to run.</li>
<li>Like I said earlier, in order to send results out of a function you must <em>return</em> the answer/result.</li>
<li>I have a hunch that instead of seeing <code>invalid input</code> you are seeing an <code>invalid syntax</code> error because you are trying to check whether the integer <code>matches</code> is inside the function pointer <code>ticket</code>. This is not a valid syntax, to make a function call you must use parentheses otherwise python thinks you are referring to the function pointer, so <code>matches in ticket()</code> could be valid syntax, however as you have defined it I cannot see how that would work.</li>
</ol>
<p>Has this code ever compiled properly or run at all? I think you need to go back to much more basic stuff about function definitions before trying to construct something this complex, start with one function definition and try and get that to work in a small program and then come back to this.</p>
<p>Let me know if there is anything else I can help with.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">This program won't run at all because its indentation is inconsistent. Please reproduce your indentation accurately. If readers have to try and guess your actual indentation, they may miss problems or introduce new ones into the program.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">My apologies. I did need to alter the indentation when posting it here, and evidently I did some areas incorrectly, but in my editor all indentation is correct. The invalid input begins halfway through the said line, beginning at the s in matches. What is the reason for this and how should I fix it?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">no reason to downvote his question. It is valid, but he needs to format the code better...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Indentation is still inconsistent. The program fails because of wrong indentation.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yiekey: delete what you have now and paste your code again into the question. Select just the code, then press Ctrl+K <b>or</b> click the <code>{}</code> button in the toolbar. That should really be all you need to do. Well, that, and adding the exact error message.
