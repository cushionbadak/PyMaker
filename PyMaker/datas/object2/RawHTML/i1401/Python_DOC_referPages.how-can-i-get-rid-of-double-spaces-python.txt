<p>I have a data file (<code>.txt</code>) containing some lines, each line as following:</p>
<p><code>0  45  1  31  2  54  3  54  4  64</code></p>
<p>With a white space before zero, two spaces between each two integers and a white space at the end. What I want is to have it like following:</p>
<p><code>0 45 1 31 2 54 3 54 4 64</code></p>
<p>I am trying everything (using Python) but I am not successful!</p>
<p>Of course at the end I want to reform it to:</p>
<p><code>45 31 54 54 64</code></p>
<p>That is eliminating the numbers 0 to 4 as well. But this last step is maybe easier to do if I reach the first one.</p>
<p>For example I have tried this:</p>
<pre><code>with open('myfile', rt') as openfile, open('myfile_2, 'a') as csvfile:
    for line in openfile:
            A = str(line).replace('  ', ' ')
            Writer = csv.writer(csvfile, delimiter=' ', quotechar=' ')
            Writer.writerow([A])
</code></pre>
<p>But yet in the `myfile_2' the string is not corrected.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Made Changes Accordingly:</p>
<pre><code>with open('newtes.txt', 'w') as outfile, open('tes.txt', 'r') as infile:
    for line in infile:
        outfile.write(line.replace('  ',' ').strip())
</code></pre>
<p>edit 1 : strip() added as suggested in the comment <br/>
edit 2 : Made Changes.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You could use <code>re</code> instead:</p>
<pre><code>import re
# Handles multiple whitespaces
WHITE_SPACE_PATTERN = re.compile(r' +')
# or
# WHITE_SPACE_PATTERN = re.compile(r'\s+')
# if you want to handle newlines as well

sample_string = "0  45  1  31  2  54  3  54  4  64"
cleaned_string = re.sub(WHITE_SPACE_PATTERN, ' ', sample_string.strip())
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You could use a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">regular expression</a>  to match one or more spaces (<code>' +'</code>, where <code>+</code> implies "one or more") and substitute them with a single space: </p>
<pre><code>import re
line = ''
file_object  = open("test.txt", "r+")
for line in file_object:
    line=line
print re.sub(' +', ' ',line.lstrip())
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">You have tried everything? Could you give some examples?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">When you say "of course you want to reform it to:" you present something which is not at all obvious. You also haven't provided any code indicating you have tried. Try the string method <code>replace</code>, <code>split</code> and then look at list slicing</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You may go with <code>' '.join(yourString.split())</code>, of course you have to load your file first.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Certainly your post lacks what you've tried so far. But I think you should also try to describe the goal you want to achieve, because I feel that "getting rid of double spaces" is only the way you <i>think</i> you need to achieve your goal. But I dare to guess your goal can be achieved easier...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">try this: <code>text.replace(DOUBLESPACE, SINGLESPACE).strip()</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">add <code>.strip()</code> to remove space in the begining and end.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks. I am using the same thing, and when I print it is correct, but in the file <code>myfile_2</code> I have still two spaces.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Check the snippet now.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks a lot. Now it is working, but all lines are in a row, I mean there is no line break.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">So I added <code>outfile.write('\n')</code> as a new line at the end.</span>
