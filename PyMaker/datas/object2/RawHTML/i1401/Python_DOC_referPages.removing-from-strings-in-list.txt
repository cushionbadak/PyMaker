<p>I'm trying to remove or ignore the <code>'</code> symbol (Apostrophe) within a list of strings. I don't know if my for loop is just plain wrong or what: </p>
<pre><code>n = ["a", "a's", "aa's"] #example list

for i in n:
    i.strip("'")
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>strip</code> won't work here use <code>replace</code>,</p>
<pre><code>In [9]: [i.replace("'",'') for i in lst]
Out[9]: ['a', 'as', 'aas']
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Two problems here. </p>
<ul>
<li>First, <code>strip</code> doesn't work in the middle of the string, you have to use `replace("'", "")</li>
<li>Second, and more important, <em>strings are immutable</em>. Even if <code>i.strip(...)</code> did what you want, it would not <em>change</em> <code>i</code>. It would just produce a new string. So, you have to store that string. </li>
</ul>
<p>Sum up, try something like</p>
<pre><code>n = [i.replace("'", "") for i in n]
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>.strip</code> only removes from the start and end of the string, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.strip" rel="nofollow noreferrer">as documented</a>. Also note that it returns a new string, so the list wouldn't have changed anyway.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Also calling<code>strip</code> achieves nothing unless you do something with its return value.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">just do <code>n = [x.replace("'", "") for x in n]</code>. <code>strip</code> does not work here for the reasons explained in the above comments.</span>
