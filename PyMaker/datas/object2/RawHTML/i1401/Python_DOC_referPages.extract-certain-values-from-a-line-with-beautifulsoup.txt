<p>for a school course we are learning advanced python,to get a first idea about web scraping and similar stuff.... I got an exercise to do where I have to extract the values v1, v2 from the following line of an HTML... I tried looking up but couldn't find any really specific things.... If it is unappropriated for SO just delete it....</p>
<p>The HTML part</p>
<pre><code>{"v1":"first","ex":"first_soup","foo":"0","doo":"0","v1":["second"]}
</code></pre>
<p>so afterwards when i want to show the values it should look like </p>
<pre><code>print(v1)
first
print(v2)
second
</code></pre>
<p>I tried to get the values just by slicing the whole line like this:</p>
<pre><code>v1=htmltext[7,12]
v2=htmltext[60,66]
</code></pre>
<p>but in this case I am not using the bs4 module, which is recommended using... I would be very grateful in case someone could teach me...</p>

<p>What you are seeing there is not an HTML file but a JSON. In this case it makes no sense to use BeautifulSoup's HTML parser, you may want to use a standard <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">JSON library</a> to do that, like so:</p>
<pre><code>import json
json_Dict=json.loads(str(soup))
</code></pre>
<p>Then you can index it using the headers (or keys)</p>
<pre><code>json_Dict["v1"]
&gt;&gt;&gt;"first"
</code></pre>
</div>
