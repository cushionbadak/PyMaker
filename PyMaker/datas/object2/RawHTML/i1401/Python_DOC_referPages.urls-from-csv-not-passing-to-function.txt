<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I'm trying to pass Urls from a .csv to a function that will send requests to SMMRY api. The .csv has a column labeled 'url', and the API summarizes websites using SMMRY (<a href="https://smmry.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://smmry.com/</a>) and asyncio. The smmrpy module creates an "article" object and while it can print the properties, I'm trying to past a list of URLs to the function and have it loop and print summarizations until complete</p>
<p>The problem is, the urls aren't being passed to the function.  Below is my code</p>
<pre><code>import time
import csv
import asyncio
import smmrpy


s = smmrpy.SMMRPY("ABCDEFGHI")
with open('Dec1.csv') as csvFile:
    reader = csv.DictReader(csvFile)
    for row in reader:
        URL = (row['url'])

    async def main():
        article = await s.get_smmry(URL)
        global contents
        contents = article.content
        #print(contents)
        print(article.keywords)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
    loop.run_until_complete(main())

print(contents)
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>I can't test this, but try:</p>
<pre><code>import time
import csv
import asyncio
import smmrpy


async def main():
    s = smmrpy.SMMRPY("ABCDEFGHI")
    with open('Dec1.csv') as csvFile:
        reader = csv.DictReader(csvFile)
        for row in reader:
            URL = (row['url'])

            article = await s.get_smmry(URL)
            contents = article.content
            print(contents)
            print(article.keywords)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
    loop.run_until_complete(main())

<span class="comment-copy">Did you intend <code>async def main</code> to be part of the <code>for row in reader</code> loop?  It isn't.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Honestly, i'm unsure if its supposed to be part of the for row in header loop or not.  I tried indenting and not indenting; the urls don't pass to it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The gist is that you reassign <code>URL</code> each time through the for loop and only the final value gets used.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is awesome.  It worked just as I want it to.  It stops running if one of the urls doesn't jive with the api, or the text of the article is too short.  Is there a way to code "If error...skip this url and go on to the next?</span>
