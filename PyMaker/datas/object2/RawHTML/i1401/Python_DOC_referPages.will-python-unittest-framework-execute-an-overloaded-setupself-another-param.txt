<p>If I <strong>overload</strong> (not override)  the setUp method, will it still be executed before each test method?</p>
<p>If not, does it affect the execution of setUp() (the non-overloaded version)?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Python does not support method overloading. The actual method will be the method which was defined last.</p>
<pre><code>class A:
    def foo(self, arg_one): pass

    def foo(self, arg_one, arg_two): pass

A().foo('')
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
TypeError: foo() missing 1 required positional argument: 'arg_two'
</code></pre>
<p>That is mostly because Python is dynamically typed language. Overloading rules would have been way too complicated if overloading was to be (somehow) supported.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">While overloading is rarely used and likely to be unidiomatic, Python has had support for overloading via <code>@functools.singledispatch</code> in the stdlib since 3.4, released in 2014. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.singledispatch" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/â€¦</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@goodside "likely to be unidiomatic" what an understatement... I'd cringe if I saw that in production code.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Perhaps, but "Python does not support method overloading" is also an overstatement. It's part of the stdlib and useful in rare cases. One would be writing a wrapper for an existing non-Python API that uses heavy overloading, where you want to maintain as much consistency as possible.</span>
