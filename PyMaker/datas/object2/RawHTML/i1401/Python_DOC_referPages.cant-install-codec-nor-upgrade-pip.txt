<p>I am working on a project that has many encode and decode issues,so I tried to install codec module for my python 3.7:</p>
<p>so I did:</p>
<pre><code>$pip install codec
</code></pre>
<p>and the Command prompt windows showed as below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Collecting codec   Could not find a version that satisfies the
  requirement codec (from versions: ) No matching distribution found for
  codec You are using pip version 10.0.1, however version 18.1 is
  available. You should consider upgrading via the 'python -m pip
  install --upgrade pip' command.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>then I did the pip upgrade followed as the above to version 18.1:   </p>
<pre><code>$python -m pip install --upgrade pip
</code></pre>
<p>and  the Command windows showed as below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Installing collected packages: pip   Found existing installation: pip
  10.0.1
      Uninstalling pip-10.0.1:
        Successfully uninstalled pip-10.0.1 Successfully installed pip-18.1</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and I used </p>
<pre><code>$pip list
</code></pre>
<p>to check the pip version is 18.1&gt;&gt;&gt;It did upgrade.
then I did install codecs again:</p>
<pre><code>$pip install codec
</code></pre>
<p>and  the Command windows showed as below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Collecting codec   Could not find a version that satisfies the
  requirement codec (from versions: ) No matching distribution found for
  codec</p>
</blockquote>
<p>so I put another command :</p>
<pre><code>$pip install --upgrade pip -vvv
</code></pre>
<p>and  the Command windows showed as below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Config variable 'Py_DEBUG' is unset, Python ABI tag may be incorrect
  Config variable 'WITH_PYMALLOC' is unset, Python ABI tag may be
  incorrect</p>
<p>--------leave out between section----------------------------------------</p>
<p>Requirement already up-to-date: pip in
  c:\users\XXX\appdata\local\programs\python\python37\lib\site-packages
  (18.1)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What should I do next?
Is anyone could help me,please.</p>

<p><a href="https://pypi.org/project/codec/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">codec</a> doesn't provide any installation packages â€” no wheels, no eggs, no source distributions.</p>
<p>Its <a href="https://github.com/metagriffin/codec" rel="nofollow noreferrer">git repository</a> doesn't contain any code beyond <code>setup.py</code>.</p>
<p>I'm sure the package is not what you want. You're probably looking for <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/codecs.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">module <code>codecs</code></a>. It is in the standard repository, that is it's always available, no need to install it.</p>
