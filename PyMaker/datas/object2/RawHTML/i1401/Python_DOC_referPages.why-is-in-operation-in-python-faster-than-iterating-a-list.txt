<p>For example, I want to determine if a certain number a is in a list A. If I use <code>return a in A</code>, this would be much faster than writing an iteration function like</p>
<pre><code>for number in A: 
    if a == number:
        return True
</code></pre>
<p>What's under the hood? Is Python using a different way as mine to determine the membership? I skimmed the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#membership-test-details" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python documentation</a> but didn't find the answer.</p>

<p><strong>6.10.2. Membership test operations</strong></p>
<p>For container types such as list, tuple, set, frozenset, dict, or collections.deque, the expression <code>x in y</code> is equivalent to <code>any(x is e or x == e for e in y)</code>.</p>
<p>For the string and bytes types, <code>x in y</code> is <code>True</code> if and only if x is a substring of y. An equivalent test is <code>y.find(x) != -1</code>. Empty strings are always considered to be a substring of any other string, so <code>"" in "abc"</code> will return <code>True</code>.</p>
<p>For user-defined classes which define the <code>__contains__()</code> method, <code>x in y</code> returns <code>True</code> if <code>y.__contains__(x)</code> returns a true value, and <code>False</code> otherwise.</p>
<p>For user-defined classes which do not define <code>__contains__()</code> but do define <code>__iter__()</code>, <code>x in y</code> is <code>True</code> if some value <code>z</code> with <code>x == z</code> is produced while iterating over <code>y</code>. If an exception is raised during the iteration, it is as if <code>in</code> raised that exception.</p>
<p>Lastly, the old-style iteration protocol is tried: if a class defines <code>__getitem__()</code>, <code>x in y</code> is <code>True</code> if and only if there is a non-negative integer index <code>i</code> such that <code>x == y[i]</code>, and all lower integer indices do not raise IndexError exception. (If any other exception is raised, it is as if in raised that exception).</p>

<span class="comment-copy">It gets pushed into C code, assuming you are talking about CPython</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@roganjosh I'm pretty sure that even without CPython, if <code>A</code> is a built in <code>list</code> object then the implementation of <code>in</code> is still in C.</span>
