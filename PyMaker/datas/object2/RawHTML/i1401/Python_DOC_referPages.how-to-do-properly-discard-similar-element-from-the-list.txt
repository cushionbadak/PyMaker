<p>I have list like this:</p>
<pre><code>a = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
b = [10,11,13,2,14,7]
</code></pre>
<p>I want output like this:</p>
<pre><code>b = [10,11,13,14]
</code></pre>
<p>if an element of a is in b then it has been discarded.
please, anyone can tell me how to do this?</p>

<p>Using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">list comprehension</a>:</p>
<p><code>b = [x for x in b if x not in a]</code></p>
<p>Works like this:</p>
<pre><code>a = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
b = [10,11,13,2,14,7]
b = [x for x in b if x not in a]

print b
&gt;&gt; [10, 11, 13, 14]
</code></pre>
<p>Re: @DeepSpace's suggestion, looking for elements of a set in a list will go significantly faster than looking for elements of a list in another list, so declare <code>a</code> as a <code>set()</code></p>
<pre><code>a = set([1,2,3,4,5,6,7])
b = [10,11,13,2,14,7]
b = [x for x in b if x not in a]
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">This is <code>O(len(a) * len(b))</code>. Make <code>a</code> a set and this will become <code>O(len(b))</code> as set lookup is <code>O(1)</code> rather than list lookup which is <code>O(n)</code></span>
