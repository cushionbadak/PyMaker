<p>I have a django project in which one of my models has a dateField named start_time. 
In my views.py I created a DetailView, and try to retrieve the timestamp like:</p>
<pre><code>s = self.object.start_time.strftime('%d-%b-%Y')
</code></pre>
<p>On my Raspberry Pi, it gives the expected result.</p>
<pre><code>print(s)
22-Nov-2018
</code></pre>
<p>However on my Ubuntu 18 computer it gives:</p>
<pre><code>print(s)
22-nov.-2018
</code></pre>
<p>How can I get my Ubuntu machine to give the same (expected) result as the Raspberry Pi?</p>
<p>They both run Django 2.1.3.</p>

<p>The value <code>%b</code> is locale-dependent (see the relevant <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#strftime-and-strptime-behavior" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>strftime</code> doc</a>).</p>
<p>Check the locale on both machines; it's likely they're at least subtly different. Ensuring both are using the same locale would be ideal in any case, but particularly for dates, you might consider sticking to locale-independent numerical values instead.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>What finally fixed my problem was to, on the computer giving unexpected results, add </p>
<pre><code>export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8
</code></pre>
<p>to <code>~/.bashrc</code>. 
Then open a new terminal or call <code>source ~/.bashrc</code>.</p>
<p>An alternative is to include </p>
<pre><code>import locale
locale.setlocale(locale.LC_ALL, "en_US.UTF-8")
</code></pre>
<p>in <code>views.py</code> of the app.</p>
<p>You can check your current locale settings by calling <code>locale</code> from the terminal. In my case <code>LC_ALL</code> was blank.</p>
