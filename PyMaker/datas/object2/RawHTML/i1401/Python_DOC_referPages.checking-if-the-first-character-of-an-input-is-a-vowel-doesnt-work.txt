<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I'm trying to make a program deciding what determiner comes behind the input.</p>
<pre><code>#For now, this only works with letters A-D.
MyInput = input("What word do you want to find out if the determiner is a/an?")
Finder = list(MyInput)
if ('a' in Finder):
    print ("Start with an.")
else:
    print ("Start with a.")
</code></pre>
<p>However, there is a little bug. When I input the word "bad", it says I need to have "an" go before the word. I want it to only say I need to have "an" be before the word when the first letter is A. What's the solution to this problem?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>It is because <code>in</code> checks if the character can be found anywhere in the string. When you use "bad" it can. If you are checking the first character use <code>Finder[0]</code></p>
<pre><code>MyInput = input("What word do you want to find out if the determiner is a/an?")
Finder = list(MyInput)
if (Finder[0].lower() == 'a'):
    print ("Start with an.")
else:
    print ("Start with a.")
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Regarding the question, using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.startswith" rel="nofollow noreferrer">str.startwith</a> would be the most clear way to go:</p>
<pre><code># For now, this only works with letters A-D.
my_input = input("What word do you want to find out if the determiner is a/an?")
if my_input.startswith('a'):
    print ("Start with an.")
else:
     print ("Start with a.")
</code></pre>
<p>Pay attention to the fact you do not need to make a list from a string: strings are iterable, they support <code>in</code> and indexing out of the box.</p>
<p>Also note the readability improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Name variables using snake_case</li>
<li>Start a comment with a space</li>
<li>Do not put a conditional into brackets</li>
</ul>
<p>See <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PEP8</a>, the python style guide for more issues and details about codestyle.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>in</code> scans the entire input. You want something like <code>if Finder[0] == 'a'</code>. Or better yet, <code>if Finder[0] in 'aeiou'</code> (though it won't be perfect, because "an" is chosen based on phonetics - e.g. "an MBA" or "a unicorn")</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You should not convert the input to a list. <code>MyInput[0]=='a'</code> suffices. <code>MyInput.startswith('a')</code> is even better (in case the input is empty).</span>
