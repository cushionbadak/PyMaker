<p>I don't even know where to begin with this</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Let's suppose the file you showed there is named <strong>myfile.txt</strong> (just make sure to uncomment the first line). Then, the following code should solve your problem:</p>
<pre><code>import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv(myfile_path, sep=',')

average_salaries = df["SALARY"].mean

print(average_salaries)
</code></pre>
<p>And just like that the magic is done. If you don't have pandas installed, run <code>pip install pandas</code> in your terminal.</p>
<p><a href="https://pandas.pydata.org" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Pandas</a> is a python library created specifically for data analysis. Considering your file is basically a csv, it is probably the best approach to properly interact with it. In the case I showed you, I converted your file into a <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.23.4/generated/pandas.DataFrame.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">dataframe</a> named df, so pandas can deal with it.</p>
<p>In this specific case, we are using the function <code>.mean</code> to calculate the average of the column <code>SALARY</code>, by calling it as a list. (there are a bunch of other functions, of course).</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Welcome to SO. Please see <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask">stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Try to read the data first from the file. And then try to access salary data only</span>
<span class="comment-copy">i have done but cant access that data only</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Use the <code>csv</code> module to read the data (use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.Dialect.skipinitialspace" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>skipinitialspace</code></a> as well).  Make a list of <code>Employee</code> objects, then it's as simple as <code>sum(emp.salary for emp in employees)</code> for example</span>
<span class="comment-copy">its for a uni assignment which I cannot use csv</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Your file can't have the .csv extension? If so, add that to your question.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Also, there is no problem in reading a .txt file with pd.read_csv(). It'll work as well. No need to change the file's extension.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for your help. Looking a few different ways to get it would you have some sample code without using the pandas module?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Unfortunately, not something as quickly to provide as my solution over there. An option would be to read your file and store the information as a <code>matrix</code> or two-dimentional <code>numpy array</code>. Once you do that, I highly recommend you convert it to a pandas dataframe (the flow would basically be <code>txt file</code> -&gt; <code>matrix</code> -&gt; <code>dataframe</code>, with no CSV codification). I can later try to send you some approaches and possibilities.</span>
