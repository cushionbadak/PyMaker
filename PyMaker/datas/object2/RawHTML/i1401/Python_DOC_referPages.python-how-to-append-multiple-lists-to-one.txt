<p>I have a list that should contain all my other lists. Currently I append every list separately but that just looks pretty ugly..</p>
<pre><code>looplist = []  # initiate an empty list that contains all date from the other lists 
[...]
looplist.append(internallist1)
[...]
looplist.append(internallist10)
</code></pre>
<p>the internallists are all getting initialized and filled in a for loop</p>

<p>The <code>zip</code> method could work for you as you stated your output should:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>look something like [ [list1], [list2], ... , [list n] ]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>in your case the code would be similar to</p>
<pre><code>looplist = list(zip(internallist1,[...], internallist10))
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can simply use <code>+</code> to merge them.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>listOne.extend(anotherList)
</code></pre>
<p>this could help you: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html</a></p>
<p>you can also do <code>listOne+=anotherList</code> and this is less expensive, as it doesn`t involve a function call like <code>extend</code></p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>To answer what you are asking, Just initialize looplist with your 10 lists.</p>
<pre><code>looplist = [internallist1,
            internallist2,
            internallist3] #Note: internallist3,] is also valid, python allows trailing comma. Nifty!
</code></pre>
<p>However, your 10 lists really shouldn't be separately named lists in the first place if this is your real use case. Just use <code>looplist[0] through looplist[9]</code> instead from the get go.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">you can just <code>+</code> them (EDIT: if I understand what you're trying to do correctly, i'm not sure why you have a list of lists to begin with so perhaps this isn't your solution)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I actually don't know what is wrong with the approach OP is using or why he wants to change it, or what he's expecting to get.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I want to have lists within the looplist, so the final structure should look something like [ [list1], [list2], ... , [list n] ].</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I updated my answer, I hope it helps.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>list+=anotherList</code> looks like you're using <code>list</code> as a variable name, which is obviously a bad idea.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thanks mate, I updated it. @Stael</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Assuming that OP's code works but is ugly, this will <i>not</i> work as <code>extend</code> does something different than <code>append</code> (as does <code>+</code>).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">can you please elaborate? @tobias_k</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It`s a generic way, he can use this piece of code inside the loop.</span>
