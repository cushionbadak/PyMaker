<p>I'm working on experimental data where I create a temperature profile from 45 °C to 5 °C and then again to 45 °C.
Plotting the data results in a loop, since cooling from 45 °C to 5 °C and heating from 5° C to 45 °C are recorded. But since I need to the plot to appear "chronological" every temperature needs to be unique.</p>
<p>The image shows a visual explanation of what I need.

<p>What I did therefore is getting the difference from each consecutive temperature interval using numpys "diff" function. So far so good.
Now to make a useful plot out of this I need to somehow create a new list where every item is the sum from the ones before.</p>
<p>A small example of what I'm looking for:</p>
<pre><code>my_list = [1,2,5,1,4,2,3]
#some operation
result_list = [1,3,8,9,13,15,18]
</code></pre>
<p>Would be great if someone knows how to do that or has a smarter idea how to get the job done!</p>

<p>Since this question is tagged <code>numpy</code> but for some reason nobody posts the numpy solution... use <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/reference/generated/numpy.cumsum.html" rel="noreferrer"><code>numpy.cumsum</code></a>. :)</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; my_list = [1,2,5,1,4,2,3] # could also be a numpy array
&gt;&gt;&gt; np.cumsum(my_list)
array([ 1,  3,  8,  9, 13, 15, 18])
</code></pre>

<p>There is a nice feature from <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>itertools</code></a> called <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.accumulate" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>accumulate</code></a> that does exactly that:</p>
<pre><code>from itertools import accumulate

lst = [1,2,5,1,4,2,3]
result_list = list(accumulate(lst))
print(result_list)  # -&gt; [1, 3, 8, 9, 13, 15, 18]
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>my_list = [1,2,5,1,4,2,3]
result_list = [my_list[0]]

for i in my_list[1:]:
    result_list.append(result_list[-1] + i)
</code></pre>
<p>This should do the trick.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">this is a bit <i>hacky</i>. using <code>enumerate</code> would be more straightforward.</span>
