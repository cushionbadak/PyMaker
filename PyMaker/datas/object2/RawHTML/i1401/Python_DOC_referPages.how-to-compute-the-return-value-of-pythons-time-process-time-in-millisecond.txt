<p>I am using python 3.6.5 <code>time.process_time()</code> to compute some performance. </p>
<p>Here its description in its official <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.process_time" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>time.process_time() â†’ float</p>
<p>Return the value (in fractional seconds) of the sum of the system and user CPU time of the current process. It does not include time
  elapsed during sleep. It is process-wide by definition. The reference
  point of the returned value is undefined, so that only the difference
  between the results of consecutive calls is valid.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I used it in a similar way to this small example:</p>
<pre><code>import time
x=0
start = time.process_time()
for x in range(100000):
    performance = time.process_time() - start

print("performance: ",performance)
</code></pre>
<p>Which gives me this output based on my machine (so I understand it can be different in another machine):</p>
<pre><code>performance:  0.051401815000000003
</code></pre>
<p>1) How can I convert the above value (the output which is supposed to be the elapsed time to perform the loop as an example) to milliseconds? I am confused because the documentation says it returns the value in fractional seconds.</p>
<p>2) What is the meaning of <code>fractional seconds</code>? If it is the fraction on the right of a float of a second, say in <code>11.56</code> seconds, it is <code>0.56</code>, then how can I know the seconds value?</p>
<p>3) I am using it to compute elapsed time or performance time. I just need the time the function took. </p>
<p>I already used it so please try <code>not</code> to suggest another function. Clarify what I used to me please.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>"in fractional seconds" means "in seconds represented as a floating-point number" (as opposed to C's <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/chrono/time" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>time</code></a>, for example, which returns an integral number of seconds).</p>
<p>So, to convert the value to milliseconds, multiply it by 1000.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">That's what I thought. But can you check this post's <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8937708/what-is-a-fractional-second">answer</a>. It confused me. The answer says it is the fraction part of a number. Can you help me what am I missing?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user9371654, well, English is confusing sometimes. You just ran into some kind of a terminology clash here.</span>
