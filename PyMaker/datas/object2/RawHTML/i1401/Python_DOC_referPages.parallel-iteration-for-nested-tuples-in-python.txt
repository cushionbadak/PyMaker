<p>I was wondering if something akin to:</p>
<pre><code>x,y = (1,2),'a'
</code></pre>
<p>would be possible in a for loop, like:</p>
<pre><code>my_tuple = ((1,2),(2,3),(3,4))
your_tuple = ('a','b','c')

for x,y in my_tuple, your_tuple:
    ...
</code></pre>
<p>At the moment I can't even figure out how to do it with 3 variables.</p>

 Here is the code:</p>
<pre><code>my_tuple = ((1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4))
your_tuple = ('a', 'b', 'c')

for x, y in zip(my_tuple, your_tuple):
    print(x, y)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Take a look at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#zip" rel="nofollow noreferrer">zip</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Okay, that was easier than I thought. Thanks!</span>
