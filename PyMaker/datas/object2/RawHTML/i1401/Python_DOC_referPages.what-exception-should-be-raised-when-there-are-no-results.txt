<p>I’m using a function that performs a query, and returns either some or no results. When no results are returned, I want to raise an exception to either stop the script execution, or possibly catch it from some outer context.</p>
<p>What exception should be raised in that case? Are there any pep recommendations about this?</p>
<p>Note that I’m not asking what the query function should return when there are no results (<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/16594103">this has already been covered</a>).</p>

<p>As this is a pretty specific case that doesn't match any of Python's built in exceptions, I'd probably declare a new one and raise that:</p>
<pre><code>class NoResultsFoundError(Exception):
    pass
</code></pre>
<p>Python does also have a generic exception to be used when no other exception seems to apply, called <code>RuntimeError</code>:</p>

<p>But using that would be less informative than using your own.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Most likely a simple <code>ValueError</code> with some appropriate message.</span>
