<p>I'm very new to python and want to create a basic coin flip program that will repeat based on user input.
I was able to create the randomized response for the coin flip but when it asks if I want to repeat it it dosn't generate a new randomized response and instead repeats the same response. how do i get it to restart the program if i input "y".</p>
<pre><code>import random
coin = random.randint(0,1)
y = "y"
n = "n"

import sys
def coin_flip():
    if coin == 0:
        print("Heads")
    elif coin == 1:
        print("tails")
    again = input("flip again?('y' or 'n') ")
    if again == y:
        coin_flip()

    else:
        again == n
        print("good bye")
        sys.exit()
coin_flip()
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Your program keep giving you the same result because you are randomizing the value <code>coin</code> variable outside the <code>coin_flip()</code> function. Therefore, it is only being randomized once, at the start of the program.</p>
<p>To fix that, simply randomize the <code>coin</code> variable value at the start of <code>coin_flip()</code> function</p>
<pre><code>def coin_flip():
    coin = random.randint(0,1)
    # the rest of the function
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You should be generating the random value within the <code>coin_flip</code> function. You only create it at the start of your script, so it is only ever created once.</p>
<p>Move the line <code>coin = random.randint(0,1)</code> to the start of the <code>coin_flip</code> function.</p>

<p>If you dig around a bit in the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>random</code> module</a> you will find some interesting utilities that will make things like this very short and pretty. For example</p>
<pre><code>random.choice(['Heads', 'Tails']
</code></pre>
<p>will give you a random heads or tails without all the extra <code>if/elif</code> logic. These kind of things will make your code easier to read, understand and maintain. For example you could do something like:</p>
<pre><code>import random

while (input("flip again?('y' or 'n') ") == 'y'):
    print(random.choice(['Heads', 'Tails']))
print("good bye")
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Holy crap! it worked! I had no idea you had to randomize 'coin' twice, thank you all for the help!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The idea is to randomize it every time coin_flip is called, since <code>random.randint()</code> only return an integer value. To be more clear about how it works, you can refer to the documentation.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for the help! I'll definitly have to look into the random module further, the elif statements didn't seem like it wasn't very efficient.</span>
