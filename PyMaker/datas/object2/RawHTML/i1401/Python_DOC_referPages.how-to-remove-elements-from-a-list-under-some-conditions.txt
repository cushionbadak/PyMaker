<p>I want to implement Binary Search algorithm in python considering the following list:</p>
<pre><code>Fibonacci_Seq = [1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89]
</code></pre>
<p>So, I wrote a function to do the calculation but when I came down to this block of code, I didn't know what to do:</p>
<pre><code>min = Fibonacci_Seq[0] #is 1
max = Fibonacci_Seq[-1] #is 89
goal = Fibonacci_Seq[4] #Equals to 5
guess = (min+max)//2  #Equals to 45
if guess &gt; goal: #Is true
            (guess-1)//2 #Equals to 22
            del Fibonacci_Seq[the elements that are less than 22]
</code></pre>
<p>Instead of "The elements that are less than 22", what can I write to eliminate the the numbers less than 22 since putting basic '&lt;=&gt;' signs don't work?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Do a modified Binary Search to find the index of that first element which is greater than or equal to 22 and then just slice the existing list. </p>
<p>In your case the index is <code>8</code> such that <code>Fibonacci_Seq[8]=34</code> and then just slice your list as <code>Fibonacci_Seq=Fibonacci_Seq[8:]</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You could use numpy:</p>
<pre><code>import numpy as np
Fibonacci_Seq = np.array([1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89])
where = Fibonacci_Seq&lt;22
Fibonacci_Seq = Fibonacci_Seq[where]
