<p>Iterating over a file retrieves the data line-by-line by default.

<span class="comment-copy">Quick reminder: When you <code>open()</code> a file, make sure that you <code>close()</code> it after using it. You can also use a context manager (like what was done in martineau's <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/53612989/1116098">answer</a>) to automatically close files after use, without explicitly closing them.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Liam: Since you're new to the site, I suggest you read <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/someone-answers">What should I do when someone answers my question?</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">The <code>my_text = F.readlines()</code> reads the entire file into memory at once, which really isn't necessary (nor likely desirable).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">the requirements was not clear so I gave answer with least changes so the person can get the idea where he was wrong.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yea sorry Im new to this so Im not great at this</span>
<span class="comment-copy">"you have to use readlines" is incorrect. Iterating over the result of readlines will give you the same sequence of line-at-a-time strings that iterating over the file gives (as in the OPs code). Try taking out the "my_text = F.readlines()" line in your code, and this will still work. What you have actually done to solve the problem is adding the nested "for c1 in c:" loop, which will correctly process each line of the file a character at a time.</span>
