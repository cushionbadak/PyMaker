<p>I tried using the <code>random.gauss</code> function in Python to get a random value between a range. The gauss function takes mean, standard deviation as parameters. Shouldn't the return value be between <code>[mean +- standard deviation]</code>?</p>
<p>Below is the code snippet:</p>
<pre><code>for y in [random.gauss(4,1) for _ in range(50)]:
    if y &gt; 5 or y &lt; 3: # shouldn't y be between  (3, 5) ?
        print(y)
</code></pre>
<p>Output of the code:</p>
<pre><code>6.011096878888296
2.9192195126660403
5.020299287583643
2.9322959456674083

<p>No. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution#Standard_deviation_and_coverage" rel="nofollow noreferrer">For the Gaussian distribution slightly less than 32% of the outcomes will be more than one standard deviation away from the mean in either direction</a>.  There is no fixed range that contains 100% of the outcomes.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Gaussian distribution only concern about the probability of a value to deviate from the mean by a certain amount. So, any value is possible, it just that the probability is very low for some range of values</p>

<p>A sample size of 50 is not enough for the sample mean and sample SD to be good estimators of the population mean/SD. <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Law_of_large_numbers" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Law of large numbers to the rescue</a>:</p>
<pre><code>from random import gauss

xs = []

for i in range(100000):
    xs.append(gauss(0,1))

print("mean = ", sum(xs)/len(xs)) # should print a number close to 0
in_sd = len(list(x for x in xs if x &gt; -1 and x &lt; 1))
print("in SD = ",  in_sd/len(xs)) # should print a number close to 0.68

<p>To get random numbers between 3 and 5, use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.uniform" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>random.uniform</code></a><code>(3,  5)</code> instead.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Answer is simple: No. Google it if you need...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Not necessarily.  On average, the value will be 4, the mean, but the values can range up to 3 standard deviations (between 1 and 7 in your case) about 99% of the time, and more the remaining 1%.  Percentages are rough, but give you an idea.  (68% will be between 3 and 5; 95% between 2 and 6, roughly.)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@millimoose to be fair, it's more about what is a Gaussian distribution, than what is random...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Julien - yes and no; the observed mean and deviation of a sample taken from a population with a given distribution are themselves random variables. (Hope I'm using the terminology coherently I took stats nearly a decade ago in German.)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@millimoose The question is not about estimating the parameters, it's about what to expect when generating from a distribution with the parameters as given.</span>
