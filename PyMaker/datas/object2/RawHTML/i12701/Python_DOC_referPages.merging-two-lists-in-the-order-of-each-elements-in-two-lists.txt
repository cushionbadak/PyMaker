<p>I looked at the following <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3938438/merging-two-lists-in-haskell">question</a>. I wanted to do the same in Python.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>List a=[ 1,2,3 none, none] list b=[4,5,3] Output=[1,4,2,5,3,3]</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>z = [ x for x in a if x != None ] + b
</code></pre>
<p>This does not work. I want the z to be [1,4,2,5,3,3]</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>from itertools import chain
list(chain.from_iterable(zip([1, 2, 3, None, None], [4, 5, 6])))
</code></pre>
<p><code>zip(a, b)</code> as mentioned above will create a list of tuples, and <code>chain.from_iterable</code> will flatten the list, discarding <code>None</code>s</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>It looks like you want to <code>chain</code> the lists after <code>zip</code>ing them together and removing <code>None</code> ...</p>
<pre><code>from itertools import chain, izip_longest
with_none = chain.from_iterable(izip_longest(a, b, fillvalue=None)]
without_none = [x for x in with_none if x is not None]
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Use <code>zip(a, b)</code> followed by flattening of list:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; [item for subtuple in zip(a, b) for item in subtuple]
[1, 4, 2, 5, 3, 3]
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">What are the constraints on the positions of the <code>None</code>s?  And how do they influence the output?  e.g. what if the first element of <code>a</code> was <code>None</code>?  What output would you want then?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ajcr - Agreed it is kind of duplicate but the other question did not have the None condition</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I agree it's a fine line - happy to reopen if you feel that those answers aren't directly applicable to your case here (someone else had suggested that duplicate first).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ajcr -- after cleaning up the duplicate issue, I agree that this is a duplicate.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks guys. I totally agree and it looks like it is a duplicate.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">please explain your answer so OP understands</span>
<span class="comment-copy">wtf is itertools?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@TomStudee tools for iterators: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">all these people doing some weird itertools stuff, quite unnecessary. +1 for plain simplicity</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I personally find itertools to be much more simple than nested list-comprehensions -- But I suppose it's what you're used to...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@mgilson Yup :) Still not used to <code>itertools</code> in Python :( Never found the use till now in 6 months since I started using Python in production :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why downvote here?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@RohitJain -- That's a good question . . .</span>
