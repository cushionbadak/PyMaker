<p>How can I write the code so <code>python</code> ONLY prints out the <strong>lower case</strong> letters of the string. In this case, it should exclude the P.</p>
<p>I tried this:</p>
<pre><code>word = "Programming is fun!"

for letter in word:
        if letter.lower():
        print letter
</code></pre>
<p>But it doesn't solely print out the lowercase letters. How could I only get the lower-case characters out of the string instead of the whole string in lower-case. </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You want <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.islower" rel="nofollow"><code>letter.islower()</code></a> (which tests), not <code>letter.lower()</code> (which converts).</p>
<p>If you want to print non-cased characters too, you'd check:</p>
<pre><code>if letter.islower() or not letter.isalpha():
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Try using <code>islower</code> instead :</p>
<pre><code>letter.islower()
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Yours doesn't work because you've called <code>.lower()</code>, which is a method of the String class - it changes the case of the letter in question, and results in <code>True</code>.</p>
<p>There are likely many ways to obtain the result you want, the simplest I can think of being:</p>
<pre><code>word = "Hello World!"
for letter in word:
    if letter.islower():
        print(letter)
</code></pre>
<p>Note that there is an equality test in mine, which is what yours is missing.</p>
<p>EDIT: As other answers pointed out, <code>.islower()</code> is a more succinct way of checking the case of the letter.  Similarly, <code>.isupper()</code> would <code>print</code> only the capital letters.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You could use</p>
<pre><code>print filter(lambda c: c.islower(), word)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>What will actually answer to your question (as i can tell from provided output) will be something like: 
<code>import string
 word="Programming is fun!"
 filter(lambda c: c.islower() or not(c.isupper() and c in string.printable), word)</code></p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">"It doesn't work" is an almost completely useless bug report.  You can get away with it in a question this simple, because what's wrong is immediately obvious to most experienced Python programmers.  As your programs (and your questions about them) become more advanced, they will require <i>much</i> more information about what you tried, what happened, why you felt that was an error, and what you'd expected to happen instead.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, i'll keep that in mind. I just started out so i'm not the keenest on talking like a programmer yet.</span>
