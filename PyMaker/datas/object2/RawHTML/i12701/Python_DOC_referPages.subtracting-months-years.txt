<p>I'm trying to subtract dates, both in the format of Month, Year. I wasn't sure if I should use datetime? I was reading over the docs and wasn't sure what would be the best way to calculate something like subtracting January 2005 from July 2008.</p>

<p>If you're trying to get the length of time between two points, subtracting <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime-objects" rel="nofollow"><code>datetime.datetime</code></a> objects is definitely the approach to take.</p>
<pre><code>import datetime

then = datetime.datetime(year=2015, month=1, day=1)
now = datetime.datetime.now()

difference = now - then
</code></pre>
<p>This generates a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#timedelta-objects" rel="nofollow"><code>datetime.timedelta</code></a>  object</p>
<pre><code>type(difference)  # &lt;class 'datetime.timedelta'&gt;

difference.days  # 351
difference.seconds  # 40732 seconds + 351 days
difference.total_seconds()  # 30367132.648078 seconds total
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>A good idea is to use <code>datetime.datetime</code> objects. Subtracting <code>datetime.datetime</code> objects generates a <code>datetime.timedelta</code> object, as exemplified below</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from datetime import datetime
&gt;&gt;&gt; someday = datetime(2005, 1, 1)
&gt;&gt;&gt; someotherday = datetime(2008, 7, 1)
&gt;&gt;&gt; diff = someotherday - someday
&gt;&gt;&gt; print diff
1277 days, 0:00:00

<span class="comment-copy">How would you programatically break up Decmeber 2008 into datetime format?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MorganAllen well <code>datetime.datetime(year=2015, month=1, day=1)</code> Is January 1st, 2015, so what's December 1st, 2008? :P</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm just not sure on how to write the code to get December 2015 into datetime(year=2015, month 12, day=1)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MorganAllen with your keyboard....? Maybe I don't understand.... Do you have the <i>string</i> <code>"December 2015"</code> and you're trying to turn that into <code>datetime.datetime(year=2015, month=12, day=1)</code>? Sounds like a different (but poor quality) question. Look up string splitting, convert the number to an <code>int</code> and do a dictionary lookup on <code>"December"</code> to see which month number it is.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ok, yes that's what I was asking :-) thank you. I didn't know if Python had an easy way of doing that, or I had to do the conversion myself.</span>
