<p>Here is my code and I'm having a NameError with this code.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NameError: name 'i' is not defined</p>

<p>So that I can't run the code.. Can you help me about it..</p>
<pre><code> linex = [['CATTCG', 'ACT'], ['GGTAC', 'GCATTA']] after file operations..

<p>the small code that explains i what i'm trying to do :</p>
<pre><code>def a(j):

   if j=="":
     return 0
   elif j=="X" or j=="Y":
     return 0
   else:
     return a(j[:-1])


a("GUGUUG")
</code></pre>
<p>I just want to generalize the code for every j in list.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The error is occuring because there is no variable named <code>j</code>.</p>
<p>Replace the <code>j</code> in <code>a(j)</code> with <code>in_file</code>.</p>
<p><br/>
Change this:</p>
<pre><code>a(j)
</code></pre>
<p>To this:</p>
<pre><code>a(in_file)
</code></pre>
<p><br/>
If you prefer to use <code>j</code> instead, then you would need to create/define the <code>j</code> variable like this:</p>
<pre><code>j = open("ncl.txt", "r")
</code></pre>
<p><br/>
It is best practice to give a meaningful name to variables, exactly as you did with <code>in_file</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Then you post a code which uses some file, post a file too, really. Or at least add a content of that file in the code itself. You can do it by adding something like this at the beginning:</p>
<pre><code>my_strings = """line 1
line 2
line 3"""
</code></pre>
<p>This is the same as doing this:</p>
<pre><code>with open("somefile.txt","r") as my_file:
    my_string = my_file.read()
</code></pre>
<p>for a file containing this:</p>
<pre><code>line 1
line 2
line 3
</code></pre>
<p>About you doing readlines() in the body of that function, and then doing recursion. Get this outside, it doesn't belong there, and it will probably everything on the second call, because readlines() will return nothing if file is already has been read.</p>
<p>I'd recommend to use <code>for</code> loops instead of recursions, they are just safer and simplier. I didn't really understood what you are trying to do, so it's just a recommendation.</p>
<p><code>lines</code> and <code>linex</code> are dangerous names, you'll mistake one for another one day and will search for a mistake for hours. Maybe call it like <code>all_lines</code> and <code>lines_list</code>?</p>

<span class="comment-copy">@İlaydaCansınKoç. change how you call the function to <code>a(in_file):</code> and the definition to <code>def a(in_file):</code></span>
