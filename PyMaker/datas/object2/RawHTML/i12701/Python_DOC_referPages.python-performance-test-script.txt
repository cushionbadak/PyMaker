<p>I'm looking for a test script in Python to test a few things to see how fast/slow it completes on various systems.</p>
<p>Just some simple commands that are looped to make the script take say 10 second to complete and a report of how much cpu it uses, how much memory and how long it took to complete?</p>
<p>I guess for the memory part we would use <code>memory_profiler</code>, I guess <code>psutil</code> for the cpu calling out 5 readings one at the start (all separated by 2 seconds) then the average cpu usage used, 1 in the middle of the script and 5 at the end (all separated by 2 seconds)</p>
<p>How best would I go about this or is there already a script avaliable, I can't find anything that is good enough for this.</p>

<p>IPython has <code>%timeit</code>:</p>
<pre><code>%timeit foo()
</code></pre>
<p>line_profiler and memory_profiler can be run from the IPython console:</p>
<pre><code>%load_ext line_profiler
%load_exp memory_profiler

%lprun -f foo foo()
%mprun -f foo foo()
</code></pre>

<p>Average CPU is... trickier. Linux does report a kind of average CPU usage over time, check this: <a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/145247/understanding-cpu-while-running-top-command">https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/145247/understanding-cpu-while-running-top-command</a></p>

<span class="comment-copy">Problem is I can't use iPython in my situation.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Ryflex: <code>ipython</code>'s <code>%timeit</code> is just a simplified way to use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/timeit.html#timeit.repeat" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>timeit.repeat</code></a> which is part of the Python batteries available everywhere. Only difference is <code>repeat</code> requires the <code>setup</code> to import everything it needs (including stuff from <code>__main__</code> where <code>%timeit</code> gets the stuff from <code>__main__</code> automatically), and requires you to tweak <code>number</code> yourself instead of autoranging, but the feature is available no matter what.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Ryflex IPython just makes it easier. Check out the link I provided, you can do all of this without IPython.</span>
