<p>Is there a way to initiate a list with multiple dictionaries (between 30 and 50 dictionaries)?</p>
<p>Instead of doing:</p>
<pre><code>list_of_dicts = [{}, {}, {}, {}, {} ... 32 to 50 times]
</code></pre>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>You can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions" rel="nofollow">list comprehension</a>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; list_of_dicts = [{} for i in range(32)]
&gt;&gt;&gt; len(list_of_dicts)
32
&gt;&gt;&gt; list_of_dicts[0]
{}

<span class="comment-copy">The linked question was the very first Google result with a search of "python list of empty dictionaries".</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@TigerhawkT3, StackOverflow should do a better job of populating the "already answered questions" when someone begins to type a question.  Even though that was the first Google response, it did not pop up here as an existing question.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Are you really trying to tell me that it's SO's fault that you didn't even try Google first? I consider that the absolute bare minimum of research effort. There wasn't even any fancy syntax like <code>site:</code> or <code>""</code> necessary here.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No, you are correct.  It is my fault that I did not try Google first, however, that is not the purpose of my reply.  I am simply stating that SO has some improvements to make especially if I didn't use any fancy syntax like you stated.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for the quick response!</span>
