<p>I want to retrieve all words that have a minimum frequency of 5 with NLTK and store them in the variable for future processing. Can not find anything in NLTK book. Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>Edit: I am using this code and want to filter out words that do not appear more than 5 times.</p>
<pre><code>import os
import glob
from nltk.tokenize import RegexpTokenizer
from nltk.corpus import stopwords

def create():
    read_files = glob.glob("D:\\test\\text\\*.txt")
    with open("D:\\test\\temp.txt", "wb") as outfile:
        for f in read_files:
            with open(f, "rb") as infile:
                outfile.write(infile.read())    

def modify():
    tokenizer = RegexpTokenizer("[\w']+")
    english_stops = set(stopwords.words('english'))
    f = open('D:\\test\\temp.txt')
    out = open('D:\\test\\result.txt', 'w')
    raw = f.read()
    a = tokenizer.tokenize(raw)
    a = [word.lower() for word in a if word not in english_stops]
    a = list(set(a))
    print(a, file=out)

def remove():
    os.remove("D:\\test\\temp.txt")

<p>Use the function <code>FreqDist</code> to get frequencies that filter them by your creteria:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A frequency distribution for the outcomes of an experiment.  A
      frequency distribution records the number of times each outcome of
      an experiment has occurred.  For example, a frequency distribution
      could be used to record the frequency of each word type in a
      document.</p>
<p><a href="http://jazzparser.granroth-wilding.co.uk/api/nltk.probability.FreqDist-class.html" rel="nofollow">ref</a> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is an example how to use it:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import nltk
&gt;&gt;&gt; from nltk import FreqDist
&gt;&gt;&gt; sentence='''This is my sentence is heloo is heloo my my my my'''
&gt;&gt;&gt; tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(sentence)
&gt;&gt;&gt; fdist=FreqDist(tokens)
</code></pre>
<p>With this last, we got a list of words with their frequencies, now you should filter them by your conditions <code>f(w) &gt;= 5</code>, use the <code>filter</code> function: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>filter(function, iterable)</strong> </p>
<p>Construct an iterator from those elements
  of iterable for which function returns true. iterable may be either a
  sequence, a container which supports iteration, or an iterator.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#filter" rel="nofollow">ref</a></p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; list(filter(lambda x: x[1]&gt;=5,fdist.items()))
[('my', 5)]
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If NLTK is not to be used you can use <code>collections</code>.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from collections import Counter
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = "This is my sentence is heloo is heloo my my my my"
&gt;&gt;&gt; c = Counter(a.split(" "))
&gt;&gt;&gt; [key for key in c.keys() if c.get(key) == 5]
['my']
