<p>In Python, I've read that it's better (and easier) to catch execptions, rather than check first, so that's what I'm trying to do.</p>
<p>My script opens and parses an XMLs file using</p>
<pre><code>xml.dom.minidom.parse(xml_file_path)
</code></pre>
<p>so I'm catching</p>
<pre><code>xml.parsers.expat.ExpatError
</code></pre>
<p>but if the file doesn't exist, I get a FileNotFoundError exception, so I obviously need to catch that too.</p>
<p>I know that I shouldn't really be catching all exceptions, but how can I know what exceptions I should be catching for a function like parse()?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can consult documentation of library you use. And even better you can write a test where you trigger exception <strong>first</strong>. Then you will know exactly what exception you need to catch (and have another test to guard you in the future).</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>A good place to start are the '<a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/exceptions.html" rel="nofollow">Built-in Exceptions</a>' of Python. With some study you can tell what operation can cause which exception. The documentation is also particularly useful as it provides practical examples.</p>
<p>Specifically in your case, you are performing file Input/Output operations (IO) and IO operations are handled generally as:</p>
<pre><code>try:
    with open('path_to_file', 'permission') as f:
        #do something with the file
except IOError as e:
    print e
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Could you give an example of the 2nd option if you don't know the exception nameÂ¿?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That sounds like a good idea, but in practice, the docs for the lib I'm using doesn't even mention <code>ExpatError</code> (<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.dom.minidom.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/xml.dom.minidom.html</a>). Maybe I'm looking in the wrong place, can you direct me to the right place?</span>
