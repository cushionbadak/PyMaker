<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have a file that looks like this:<strong>its exactly like this</strong></p>
<pre><code>Pokemon     HP  Attack_Points   Type    Weakness
Bulbasaur   45     49     Grass Fire
Ivysaur     60     62     Grass Fire
Venusaur    80     82     Grass Fire
</code></pre>
<p>and I am trying to generate list from a random line and this is my code:</p>
<pre><code>from random import randint

open_pokedex=open("pokedex.txt","r")
p1_p1=list()
pokemon_selection=(randint(1,40))
p1_p1.append(open_pokedex.readline()[pokemon_selection])
</code></pre>
<p>but this is not working anyone have any ideas?
output: it generetes 31 this time and shows p1_p1 as this = ['\t']</p>
<p>problem solved</p>
<p>but bcs of bad txt file it does this ['Charmander \t39\t52\tFire\tWater\n'] how to erase these tabs without messing with file itself</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/linecache.html#linecache.getline" rel="nofollow"><code>linecache.getline</code></a>. It does exactly what you want; getting line <code>lineno</code> from a file.</p>
<pre><code>import linecache
from random import randint

pokemon_selection = randint(1, 40)
pokemon = linecache.getline("pokedex.txt", pokemon_selection)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">you probably want <code>readlines()</code> rather than <code>readline()</code>. You should show us what your code does/outputs at the moment so we have more info. Saying "it doesn't work" isn't useful as we need to know in what way it doesn't work.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">yeah u re right let me change edit: done</span>
<span class="comment-copy">well i want to add them to list and changed your code to this p1_p1.linecache.getline("pokedex.txt", pokemon_selection) and it says AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'linecache'</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@CiocomoTrombetta, Then, <code>p1_p1.append(pokemon)</code> `</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@CiocomoTrombetta, BTW, instead of updating question more, please post another question if possible.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@CiocomoTrombetta, <code>str.strip</code> remove leading, trailing spaces (including space, tabs, vertical tabs, newline). but not in the middle.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@CiocomoTrombetta, What you want is <code>str.split</code>: <code>p1_p1.append(linecache.getline("pokedex.txt", pokemon_selection).split())</code></span>
