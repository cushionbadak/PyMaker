<p>Python isn't showing output when runned the above code, while expected "truth". Any help?</p>

<p><code>open</code> returns a file object, not a string. You can read the contents of the file using the <code>read()</code> method, something like this:</p>
<pre><code>with open("names.txt", "r") as fin:
    users = fin.read()

if "Smith" in users:
    print("truth")
else:
    print("false")
</code></pre>
<p><em>Edit:</em></p>
<p>If nothing is happening when you run your program, and if the code you posted is your whole source file, then you are not running the method you have defined.</p>
<p>A <code>def</code> inside a <code>class</code> block will define a method belonging to that class. You don't actually seem to be using the class though. If you just want to define the <code>login()</code> function and run it, you can do that like this:</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/python

def login(): # &lt;-- this only defines the function
    with open("names.txt", "r") as fin:
        users = fin.read()
    if "Smith" in users:
        print("truth")
    else:
        print("false")

login() # &lt;-- this actually runs the function you have defined
</code></pre>

<p>You should use a context manager to open your files, you also cannot just use <code>in user.read()</code> as you will get False positives matching a substring like <code>foo in foobar</code>. </p>
<p>You can use a regex with a word boundary for an exact match with <code>any</code>  evaluating line by line lazily iterating over the file object getting a line at a time without reading the whole file at once:</p>
<pre><code>import re
r = re.compile(r"\bSmith\b")
with open("names.txt", "r") as user:
      if any(r.search(line) in line for line in users):
         print("truth")
      else:
         print("false") 
</code></pre>
<p>If each line is a name by itself you could rstrip and compare each line:</p>
<pre><code>with open("names.txt", "r") as user:
      name = "Smith"
      if any(line.rstrip() == name in line for line in users):
         print("truth")
      else:
         print("false") 
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Are you actually running the method, or only defining it?</span>
