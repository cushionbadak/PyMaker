<p>You get a <code>ValueError</code> when you attempt to find the index of a non-existent item in a list. There are two ways to deal with that.You could put <code>Emails1.index(Email)</code> inside a<br/>
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#handling-exceptions" rel="nofollow"><code>try:</code> <code>except ValueError:</code></a>, block but it's simpler to just test if <code>Email</code> is in <code>Emails1</code>. </p>
<p>Here's an improved version of your code that <em>should</em> do what you want. Note that I open the CSV file with <code>'rb'</code> mode, as recommended in <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/csv.html" rel="nofollow">the docs</a>, although this isn't strictly necessary in Python 3.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Your code is rather inefficient. Why do you throw away all the data from the csv file and re-read it all again if the password is wrong? I <i>guess</i> you want to give the user 3 chances to supply a correct email address and corresponding password. If so, you should say that in your question.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The short answer is that you are trying to get the index of an item from the list that doesn't exist. There are no checks in place to ensure that the email that's entered is valid, so when it tries to set Emaildex, it will fail since it doesn't find that value in the list.</span>
