<p>I am trying to get a laughing track to play whenever you die in my text adventure game, I am using Python but since I have no clue how to use Tkinter on Python. I never used TKinter so I need some help. If you are wondering where the file is, It is in a folder I named <strong>Sound Files</strong>.</p>

<p>Use winsound - it's built in.
</p>
<pre><code>import winsound

winsound.PlaySound('laugh.wav', winsound.SND_FILENAME)
</code></pre>

<p>I will wager a guess and say there is not built-in facility for playing audio. I would suggest reviewing older answers to similar question: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/260738/play-audio-with-python">Play audio with Python</a></p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>
<p>I see I was wrong. Python 3 appears to have some facilities: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/mm.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">22. Multimedia Services â€” Python 3.5.1 documentation</a></p>

<span class="comment-copy">The <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/tkinter.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">TKinter help page has a HelloWorld</a>, did you try it?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Search web or pypi.python.org for something like 'python play sound'.  The sound functions in pygame are one possibility.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I believe you were right the first time.  The 'audio' modules read and write sound files in various formats, but do not play them through a speaker (unless writing to a sound device works).</span>
