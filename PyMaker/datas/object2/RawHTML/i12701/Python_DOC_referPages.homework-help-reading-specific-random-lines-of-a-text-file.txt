<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have a text file listing names and addresses that looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>Owners Details

Muammmar Gaddafi,
1 Alison Drive

Idi Amin,
45 Kings Road

Vladimir Lenin,
3 Bow Street

Saddam Hussein,
45 Wall Street

Pol Pot,
78 Abbey Road
</code></pre>
<p>I want my program to be able to read and print a random line from the file, how do I do this?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The easiest solution is to read the whole file in (assuming that it is not gigantic) and to apply <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.choice" rel="nofollow"><code>random.choice()</code></a>.</p>
<pre><code>import random

with open('testfile.txt') as f:
    lines = f.readlines()
    print(random.choice(lines))  # prints a random line from testfile.txt
</code></pre>
