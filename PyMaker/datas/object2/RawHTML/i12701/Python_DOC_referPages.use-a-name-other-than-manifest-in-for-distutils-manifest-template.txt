<p>In the Python <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/distutils/sourcedist.html#specifying-the-files-to-distribute" rel="nofollow">documentation for distribution</a>, it is stated that the manifest template is named <code>MANIFEST.in</code> by <em>default</em>. It then doesn't appear to state anything about how to change that default.</p>
<p>For the sake of a mixed language project, I'd like to name <code>MANIFEST.in</code> something more like <code>PYTHON-MANIFEST.in</code> or some such to avoid the mental load on developers who need to know what belongs to what language (and we cannot just put the Python subproject into a subdirectory as it needs access to umbrella project items at root).</p>
<p>Is this possible? If so, how?</p>

<p>The command-line help for the Distutils <code>sdist</code> command has the answer:</p>
<pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"><code>$ python3 ./setup.py sdist --help
[…]
Options for 'sdist' command:
  --template (-t)        name of manifest template file [default: MANIFEST.in]
[…]
</code></pre>
<p>So you can name your “<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/distutils/sourcedist.html#manifest" rel="nofollow">manifest template</a>” file any name you like, and then <strong>specify the template filename with the <code>template</code> option</strong> for <code>sdist</code>.</p>
<p>I could not find the answer in the Distutils documentation, which really needs some dedicated improvement and maintenance.</p>

<p>The above answer gave me a place to look and find a way to do this programmatically.</p>
<p>When using <code>setuptools</code> it's possible to simply reassign the variable that's used to find the manifest template:</p>
<pre class="lang-python prettyprint-override"><code>setuptools.command.egg_info.manifest_maker.template = 'your-manifest-template-here.in'
</code></pre>
<p>I imagine that a similar thing would be possible with pure <code>distutils</code> by deriving from <code>distutils.command.sdist.sdist</code> and changing what <code>self.template</code> is assigned to in an overridden <code>finalize_options</code> (and further, of course, assigning this as your custom <code>sdist</code> command).</p>
