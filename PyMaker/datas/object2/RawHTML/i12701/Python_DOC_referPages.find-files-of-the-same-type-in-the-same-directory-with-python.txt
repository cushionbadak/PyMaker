<p>Is there a way to find all the files of a particular file type that is specified and recursively call them to be read until you have read all of the files? (This is in Ubuntu)</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>In directory <code>/home</code> you have files <code>a.png</code>, <code>b.txt</code>, <code>c.txt</code>, <code>d.txt</code>, <code>e.jpeg</code>
and I would like to read all the file that are <code>txt</code>.</p>
<p>How would one do so in Python?</p>
<p>Sub Question: Is it possible to do what was mentioned above with two different file types?</p>

<p>You could use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/glob.html#glob.glob" rel="nofollow"><code>glob.glob()</code></a> to do this:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from glob import glob

&gt;&gt;&gt; glob('/home/*.txt')
['/home/c.txt', '/home/d.txt', '/home/b.txt']

&gt;&gt;&gt; [glob(i) for i in ['/home/*.txt', '/home/*.jpeg']]
[['/home/c.txt', '/home/d.txt', '/home/b.txt'], ['/home/e.jpeg']]
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Assuming you're using the extension of the file to guess the type, you could use <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/os.html#os.listdir" rel="nofollow">os.listdir</a> and filter the files based on the filename:</p>
<pre><code>import os

for filename in os.listdir('.'):
    if filename.endswith('.txt'):
        # Do what you want to do
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">I really doubt you're going to be using all of those languages for this, so it sounds like this question is a lot too broad.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@NathanTuggy: Nah, since OP said he only wants use Python, so I removed these tags.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sounds like <code>os.walk</code> would work for you. Write some code and see how it goes.</span>
