<p>I am currently working through Learn Python the Hard Way, exercise 15. The script I am trying to run is:</p>
<pre><code>from sys import argv

script, filename = argv

txt = open(filename)

print("Here's your file %r:" %(filename)
print txt.read()

print("Type the filename again:")
file_again = raw_input(&gt; ")

text_again = open(file_again)

print txt_again.read()
</code></pre>
<p>When I run the script I get the error: 'Invalid Syntax', and it points to the "print txt.read" portion of the code (line 5).</p>
<p>As stated, I am using python 3, and I know this book is written for Python 2. So my question is: what is the Python 3 equivalent of "print txt.read"?</p>
<p>Many thanks</p>

<p>In addition to <code>print</code> needing to be a function (i.e. <code>print()</code>), your example is missing a starting quote on the line for raw_input.  It should be:</p>
<pre><code>file_again = raw_input("&gt; ")
</code></pre>
<p>And, you're missing a closing parentheses on one of the <code>print</code> lines.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I've started, so I'll finish.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Your choice, but a lot of us here strongly recommend against it, especially if you're only at Ex 15. Do what you want, though.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Allow me to elaborate, I realise my first response may have been rather blunt.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I am finding this book very good. It is forcing me to really use my brain to solve the problems...and because I on python 3 and the book is on python 2, it is forcing me to learn both versions at once. Yes the tone of the book is very blunt. But I'm a no nonsense kind of guy and can deal with....in my humble opinion people are being too sensitive, they should just get on with it. But thats just my personal opinion. Like you said, each to their own.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>raw_input</code> is no longer a function in Python 3.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ Inkblot - raw_input works just fine in python 3</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ Brian - Thank you sir! The problem was not with "print txt.read", it was with "print("Here's your file %r:" %(filename)".......as you said, I missed off a closing parenthesis. Once I resolved that it worked.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Also my other mistake was: "text_again = open(file_again)" and "print txt_again.read()".......using 'text' and 'txt'</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user5185132 In python 3, <code>raw_input</code> gives you <code>NameError: name 'raw_input' is not defined</code>. Python 3 dumped the old python 2 <code>input</code> and renamed <code>raw_input</code> to <code>input</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Unfprtunately that is not working for me either...I get the following message:</span>
<span class="comment-copy">File "ex15.py", line 8      print(txt.read())          ^  SyntaxError: invalid syntax</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user5185132 that because you are missing a <code>)</code> in the line above this line</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user5185132 <code>print("Here's your file %r:" %(filename))</code> also change raw_input to input</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@SnakeInTheGrass The SyntaxError is raised at the point python gets confused. Open parens can cross new line boundaries so it wasn't until later that python realized there was a problem.</span>
