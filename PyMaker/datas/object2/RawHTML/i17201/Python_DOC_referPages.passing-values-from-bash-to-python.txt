<p>I am trying to implement bash with python can anybody help me or teach me on what should be done.
my code is</p>
<pre><code>import io

val=os.system("echo 'sdfsfs'") #for example

print(val)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The return value from <code>os.system</code> is an exit code of some kind (the exact details are platform-dependent), not the text the command it ran wrote to its to standard output stream.</p>
<p>To get that text, you need to use a different Python command to run the program. There are a few different options, and which is best depends on more details than you've given. I'd start with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the <code>subprocess</code> module documentation</a>, and pick the function that works best for what you need. The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.check_output" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>check_output</code> function</a> seems like a good first candidate.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You mean you're trying to write a shell, or that you're trying to run bash commands via Python and capture results? It's very unclear what you're actually trying to do/achieve here... could you clarify?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I just want to test if python can accept bash results.A simple sample will do.</span>
