<p>I am a python newbie and have a question. Why can a if allow a brackets and not for. </p>
<ol>
<li><p><code>if (1==2):</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>for (i in range(1,10)):</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>while (i&lt;10):</code></p></li>
</ol>
<p>First one and third one are valid syntax but not second one.</p>
<pre><code>File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 2
    for (i in range(1,10)):
                          ^
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Because <code>for (i in range(1,10))</code> isn't syntactically correct.</p>
<p>Lets assume <code>(i in range(1,10))</code> was parsed anyway, it would return a boolean. So then you're trying to say <code>for True</code> or <code>for False</code>, and booleans can't be iterated, and it's invalid syntax.</p>
<hr/>
<p>The reason why your other examples work is because they expect a boolean, which is what is returned from <code>1 == 2</code> and <code>i &lt; 10</code></p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>if</code> expects a value (<code>True</code> of <code>False</code>). You can put parenthesis around any values: <code>(1) + (1)</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>for VAR in LIST</code> is a fixed syntax which does not expect a value single value, but rather <strong>two</strong> inputs:</p>
<ul>
<li>a variable name</li>
<li>what you will iterate over</li>
</ul>
<p>So why would the Python language allow extra parenthesis there?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>As someone had pointed on a now deleted answer (why?), this is the syntax for the <code>for</code> statement: <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-for-statement" rel="nofollow">http://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-for-statement</a> :</p>
<pre><code>for_stmt ::=  "for" target_list "in" expression_list ":" suite
              ["else" ":" suite]
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">I think he wants to know <i>why</i> the second statement isn't valid.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You could do <code>for i in (range(1, 10)):</code> but it's better not to use unnecessary parens in statements like this.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>(And even then, i isn't yet defined)</code>...That was just an example I guess. He can define it anywhere above.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@VamsiKrishna Hence the "and even then" ;)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The answer is correct, but that statement seems irrelevant. So I thought of mentioning. ;)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">yes it was a example but what do you mean by even this, i is not defined</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The (i in range(1,10)) is parsed first and returns a boolean.... How it is parsed when it is not a valid syntax?</span>
