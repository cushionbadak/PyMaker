<p>I was wondering if it was possible to make python disregard the first 4 lines of my text file. Like if I had a text file which looked like this:</p>
<pre><code>aaa
aaa
aaa
aaa
123412
1232134
</code></pre>
<p>Can I make it so python starts working from the numbers?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Use <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#next" rel="nofollow"><code>next</code></a> and a loop:</p>
<pre><code>with open("/path/to/myfile.txt") as myfile:
    for _ in range(4):  # Use xrange here if you are on Python 2.x
        next(myfile)
    for line in myfile:
        print(line)  # Just to demonstrate
</code></pre>
<p>Because <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-file-object" rel="nofollow">file objects</a> are iterators in Python, a line will be skipped each time you do <code>next(myfile)</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This should do the trick</p>
<pre><code>f = open('file.txt')
for index,line in enumerate(f):
    if index&gt;3:
      print(line)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>assuming you know the number of lines to discard, you can use this method:</p>
<pre><code>    for i, line in enumerate(open('myfile')):
        if i &lt; number_of_lines_to_discard:
            continue
        # do your stuff here
</code></pre>
<p>or if you just want to disregard non numeric lines:</p>
<pre><code>    for line in open('myfile'):
        if not re.match('^[0-9]+$\n', line):
             continue
        # do your stuff here
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>A more robust solution, not relying on the exact number of lines:</p>
<pre><code>with open(filename) as f:
    for line in f:
        try:
            line = int(line)
        except ValueError:
            continue
        # process line
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Sure -- Is it always 4 lines?  Is it only the non-number lines?  What is the criteria for dropping the first 4?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I only have one file which begins with 4 lines of useless information. I would like to make python completely disregard these lines</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That doesn't answer the question.  The question is <i>how does the program know the lines are useless</i>?  It it useless because it isn't a number?  Is it useless because it is literally <code>aaa</code>?  if it's only 1 file in a bunch, rather than modifying your python, maybe it's better to fix the file:  <code>tail +4 file &gt; file_new</code> IIRC.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes it is useless because it isn't a number</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you want you can check if it is a number or not.
