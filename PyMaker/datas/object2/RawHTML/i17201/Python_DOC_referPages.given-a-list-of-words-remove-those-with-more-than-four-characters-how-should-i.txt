<p>What I have below uses the idea of <strong><em>'List Comprehensions'</em></strong>. you can read more about it, here: <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions" rel="nofollow">http://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions</a></p>
<p>I suggest you to look over the code and read about list comprehension and try to understand what is going on.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Fix your code formatting, and read up on list comprehensions.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This sounds like a homework question.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Have you tried to write any code yourself? You should try that first and come back with specific questions about the problems you're having.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Welcome to StackOverflow! It looks like you want us to write some code for you. While many users are willing to produce code for a coder in distress, they usually only help when the poster has already tried to solve the problem on their own. A good way to demonstrate this effort is to include the code you've written so far, example input (if there is any), the expected output, and the output you actually get (console output, stack traces, compiler errors - whatever is applicable). The more detail you provide, the more answers you are likely to receive.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hint: you are thinking about it backwards. Don't <i>remove</i> words with more than four characters; <i>keep</i> words with four or fewer.</span>
