<p>the following code opens a file searches for a word or phrase, then opens the file in an array, it then adds two new objects after the word or phrase and then re-writes it to the file, the with statments do not work, when compiled it produces a syntax error saying the file = open(...) the '=' is not valid but it is the assignment operator. help?    </p>
<pre><code>def edit(file_name,search_parameters,added_data,second_data):

    with(file = open(file_name,'r')):
        lines = list(file)
        file.close()
    linenum = (num for (num,line) in enumerate(lines) if search_parameters in line).next()
    lines[linenum+1] = added_data
    lines[linenum+1] = second_data

    with (file2 = open(file_name,"w")):
        file2.writelines(line + '\n' for line in lines)
        file2.close()
</code></pre>

<p>You need to use the <code>as</code> keyword:</p>
<pre><code>with open(file_name,'r') as file:

with open(file_name,"w") as file2:
</code></pre>
<p>Here is a reference on <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-with-statement" rel="nofollow">Python's with statement</a>.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Also, these two lines are unncessary:</p>
<pre><code>file.close()

file2.close()
</code></pre>
<p>Using a with statement to open a file will cause it to be closed automatically when the with statement's code block is exited.  In fact, that is the only reason why you use a with statement to open files.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">In python, assignment is a statement, not an operator.  It does not return a value.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It is also noteworthy that OP does not need to explicitly close the file. Perhaps an explanation of the <code>with</code> statement is required.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@AlexThornton - Good idea, I missed that.  Let me mention it.</span>
