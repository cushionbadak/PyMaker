<p>I am new to Python and I have become stuck with printing the elements of an array separated by a delimiter. My array consists of 60 000 odd rows with 26 elements per row, some of the elements only contain numbers, while others contain an assortment of characters including special characters.
Example:</p>
<pre><code>a[0] = [abc,123,a1b2c3,*wewqe,...] 
a[1] = [098i,qwerty,123qwe,xx-u,...]
</code></pre>
<p>I would like the output to be(without a "|" after the last element and each row on their own line:</p>
<pre><code>abc|123|a1b2c3|*wewqe,...
098i|qwerty|123qwe|xx-u,...
</code></pre>
<p>I have tried the following, but they do not work:</p>
<pre><code>for row in results :
    length = len(row)
    print("")#throw in a new line
    print ("Number of elements: " + str(length))
    print '|'.join((str(row)))
</code></pre>
<p>And this:</p>
<pre><code>for row in results :
    length = len(row)
    print("")#throw in a new line
    print ("Number of elements: " + str(length))
    for item in row:
            print '|'.join(str(item))
</code></pre>
<p>And this:</p>
<pre><code> for row in results :
    length = len(row)
    print("")#throw in a new line
    print ("Number of elements: " + str(length))
    for item in row:
    print item,
</code></pre>
<p>All of the above produces results, but not the results I would like. Thank you in advance.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>print '|'.join(map(str, row))
</code></pre>
<p><code>join</code> takes a sequence of strings. <code>row</code> is a sequence of... something, so <code>map(str, row)</code> turns it into a sequence of strings. If the elements of <code>row</code> are already strings (and they should be), you can just do</p>
<pre><code>print '|'.join(row)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I assume your arrays contain strings. You might want to edit your post accordingly.
You can do: </p>
<pre><code>a = [ 'abc','123','a1b2c3','*wewqe' ]
output = '|'.join(a)
print output
</code></pre>
<p>output: </p>
<pre><code>abc|123|a1b2c3|*wewqe
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; ",".join(["a", "b", "c"])
'a,b,c'
</pre>
<p>This will help you to join array</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Hi Greg, are you sure your elements are not strings? if not, what is wewqe in your first array?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks!! Works like a Charm, I was trying <code>print '|'.join((str(row)))</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">This works nicely for me as I wanted a csv like formatting with a comma separator.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@DavidJung: If you want CSV, you should probably check out the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">csv module</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user2357112 Great. Seems even the previous version of Python has the module (Iâ€™m using 3.5.5). Thank you.</span>
