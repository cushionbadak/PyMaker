<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Is it possible to use a Python loop not to print a list of values but rather to create a list of values to use in another loop? For example, let's say I want to run a loop of code through multiple time frames, with shifting date ranges. Until now, I have entered manually or copied and pasted my sets of dates in a dictionary for the loop. But can I create a function that where I give a start date for the first time frame and then tell it to create the values for an additional 7 or 27 time frames, shifting by 3 months each time? Furthermore, my main code may require not one date variable, but a set of variables, each needing to be produced for the appropriate number of loops.</p>
<p>Thank you for any assistance.</p>

<p>Suppose you have</p>
<pre><code>for i in something:
    result = f(i)
    print result
</code></pre>
<p>You can make a list of those things, by switching the print to an list.append</p>
<pre><code>results = []
for i in something:
    result = f(i)
    results.append(result)
</code></pre>
<p>In simple cases like this, you can do it in one line with a list comprehension</p>
<pre><code>results = [f(i) for i in something]
</code></pre>
<p>The rest of your question needs you to show your current code to get a useful answer</p>

<p>One possibility is to do it with list comprehension:</p>
<pre><code>totalValues = 10

# Initial value and generation of the other ones
start = datetime.datetime.now()
dates = [datetime.timedelta(90 * i) + start for i in range(totalValues)]
# Another variable as example
salary = [1000 + i * 0.02 for i in range(totalValues)]

# And you can use both in another *loop*:
savings = [salary[i] * (dates[i] - start).days/90 for i in range(len(salary))]
</code></pre>
<p>The other possibility is to do it with a normal loop:</p>
<pre><code>totalValues = 10

# Initial value
start = datetime.datetime.now()
dates = []
salary = []

for i in range(totalValues):
    dates.append(datetime.timedelta(90 * i) + start)
    salary.append(1000 + i * 0.02)

savings = []
# And you can use both in another *loop*:
for i in range(totalValues):
    savings.append(salary[i] * (dates[i] - start).days/90)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">The reason you're getting downvoted is this question is vague. Please give example code or better yet boil your question down to something very simple.
