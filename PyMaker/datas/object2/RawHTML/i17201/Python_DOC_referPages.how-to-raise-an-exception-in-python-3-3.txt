<p>I am currently reading tutorials in tutorialspoint's python tutorials. But it's the tutorial of Python 2 not Python 3.3 which I have right now. Well, I managed to search in the internet and found out about some changes. But this one is pretty tough.</p>
<p>So, in tutorialspoint the python source code for raising an exception is:</p>
<pre><code>def functionName( level ):
if level &lt; 1:
   raise "Invalid level!", level
  # The code below to this would not be executed
  # if we raise the exception
</code></pre>
<p>But if I type   </p>
<pre><code>raise "Invalid level!", level  
</code></pre>
<p>it says syntax error. 
So, I want to know how I raise an exception in Python 3.3. </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The syntax is:</p>
<pre><code>raise Exception("Invalid level! " + level)
</code></pre>
<p>I would really recommend you to read the <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions" rel="nofollow">Python docs.</a></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You need to create an Exception object:</p>
<pre><code> raise Exception('spam', 'eggs')
</code></pre>
<p>See the docs here:
