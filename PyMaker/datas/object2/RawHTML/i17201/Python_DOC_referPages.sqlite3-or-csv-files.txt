<p>First of all, I'm a total noob at this. I've been working on setting up a small GUI app to play with database, mostly microsoft Excel files with large numbers of rows. I want to be able to display a portion of it, I wanna be able to choose the columns I'm working with trought the menu so I can perform different task very efficiently. </p>
<p>I've been looking into the .CSV files. I can create some sort of list or dictionnarie with it (Not sure) or I could just import the excel table into a database then do w/e I need to with my GUI. Now my question is, for this type of task i just described, wich of the 2 methods would be best suited ? (Feel free to tell me if there is a better one) </p>

<p>It will depend upon the requirements of you application and how you plan to extend or maintain it in the future. </p>
<p>A few points in favour of sqlite:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>standardized interface</em>, SQL - with CSV you would create some custom logic to select columns or filter rows</li>
<li><em>performance on bigger data sets</em> - it might be difficult to load 10M rows of CSV into memory, whereas handling 10M rows in sqlite won't be a problem</li>
<li><a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html" rel="nofollow">sqlite3</a> is in the python standard library (but then, <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html" rel="nofollow">CSV</a> is too)</li>
</ul>
<p>That said, also take a look at <a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/" rel="nofollow">pandas</a>, which makes working with tabular data that fits in memory a breeze. Plus pandas will happily import data directly from Excel and other sources: <a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/io.html" rel="nofollow">http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/io.html</a></p>

<span class="comment-copy">Let me add that you can use pandas in conjunction with <a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/io.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">many IO readers/writers</a> to read directly from Excel and write to SQL, CSV or HDF5 if you please :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Good point, added your link to the answer.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, that will help !</span>
