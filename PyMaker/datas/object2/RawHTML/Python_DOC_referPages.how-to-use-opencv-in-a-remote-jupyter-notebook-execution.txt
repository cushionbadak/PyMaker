<p>In my local machine with macOS Mojave, I installed a virtual environment with Python 3.6, opencv package and some additional unrelated packages. </p>
<p>I started a very simple Jupyter Notebook that is executed with no problem, here it's the code: </p>
<pre><code>import cv2
print(cv2.__version__)
my_img = cv2.imread("colibri_763_460.jpeg",1)
cv2.imshow("Original", my_img)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
</code></pre>
<p>Now, I'm trying to execute the same code in a Jupyter Notebook in my remote Ubuntu machine but I can't make it work. These are the steps that I took: </p>
<ul>
<li>I copied the image file and the Notebook ypnb file to the remote ubuntu machine.</li>
<li>I opened an ssh session, selected a virtualenv with the same packages than my local machine and executed the "jupyter notebook"</li>
<li>I opened another terminal with ssh -L 8000:localhost:8888 mpastorg@mpgubu18 for the ssh tunneling</li>
<li>I opened my local browser in the localhost:8000 to execute the Notebooks that I have in my remote Ubuntu machine, it works with any Notebook not involving opencv. </li>
</ul>
<p>I tried to solve my problem using two different ways: </p>
<ul>
<li>Installing in the ubuntu remote machine the package opencv-contrib-python-headless: when I try to use <em>cv2.imshow</em>, I got the error method not found</li>
<li>Installing in the ubuntu remote machine the package opencv-contrib-python: I got the error that kernel is dead. </li>
</ul>
<p>Does anyone know if there's any way to execute the remote jupyter notebook and see the picture locally? it maybe would be possible a workaround to embed the picture in the browser window?</p>
<p>Thank you very much

<p>I wonder if the image is being rendered using X - which you have not explicitly enabled, in both your host machine, nor in your ssh tunnel.</p>
<p>On the Host machine. (Where you want to see the Image).
Enter this comment</p>
<pre><code>xhost+
</code></pre>
<p>This now allows remote X-Hosts to send you data. As you are on a Mac - you will need to have the <strong>XQuartz</strong> package installed.</p>
<p>Now modify your ssh command. - so that you allow X - this is typically done using a -X flag (Or it can be placed in your .ssh/config file like this</p>
<pre><code>Host *
  ForwardX11 yes
  ForwardX11Trusted no
  XAuthLocation /opt/X11/bin/xauth
  ForwardAgent yes
  Compression yes
  KeepAlive yes
  Compression yes
</code></pre>
<p>If you are not using a config try the -X to start with.</p>
<p>Hope that helps</p>
