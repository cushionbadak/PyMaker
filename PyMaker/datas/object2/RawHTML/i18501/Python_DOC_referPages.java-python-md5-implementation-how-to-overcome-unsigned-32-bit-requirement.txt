<p>I'm attempting to implement MD5 (for curiosity's sake) in Python/Java, and am effectively translating the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5" rel="nofollow">wikipedia MD5</a> page's pseudocode into either language. First, I used Java, only to encounter frustration with its negative/positive integer overflow (because unsigned ints aren't an option, <code>for-all integer,-2147483648 &lt;= integer &lt;= 2147483647</code>). I then employed Python, after deciding that it's better suited for heavy numerical computation, but realized that I wouldn't be able to overcome the unsigned 32-bit integer requirement, either (as Python immediately casts wrapped <code>int</code>s to <code>long</code>s). </p>
<p>Is there any way to hack around Java/Python's lack of <code>unsigned 32-bit integer</code>s, which are required by the aforementioned MD5 pseudocode? </p>

<p>As a note beforehand - I don't know if this is a <em>good</em> solution, but it appears to give the behaviour you want.</p>
<p>Using <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html" rel="nofollow">the <code>ctypes</code> module</a>, you can access the underlying low-level data-type directly, and hence have an unsigned int in Python.</p>
<p>Specifically, <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html#ctypes.c_uint" rel="nofollow"><code>ctypes.c_uint</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; i = ctypes.c_uint(0)
&gt;&gt;&gt; i.value -= 1
&gt;&gt;&gt; i                                                            
c_uint(4294967295)
&gt;&gt;&gt; i.value += 1
&gt;&gt;&gt; i
c_uint(0)
</code></pre>
<p>This is arguably abuse of the module - it's designed for using C code easily from within Python, but as I say, it appears to work. The only real downside I can think of is that I assume <code>ctypes</code> is CPython specific.</p>

<p>Since all the operations are bitwise operations, they wouldn't suffer from sign extension (which would cause you problems), except for right shift.</p>
<p>Java has a <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-15.html#jls-15.19" rel="nofollow"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code></a> operator for this purpose.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">+1.  People overestimate the difference between signed and unsigned arithmetic, and most operations will come out with the same result.</span>
