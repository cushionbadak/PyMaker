<p>I am building a solution with various classes and functions all of which need access to some global consants to be able to work appropriately. As there is no <code>const</code> in python, what would you consider best practice to set a kind of global consants.</p>
<pre><code>global const g = 9.8 
</code></pre>
<p>So I am looking for a kind of the above</p>
<p>edit: How about:</p>
<pre><code>class Const():
    @staticmethod
    def gravity():
        return 9.8

print 'gravity: ', Const.gravity()
</code></pre>
<p>?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You cannot define constants in Python. If you find some sort of hack to do it, you would just confuse everyone.</p>
<p>To do that sort of thing, usually you should just have a module - <code>globals.py</code> for example that you import everywhere that you need it</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>General convention is to define variables with capital and underscores and not change it. Like,</p>
<pre><code>GRAVITY = 9.8
</code></pre>
<p>However, it is possible to create constants in Python using <code>namedtuple</code></p>
<pre><code>import collections

Const = collections.namedtuple('Const', 'gravity pi')
const = Const(9.8, 3.14)

print(const.gravity) # =&gt; 9.8
# try to change, it gives error
const.gravity = 9.0 # =&gt; AttributeError: can't set attribute
</code></pre>
<p>For <code>namedtuple</code>, refer to docs <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.namedtuple" rel="noreferrer">here</a></p>

<span class="comment-copy">Doesn't work. Anyone can change <code>Const.gravity</code> or just replace the <code>Const</code> class entirely. The lack of anything like <code>const</code> is a deliberate design decision; Python makes it very difficult to enforce that code won't touch something it shouldn't. Instead, if you're not supposed to touch something, standard practice is to just not touch it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I suspected "As there is no const in python" :/</span>
<span class="comment-copy">how do you name your consts? all caps? or something like c_gravitation?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">PEP 8 says <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#constants" rel="nofollow noreferrer">all caps with underscores</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">please see my edit to the question</span>
