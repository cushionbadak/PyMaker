<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I know the question sounds it a bit weird, I can't think of a way to explain it.</p>
<p>Basically, I need to round numbers without cutting off extra zeros and such. For example, my current <code>format(round(whatever, 3))</code> will round something like <code>1.00000024</code> to <code>1.0</code>, when I want it to round to <code>1.000</code>. I know the practicality of this is stupid, but I need to do this so as to not confuse people when the numbers they get aren't the same length.</p>
<p>Help, please?</p>

<p>The number of digits displayed after the decimal point isn't a property of the <code>float</code> representing the number - it's a property of how you display it. The <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#format" rel="nofollow"><code>format</code></a> built-in or the <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.format" rel="nofollow">string <code>format</code> method</a> can use a <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#formatstrings" rel="nofollow">format spec</a> to control how numbers are displayed:</p>
<pre><code>print('{:.3f}'.format(1.0))  # prints 1.000
</code></pre>
<p>See the links for how to use format specs - there are a lot of options, and they can get kind of confusing.</p>
