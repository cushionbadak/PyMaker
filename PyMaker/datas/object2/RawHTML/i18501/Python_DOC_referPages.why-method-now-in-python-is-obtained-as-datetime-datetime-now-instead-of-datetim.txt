<p>I would like to know why the method <strong>now</strong> was implemented under the datetime.datetime label instead of the datetime.time? </p>
<p>For example to obtain today's date on python you do the following.</p>
<pre><code>import datetime
print datetime.date.today()
</code></pre>
<p>but you can't the same for the time now, I mean</p>
<pre><code>print datetime.time.now()
</code></pre>
<p>Instead you have to do the following:</p>
<pre><code>print datetime.datetime.now()
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>"Now" is a point in time. That means date matters; if it's noon now, yesterday noon is not also now. (Time of day also matters; 9 AM today is also not now.) Thus, it makes sense to have a <code>datetime.datetime.now</code>, but not a <code>datetime.time.now</code>. It could make sense to have a <code>datetime.time.currentlocaltime</code> or <code>datetime.time.currentutctime</code>, but those methods don't exist. You could put in a feature request if you want.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Good answer. <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/datetime.html#available-types" rel="nofollow noreferrer">The docs</a> explicitly say that <code>datetime.time</code> is "An idealized time, independent of any particular day", and "now" is obviously not independent of any particular day…</span>
<span class="comment-copy">One little quibble: Unlike <code>datetime.datetime</code>, <code>datetime.time</code> is implicitly a local or tz-aware time of day; a current UTC <code>time</code> only makes sense for a (naive or aware) local time where the local timezone is UTC. From <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#time-objects" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the docs</a>: "A time object represents a (local) time of day… subject to adjustment via a <code>tzinfo</code> object."</span>
<span class="comment-copy">+1 Nice explanation.</span>
