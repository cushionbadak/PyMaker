<p>I'm having some troubles when it comes to multiplying two matrices. An <em>AttributeError</em> appears when I'm trying to perform the addition part</p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "MatrixClass.py", line 189, in &lt;module&gt;
    main()
  File "MatrixClass.py", line 184, in main
    mat.multiplyMatrixes(mat1,mat2)
  File "MatrixClass.py", line 176, in multiplyMatrixes
    self[i][j] += (m1[i][k])*(m2[k][j]) 
AttributeError: matrix instance has no attribute '__getitem__' 
</code></pre>
<p>I tried saving the new matrix in another instance called for example m3 but the I thought it would be better to use <em>self</em> instead.</p>
<p>Here's my code:</p>
<pre><code>def multiplyMatrices(self,m1,m2):
    if m1.getRows() == m2.getColumns() and m1.getColumns() == m2.getRows():
        self.setRows()
        self.setColumns()
        for i in range(m1.getRows()):
            for j in range(m2.getColumns()):
                for k in range(m1.getColumns()):
                    self[i][j] += (m1[i][k])*(m2[k][j])
</code></pre>
<p>I created the instance of self in <em>main()</em>, before calling <em>multiplyMatrices()</em></p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>According to the <code>AttributeError</code>, you never defined the <code>__getitem__</code> method in your class. <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__getitem__" rel="nofollow">This</a> is how you can control object[key] access. I would suggest reading up on the python <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html" rel="nofollow">data model</a> in general if you are deciding to make a more advanced class (like this one) in python. Although it is a bit strange to have the multiplication of two <em>other</em> matrices being stored in self. I'd probably just create a new matrix in the method and return that.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Does your matrix class actually have a <code>__getitem__</code> method?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">How can I know that? I implemented getValue(file,column), getRows() &amp; getColumns()</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Well, you wrote it, didn't you? Did you write a <code>__getitem__</code> method? (If you did, is it still there when you look for it? And is the name right?)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is confusing. If you get this to work, the call <code>m0.multiplyMatrices(m1, m2)</code> is going to end up replacing the contents of <code>m0</code> with <code>m1 * m2</code> Why would you want that? Can you show us (a stripped-down version of) your class definition, and describe what the API is supposed to be?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Note that getter and setter functions (especially this usage) are unpythonic - prefer raw attributes or <code>@property</code>s</span>
