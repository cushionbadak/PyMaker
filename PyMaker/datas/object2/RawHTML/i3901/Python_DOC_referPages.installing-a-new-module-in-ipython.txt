<p>I'd like to install the pygame package through IPython but when I try the command suggested <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8663046/how-to-install-a-python-package-from-within-ipython">here</a>,</p>
<pre><code>!pip install pygame
</code></pre>
<p>I get the following error:</p>
<pre><code>'pip' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.
</code></pre>
<p>What should I do? If it helps, I'm on Windows 10 and Python 3.6.1. Thanks!</p>

<p>As the Python Packaging Authority docs on <a href="https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtualenv/#windows" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Installing packages using pip</a> explain, on Windows, you usually don't want to use <code>pip</code> directly. It may not be on your <code>PATH</code>, or it may be on your <code>PATH</code> but not match the same version as the <code>py.exe</code> launcher.</p>
<p>Usually, you want to use that <code>py.exe</code> launcher for everything:</p>
<pre><code>py -m pip install pygame
</code></pre>
<p>If you're not using <code>py.exe</code> for some reason, the answer is usually one of these:</p>
<pre><code>python -m pip install pygame
D:\path\to\specific\python -m pip install pygame
</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">The official docs</a> mention the <code>python</code> version first, and only mention <code>py</code> for when you're dealing with multiple Python versions. But you're probably better off always using <code>py</code>, as the PyPA suggests. See <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0397/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PEP 397</a> for why the launcher is useful.)</p>
<hr/>
<p>Of course if you want to do this from inside IPython instead of directly at the shell, prefix any of those with <code>!</code>.</p>
<hr/>
<p>As a side note: Notice that the same page pretty strongly recommends using <code>virtualenv</code> (or the builtin <code>venv</code>, but the documentation is all for <code>virtualenv</code>). You should consider doing so, but if you have a good reason not to, it's not mandatory or anything.</p>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>pip</code> is for Python 2.x. <code>pip3</code> is for Python 3.x. You have Python 3.6.1. Which command should you use?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">On Windows, <a href="https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtualenv/#windows" rel="nofollow noreferrer">as explained here</a> as well as in the official docs, it's usually recommended to use <code>py -m pip</code> (or <code>python -m pip</code> if you're not using the <code>py.exe</code> launcher, or <code>C:\path\to\specific\python -m pip</code>, etc.).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ForceBru That's usually not true on Windows. <code>pip</code> will either be accessible on the PATH as <code>pip</code>, or not at all, even for 3.x.</span>
