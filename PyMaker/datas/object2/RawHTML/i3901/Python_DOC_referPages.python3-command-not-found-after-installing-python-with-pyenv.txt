<p>I installed a specific version of python with pyenv. When typed <code>pyenv version</code> in terminal, i see <code>3.5.0 (set by /Users/lcherukuri/.python-version)</code>. But when I typed <code>python3</code>, I got <code>python3 command not found</code>. How to fix this? pip3 is Also not found</p>

<p><code>pyenv</code> is just a Python version manager. It may be able to see a Python 3.X installed even if <code>python3</code> isn't installed in your $PATH.</p>
<p>You need to add <code>python3</code> to your $PATH. You can see how to do that <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/using/mac.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<p>By default, MacOS uses <code>python3</code> to differentiate between the native pre-installed <code>python</code> (which is Python 2.7) and any post-installed Python 3.X distributions. The same goes for <code>pip</code> and <code>pip3</code>. </p>
<p>From the <code>pyenv</code> documentation on managing versions:</p>
<blockquote>
<h2>Locating the Python Installation</h2>
<p>Once pyenv has determined which
  version of Python your application has specified, it passes the
  command along to the corresponding Python installation.</p>
<p>Each Python version is installed into its own directory under $(pyenv
  root)/versions.</p>
<p>For example, you might have these versions installed:</p>
<p>$(pyenv root)/versions/2.7.8/ </p>
<p>$(pyenv root)/versions/3.4.2/ </p>
<p>$(pyenvroot)/versions/pypy-2.4.0/ </p>
<p>As far as pyenv is concerned, version names
  are simply the directories in $(pyenv root)/versions.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Is python part of your $PATH? What OS are you on?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">you need to define an alias for the new environment. Like: <a href="https://gist.github.com/haridas/4966347" rel="nofollow noreferrer">gist.github.com/haridas/4966347</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">try 'python' without the 3. It may be that with specific environment python give you python3</span>
