<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have to do a coding task in school. I should list several numbers at random and complete the form of a turtle moving around on them. I would like to know how to list the numbers entered in the turtle window. Is it possible?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use <code>write</code></p>
<pre><code>import turtle


if __name__ == '__main__':

    number = 42

    t = turtle.Turtle()
    t.write(number)

    turtle.done()
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you want to enter text then you need <code>turtle.write()</code>:</p>
<pre><code>import random

a = [random.randint(0,10) for x in range(10)] # Generate 10 random numbers between 0 and 10

for i in a:
    turtle.forward(15)
    turtle.write(str(i))
</code></pre>
<p>You need to move the turtle otherwise all the numbers will appear on top of each other.</p>
