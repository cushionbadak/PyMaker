<p>Currently working through a free online class for Python from Cybrary (I'm coding in 3.6), but I use a Mac while the presenter uses Windows. So far, there have been very few differences if any.</p>
<p>The current section deals with learning and using Ctypes however, and the "assignment" says to <code>Write a function which takes two arguments, title and body and creates a MessageBox with those arguments</code>.</p>
<p>The code used in the video as an example of creating a Message Box:</p>
<pre><code>from ctypes import *

windll.user32.MessageBoxA(0, "Click Yes or No\n", "This is a title\n", 4)
</code></pre>
<hr/>
<p>My code:</p>
<pre><code># 2.1 Ctypes: Write a function which takes two arguments, title and body
#  and creates a MessageBox with those arguments
def python_message_box(title, body):
    return windll.user32.MessageBoxA(0, body, title, 0)
</code></pre>
<p>Running this gives the error:</p>
<pre><code>File ".../AdvancedActivities.py", line 9, in python_message_box
   return windll.user32.MessageBoxA(0, body, title, 0)
NameError: name 'windll' is not defined
</code></pre>
<p>I don't believe I need to say that I get the same error trying to run</p>
<pre><code>windll.user32.MessageBoxW(0, body, title, 0)
</code></pre>
<hr/>
<p>I haven't been able to find any examples anywhere of people creating Message Boxes on Mac computers. Is it a Windows-specific function? If so, what would be the Mac equivalent of this?</p>
<p>EDIT: Mark Setchell's solution is to have Python run terminal functions that accomplish <code>windll</code> tasks, so instead of <code>windll.user32.MessageBoxA(0, body, title, 0)</code>, use:</p>
<pre><code>command = "osascript -e 'Tell application \"System Events\" to
           display dialog \""+body+"\"'"
system(command)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you type this into a Terminal on any Mac, you'll get a dialog box:</p>
<pre><code>osascript -e 'Tell application "System Events" to display dialog "Some Funky Message" with title "Hello Matey"'
</code></pre>

<p>See <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/28749940/2836621">here</a> for further examples.</p>
<p>So, just use a Python subprocess call to run that... <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">subprocess documentation</a>, or use <code>system()</code>.</p>
<p>Nothing to install. No dependencies. You can also ask user for values, select files or directories and pick colours using the same technique. The dialog boxes are all native Mac ones - not some ugly imitation.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Calling <code>windll.user32.MessageBoxA()</code> is most definitely Windows-specific. There are ways of doing the equivalent on almost <i>any</i> system using the <code>tkinter</code> module.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I forgot to say, you can also do <code>.... display dialog "blah blah" with title "Put your title here"</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ok that's pretty cool. Currently though, I have to run <code>system("osascript -e 'Tell application \"System Events\" to display dialog \""+body+"\"'")</code> to get it to work. <code>subprocess</code> is being funky.</span>
