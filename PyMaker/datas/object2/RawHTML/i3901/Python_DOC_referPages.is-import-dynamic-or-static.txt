<p>In my main script, I import one of my own module which contains global variables. This main script execute another script with the function exec (<code>exec(compile(open(Seq_1, "rb").read(), Seq_1, 'exec'))</code> and this other script import the same module.
So my question is: does these scripts have access to the same global variables (that means if I modify one global variable, the other script will be impacted) or not?</p>

<p>In practice, python functions and variables directly on modules (not wrapped in classes) works like singletons.</p>
