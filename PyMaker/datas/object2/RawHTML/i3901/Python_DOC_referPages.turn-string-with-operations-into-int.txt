<p>I am trying to create a short program to do a task. Unfortunately I keep getting an error. The problem boils down to the following.</p>
<p>If I try to run:</p>
<pre><code>line = "1+1"
int(line)
</code></pre>
<p>I would like it to return</p>
<pre><code>2
</code></pre>
<p>However I get the following error:</p>
<pre><code>invalid literal for int() with base 10: '1+1'
</code></pre>
<p>From looking online this is due to the fact that Python cannot recognize the fact that I have used a non-number. However without some rework I can't get around this.</p>
<p>I was hoping that there is a straight forward method for solving this. I have tried using float but that has the same problem.</p>

<p>You can use the <code>eval</code> function.</p>
<pre><code>    eval("1 + 1")
</code></pre>

<p>You could use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html#ast.literal_eval" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>ast.literal_eval</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>import ast

line = "1+1"
print(ast.literal_eval(line))
# 2
</code></pre>
