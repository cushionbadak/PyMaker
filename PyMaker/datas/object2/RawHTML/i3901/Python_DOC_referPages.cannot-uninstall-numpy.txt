<p>I'm trying to use <code>pip</code> to uninstall <code>numpy</code>(I also installed <code>pandas</code>, but I seem to have been able to uninstall that). In the case of `numpy, I get the following output.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>I've got a Fedora 26 system running both Python 2.7.15 and Python 3.6.5</p>
<p>I'm very new to Python (just started learning it last night), so forgive the ignorance. I've seen several related questions (mostly dealing with pip installs rather than uninstalls. None of them seemed to solve the issue. I should also note that I've read in these other posts that running pip as sudo is a bad idea (something I did while trying to install pandas because I didn't have permissions (and again, I read later on that that is a bad idea). Any help here is appreciated.</p>

<p>Try to get PyCharm community as an ide. They have an easy way to install and uninstall packages. You have also view an manage all of the packages you currently have installed in your virtual environment. </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Try running it with root authorization</p>
<pre><code>    sudo pip3 uninstall numpy
</code></pre>
<p>It should work, most of the times.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I had a similar problem with numpy and I just had to remove the package using <code>apt</code> (In your case is <code>yum</code>).
Try to do:<br/>
<code>sudo yum remove python3-numpy</code></p>

<p>I assume you are using a command prompt to do that, you should try starting it as Admin.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Are you using a virtual environment? (for example: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html</a>). In general, that will help manage your packages install/uninstalls better. Specifically, it will also avoid running into permission issues - and also allows you to avoid using sudo. This comment doesn't address your problem specifically, but in most cases, using virtualenv helps you avoid problems like this.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No, but I do plan on using them in the future. I'm just following tutorials at the moment, so I didn't even know about them until I hit this problem. Not to mention, the guy running the tutorial is using Windoze, so things are slightly different.</span>
