<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Trying to write a program that prints the <em>n</em> most common items in a list depending on how many the user wants to see, and prints more if the last items have the same frequency.</p>
<p>This is what i have written:</p>
<pre><code>num = int(input("Enter Number"))
i = 0
wordsInList = [word1, word2, word2, word3, word1]
catagory = Counter(list)
catagory.keys()
for key, value in catagory.items(): #set the frequency to value and word to key
    if i &lt;= num or lastValue == value: #(Issue with code)If the required number of values have been printed, stop printing
        print('{:&lt;5d}{:&lt;15s}'.format(value, key)) 
        lastValue = value
        i =+ 1
</code></pre>
<p>The problem with this is that as soon as that print statement is run, it prints all lines of the <em>count()</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You could make use of the built-in function <code>most_common</code> for the <code>Counter</code> class (<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">reference</a>):</p>
<pre><code>num = int(input("Enter Number"))
list = [word1, word2, word2, word3, word1]
counts = Counter(list)

most_common = counts.most_common(num)

# additional requirement by OP 
# of having more results if last items have same frequency

most_common_values = [elt[1] for elt in most_common]

ret = []
for k, v in most_common.items(): # python 3.5+
    if v in most_common_values:
        ret.append((k,v))

print(ret)    
</code></pre>
