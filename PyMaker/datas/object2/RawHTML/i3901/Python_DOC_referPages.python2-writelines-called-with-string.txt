<p>When I use <code>f.writelines('aaa')</code> in both Python2 and Python3, the string <code>aaa</code> is written to the file, but what I expect is three separate lines of <code>a</code>.</p>
<p>Here is the document of <code>writelines</code>:</p>
<pre><code>writelines(sequence_of_strings) -&gt; None.  Write the strings to the file.

Note that newlines are not added.  The sequence can be any iterable object 
producing strings. This is equivalent to calling write() for each string.
</code></pre>
<p>Please note that it accepts any iterable and <code>str</code> <strong>is</strong> iterable, so why instead of writing a line for each item in the string, <code>writelines()</code> simply writes a single string? </p>
<p>Should I need to use <code>f.writelines(list('aaa'))</code> to get the desired result?</p>
<p>I wonder whether this is a deliberately consideration or simply a novel bug.</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>writelines(lines)
</code></pre>
<p>Write a list of lines to the stream. Line separators are not added, so
  it is usual for each of the lines provided to have a line separator at
  the end.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>with open('test.txt', 'w') as f:
    f.writelines(['a\n','a\n','a\n'])
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>a
a
a
</code></pre>
<p>Please note that the line separator <code>\n</code> is part of each string.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Your analysis and expectation assume that <code>writelines</code> calls <code>list(...)</code> on the string that is given, isn't it?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">While the question itself is not exactly a duplicate, you may find this answer interesting: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/12377575/1453822">stackoverflow.com/a/12377575/1453822</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy"><i>Note that newlines are not added.</i> Does that tell you anything?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@DeepSpace Yes.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@DeepSpace Oh I figure out. 3 <code>a</code> without newline is just <code>aaa</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What would be the output of <code>f.writelines('a\na\na')</code> ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@DeepSpace you probably knew the answer before you posted the comment, and so do/did I... the output will be the same, also it would be the same as <code>f.write('a\na\na')</code>. Or should I say 'similar' as your example does not have a <code>\n</code> (nor does my example in this comment) so technically the code in my answer has 1 more <code>\n</code> at the end.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why would you ever do that? If you had newlines in a string, you would just write the string using <code>f.write</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@SeanBreckenridge... you are correct by asking that, and to be honest I wouldn't, I am only answering the OP question, who did not include line separators, while the documentation clearly states that the <code>.writelines()</code> does not add them, hence this answer.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@SeanBreckenridge This whole question is hypothetical and so was my   bite</span>
