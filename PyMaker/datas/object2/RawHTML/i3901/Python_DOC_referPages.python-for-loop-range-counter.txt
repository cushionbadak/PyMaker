<p>I have made a program that prints the each date of year. Is it possible to add a counter that will allow to limit the printable dates? I would print for example every 7 days. Thanks for any advice. 
The original code below.</p>
<pre><code>def main():

    for month in range(1, 13):
        daymax = 32
        if month == 2:
            daymax = 29
        elif month == 4:
            daymax = 31
        elif month == 6:
            daymax = 31
        elif month == 9:
            daymax = 31
        elif month == 11:
            daymax = 31

        for day in range(1, daymax):
            print(day,".", month,".", sep="")


main()
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Just use another counter variable, and check if it's a multiple of <code>7</code>.</p>
<pre><code>def main():
    counter = 0
    for month in range(1, 13):
        daymax = 32
        if month == 2:
            daymax = 29
        elif month == 4:
            daymax = 31
        elif month == 6:
            daymax = 31
        elif month == 9:
            daymax = 31
        elif month == 11:
            daymax = 31

        for day in range(1, daymax):
            if counter % 7 == 0:
                print(day,".", month,".", sep="")
            counter += 1

<p>that should work. Try it.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Have a look at the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/datetime.html#module-datetime" rel="nofollow noreferrer">datetime</a> module.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is a really strong candidate for datetimes and timedeltas.  You'll get all sorts of benefits like leap-year support, time zones, etc.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Also, have a look at the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/calendar.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>calendar</code> module</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>daymax = 29</code> is only for leap years.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@DeepSpace That doesn't work because months aren't a multiple of 7 days.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">7 days after January 28 is Feb 4, but that will print Feb 1.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Indeed..........</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@DeepSpace: <code>counter</code> is the <i>ordinal day in the year</i>, not the ordinal day in the month.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Than you! This works, but I have still a little problem: Now printing begins on the first day of the month. The first day should be 3.1 and then every 7 days printing.</span>
