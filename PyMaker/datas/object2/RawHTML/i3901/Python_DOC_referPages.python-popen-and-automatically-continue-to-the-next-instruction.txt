<p>I am trying to start and stop an in-memory database server from a python script for a certain experiment I'm working on. The issue that I am facing is that I'm not able to figure out how to continue to the next instruction automatically. The following code seems to work except as I said, it will wait for the server to return. I tried to search various solutions but none worked - including the ones mentioned here on stackoverflow. </p>
<pre><code>pid = subprocess.Popen(r"/PATH_TO/server",shell=True,stdin=None,
                  stdout=None, stderr=None, close_fds=True).pid
    # DO SOME MORE STUFF HERE
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Cool! this one worked. Thanks all!</p>
<pre><code>import os
import subprocess
DEVNULL = open(os.devnull, 'wb')
pid = subprocess.Popen(r"PATH_TO/server",stdin=DEVNULL,stdout=DEVNULL,
                      stderr=DEVNULL, close_fds=True).pid
# CONTINUE TO THE NEXT STUFF
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>stdout=/dev/null</code> that's a syntax error.</span>
