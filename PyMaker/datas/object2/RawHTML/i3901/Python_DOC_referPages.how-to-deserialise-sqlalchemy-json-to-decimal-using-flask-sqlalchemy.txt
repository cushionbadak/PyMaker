<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have got my code working to serialise an object which has <code>Decimal</code> and store in JSON in my PostgreSQL utilising <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36438052/using-a-custom-json-encoder-for-sqlalchemys-postgresql-jsonb-implementation">this post here</a> , i am using Flask-SQLAlchemy so have created my own custom <code>apply_driver_hacks</code> method to pass in a <code>json_serializer</code> which will serialise <code>Decimal</code> objects - so all good so far.</p>
<p>However on pulling the data back out , the deserializer loads these values as float. I've searched high and low but can't seem to find any way to reload as Decimal - i can pass in a custom <code>json_deserializer</code> as an option to Flask-SQLAlchemy but cant find a way to pass in any value such as <code>use_decimal=True</code> which is what I would use if using <code>simplejson</code> to load up Json with <code>Decimal</code> . </p>
<p>Any help greatly appreciated ! </p>

<p>Pass a callable that passes <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html#json.load" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>parse_float=decimal.Decimal</code></a> to <code>json.loads()</code> as <code>json_deserializer</code>. A simple function such as</p>
<pre><code>def json_deserializer(*args, **kwgs):
    return json.loads(*args, parse_float=decimal.Decimal, **kwgs)
</code></pre>
<p>should do.</p>
