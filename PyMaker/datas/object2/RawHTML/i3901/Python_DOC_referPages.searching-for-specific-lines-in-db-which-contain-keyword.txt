<p>I have a SQLite database that I'd like to find a certain keyword in using Python and display lines of database only containing them in a certain row:</p>
<pre><code>import sqlite3 as lite
con = lite.connect("corpus.db")
c = con.cursor()
keyword = str(input("Which keyword do you wish to find in the corpus? "))
c.execute("SELECT Content FROM Corpus")
#I'm guessing there should be more parameters here
</code></pre>
<p>I'm fairly new to coding in general, so sorry if the whole thing seems very noobish. I can't seem to find any similar solutions. I tried doing this (even though it's not exactly what I'm looking for, but I thought I could at least work around with the results from here later):</p>
<pre><code>import sqlite3 as lite
con = lite.connect("corpus.db")
c = con.cursor()
keyword = str(input("Which keyword do you wish to find in the corpus? "))
#For example, "camera"
c.execute("SELECT Content FROM Corpus")
#In my case, content contains a list with this data [('A Japanese woman has been reunited with a camera she dropped in the ocean two-and-a-half years ago, after schoolchildren in Taiwan found it washed up on a beach and covered in barnacles.',), ('The writer is a Washington DC-based foreign affairs analyst. His views are his own.',), ...]
content = c.fetchall()
for text in content:
    if keyword in text:
        print(text)
</code></pre>
<p>So, theoretically, it should print the sentence about a Japanese woman, but it prints nothing, so I have no idea what I should do to actually find elements inside of a list even. It works in this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13779526/finding-a-substring-within-a-list-in-python">example</a> though.</p>

<p>In my case, content contains a list with this data<br/>
  [('A Japanese woman has been reunited with a camera she dropped in the ocean

  washed up on a beach and covered in barnacles.',), ('The writer is a
  Washington DC-based foreign affairs analyst. His views are his

<p>The returned values in <code>content</code> seems to be a list of <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#tuples-and-sequences" rel="nofollow noreferrer">tuples</a>.<br/>
You'll have to iterate again within each tuple to get the sentence.  </p>
<p>Like this:</p>
<pre><code>for item in content:
    # item = ('A Japanese woman has been reunited with a camera she dropped in the ocean two-and-a-half years ago, after schoolchildren in Taiwan found it washed up on a beach and covered in barnacles.',)
    for sentence in item:
        if keyword in sentence:
            print(sentence) 
</code></pre>
