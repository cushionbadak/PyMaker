<p>I need a program that counts the top 5 most common first words of the lines in a file and which does not include lines where the first word is followed by a "DM" or an "RT"?</p>
<p>I don't have any code as of so far because I'm completely lost. </p>
<pre><code>f = open("C:/Users/Joe Simpleton/Desktop/talking.txt", "r")
?????
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Not tested, but should work roughly like that:</p>
<pre><code>from collections import Counter

count = Counter()
with open("path") as f:
     for line in f:
          parts = line.split(" ")
          if parts[1] not in ["DM", "RT"]:
                count[parts[0]] += 1
     print(count.most_common(5))
</code></pre>
<p>You should also add a check that ensures that parts has &gt; 2 elements.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Read each line of your text in. For each line, split it into words using a regular expression, this will return a list of the words. If there are at least two words, test the second word to make sure it is not in your list. Then use a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html?highlight=counter#collections.Counter" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>Counter()</code></a> to keep track of all of the word counts. Store the lowercase of each word so that uppercase and lowercase versions of the same word are not counted separately:</p>
<pre><code>from collections import Counter
import re

word_counts = Counter()

with open('talking.txt') as f_input:
    for line in f_input:
        words = re.findall(r'\w+', line)

        if (len(words) &gt; 1 and words[1] not in ['DM', 'RT']) or len(words) == 1:
            word_counts.update(word.lower() for word in words)

print(word_counts.most_common(5))
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>Counter()</code> has a useful feature in being able to show the most common values.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Iterate over the file and implement your constraints using if statements. There are plenty of tutorials on the web that show you how to read files by line.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">One suggestion (not meant glibly) is to google <code>"python counter"</code>.</span>
