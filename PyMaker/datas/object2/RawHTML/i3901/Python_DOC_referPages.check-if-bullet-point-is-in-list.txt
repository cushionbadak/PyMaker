<p>So I am trying to check and see if a bullet point is part of an item in a list by iterating through it with a for loop. I know that, at least in Regex a bullet point is defined as <code>\u2022</code>. But don't know how to use this. What I currently have but obviously doesn't work is something like this.</p>
<pre><code>list = ['changing. • 5.0 oz.', 'hello', 'dfd','df', 'changing. • 5.0 oz.']
for items in list:
     if "\u2022" in items:
        print('yay')
</code></pre>
<p>Thanks in Advance!</p>

<p>In <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/unicode.html#python-s-unicode-support" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python 3 your code will work fine because UTF-8 is the default source code encoding</a>. If you're going to be working with Unicode a lot, consider switching to Python 3.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://docs.python.org/2.7/howto/unicode.html#python-2-x-s-unicode-support" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python 2, the default is to treat literal strings as sequences of bytes</a>, so you have to explicitly declare which strings are Unicode by prefixing them with <code>u</code>.</p>
<p>First, set your source code encoding as UTF-8.</p>
<pre><code># -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
</code></pre>
<p>Then tell Python to encode those strings as Unicode. Otherwise they'll be treated as individual bytes which will lead to odd things like Python thinking the first string has a length of 21 instead of 19.</p>
<pre><code>print len(u'changing. • 5.0 oz.')    # 19 characters
print len('changing. • 5.0 oz.')     # 21 bytes
</code></pre>
<p>This is because <a href="https://utf8-chartable.de/unicode-utf8-table.pl" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the Unicode code point <code>U+02022 BULLET</code> is UTF-8 encoded as three bytes <code>e2 80 a2</code></a>. The first treats it as a single character, the second as three bytes.</p>
<p>Finally, encode the character you're searching for as Unicode. That's either <code>u'\u2022'</code> or <code>u'•'</code>.</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

list = [u'changing. • 5.0 oz.', u'hello', u'dfd', u'df', u'changing. • 5.0 oz.']
for item in list:
    if u'•' in item:
        print('yay')
</code></pre>
<p>Real code probably won't be using constant strings, so you have to make sure that whatever is in <code>list</code> is encoded as UTF-8.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Best if you use the <code>re</code> (regex) library. Something like this:</p>
<pre><code># import regex library
import re

# compile the regex pattern, using raw string (that's what the r"" is)
bullet_point = re.compile(r"\u2022")
list = ['changing. • 5.0 oz.', 'hello', 'dfd','df', 'changing. • 5.0 oz.']

# search each item in the list
for item in list:
    # search for bullet_point in item
    result = re.search(bullet_point, item)         
    if result:
        print('yay')
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">your code works fine for me</span>
<span class="comment-copy">While this will work, it's overkill for a simple character search and papers over the encoding problem.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Very true, I often forget you can encode python as UTF-8</span>
