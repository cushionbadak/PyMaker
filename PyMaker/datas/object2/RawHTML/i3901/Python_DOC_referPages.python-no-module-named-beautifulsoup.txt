<p>This might be a super newbie question but I am trying to import BeautifulSoup to my python project: </p>
<pre><code>import urllib.request
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
</code></pre>
<p>but I am getting this error:</p>
<pre><code>import BeautifulSoup
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'BeautifulSoup'
</code></pre>
<p>From what I am reading I have to install it make a child folder for it? If so why do my other imports such as import urllib.request work without installation and this one doesn't? </p>

<p>Python comes with a default set of modules - you can see that <code>urllib</code> is included with your installation of Python by <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">looking at the list of default modules on this page</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/pypa/get-pip" rel="nofollow noreferrer">You should follow these instructions to download and use <code>pip</code></a>, the Python package manager and installer, to get and install the <code>BeautifulSoup</code> module.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Have you tried <code>pip install beautifulsoup4</code>? Beautiful Soup is an external module whereas urllib is from the standard library of Python, so you don't have to install it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Did you pip install beautifulsoup4 from the command line? See the accepted answer to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19957194/install-beautiful-soup-using-pip">this question</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">just to add, newer versions of python ship with pip, so you may not need to install it.</span>
