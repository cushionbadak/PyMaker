<p>I've been using TensorFlow for very little but it seems promising. I'm doing the Coursera second course from DeepLearning.ai (Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization).</p>
<p>I noticed that there is an equivalent(ish) to simple operations like:</p>
<ul>
<li>tf.matmul(a,b) ≈ a @ b</li>
<li>tf.add(a,b) ≈ a + b</li>
</ul>
<p>I prefer shorthand operations because they might make code easier to read. So...</p>
<p><strong>What are all the shorthand operators?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Is there some place where I can find all the possible operations?</strong></p>
<p>Also, I would appreciate to hear some feedback on whether it is a good practice or not to use these shorthand operators...</p>

<p>This is not specific of tensorflow but a functionality of the python language. By defining some special member functions, you enable the use of those "shortcuts" -- for example if you implement the <code>__add__</code> member function then you use <code>+</code> to call this function.</p>
<p>You can find more about those <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#emulating-numeric-types" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a> regarding "numeric" operators, and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#emulating-container-types" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a> regarding "container" operators (such as <code>[]</code>). There are some more on the same page.</p>
<p>The fact that this is a python functionality, means that they may depend on the version of python you are using. I am thinking more particularly to <code>@</code> which came in python 3.5 and therefore cannot be used in python 2.7 AFAIK.</p>
<p>Those shortcuts make the code easier to read and I have not seen any induced penalty so far, so you can use at will.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I just found out about a nifty advantage from using the full function statements in TensorFlow (i.e. tf.matmul(a,b) vs a@b) and it is that you can name operations (apparently you can name everything in TF). Well, what does it mean? you ask... It means that when using a tool such as <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/programmers_guide/summaries_and_tensorboard" rel="nofollow noreferrer">TensorBoard</a> you can easily find out what that operation was by its name. Probably not all operations should be named but you ca do so and make it easier to debug a graph.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@loco.loop True -- although I personally find scopes to be my main tool for organizing a graph. I name scopes and variables, very rarely operations. But that is a personal standpoint of course.</span>
