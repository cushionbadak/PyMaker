<p>I am very new at Python.
I need to input integers, and sort integers into positive and negative lists.
When the input is 0, it can be ignored.
The result should look like this:</p>
<pre><code>input integers:
23 -2 5 89 -43 0 5 0
positive: 4, negative: 2, sum: 77

input integers:

there is no input
positive: 0, negative: 0, sum: 77
</code></pre>
<p>This is my code, but it has some problems. </p>
<pre><code>L = [int(x) for x in input("input integers: \n").split()]
positive=[]; negative=[]


for number in L:
    if L==[]:
        print("There is no input")

    if L!=[]:
        if number &gt; 0:
            positive.append(number)
        elif number &lt; 0 :
            negative.append(number)

        else:
            break
print("positive: %d , negative : %d, total : %d" %(len(positive), len(negative), sum(L)))
</code></pre>
<p>first of all, my code doesn't count the same numbers twice;
in this case, there are two '5', but it counts as one.</p>
<p>second, when there is no input number,
    print("There is no input")
is not shown.</p>
<p>How should I solve these problems?</p>

<p>Not precisely. What's happening is that, as soon as your loop encounters a zero, it <code>break</code>s out of the loop and stops looking at any further numbers. In the case of your first input, this means it ends up skipping over the second <code>5</code>.</p>
<p>The solution is simple: remove the <code>else: break</code>. It's unnecessary. If a number is neither <code>&gt; 0</code> nor <code>&lt; 0</code>, you don't need to do anything, so you don't need an <code>else:</code> for that case.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>second, when there is no input number, print("There is no input") is not shown.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The check for an empty list is inside the <code>for</code> loop. If the list is empty, there are no numbers to iterate over, so the loop never runs.</p>
<p>Move that check outside the loop.</p>
<hr/>
<p>As an aside, there's a much simpler way of doing the job of your <code>for</code> loop:</p>
<pre><code>positive = [x for x in L if x &gt; 0]
negative = [x for x in L if x &lt; 0]
</code></pre>
<p>This implementation uses <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">list comprehensions</a>. You will probably learn about these later.</p>
