<p>I am brand new to Python programming and programming in general. Anyway I have been looking for a clear answer as to why this isn't working for quite a while now. I pretty sure I have the file in the PATH but it still cant find it for some reason. Here is the error I keep getting. Any thoughts</p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:\Users\ovvip\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python36-32\KahootSpammer.py", line 28, in &lt;module&gt;

<p><code>os.chdir</code> <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.chdir" rel="nofollow noreferrer">changes the current directory</a> to the specified one. You don't need to go to the directory, you just need to tell selenium where it is.</p>
<p>Removing those two lines of code and adding this should work:</p>
<p><code>webdriver.Chrome(r'C:\WebDriver\bin\chromedriver_win32.exe')</code> </p>
