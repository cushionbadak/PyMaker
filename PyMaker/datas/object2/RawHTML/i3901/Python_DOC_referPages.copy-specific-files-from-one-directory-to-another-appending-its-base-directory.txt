<p>I have<br/>
 ~/a/a1/1.pdf <br/>
~/a/a1/2.pdf <br/>
~/a/b1/1.pdf <br/>
~/a/b1/2.pdf <br/>
I want to copy all the pdfs into ~/a/c with names a1_1.pdf,a1_2.pdf,b1_1.pdf,b2_2.pdf. How do I do that?</p>
<p>Please forgive my ignorance.I am new to programming and linux</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You mentioned that you are not familiar with Linux. Below is how to do it shell commands.  Once this is understood, if you want to do it from within a Python script, you can do similar actions with an import of the os module.  </p>
<p>First make your target directory:</p>
<pre><code># mkdir ~/a
# mkdir ~/a/c
</code></pre>
<p>then you can copy</p>
<pre><code># cp ~/a/a1/1.pdf ~a/c/a1_1.pdf
# cp ~/a/a1/2.pdf ~a/c/a1_2.pdf
# cp ~/a/b1/2.pdf ~a/c/b1_1.pdf
# cp ~/a/b1/2.pdf ~a/c/b2_2.pdf
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I don't know if you need to automatically browse folders, so if you need it you can use something like this to identify PDF files:</p>
<pre><code>for root, dirs, files in os.walk(~/a):
    print(root, dirs, files)
</code></pre>
<p>Then you can manipulate path with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><em>os.path</em> commands</a>:</p>
<pre><code>os.path.dirname('~/a/a1/1.pdf') -&gt; '~/a/a1'
os.path.basename('~/a/a1/1.pdf') -&gt; '1.pdf'
</code></pre>
<p>Finally you can also use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html#shutil.copyfile" rel="nofollow noreferrer">shutil.copyfile command</a>:</p>
<pre><code>shutil.copy('~/a/a1/1.pdf', '~/c/a1_1.pdf')
</code></pre>
<p>I let you combine and test all these commands so that you get familiar with python. Don't hesitate to print or debug variables before doing the final <em>shutil.copyfile</em></p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">what are all the ways that you have tried and what's failing you from doing this?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I won't do it for you because you'll learn more by doing it. But have a look at the os module and the methods that strings have (e.g. strip, split, toupper etc).</span>
