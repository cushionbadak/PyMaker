<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I loaded the <em>reticulate</em> package, if it matters.</p>
<p>In a <strong>python script in R</strong>, the below commands work.</p>
<pre><code>import numpy as np
import pandas as pd 
</code></pre>
<p>But this one doesn't</p>
<pre><code>import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
</code></pre>
<p>The console says : ModuleNotFoundError: no module named 'matplotlib'</p>
<p>In R's terminal I'm trying to do <em>pip install matplotlib</em> , but I get the error 'pip' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.</p>

<p>I think you need to use the <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/reference/py_install.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">py_install</a> function provided in the <code>reticulate</code> package.</p>
<p>It should work: <code>py_install(packages = "matplotlib")</code></p>
<p>In case you are using an virtual environment, try the <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/reference/virtualenv-tools.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">virtualenv_install</a> function.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I don't know why this is happening. I just tried on a new Rstudio cloud project and it worked fine. Perhaps you should ask a new question, or see here: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48493505/packagesnotfounderror-the-following-packages-are-not-available-from-current-cha" title="packagesnotfounderror the following packages are not available from current cha">stackoverflow.com/questions/48493505/â€¦</a></span>
