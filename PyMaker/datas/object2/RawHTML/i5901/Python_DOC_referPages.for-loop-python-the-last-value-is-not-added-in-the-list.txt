<p>The last value is not added in the tab.
So i create a program to test if a string is contains on other string. it works but the last value is not take in care.
result: </p>
<pre><code>result: ['testing', 'toto', 'trete'] 
what expected: ['testing', 'toto', 'trete','apoi']

str= ("""test
testing
toto
trete
apoi""")

tab = str.splitlines()
tabmot = []

mot = ""
for i in range(len(tab)):
  print(int(tab[i])
  if mot in tab[i]:
    mot = tab[i]
  else:
    if mot != "":
        tabmot.append(mot)
    elif tab[i] == tab[-1]:
        tabmot.append(tab[i])
    mot = tab[i]
</code></pre>

<p>It seems that you are trying to create a new list of unique strings from a test string. If that is your intention then this code won´t work. If that is not your intention then see the solution at the end of this post otherwise continue reading.</p>
<p>'mot' stores the previous iteration then you compare with the next element in the 'tab' list. Now suppose, if your input string is ¨test toto testing trete apoi" then you are not comparing 'test' with 'testing'. Your code will result ['test', 'toto' , 'testing', 'trete', 'apoi']. Therefore, it doesn't work the way it should. A basic solution can be achieved with the help of two loops, like this: </p>
<pre><code>str= ("""test testing toto trete apoi""")
tab = str.split()
tabmot = []
mot = ""
for i in range(len(tab)):
   mot = tab[i]
   for j in range(i+1, len(tab)-1):
       if(mot in tab[j]):
          if(len(mot) &lt; len(tab[j])):
             mot = tab[j]
   if(mot not in tabmot):
      tabmot.append(mot)
print(tabmot)
</code></pre>
<p>The solution of your post can be achieved this way:</p>
<pre><code>tab = str.split()
tabmot = []
mot = tab[0]
for i in range(1,len(tab)):    
  if mot in tab[i]:
    mot = tab[i]
    tabmot.append(mot)
  else:
    tabmot.append(tab[i])
  mot = tab[i]
print(tabmot) 
</code></pre>
<p>Hope, it'll help!</p>
<p>p.s: btw, you can make it more pythonic.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">It is still difficult to understand. Can you please add expected output or elaborate on given example?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">i've added an example,</span>
<span class="comment-copy">doesn't help. so looks like it's tabmot that is the output you need. are you looking for words that are stems like test and testing and so want to keep testing only in the final list?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What are you actually trying to do here?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@JHWOOD the problem seems to be on <code>range</code> as @Ahtisham pointed out. I'd suggest using a debugger to find such problem, it will make you faster on finding issues in your code. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/debug.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/debug.html</a> Best wishes!</span>
