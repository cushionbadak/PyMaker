<p>I am writing a chatbot program with python and when I run my code I get the following error.  </p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):

<p>Could not find any information online regarding error.  All I saw was maybe that it was a bug and I should report it to python.  Currently running python3.5.3.  This is the part of the code that gets the error.</p>

<p>The error is very explicit:</p>

<p>A simple check of the documentation for <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/bz2.html#bz2.open" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>bz2.open</code></a> would then show you that this function does not take a <code>buffering</code> argument.</p>
<p>So simply remove it.</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/bz2.html?highlight=bz2#bz2.open" rel="nofollow noreferrer">The <code>bz2.open</code> function</a> doesn't take a <code>buffering</code> argument. Even <code>bz2.BZ2File</code>, which takes <code>buffering</code>, explicitly notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <code>buffering</code> argument is ignored. Its use is deprecated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Buffering arguments are a bit nonsensical for compressors; they <em>have</em> to buffer to some extent, since if you request X amount of data, they may need need to decompress a block of unknown final size to get it, so they're either decompressing the whole block and buffering the uncompressed data beyond the X request, or stopping decompression when they reach X, buffering the compressed data (and they might still have to buffer some uncompressed data since decompressing a single byte from a stream can produce many bytes of output).</p>
<p>Point is, there is no reasonable way to disable or limit buffering; the needs of the compressor mean you don't have that level of control.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Please take the moment required to format your question into something readable.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Just remove the argument <code>buffering=1000</code> - are you sure this is the correct signature of the <code>open</code> method? Perhaps you want <code>bz2.BZ2File</code> instead.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It seems unlikely you need to report the bug "function doesn't take argument that it's defined not to take" to python.</span>
