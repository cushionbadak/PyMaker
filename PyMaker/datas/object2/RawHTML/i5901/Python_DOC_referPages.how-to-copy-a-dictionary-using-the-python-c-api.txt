<p>Given a Python dictionary, how can I obtain a copy using the C API?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Let's say that you have a dictionary, and you want to make a copy, meaning specifically that you want to create a new dictionary with references to all of the objects in the existing dictionary. One way is to use the <code>PyDict_Copy()</code> function: </p>
<pre><code>PyObject *new_dict = PyDict_Copy(old_dict);
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Of course this is going to be downvoted, but I did check for duplicates. If no one wants to answer the question, I might just answer it myself.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Also, I do wonder what the reason was for the close vote.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What's wrong with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/dict.html#c.PyDict_Copy" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>PyDict_Copy</code></a>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Actually nothing, other than I did not know about it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Do you want points for the answer?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">BTW, I will be more than happy to mark an answer given by someone else as correct.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><i>"I will be more than happy to mark an answer given by someone else as correct"</i> - There is no need. Your answer is fine, clear, and first. Unless somebody else's answer is actually <i>better</i> than yours in some way, you shouldn't feel any obligation at all to accept it.</span>
