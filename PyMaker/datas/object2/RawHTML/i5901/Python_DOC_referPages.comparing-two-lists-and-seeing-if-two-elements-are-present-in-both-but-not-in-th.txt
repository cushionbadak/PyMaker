<p>I need to find a way to say R and Y are in both lists but not in the right place</p>
<pre><code>    a = ['R','G','Y','Y']
    b = ['Y','R','B','O']         
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Rather simple really. </p>
<pre><code>for index,val in enumerate(a):
  if val in b:
    if b[index]!= val:
      print "%s is in both a and b, but at different indices."%(val,)
</code></pre>
<p>This iterates through <code>a</code> and keeps track of its current index. It then checks that the value is in <code>b</code> (and, obviously, it's in <code>a</code>, also.) If it is, then it checks to see if the values of <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are different at <code>index</code>. You can add variability to this by altering the conditionals.</p>
<p>For example, if you only want to find 'R' and 'Y' once, then you'd need to record them. Try:</p>
<pre><code>dup_values = set()
for index,val in enumerate(a):
  if val in b:
    if b[index]!= val:
      if val not in dup_values:
        dup_values.add(val)
        print "%s is in both a and b, but at different indices."%(val,)
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">So for your example lists the algorithm should return <code>False</code> because <code>'R' </code>and <code>'Y'</code> both appear at index 0? What should the algorithm output for <code>a = ['R', 'R', 'X']</code> and <code>b = ['Y', 'Z'. 'Y']</code> where <code>'R'</code> and <code>'Y'</code> appear paired and unpaired?</span>
