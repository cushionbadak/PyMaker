<p>I want to create a dictionary of the capitals and governors and then later choose a random state to ask the user what the capital of <strong>_ is or who the governor of _</strong> is. I have</p>

<p>You don't need a function for a static dict like <code>states</code> and also no main function. You can simplify this a lot:</p>
<pre><code>states = {
    "Alabama": ["Montgomery", "Kay Ivey"],
    "Alaska": ["Juneau", "Bill Wallker"]
}
question_list = ["What is the capital of", "Who is the governor of"]

choose_state= random.choice(states)
choose_question = random.randint(0, 1)  # just an index that can be reused
answer = input(question_list[choose_question], choose_state)
if answer == states[choose_state][choose_question]:
    # yay
else:
    # aww
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Why not make your dictionary in this type of format?</p>
<p><code>states = {'Alabama': {'capital': 'Montgomery', 'governor':'Kay Ivey'....}</code></p>
<p>It flows more like Json data that way.</p>
<p>Plus here in your question,</p>
<p><code>def state_dict():
    states={"Alabama":["montgomery","kay ivey"],"Alaska":["Juneau","Bill 
    Wallker"]}
</code></p>
<p>You don't return the <code>states</code> dict. So when you use it in <code>random.choice(state_dict())</code> you never end up passing the <code>states</code> dict to <code>random.choice(state_dict())</code></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Update2:
As @schwobaseggl has pointed out there's no reason to use the function states_dict() here. Just do</p>
<pre><code>def main():
    states_dict = {
        "Alabama": ["montgomery", "kay ivey"],
        "Alaska": ["Juneau", "Bill Wallker"],
        }
    question_list = ["What is the capital of","Who is the governor of"]
    choose_question = random.choice(question_list)
    if choose_question == "What is the capital of":
        choose_state = random.choice(list(states_dict.keys()))  # this will give you a random key from the dict.
</code></pre>
<p>Also, you should study the PEP8 style guide and incorporate it in your muscle memory now.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Update:</p>
<pre><code>def state_dict():
    states={"Alabama":["montgomery","kay ivey"],"Alaska":["Juneau","Bill 
    Wallker"]}
    return states  # returned states dict.

def main():
    question_list=["What is the capital of","Who is the governor of"]
    choose_question=random.choice(question_list)
    if choose_question=="What is the capital of":
        choose_state= random.choice(states_dict())  # added ()
        print("What is the capital of",choose_state)
</code></pre>
<hr/>
<p>Original:
You indentation is incorrect.</p>
<pre><code>def state_dict():
states={"Alabama":["montgomery","kay ivey"],"Alaska":["Juneau","Bill 
Wallker"]}
</code></pre>
<p>states is outside the function state_dict(). Make it:</p>
<pre><code>def state_dict():
    states={"Alabama":["montgomery","kay ivey"],"Alaska":["Juneau","Bill 
Wallker"]}
</code></pre>
<p>Additionally, you haven't followed the PEP8 style guidelines, maybe you did and compacted the code for SO. For those reading, this is a better way to format the code:</p>
<pre><code>def state_dict():
    states = {
        "Alabama": ["montgomery", "kay ivey"],
        "Alaska": ["Juneau", "Bill Wallker"],
        }
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<ol>
<li>As @Ajax1234 noted your indentation in <code>state_dict</code> is off and you need to add <code>return states</code></li>
<li>Your function is <code>state_dict</code> but you're calling <code>states_dict</code></li>
<li>You need to switch <code>random.choice(states_dict)</code> to <code>random.choice(states_dict())</code></li>
</ol>
<p>If you fix 1 &amp; 3 you should be good to go.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">1. Use return statement in state_dict() function. 2. replace statement choose_state= random.choice(states_dict) by choose_state= random.choice(states_dict().keys()).</span>
