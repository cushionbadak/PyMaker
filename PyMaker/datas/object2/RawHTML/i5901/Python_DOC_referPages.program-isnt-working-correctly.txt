<p>So I am not getting any errors but it is not running correctly. The bit of code highlighted with <code># **</code> is where it is going wrong. So when I run it, whether I put in .com or .co.uk or .org.uk or not it always ends up printing that my code is invalid.</p>

#Email validator
#Make a program to check whether an email address is valid or not.
#You could make sure that there are no spaces, that there is an @ symbol and a dot somewhere after it. Also check that the end parts of the address are not blank.
#Extensions:
#1. When an email address is found to be invalid, tell the user exactly what they did wrong with their email address rather than just saying it is invalid
#2. Allow the user to choose to give a text file with a list of email addresses and have it process them all automatically.

    #starts the definition and defines the command.
    time.sleep(1)

<p>You need <code>and</code> instead of <code>or</code>:</p>
<p>Try this:</p>
<pre><code> elif com not in email and couk not in email and org not in email:
    print("This email is not valid. Only .com or .co.uk or .org.uk are accepted.")**
    ev()

<span class="comment-copy">Please <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/posts/47491233/edit">edit</a> your question and add at the the error message verbatim or better yet the whole backtrace. Just saying "isn't working" and "my code is invalid" are too vague.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The answers may have solved your initial concern, but it'd be a lot easier (and error-proof, unlike the current code) to use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">regular expressions</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">You have an answer, but let's also point out that a regular expression would be more effective. Also it'd be good to organize this as a validator function that takes a string and returns an error message -- you could easily write unit tests for that -- and a separate function that reads input, calls the validitor, prints the result, and loops.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thnx for the advice</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thnx! Works perfectly now!</span>
