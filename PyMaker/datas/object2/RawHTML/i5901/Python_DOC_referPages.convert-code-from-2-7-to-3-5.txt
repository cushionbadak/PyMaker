<p>I'm very new to learning python, and was wondering if someone could convert a previously answered question so that it would work in Python 3.5. I would like to get the exact same info as the original question.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>Take the code and run this on the file, assuming it is called 'my_code.py'</p>
<pre><code>2to3 -w my_code.py
</code></pre>
<p>The code will now be Python 3 code! This process will save the old Python 2 code as my_code.py.bak should you want to restore it.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Just give it a try</span>
<span class="comment-copy">There's a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/2to3.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">program</a> to do that for you, so no need to ask real people.</span>
