<p>Please let me know how do I use paramiko module to transfer files between two remote hosts.</p>
<p>I have seen that 'get' method will get the files from remote host to local host.
'put' method will put the local files to some remote host.</p>
<p>Is there any method that combines 'get' and 'put' methods i.e.get files from remote host and put it in remote host. This request will get initiated from localhost.</p>

<p><code>Paramiko.sftp_client.SFTPClient</code> provides SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) features to move files between computers. After starting an sftp session via </p>
<p><code>ssh = client.open_sftp()</code>,</p>
<p>you can access all of these <a href="http://docs.paramiko.org/en/2.3/api/sftp.html#" rel="nofollow noreferrer">methods</a>.</p>
<p>If you just want to move files on the remote host, then you can use "local" file transfer methods with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">shutil</a>. Hope that helped! </p>

<span class="comment-copy">I think I musinderstood your question: If you could start a method from the localhost on the remote host that makes the remote host act as a client to the second remote host, using paramikos <code>SFTP</code> features, you would be able to solve your problem directly.</span>
