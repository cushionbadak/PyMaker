<p>Does it exist in python something like 'std::endl' in c++ std? Or, how can I get an end line symbol of the current system?</p>
<p>It seems very important thing because an end line symbol may be different in different OSs. </p>

<p>The os module has linesep which is the platform-specific string to end a line. However, quoting the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.linesep" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Do not use <em>os.linesep</em> as a line terminator</strong> when writing files opened in text mode (the default); use a single <code>'\n'</code> instead, on all platforms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The default Python behaviour for text files and file-like objects is that if your program writes '\n', it will be translated into whatever is appropriate for the local system. So as Mateen Ulhaq wrote, just use '\n'</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Just use the character <code>\n</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>std::endl</code> isn't needed to get a platform-specific line terminator even in C++ - <code>\n</code> in text mode will already do that.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hm, Do we not need to use '\r\n' in Unix?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Heck no. <i>Definitely</i> don't use <code>'\r\n'</code> on Unix.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Wow.. It's odd to me when you said: "Put the '\n' to the file', but, the interpreter might do another.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hm, I still can't find a site where said that python might interpret '\n' in a different way for different OSs, like you said above. In fact, it's very very odd because, if you wanna write '\n' to the text file in text write mode, it will be not equal to that you want</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It's been around in Python since 2.7, so one of those things that perhaps isn't made clear "because everybody knows it".
