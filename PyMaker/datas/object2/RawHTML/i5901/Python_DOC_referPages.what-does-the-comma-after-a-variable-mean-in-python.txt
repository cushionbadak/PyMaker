<p>I've pass by some variables while documenting myself for animation with matplotlib which are written like this <code>ln, = plt.plot([], [], 'ro', animated=True)</code> or <code>return ln,</code> , and I don't understand what the comma stands for...</p>
<p>It's probably related to tuple but I don't understand how, as the comma is supposed to be after the value and not the variable like <code>i = 1,</code></p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any clarification,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A tuple consists of a number of values separated by commas<br/>[...]<br/>Tuples are immutable, and usually contain a heterogeneous sequence of elements that are accessed via unpacking  or indexing</p>

<span class="comment-copy">It creates a tuple.  <code>i = 1,</code> is equivalent to <code>i = (1,)</code>.  All you need to do to see this is type it into the interpreter, then see what <code>i</code> is, right?  Similarly, <code>return ln,</code> is equivalent to <code>return (ln,)</code>, and <code>ln, = ...</code> is equivalent to <code>(ln,) = ...</code></span>
