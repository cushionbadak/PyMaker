<p>So I have a file that look something like this:</p>
<pre><code> Apples
 Red
 Round

 Banana
 Yellow
 Long
</code></pre>
<p>I want to create a list where each 'group' is in a separate list like this:
[[Apples, Red, Round], [Banana, Yellow, Long]</p>
<p>I am completely stumped on how I should proceed. </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>We'll split on <code>\n\n</code> (two newlines) to separate the groups, then use regular <code>str.split</code> to divide those into items</p>
<pre><code>with open('yourfile.txt') as f:
    l = list(map(str.split, f.read().split('\n\n')))
</code></pre>
<p>You can see a similar example (without the file I/O) running at <a href="https://repl.it/repls/MeaslyReliableMetalmarkbutterfly" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this repl.it</a></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I'd split the content once by a double newline in order to get each group separately, and then split each group individually:</p>
<pre><code>with f = open('file.txt'):
    content = f.read()
    result = [group.split() for group in content.split('\n\n')]
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Short code is great but what if you have to maintain it 2 years later? ;-)</p>
<p>So here's my more human readable version which works like the existing versions:</p>
<pre><code>file = open('file.txt')
text = file.read() # read everything into a string
file.close()
groups = text.split("\n\n") # create the groups
result = [ group.split("\n") for group in groups ] # split each group again at \n
</code></pre>
<p>This is two lines longer but I prefer this way because I am able to read and understand that easier than the other versions. However it's your decision. I hope I could help you.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Your first task is to read the file into a variable, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#reading-and-writing-files" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here are some examples of how to do that</a>.
