<p>These are randomly placed bricks which move along the x-axis, to the left and right from wall to wall. I'd like to have all bricks collide with themselves, for example if one of them hit another brick, the <code>speed</code> must be <code>-speed</code>.</p>
<pre><code>brick = []
for in range(50):
    block = Brick()
    brick.append(block)
</code></pre>
<p>My code is below:</p>
<pre><code>if block.rect.colliderect(block.rect.colliderect):
    block.speed *= -1
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You'd have to add another, nested loop to use the <code>colliderect</code> of each block with all other blocks. You also need to check if the two block instances are not the same object <code>block is not other_block</code>.</p>
<pre><code>for block in brick:
    for other_block in brick:
        if block is not other_block and block.rect.colliderect(other_block.rect):
            block.speed *= -1
</code></pre>
<p>You could also use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.product" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>itertools.product</code></a> instead of the two loops.</p>
