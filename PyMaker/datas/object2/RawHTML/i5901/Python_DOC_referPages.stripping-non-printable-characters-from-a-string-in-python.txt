<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>So currently I am trying to find out how many times a specific word appears on a page. </p>
<p>My Python code has this: </p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>print(len(re.findall(secondAnswer, page))) </p>
<blockquote>
<p>0</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Upon careful analysis, I noticed that 
print(secondAnswer) is giving me a different answer "Pacific"</p>
<p>from print(ascii(secondAnswer)) 'Paci\ufb01c'</p>
<p>I have a feeling that my secondAnswer value in len(re.findall(secondAnswer, page)) is using 'Paci\ufb01c' instead and thus not finding any matches on the page.</p>
<p>Can someone give me any tips on how to solve this?</p>
<p>Thanks, Nick</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Unicode character <code>fb01</code> is the <a href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/fb01/index.htm" rel="nofollow noreferrer">ﬁ ligature</a>. That is, it's a single character as far as Python is concerned, but appears as two (tied) characters when displayed.</p>
<p>To decompose ligatures into their separate characters, you can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unicodedata.html#unicodedata.normalize" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>unicodedata.normalize</code></a>. For example:</p>
<pre><code>page = unicodedata.normalize("NFKD", page)
</code></pre>
<p>Or in this specific case, you could write your regex to accept the ligature as an alternate for the <code>fi</code> character sequence, for example by using alternation with a non-capturing group: <code>paci(?:fi|ﬁ)c</code>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Could you elaborate on what you mean by how I would write my "regex to accept the ligature as an alternate for the fi character sequence" Sorry, I'm  fairly new to programming.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Added that to my answer.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, so where do I put the non-capturing group? I'm using PyCharm with my script.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I've tried to Google non-capturing groups but haven't understood much.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It's shown right in my answer. The <code>(?:....)</code> construction is a non-capturing group.</span>
