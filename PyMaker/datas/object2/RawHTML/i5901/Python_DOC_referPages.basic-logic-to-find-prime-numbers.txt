<p>I aim is to have a simple logic to find prime numbers between 2 ranges. However to start simple, i am trying to have a code that evaluates a number input if it is prime and i am failing at it. Though i am able to evaluate it to some degree the final print statement is off. How do i ensure that the final print only happens when the previous loop is done and did not succeed?</p>
<pre><code>n = int(input ('The number'))
if n &lt;2:
  print (n,' is not a prime number')
elif n==2:
  print (n, ' is a prime number')
else:
  i = 2
  while i&lt;n:
    if n%i ==0:
      print (n, ' is not a prime number')
      break
    else:
      i +=1
print (n, " is a prime number")    
</code></pre>

<p>In this case, you could use the while-else construction.</p>

<p>Well, you can find this answer anywhere on the net. But i will put a simple function here to check for a prime number.</p>
<pre><code>def is_prime(num):
    """ Returns if the given number is prime or not
    """ 
    # 0 and 1 are not a prime numbers so return them as not a prime number
    if num == 0 or num == 1:
        return '{0} is Not a prime number'.format(num)
    for i in range(2, num):
        if num%i == 0:
            return '{0} is Not a prime number'.format(num)
    return '{0} Is a prime number'.format(num)

n = int(input ('The number'))
print(is_prime(n))
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Thank you vvv much Peter. your clue helped me solve in few seconds and very thankful.n = int(input ('The number')) t = True if n &lt;2:   print (n,' is not a prime number') elif n==2:   print (n, ' is a prime number') else:   i = 2   while i&lt;n:     if n%i ==0:       print (n, ' is not a prime number')       t = False       break     else:       i +=1   else:     print (n,' is a prime number')</span>
