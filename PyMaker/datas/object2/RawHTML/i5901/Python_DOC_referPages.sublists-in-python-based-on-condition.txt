<p>I would like to get sublist of a list having more than 300 000 lines.</p>
<pre><code>line1 = [field1,field2,field3,code1]
</code></pre>
<p>Where code1 is a 5 character string</p>
<p>I would like to do something like a select statement in sql</p>
<pre><code>select * from table where code1 = '78100'
</code></pre>
<p>I tried doing the below with itertools but i do not know how to use the grouperobject it returns.</p>
<pre><code>import csv
import sys
reload(sys)  
sys.setdefaultencoding('utf8')

with open(r"csvfile", "rU") as f:

    reader = csv.DictReader(f,delimiter=';')
    sortedreader = sorted(reader, key=lambda d: (d['insee']))
    groups = groupby(sortedreader, key=lambda d: (d['insee']))
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This should work:</p>
<pre><code>long_list = [[1, 2, 3, '12345'],
             [1, 2, 3, '78100']]

def filter_list(long_list, pos, value):
    filtered_list = []
    for line in long_list:
        if line[pos] == value:
            filtered_list += line
    return filtered_list


print(filter_list(long_list, 3, '78100'))
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Please show us what you have done to solve the problem. Only then will we be able to help you out.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What you have done till now?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">get the index of code 1 what is the problem in that?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">or use line1[-1] to print code1</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why not read up on <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">list comprehension</a>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks!Exactly but i do not want to iterate over the 300 000 lines everytime</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What so you mean every time? How would you want to find out which lines are the ones you want if you do not iterate over the lines?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I am looking for a way to speed up the creation of this sublist because i will be creating it a few hundred times in my script.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sorry i'm new here. i'd repost a new question. Cheers</span>
