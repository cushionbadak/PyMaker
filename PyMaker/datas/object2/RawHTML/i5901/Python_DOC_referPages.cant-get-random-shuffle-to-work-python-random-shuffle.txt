<h1><strong>Right now I am trying to do a piece of code for the Monty Hall problem</strong></h1>
<p>I have some code that I am trying to fix and then enhance</p>
<p><strong>This is one thing that I am stuck on:</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>I am trying to change the way the door at which the prize is chosen by using random.shuffle(), I have to use random.shuffle(), not anything else.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>How would I do this?</strong></p>
<p>What I have now does not work for that.
if I put <code>print(random.shuffle(door))</code>, I don't get a new output.
how do I make it return the chosen output</p>
<pre class="lang-python-3.x prettyprint-override"><code>import random
door = ["goat","goat","car"]

choice = int(input("Door 1, 2 or 3? "))

otherDoor = 0
goatDoor = 0

if choice == 1:
    if door[1] == "goat":
        otherDoor = 3 
        goatDoor = 2
    elif door[2] == "goat":
        otherDoor = 2
        goatDoor = 3  
elif choice == 2:
    if door[0] == "goat":
        otherDoor = 3
        goatDoor = 1
    elif door[2] == "goat":
        otherDoor = 1
        goatDoor = 3
elif choice == 3:
 if door[0] == "goat":
     otherDoor = 2
     goatDoor = 1
 elif door[1] == "goat":
     otherDoor = 1
     goatDoor = 2

switch = input("There is a goat behind door " + str(goatDoor) +\
               " switch to door " + str(otherDoor) + "? (y/n) ")

if switch == "y":
    choice = otherDoor

if random.shuffle(door) == "car":
    print("You won a car!")
else:
    print("You won a goat!")

input("Press enter to exit.")

<p><code>random.shuffle</code> shuffles in place, meaning it will return <code>None</code> if you try and assign a variable to it's non-existent output.</p>
<p>Since you say you have to use <code>shuffle</code>, you can shuffle the list in place with <code>random.shuffle(door)</code>, then take an element from this shuffled list eg: <code>door[0]</code></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>From the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.shuffle" rel="nofollow noreferrer">python3 documentation of the random module</a>: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>random.shuffle(x[, random]) 
  Shuffle the sequence x in place.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The 'in place' means that the function is replacing the variable x (in your case, 'door') with a different variable that has the same values as before but with their order shuffled. It does not have a return, it simply modifies the variable you gave it, which is why your print statement shows 'None'.</p>
<p>If you must use, <code>random.shuffle</code>, you can simply select an element of the door after you've shuffled it  (i.e. <code>random.shuffle(door)</code> then <code>print(door[0])</code>). </p>
<p>However, if other functions were to be an option, then <code>random.sample(door,1)</code> may be simpler instead (documentation for random.sample <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.sample" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>).</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You need to pay closer attention to the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/17649901/10077">answers to the question you linked</a>. <code>random.shuffle()</code> <b>does not return anything</b>. It shuffles the list in-place.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>random.shuffle()</code> does just that... It shuffles the data. It's not <i>supposed</i> to output anything.</span>
