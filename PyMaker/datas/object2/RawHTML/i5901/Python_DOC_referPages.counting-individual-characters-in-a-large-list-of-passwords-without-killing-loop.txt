<p>I'm trying to get a count on, for example, how many a's are in a massive list of passwords out of curiosity. but i think when i'm trying to add a count for a character it's killing the loop that is going through all the characters. </p>

<p>You should use a <code>dictionary</code> (or a <code>list</code> which has an order) to store how many counts of each letter there are. This is <em>much</em> better than using <code>26</code> one letter variables which is ridiculous!</p>
<p>To create a dictionary, you can use a dictionary-comprehension with <code>str.count</code> on the entire contents of the file.</p>
<pre><code>with open('passwords.txt','r') as fileobj:
    text = fileobj.read()
    letterCounts = {c: text.count(c) for c in "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"}
</code></pre>
<p>which would give <code>letterCounts</code> as something like:</p>
<pre><code>{'s': 0, 'a': 4, 'o': 0, 'i': 0, 'm': 0, 'k': 0, 'q': 0, 'y': 0, 'c': 1, 'j': 0, 'b': 4, 'g': 0, 'd': 1, 'h': 0, 'e': 0, 'f': 0, 'u': 0, 'n': 0, 'w': 0, 't': 0, 'x': 0, 'p': 0, 'l': 0, 'r': 0, 'z': 0, 'v': 0}

<p><code>counts</code> is a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.Counter" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>Counter</code></a> keeping track of the counts of all the characters that appear in the file.

<span class="comment-copy">Do you mean <code>if char == 'a'</code> and <code>elif char == 'b'</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">yes, when i run it i get those as being 0, and there's 1,000,000 passwords in my list so there's quite a few more than 0</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Well, the code as written will always produce 0 because you forgot to put quotes around the <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thanks lol, i didn't even think of that lol. you have fixed my issue</span>
<span class="comment-copy">a text file of 1 million passwords seems, uh, nefarious at best</span>
