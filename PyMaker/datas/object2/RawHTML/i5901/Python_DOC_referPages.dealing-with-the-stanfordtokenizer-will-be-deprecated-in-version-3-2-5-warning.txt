<p>I was testing the StanfordNERTagger using the NLTK wrapper and this warning appeared:</p>
<pre><code>DeprecationWarning: The StanfordTokenizer will be deprecated in version 
3.2.5. Please use nltk.tag.corenlp.CoreNLPPOSTagger or 
nltk.tag.corenlp.CoreNLPNERTagger instead.
super(StanfordNERTagger, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)
</code></pre>
<p>My code looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>from nltk import word_tokenize, pos_tag, ne_chunk
from nltk.tag import StanfordNERTagger

sentence = "Today George went to school and met his friend Peter."

# stanford's NER tagger 3 entity classification
st = StanfordNERTagger('/home/hercules/Desktop/PhD/Tools/stanford-ner-
     2017-06-09/classifiers/english.all.3class.distsim.crf.ser.gz',
     '/home/hercules/Desktop/PhD/Tools/stanford-ner-2017-06-09/stanford-
     ner.jar',
     encoding='utf-8')

tokenized_text = word_tokenize(sentence)
classified_text = st.tag(tokenized_text)

print("Stanford NER tagger:")
print(classified_text)
</code></pre>
<p>I tried to use CoreNLPNERTagger but I could not find any examples or documentation. 
I only found this <a href="http://www.nltk.org/_modules/nltk/tag/stanford.html" rel="noreferrer">link:</a>
where it gives something like an example in the comments of the 
class CoreNLPNERTagger(CoreNLPTagger)                                      (I found it by searching the keyword "CoreNLPNERTagger")</p>
<p>I tried to follow that example with no use.
I think I should start (if that is the correct term) the coreNLP server first but if is that the case I don't know how.</p>
<p>If anyone got any idea or advice I would be grateful.</p>

<p>Well i found myself working with Stanford POS Tagger recently (got a similar warning) but still the tagger is still working.<br/>
The thing is, this is a warning telling you that they will change/remove the StanfordNERTagger class (more information about the <a href="http://www.lesinskis.com/python_deprecation_tutorial.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">warning</a>).<br/>
What i advise you to do is to maintain your code with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">venv</a> or just copy the module (that's what i did) for example in order to keep your nltk module the way it is (avoid updating therefore sticking with this class).<br/>
Hope this helps you.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I don't get why cross posting makes a question off topic. And given that the question has 1k views shows that a lot of people had the same issue with me and searched SO.</span>
