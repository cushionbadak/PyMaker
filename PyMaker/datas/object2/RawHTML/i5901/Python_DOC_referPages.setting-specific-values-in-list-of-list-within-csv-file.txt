<p>what would be the correct way to set certain values of a list of lists to 0 then writing these back to a csv file?</p>
<p>For example:  </p>
<pre><code>list = [[a, 1, 0] , [b, 2, 5], [c, 6, 9], ............]  
</code></pre>
<p>Required output:  </p>
<pre><code>list = [[a, 0, 0] , [b, 0, 0], [c, 0, 0], ............]  
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can just replace the trailing values with a list of zeroes:</p>
<pre><code>list = [['a', 1, 0] , ['b', 2, 5], ['c', 6, 9]]  
final_list = [[i[0]]+[0]*len(i[1:]) for i in list] 
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>[['a', 0, 0], ['b', 0, 0], ['c', 0, 0]]
</code></pre>
</div>
