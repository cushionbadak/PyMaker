<p>How exactly would I add a loop that asks the user to continue or not? I'm new to programming and im very confused. I also don't understand how to add the English form of the sentence before the pig latin form??
can someone please help!</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>you can use a <code>while</code> loop in your <code>main</code> and a string like -1 to exit</p>
<pre><code>def main():
   while True: 
   """
   Main function
   """
   # Reading line of text
   text = input("\n Enter a line of text or -1 to exit: ")
   if text == '-1':
      exit(0)
   # Removing punctuation
   text = removePunctuation(text)

   # Converting to lower case
   text = text.lower()

 print("\n\n Pig Latin form: \n");

  # Iterating over words
  for word in text.split(" "):

   # Converting word to Pig Latin form
   word = pigLatin(word)

   # Printing word
   print(word, end = " ");

   print("\n");

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>A simple solution might look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>while True:
    main()

    response = input("Continue?")
    if response != 'y':
        break
</code></pre>
<p>You'll probably want to be a little less strict about the inputs you accept.</p>
<p>I think it would be better practice to put this loop inside your main function (and have a check on <code>__name__</code> before invoking it), but this at least demonstrates what the loop would look like.</p>
