<p>I am relatively new to python3 and I just got the code for a string that adds one number to the previous number, and adds that number onto the previous number as a string</p>
<p>For example if the first number was 1, it would 1+1 to equal 2 and attach that to the string to make 12.</p>
<p>The first few digits of the number would be
123456789101112131415161718... </p>
<p>I have the code</p>
<pre><code>from itertools import count
for c in count():
print(c, end="")
</code></pre>
<p>And I am wondering if there is a way to stop it at a certain amount of digits lets say 10,000 and then save it to a document called number.txt</p>

<p>All of the answers so far are very memory intensive, or quite finite.</p>
<p>I would consider the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.count" rel="nofollow noreferrer">itertools.count</a> generator and printing the results immediately. This will use very little memory, and is by far the most 'infinite' of the solutions posted so far.</p>
<pre><code>from itertools import count
for c in count():
    print(c, end="")
</code></pre>

<pre><code>k = ""

for i in range(0, 100):

    k = k + ''.join(str(i))

print(k)
</code></pre>
<p>will create till from 0 to 100 like so</p>

<span class="comment-copy">sure, show us your flaw, and given you are using python, make sure you post it using the code tags so we can see your proper indentation.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">There are a few ways to do this. Try searching for <code>random number python</code> or similar...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Shadow the numbers aren't random</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@cricket_007 - You're right. Then <code>itertools.counter</code> might be the way to go then.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thanks @Shadow :)</span>
