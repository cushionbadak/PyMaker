<p>Just learning in Python 3, doing function building.  I have a set of functions that take in multiple elements from the user and output the unique elements.  I'm wondering if I can improve the program appearance because if there are large number of inputs they chain together, one after the next, each on a new line.  Ideally, every time a user hits enter the input line takes the element and the same line resets for the next value.</p>
<p>Here's what I have:</p>
<pre><code>userlist = []
uniquelist = []

def make_list(list): #function to assign only unique list values
    for u in userlist:
        if u not in uniquelist:  #only append element if it already appears
            uniquelist.append(u)
        else:
            pass
    print("The unique elements in the list you provided are:", uniquelist)


def get_list():  #get list elements from user
    i = 0
    while 1:
        i += 1  #start loop in get values from user
        value = input("Please input some things: ")
        if value == "":  #exit inputs if user just presses enter
            break
        userlist.append(value)  #add each input to the list
    make_list(userlist)

get_list()
</code></pre>
<p>The output (in Jupyter Notebook) adds a Please input some things: line for each element a user inputs.  50 inputs, 50 lines; looks sloppy.  I cannot find a way to have the function just use a single line, multiple times.</p>

<p>You just need to use the map function to take input in a single line and then split every data and then typecast it to form a map object and then pass it to the list function which would return a list in the variable like this:</p>
<pre><code>var = list(map(int,input().split()))
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Do you want to clear the text in the console after each input? Then you could use <code>os.system('CLS')</code> on Windows or <code>os.system('clear')</code> on Unix systems:</p>
<pre><code>import os

os.system('CLS')
user_input = ''
while user_input != 'quit':
    user_input = input('Input something:')
    os.system('CLS')  # Clear the console.
    # On Unix systems you have to use 'clear' instead of 'CLS'.
    # os.system('clear')
</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively, I think you could use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/curses.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>curses</code></a>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Just omit the prompt. You can use the <code>iter</code> function to replace the <code>while</code> loop with <code>for value in iter(input, ""): userlist.append(value)</code>, or simply <code>userlist = list(iter(input, ""))</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">It's Python 3: <code>raw_input</code> doesn't exist and <code>map</code> creates an iterator rather than returning a list (and certainly not an array).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">sorry I didn't see that it was asked for python3, I corrected it so now it works in python 3.x</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Perhaps I wasn't explaining (asking) correctly.  The user enters something and presses enter.  They are then given another prompt.  Pressing enter while blank breaks the input loop.   I was hoping to find a way for Python to not keep presenting new lines - and instead offer the same line over again each time.</span>
