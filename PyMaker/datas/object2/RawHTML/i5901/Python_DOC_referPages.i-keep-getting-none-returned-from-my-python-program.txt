<pre><code># Cristmas Quiz
import time
from time import *

score = 1
quiz_q = [ 
        'how many turtle doves', 
        'how many French Hens',

        ]

quiz_a = [2,3,5,10]

for n in range(4):
    question = input(print(quiz_q[n]))
    if quiz_a[n] == question:
        score += 1
    else:
        print("your score was ",score-1)
        time.sleep(5)
        quit()
</code></pre>
<p>which returns this:</p>
<pre><code>how many turtle doves
None 
</code></pre>
<p>I had a look around, but all the other qustion seemed to be refering about functions and the use of return vs print()</p>
<p>any help would be appreciated</p>

<p>As suggested in the comments, I'm reformatting my comment as an answer. I will attempt to elaborate on my explanation.</p>
<p>You are calling the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>print</code></a> function, which outputs the text, then returns <code>None</code>. This may not be intuitive, but <code>None</code> is returned from any function that doesn't return anything else.</p>
<p>The <code>None</code> is then passed to the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>input</code></a> function as a parameter, which transforms it into text, outputs that and then waits for input.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The "input()" call should only take a string as an argument, not a print function:</p>
<pre><code>for n in range(4):
    question = input(quiz_q[n])
    # ...
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Don't put <code>print</code> inside your <code>input()</code>. Just put <code>input(quiz_q[n])</code>. <code>print</code> returns <code>None</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You are calling the <code>print</code> function, which outputs the text, then returns <code>None</code>. This is then passed to the <code>input</code> function, which outputs that and then waits for input.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It's important to show the full exception, because that would have told you which line it was coming from, and help you debug. But it has to be <code>input(print(quiz_q[n]))</code>. In future please paste the full exception.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Kendas stick that in an answer and claim the prize</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'd make use of an editor that can check the syntax of your code, the linter would've found the problem.</span>
