<p>How do I add headers to row one in a csv? </p>
<p>My solution currently appends everything</p>
<p>Something like: <code>writer.writerow(['DataA', 'DataB', 'DataC', 'DATA D'])[0]</code></p>
<p>I feel like there an easy way of doing this and I'm overlooking the obvious.</p>
<p>I've looked at a lot of examples online but am still struggling as to how you can easily do this in a csv.</p>
<p>As an example lets say I wanted to scrape data of SO - load up selenium, write that into four columns and do this for 20 pages.  I'd want to write the headers to row 1 each time and then append the scraped data </p>
<pre><code>with open('C:\\fa.csv', 'a+', newline='', encoding="utf-8") as outfile:
    writer = csv.writer(outfile)
    writer.writerow(['DataA', 'DataB', 'DataC', 'DataD'])
    for row in zip(ZAW_text, RESULTS1, RESULTS):
        writer.writerow(row)
        #writer.writerows({'Date': row[0], 'temperature 1': row[1], 'temperature 2': 0.0} for row in writer)
        print(row)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>import csv
import os

file_name = 'C:\\fa.csv'
fake_data = [[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4444, 6, 67], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4444, 6, 67],
             [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4444, 6, 67], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4444, 6, 67]]
headers = ['DataA', 'DataB', 'DataC', 'DataD']

if os.path.isfile(file_name):
  with open(file_name, 'a', encoding="utf-8") as outfile:
    writer = csv.writer(outfile)
    for datum in fake_data:
      writer.writerow(datum)
else:
  with open(file_name, 'w', encoding="utf-8") as outfile:
    writer = csv.writer(outfile)
    writer.writerow(headers)
    for datum in fake_data:
      writer.writerow(datum)
</code></pre>
<p>In the first line <code>open('C:\\fa.csv', 'a+', newline='', encoding="utf-8")</code> you have <code>a+</code> which is <em>append</em> you want <code>w</code> which is write.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">That is pretty much how you do it. I don't think there is an easier way.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Tyler.Exposure Very well.  Well in my case it appends the headers so it's not working for me.  How do I get around that as I want headers in row one.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Pretty sure I'm missing something.  You can specify columns in csv surely rows is possible too.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">AHHH I see what you did. I'm posting an answer.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I see.  In the example with 20 other pages, will that data still be appended in the csv.  Or will it all overwrite each other.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Unfortunately.  The headers need to be at row 1.  The data needs to be appended as its in a loop</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Every time you run this whole function, it will overwrite the file, but as its going through the for loop it will append, because you are writing a new row each time. Make sense?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ahh Ok, I'll edit my answer to show both.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Uh.. that makes sense.  I'd rather not overwrite the file if possible and keep an ever growing list of data.  Is that possible?  Hmm</span>
