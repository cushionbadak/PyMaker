<p>I was trying to find a good way to translate this string:</p>
<p><i>'20171127124906.359599+000'</i>   - into date/time;</p>
<p>I was currently trying to accomplish this by cutting string into different elements, but the code started to look a bit ugly.</p>
<p>Essentially, my goal is to find a most Pythonic or elegant way to calculate the machines UpTime;</p>
<p>I get this string from WMI, Win32_OperatingSystem class; There are two values that I want to use to calculate the machine UpTime;</p>
<pre><code>LastBootUpTime = '20171127124906.359599+000'
LocalDateTime = '20171201151404.691000+000'
</code></pre>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>

<p>Normal UTC offsets are usually four digits <code>+HHMM</code>.  If you can convert your timestamp to that, you can use </p>
<pre><code>form datetime import datetime

t = '20171127124906.359599+000'
# I think that your inputs are of the form HHM (So 11:30 would be 113).
# This rounds that out by adding a zero at the end
t = t + '0'

datetime.strptime(t, '%Y%m%d%H%M%S.%f%z')
</code></pre>
<p>gives us </p>
<pre><code>datetime.datetime(2017, 11, 27, 12, 49, 6, 359599, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc)
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to change that format string, the documentation for it is <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#strftime-and-strptime-behavior" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a></p>

<span class="comment-copy">Assuming that comes from Powershell, use powershell's built in functionality to convert to a date timestamp that you can import into python.  <a href="http://www.itprotoday.com/management-mobility/converting-those-weird-wmi-dates-and-times" rel="nofollow noreferrer">itprotoday.com/management-mobility/â€¦</a></span>
