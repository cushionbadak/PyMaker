<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.strip" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>str.strip()</code></a> removes characters from the beginning of the line or the end of the line only. It does not modify those in between, so instances of the substring <code>&amp;nbsp;</code> situated elsewhere in the string will not be removed. Also, <code>str.strip()</code> removes any of the characters in the given string, not the actual string.</p>
<p>You can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.replace" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>str.replace()</code></a> to remove the substring <code>'&amp;nbsp;'</code>:</p>
<pre><code>data = data.replace('&amp;nbsp;`, '')
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>What you are probably looking for is <code>replace</code> rather then <code>strip</code> is used to eliminate characters at the beginning or end of your text. By default it is removing spaces, but you can specify a character as well. </p>
<pre><code>data.replace("&amp;nbsp", "")
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">strip() is used to remove white spaces</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>strip()</code> only works at the start and end of a string not inside of it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">strip only removes from start and end of string. Use data.replace('&amp;nbsp;','')</span>

<span class="comment-copy">@KlausD. It does not matter if an answer is low quality or high it should work and this answer works for me.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sounds good, If you think other answers were usefull too, you can upvote them and make people happy :D</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@PuneetMathur: you should prefer the correct answers of higher quality. Those tend to be answers with some explanation. Also, your question does not ask for a solution, it asks for an <i>explanation</i> as to <i>why</i> <code>strip()</code> did not work as you expected. This answer (originally) did not provide that explanation.</span>
