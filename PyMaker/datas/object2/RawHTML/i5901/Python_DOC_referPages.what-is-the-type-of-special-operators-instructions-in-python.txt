<p>In Python, we have things like <code>if</code>, <code>elif</code>, <code>else</code>, <code>break</code>, <code>continue</code>, <code>pass</code>, etc. For want of a better word, I'll call them special instructions.</p>
<p>What type are they? If I do something like <code>type(pass)</code> I get a <code>SyntaxError</code>.</p>

<p>According to documentation, the terminology you're looking for is <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#keywords" rel="nofollow noreferrer">"Keywords"</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<h2>2.3.1. Keywords</h2>
<p>The following identifiers are used as reserved words, or keywords of
  the language, and cannot be used as ordinary identifiers. They must be
  spelled exactly as written here:</p>
<pre><code>False      class      finally    is         return
None       continue   for        lambda     try
True       def        from       nonlocal   while
and        del        global     not        with
as         elif       if         or         yield
assert     else       import     pass
break      except     in         raise
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>These are language constructs. They are part of the language's <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/grammar.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">grammar and syntax</a>, and <em>not</em> objects. The interpreter treats these differently. As such, they are not associated with a <code>type</code>, as objects typically are.  </p>
<p>If, for any reason, you want to know whether a word is a python keyword (aka, reserved word), you can import the <code>keyword</code> module and test - </p>
<pre><code>import keyword

keyword.iskeyword('if')
True
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>They're called <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#keywords" rel="nofollow noreferrer">keywords</a>. You can test if a string represents a keyword by using <code>keyword.iskeyword</code>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import keyword
&gt;&gt;&gt; keyword.iskeyword("if")
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; keyword.iskeyword("ifo")
False
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">"Keywords"/"Reserved Words"?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You mean <b>keywords</b>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">They do not have a type. These are keywords, keywords are not objects. These are keywords that the interpreter/compiler understands.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">They're keywords? <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/keyword.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/2/library/keyword.html</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">One of you commenters should probably write this as an answer.</span>
