<p>I would like to use a Python script to look for folders containing a certain string in its name and replace the entirety of that name to another. Like this:</p>
<p>The data is nested inside folders LastName FirstName
The script should go to each of those folders and rename the following folders.</p>
<pre><code>ep2d_diff_e_2d_tra_7
ep2d_diff_e_2d_tra_ADC_8
t1_blade_tra_darkfl_6
t1_blade_tra_darkfl_14
t2_blade_tra_320_9
t2_fl2d_tra_hemo_5
t2_tirm_tra_darkfluid_blade_4
</code></pre>
<p>to </p>
<pre><code>DWI
ADC
T1
KM
T2
Hemo
Flair
</code></pre>
<p>Those numbers at the end are not always consistant so should just be dropped.</p>
<p>You can see those 2 are quite similar..The only difference being, that the one has a higher number in the postscript. (It might be 8 and 12 or other numbers)</p>
<pre><code>t1_blade_tra_darkfl_6
t1_blade_tra_darkfl_14
</code></pre>
<p>How would I best go about it? </p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The <code>os</code> package contains methods for manipulating files and folders, and you could use <code>re</code> to match the strings with regular expressions.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>import os
import re

for dir_name in os.list_dir('path'):
    if re.match('string', dir_name):
        os.rename(old_name, new_name)
</code></pre>
