<p>Within pdb, I'm using the interact command to enter interactive mode (documentation at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html</a>).
This gives me an InteractiveConsole within pdb (which I need in order to do list comprehension).
From within a Jupyter Notebook, how do I leave interactive mode without exiting the debugger entirely? </p>
<p>Things I've tried:</p>
<ul>
<li>The link below answers this exact question but the solutions only work from the terminal. Ctrl-d from within Jupyter just adds a bookmark...And quit() returns: 
NameError: name 'quit' is not defined</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Meditating. Situation unchanged.</li>
</ul>
<p>I can do import sys; sys.exit(), but that exits the debugger entirely, meaning I have to start from scratch.</p>

<p>The only way I have been success is to copy/paste the Crtl-D character from another source. I use Emacs, so this is fairly easy, but any text editor that allows you to insert a Crtl-D into the document should work. Once inserted, use the standard copy/paste into the pdb interact field and hit  or . This should get you out.</p>
<p>For Emacs, the long way is as follows, for demonstration purposes:</p>
<p></p>
<pre><code>M-x insert char &lt;RET&gt; END OF TRANSMISSION &lt;RET&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>At this point you should see ^D in the buffer. At this point select the character and M-w or kill-ring-save to put it on the clipboard.</p>
<p>Then, change to the browser and make the interactive field active, and paste the character back. You will not see anything. Then hit . This should/might get you out.</p>
