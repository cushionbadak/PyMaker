<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The title says it all, I have a users.txt file, I want to pass each line as a parameter to screen_name='$' and run the script in loop. I read some tutorials and googled the answer but didn't found what I was looking for. </p>
<p>for tweet in tweepy.Cursor(api.user_timeline, <strong>screen_name='user'</strong>).items():</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>When a file is opened for input in Python, iterating over it returns each line as a string.</p>
<p>As such, you can really simply achieve what you want something like the following:</p>
<pre><code>with open('users.txt') as f:
    for user in f:
        for tweet in tweepy.Cursor(api.user_timeline, screen_name=user).items():
            # do something with `tweet`
</code></pre>
<p><hr/>
<strong>NOTE</strong>: being unfamiliar with <code>tweepy</code>, I'm assuming that the syntax is otherwise correct.</p>
