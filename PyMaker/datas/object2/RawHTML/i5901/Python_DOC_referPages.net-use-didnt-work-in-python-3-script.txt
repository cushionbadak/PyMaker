<p>I want to access some files in my network drive.
My network drive is called  "networkfile". If I just run this on the Window command line, it is working:  net use \networkfile\Programs. </p>
<p>However, It didn't work when I put it in the Python script (I'm using Python3). I tried:</p>
<p>a = os.system("net use O:\networkfile\Programs")</p>
<p>a = os.system("net use \networkfile\Programs")</p>
<p>a = os.system("net use \networkfile\Programs")</p>
<p>a = subprocess.run("net use O:\networkfile\Programs", shell=True, stdout=subprocess.PIPE)</p>
<p>None of those work. The error is:  "System error 67 has occurred. The network name cannot be found."</p>
<p>Anyone has experienced this before? 
Please advice.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>your string <code>"net use O:\networkfile\Programs"</code> is being evaluated by the python interpreter as:</p>
<pre><code>net use O:
etworkfile\Programs
</code></pre>
<p>because the <code>\n</code> is interpreted as a newline character. You can work around this in a couple different ways</p>
<ol>
<li><p>use a raw string (see four paragraphs down <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#string-and-bytes-literals" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>) to prevent backslashes being treated specially (in most cases).</p></li>
<li><p>escape the backslashes themselves so they evaluate to a literal backslash (make all <code>"\"</code> into <code>"\\"</code>)</p></li>
<li><p>use the <code>os.path</code> library to generate the string so the correct directory separator is used regardless of operating system.</p></li>
</ol>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>print("net use \networkfile\Programs")</code> and see what it shows you...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@juanpa.arrivillaga if it were just escaping, the third tiral would have solved the problem would it not?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Aaron um, no, <b>you</b> seem to have edited in the escaping backslashes, changing the question completely...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@juanpa.arrivillaga my bad... I just hit the auto format as code tool. I didn't know it auto inserted backslashes</span>
<span class="comment-copy">if command in Windows starts with <code>\\n</code> then in Python you have to use <code>\\\\n</code>. See <code>print('\\\\n', '\\n')</code> Or use raw string with prefix <code>r</code> - <code>print(r'\\n')</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">The double flash works.  This works for me:   a = os.system("net use \\\networkfile\\Programs")  . Thank you for all your help. I appreciate it.</span>
