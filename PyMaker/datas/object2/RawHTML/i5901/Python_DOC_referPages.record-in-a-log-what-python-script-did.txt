<p>I have the following line code in a Python script:</p>
<pre><code>sql_create_table(total_stores, "total_stores")
</code></pre>
<p>This is a function I created to upload tables to an Oracle database. I want to do something like this in order to record what tables were not created because the line failed to run:</p>
<pre><code>Try:
    sql_create_table(total_stores, "total_stores")
except:
    print in a log.txt "table x could not be created in the database"
</code></pre>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can write the log to a txt file by doing the following:</p>
<pre><code>Try:
    sql_create_table(total_stores, "total_stores")
except:
    with open('log.txt', 'a') as log:
        log.write("table x could not be created in the database")
</code></pre>
<p>Note, that by using <code>'a'</code>, we are appending to the txt file and won't be overwriting old logs. </p>

<p>There is the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">python logging module</a>, which has <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html#logging-basic-tutorial" rel="nofollow noreferrer">a good tutorial</a>, which even includes how to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html#logging-to-a-file" rel="nofollow noreferrer">log to a file</a>.</p>
<p>Very basic example:</p>
<pre><code>import logging
logging.basicConfig(filename="program.log", level=logging.INFO)
â€¦
try:

    logging.warning("table x could not be created in the database")
