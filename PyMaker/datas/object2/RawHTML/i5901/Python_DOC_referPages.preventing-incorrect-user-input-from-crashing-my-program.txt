<p>I am attempting to access a FASTA sequence from a UniProt database.  This currently works when entering the UniProt code in correctly (a 6 digit string of characters, for example P10079), however if entering an incorrect one it crashes my program.  I've attempted to write a loop so the user can re-input another code, until one is correctly entered although I'm still getting errors.  Is this because I haven't used this in a function?
Cheers</p>
<pre><code>    #Get User Input and access data from UniProt
user_input = input ("Type in your protein accession code: ")
try:
    handle = ExPASy.get_sprot_raw(user_input)
except HTTPError as e:
    user_input = input("Invalid UniProt Accession Code\nPlease enter another code:") 
else:
    record = SwissProt.read(handle)
    handle.close()
    print("Searching UniProt... \nFinding Sequence... \nChecking for matches...") 
    print (record.description)
    sequence = record.sequence
    print ("Your Fasta Sequence is: ", sequence)
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that your <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>else</code></a> statement will only executed if no exception occurs. So if the first input is invalid, i.e. causes an exception, but not the 2nd input, the whole <code>else</code> block will be skipped.</p>
<p>One of the several possibilities would be to put everything in a loop which is executed until <code>get_sprot_raw</code> succeeds and then get the sequence information.</p>
