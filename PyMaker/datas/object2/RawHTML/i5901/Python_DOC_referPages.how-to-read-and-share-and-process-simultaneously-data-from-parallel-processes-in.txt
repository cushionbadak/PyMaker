<p>Here is my issue.
I am working on a system that acquires data from three different devices (each time, I would like to launch a process that executes a "read_data" loop).</p>
<p>From the three data recorded in realtime, I would like to add a loop on top of that , that would perform an action regarding these data.</p>
<p>Ex (with an obviously really bad semantic, but that's for understanding the idea):</p>
<pre><code>Class Sensor1:
read_s1():
 data_s1 = ...
Class Sensor2:
read_s2():
 data_s2 = ...
Class Sensor3:
read_s3():
 data_s3 = ...

main:
read_s1.start()
read_s2.start()
read_s3.start()

while True: #processing and acting regarding realtime data from the three sensors
   if read_s1.data_s1/read_s2.data_s2 + read_s3.data_s3 == 2:
               #do something 
</code></pre>
<p>I tried to use threading and multiprocess, but I could not manage to launch the three threads that read and save in a variable the incoming data, then accessing when I want from an external loop to these data.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I'm going to try to be more specific:</p>
<p>I have precisely :</p>
<pre><code>thread_1:
   while not e.isSet():
         data1 = read_data1()
thread_2:
   while not e.isSet():
         data2 = read_data2()
thread_3:
   while not e.isSet():
         data3 = read_data3()

if __name__ == 'main':
      thread_1.start()
      thread_2.start()
      thread_3.start()
      while not e.isSet():
            if data1 = 2 and data2 = 3 and data3=4:
                     #do something
</code></pre>
<p>How am I suppose to use the Lock?
Each thread has a different execution time by iteration as the reading of the data has a different time for each sensor.
Thank you very much!</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You need to have  synchronization with these threads so that when all are done an iteration, it signals the main thread and the main thread countinues processing the data.
