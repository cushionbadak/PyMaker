<span class="comment-copy">You could probably use the following api or something similar to get articles related to particular keywords (like Apple) more efficiently than trying to do the requests yourself. <a href="https://newsapi.org/s/bbc-news-api" rel="nofollow noreferrer">newsapi.org/s/bbc-news-api</a></span>
