<p>I have tried many different ways, but none of them worked. If you have a solution, can you provide a step-by-step description about it?</p>

<p>Use python <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Socket</a> module. Here you can find <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_networking.htm" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Socket's documentation for Python 3.x</a>.

<span class="comment-copy">Please read the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/on-topic">how to ask</a> articles. Do you think it would be okay to put some effort into asking? Do you think it is okay to ask others to do the research? And do you think we should feed you with the answers from a silver platter? At least present us what you have tried so far.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, you can use HTTP.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">While this link may answer the question, it is better to include the essential parts of the answer here and provide the link for reference.  Link-only answers can become invalid if the linked page changes. - <a href="/review/low-quality-posts/18522860">From Review</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">But this question seems to be too broad to find essential parts of e.g. Socket module documentation.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I also think that even if the links doesn't work any longer... The used words are giving a good information to find a solution.</span>
