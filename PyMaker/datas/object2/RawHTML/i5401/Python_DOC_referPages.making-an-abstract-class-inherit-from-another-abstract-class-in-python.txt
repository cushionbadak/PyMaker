<p>Is it possible to have an abstract class inherit abstract methods from another abstract class in python?</p>
<p>If so, how should I do this? </p>

<p>Have a look at <code>abc</code> module. For 2.7: <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/abc.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">link</a>. For 3.6: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/abc.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">link</a>
Simple example for you:</p>
<pre><code>from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class A(ABC):
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        super().__init__()

    @abstractmethod
    def do_something(self):
        pass


class B(A):
    @abstractmethod
    def do_something_else(self):
        pass

class C(B):
    def do_something(self):
        pass

    def do_something_else(self):
        pass
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">OK. My IDE (PyCharm) was complaining that I hadn't provided implementations for all abstract methods from class A in class B. I suppose I should just ignore those warnings, or is there some way to force it to recognise that class B is another abstract class?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You need to provide implementations for ALL abstract methods if will you need to create an instance afterwards</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes. I need to provide implementations for all abstract methods in class C since it is a concrete class. However, I want to code class B in such a way that IDEs understand that it is an abstract class (just as IDEs understand inheritance with interfaces in Java). If it isn't possible, I may as well just ignore the warning.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">In other words, my IDE shows a warning for class B in your code whilst it doesn't for class C.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Don't understand that behavior of ur IDE. I'm on VS Code now and do not see any warnings. The code above work for me like a charm</span>
