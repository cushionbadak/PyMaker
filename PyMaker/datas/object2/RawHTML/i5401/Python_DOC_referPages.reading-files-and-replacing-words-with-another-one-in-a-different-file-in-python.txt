<p>I have two text files, hostname1 and command_file1.</p>
<p>Hostname1 would be:</p>
<pre><code>[Host1]
dfwm2
dwm1-su2
[Host2]
cisb1
cisb2
[Othe]
b4
b8
</code></pre>
<p>command_file1 would be:</p>
<pre><code>[1]
edit
run show 
exit
show  et-0/0/0 brief
show adjacency
show oamtest
edit
run 
</code></pre>
<p>What I need to do is:</p>
<p>I need to replace [1] in Command_file1 with dfwm2 and then print the following lines like 'edit,run show,exit, etc' then again replace the [1] with dwm1-su2 and print the next lines.</p>
<p>What I did is: </p>
<p>I first read the Hostname1.txt and saved it in a dictionary:</p>
<pre><code>def read_hosts(filename):
# Read the filename and store file content in a variable as list of lines. Variable - file_cont
hosts=collections.OrderedDict()
key=''
value=[]
with open(filename) as f:
    lines = f.read().splitlines()
    for line in lines:
    #if '[' in line and ']' in line:
        if line.startswith('[') and line.endswith(']'):
            key = line[1:-1]
            value = []
            hosts[key]=value
return hosts
</code></pre>
<p>The o/p that I am getting is </p>
<pre><code>{'Host2': ['cisb1', 'cisb2'], 'Host1': ['dfwm2', 'dwm1-su2'], 'Others': ['b4', 'b8']}
</code></pre>
<p>Any idea how to do it?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Since you didn't use the headers in the host file, I simply ignored lines that start with '[' in this code and return a list of values instead of a dict. If you do need the keep the headers from the file it would not be hard to change this code to support that.</p>
<p>The key here really is just using the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.replace" rel="nofollow noreferrer">str.replace</a> function. If you have control over the format of the input files you might have more success using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.format" rel="nofollow noreferrer">str.format</a> or <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/string.html#string-formatting" rel="nofollow noreferrer">string formatting</a>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You set <code>value = []</code> and <code>hosts[key] = value</code>??? You need to reindent your post code.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hi @liliscent the value gets set to the next box as soon as it encounters a new box (if there is any). Thats why its value=[ ].</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The code you posted will return a trivial dict, the value of every key is <code>[]</code>, not to mention the indentation error. If you just want to replace [1] in second file by every host name in the first file, you can simply skip all rows containing '['.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hi @liliscent I have changed the dictionary to be an oredered dict, changed in the code as well, and in this function I am only returning the hostfile values. Thanks.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why do you need to load the hostnames into a dict? If you're not using the headings (parts in '[]') just skip them?</span>
