<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I am a bit of a newcomer and am pouring through some tutorials like water from a firehose when I encountered an acquaintance post something on social media that looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>print(
    [format(x, "c") for x in range(32,127)]
)
</code></pre>
<p>Now, I went and ran the code and was perplexed to see it print out a large set of varying characters. I tried to skip ahead to some tutorials talking about format and also perused the site: <a href="https://pyformat.info/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://pyformat.info/</a> to no avail. </p>
<p>Any pointers would be greatly appreciated.
Cheers!</p>

<p>To be fair, running help(format) in the Python terminal doesn't give a lot of insight into what format() does. The official documentation page, specifically Section 7.1.3.1. of the following link goes into a lot more detail: <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html</a></p>
<p>format(x, 'c') converts the integer (x for x in range(32,127)) to the corresponding unicode character before printing. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/methods/built-in/format" rel="nofollow noreferrer">This should help you understand format</a></p>
<p>Basically, your code prints every character with an Unicode value between 32 and 127.</p>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>format(x, "c")</code> does the same as <code>chr(x)</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You might want to type "ASCII" to your favorite search engine.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I think the reason people are voting you down is that your question title is ambiguous. It's a question about python and <code>format</code>, which you tagged, but the title itself is a mystery (and folks are feeling crotchety, I guess). Be a little more descriptive in the title, and you should be golden!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm wondering if it's the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">list comprehension</a> that's actually the point of confusion, or at least a contributor.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hey Erekalper, I'm not fussed. While I agree that the title may be ambiguous, I think we have all been at the point where a concept was so new that we don't even know how to phrase a question properly. Oh well, I tried to point out that I looked into this problem myself. Alas! The community remains as astute as I remember it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This was the type of documentation I sorely needed! Thank you, sir! And apologies to all whos time I may have squandered.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Except that "c" formats the value as the "Corresponding <a href="http://www.unicode.org/charts/nameslist/index.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><i>Unicode</i></a> character". You have to be cautious when talking about ASCII; it is rare or highly specialized and many people might not know of itâ€”besides being irrelevant to the question.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Tom Thanks for pointing out</span>
