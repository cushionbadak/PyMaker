<p>These are the remaining keys of sys.modules with all things at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/py-modindex.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/py-modindex.html</a> and modules starting with _* removed.</p>
<p>mpl_toolkits  # is part of matplotlib</p>
<p>zope  # zope</p>
<p>I'm running Python 3.6.4 on OSX. There are no cython, matplotlib, zope references in .profile and no PYTHONSTARTUP environment variable in .profile. They still appear after starting python with -s.</p>
<p>Cython, matplotlib, zope are installed packages I want to keep but I am not importing them. How can I find what is causing these modules to be imported?</p>
<p>Edit:
Removed genericpath from above list per @user2357112</p>
<p>EDIT2: </p>
<p>They do not appear with -S flag per @wim</p>
<p>There are references in the output of -v flag suggested by @wim</p>
<p>though they appear to be comments. I still would like to know how these are being called.</p>
<p>The line before and after the mpl_toolkits and zope are included.</p>
<pre><code>import 'importlib.util' # &lt;_frozen_importlib_external.SourceFileLoader object at 0x1022a6940&gt;

<span class="comment-copy"><code>genericpath</code> is an internal part of the standard library, not part of Cython. (It's most of the os-independent parts of <code>os.path</code>.)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You mentioned <code>-s</code> flag but more interesting is <code>-S</code> flag (uppercase S).  Do they still appear with disabling the site import?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">They do not appear with the -S flag. They are in site_packages. I do not see how they are being called.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Good point. They do appear as comments in this output. I've pasted it in the main entry.</span>
