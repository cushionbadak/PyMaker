<p>I'm trying to use <code>logging.basicConfig</code> to log everything and <code>logging.hanlers.RotatingFileHandler</code> to have a <code>maxBytes=1000000</code> and <code>backupCount=5</code>.
The problem is that when I use <code>RotatingFileHandler</code> it'll log some duplicate outputs as well.
I tried removing <code>basicConfig</code> and only using <code>RotatingFileHandler</code> but it didn't log every message I wanted.</p>
<p>example:</p>
<pre><code>logging.basicConfig(format=f, datefmt=date, level=lvl, filename=file_name)
handler = logging.handlers.RotatingFileHandler(file_name, maxBytes=1000000, backupCount=5)
logging.getLogger('').addHandler(handler)
</code></pre>
<p>I changed that to remove <code>basicConfig</code> by:</p>
<pre><code>handler = logging.handlers.RotatingFileHandler(file_name, maxBytes=1000000, backupCount=5)
handler.setFormatter(f)
handler.setLevel(lvl)
logging.getLogger('').addHandler(handler)
</code></pre>
<p>The above didn't work as <code>RotatingFileHandler</code> didn't log every message that I wanted. Why?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The logger that you get from <code>logging.getLogger('')</code> has its logging level set by default to <code>logging.WARNING</code>. You need to set the desired level on the logger itself as well as on each handler you associate with it to ensure you log the desired messages. Your second code snippet sets the level for the handler but not the logger.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Could be a bug; you may need to manually create a minimum example (which may be hard) to actually demonstrate this issue. Also see <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9975609/python-timedrotatingfilehandler-logs-are-missing" title="python timedrotatingfilehandler logs are missing">stackoverflow.com/questions/9975609/â€¦</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">thanks doing that seemed to have worked (formats different but I can probably fix that) but why do I have to set the level on both the logger and the handler?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">A common pattern is to have multiple handlers on a single logger with different levels. For example you might want to print only ERROR level messages to the console, but include INFO or DEBUG information in your logfile. Other use cases may want to change the logging level for all log messages by just setting the level on the logger. I do question the decision to make WARNING the default level for loggers while INFO is the default level for handlers... that tends to make things confusing.</span>
