<p>Taking a video game design course and I've never had to use python before so I am very confused... I am tasked with the following : </p>
<p>read in the CSV file into Python and store its contents as a list of lists
(or 2D list/array). To do so, you will make use of the CSV[1] library.
The reading of the CSV file should be done as its own function - please create a function called readCSV(...)
that takes in the file name as the argument and returns the 2D list. </p>
<p>As mentionned I have no previous coding experience with python. I have managed to do this so far and would greatly appreciate some support. </p>
<pre><code>import csv

# reading each row and printing it 
def readCSV(fileName): 
    TwoDimList = []
    with open(fileName, 'r') as f:
        r = csv.reader(f, delimiter=',')
        for row in r:


entities = readCSV('entities.csv')              
print(entities)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Just append each row (which is a list of columns values) to your 2d list and return it in the end:</p>
<pre><code>def readCSV(fileName): 
    two_dim_list = []  # snake case ftw (PEP8)
    with open(fileName, 'r') as f:
        r = csv.reader(f, delimiter=',')
        # next(r)  # skip header line if necessary
        for row in r:
            two_dim_list.append(row)
    return two_dim_list
</code></pre>
<p>The short version of that is:</p>
<pre><code>def readCSV(fileName): 
    with open(fileName, 'r') as f:
        r = csv.reader(f, delimiter=',')
        # next(r)  # skip header line
        return list(r)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can just call <code>list</code> on the reader to get the full 2d list:</p>
<pre><code>def read_csv(file_name):
    with open(file_name) as f:
        return list(csv.reader(f))
</code></pre>
<p>This works because <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.reader" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>csv.reader</code> is an iterable</a>.</p>
