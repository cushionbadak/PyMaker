<p>I'm having trouble storing data minus the header into a new file. I don't understand Python enough to debug. </p>
<p>Ultimately, I'd like to extract data from each file and store into one main csv file rather than opening each file individually, while copying and pasting everything into the main csv file I would like.</p>
<p>My code is as follows:</p>
<pre><code>       import csv, os

# os.makedirs() command will create a folder titled in green or in apostrophies
os.makedirs('HeaderRemoved', exist_ok=True)

# Loop through every file in the current working directory.
for csvFilename in os.listdir('directory'):
    if not csvFilename.endswith('.csv'):
        continue #skips non-csv files
    print('Removing header from ' + csvFilename + '...')

    ### Read the CSV file in (skipping first Row)###

csvRows = []
csvFileObj = open(csvFilename)
readerObj = csv.reader(csvFileObj)
for row in readerObj:
    if readerObj.line_num == 1:
        continue # skips first row
    csvRows.append(row)
print (csvRows) #-----------&gt;Check to see if it has anything stored in array
csvFileObj.close()

    #Todo: Write out the CSV file
csvFileObj = open(os.path.join('HeaderRemoved', 'directory/mainfile.csv'), 'w',
                  newline='')
csvWriter = csv.writer(csvFileObj)
for row in csvRows:
    csvWriter.writerow(row)
csvFileObj.close()
</code></pre>
<p>The csv files that are being "scanned" or "read" have text and numbers. I do not know if this might be preventing the script from properly "reading" and storing the data into the csvRow array.</p>

<p>The problem comes from you reusing the same variable when you loop over your file names. See the documentation for <code>listdir</code>, it returns a list of filenames. Then your <code>newfile</code> isn't really pointing to the file anymore, but 
to a string filename from the directory.

<pre><code>with open(scancsvFile, 'w') as newfile:
    array = []
    #for row in scancsvFile
    for newfile in os.listdir('directory'): # &lt;---- you're reassigning the variable newfile here
        if newfile.line_num == 1:
            continue
        array.append(lines)
newfile.close()
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">and what's the fixed code then?</span>
