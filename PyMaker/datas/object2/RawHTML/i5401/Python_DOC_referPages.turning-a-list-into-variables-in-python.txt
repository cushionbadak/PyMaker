<p>When I use .readlines(), it gives me a list, can I separate this list into individual variables?</p>

<p>You can call <code>enumerate()</code> over a generator within the context manager and go to specific lines. For example, if you know the line number or perhaps build a dictionary of Q&amp;A for even lines:</p>
<pre><code>with open(myfile, 'r') as f:
    q_a = {}
    for num, line in enumerate(line for line in f):
        if num % 2 = 0:
            question = line
        else:
            q_a[question] = line
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">I think this question is more about how to assign a variable in Python, or how you iterate over a list.</span>
