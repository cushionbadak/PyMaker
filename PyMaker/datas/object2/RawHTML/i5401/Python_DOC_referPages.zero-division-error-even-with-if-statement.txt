<p>My teacher told me to use an if statement to get rid of the Zero Division error but all I see in the internet is function that counters it not an if statement.</p>

<p>If you're using an <code>if</code> statement, but you're not <code>return</code>ing anything, the code after it will still be executed.
You can avoid that by wrapping the rest of your related code in an <code>else</code> as mentioned by @Stephen Rauch..</p>
<p>FYI: <em>Common mistake while beginning to learn programming,</em> <code>print</code> <em>and</em> <code>return</code> <em>are</em> <strong>not</strong> <em>the same.</em></p>
<p>Alternatively, you can handle the <code>ZeroDivisionError</code> using a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">try/except</a></p>
<pre><code>......
y = y2 - y1
x = x2 - x1

try:
    # not sure what this does
    yx = y/x
    yx = int (slope) # I'm assuming you have slope defined somewhere
    print ("%d"%yx)
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print ("Undefined")
</code></pre>
<p>NB: This only handles for ZeroDivisionError. For more info on error handling, visit the link above</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>An <code>else</code> would useful here:</p>
<pre><code>if x == 0:
    print("Undefined")
else: 
    yx = y/x
    yx = int (slope)

    if yx != 0:
        print ("%d"%yx)
    else:
        print ("Undefined")
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>As @Stephen Rauch mentioned you can chose to go with else block or you can put <code>!=</code> check in if block (if negative values are allowed) :</p>
<pre><code>if x != 0:
    yx = y/x
    rest of your code
</code></pre>
<p>Here are some examples.</p>
<p>We took x equals to 0:</p>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pM4VA.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img alt="with x == 0" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pM4VA.png"/></a></p>
<p>We took x not equal to 0:</p>

<span class="comment-copy">What is <code>slope</code> supposed to be?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I guess it is <code>slope = y/x</code> and then <code>yx = int (slope)</code>. And also it will be better if you cahnge the datatype of slope to float.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">A print doesn't end the execution, so it keeps running through past the if statement. Either use an else statement or kill the program in some other way.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ahhh yeah. Somebody answered this question already. I learned that a print doesn't end the execution. I will use else statement next time. Thanks for the info. I got rid of yx = int (slope). I was just making extra sure that I know slope is a integer and not a string. Well I now know it's an integer because it's not enclosed in parentheses and is result of division with integers. Now how do I close the question?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You can delete the question.  There is a flag under the question text.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This worked wonderfully. I don't know how my teacher will accept this though. I will tell him I got it from stack overflow as he said that we should try to learn from internet too. :D</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This worked?  No...  There is an undefined variable in this code...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@StephenRauch has a good point! I am only assuming that you forgot to add the definition of <code>slope</code> to the snippet you posted @CateDoge</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes. I just added this to my previous code. :D Also I'm at a loss on how to close this subject. I can't delete it because people have put time and effort here.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I added that to the previous code. It still doesn't work.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is the instruction. Write a program prompting the user to enter x and y-coordinates of two points on the XY-plane, that is x1, y1, x2, and y2. The program calculates the slope of the line with formula (y2-y1)/(x2-x1).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">As an FYI: The statement <i>it still doesn't work</i> is not terribly illuminative.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">FYI2:  The assignment was actually pretty obvious...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm sorry but we're not there yet. We're at the basics right now. :D Thanks for answering though.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is also basic mate. You are checking for "equal to" and != is "not equal to". or put code you want to execute if x is "not equal to 0" in the "else" block.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">please see the images, hope that helps</span>
