<p>As the title suggests, I'm looking for a way of generating a Random number between 1000000 and 9999999 if 7 is entered and similarly if any other number is entered</p>

<p>I don't quite understand what you mean by</p>
<blockquote>
<p>if 7 is entered and similarly if any other number is entered</p>
</blockquote>
<p>but what I can tell you is that the following Python snippet will generate a randomized number between your two numbers. </p>
<pre><code>    from random import randint
    print(randint(1000000, 9999999))
</code></pre>
<p>If you're at loss as to how the snippet works you can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.randint" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this</a> to read up on Python functions for integers and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html#submodules" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this</a> to read up on submodule importing in the Python docmentation</p>
