<p>I am able to do this, but the format of the output isn't what I want.</p>

<p>Here is my code (I used some formatting but it's still not giving me the desired output):</p>
<pre><code>for line in open("sample.txt"):

      strsales=line.split()[-2]
      item=line.split('\t')[3]
      itemsales=item+"{0:&gt;33}".format(strsales)
      print(itemsales)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This line:</p>
<pre><code>itemsales=item+"{0:&gt;33}".format(strsales)
</code></pre>
<p>is padding out the <em>number</em> to 33 positions. But the length of <code>item</code> is variable, and that is causing your alignment to go out. Look closely and you will see that the unevenness in row 1 and row 2 is 2 positions, and that is exactly the difference in length between <code>Men's Clothing</code> and <code>Women's Clothing</code>. You need to pad out <em>both</em> variables to a constant number of positions. Try this</p>
<pre><code>itemsales = "{0:&lt;33}{1:&gt;18}".format(item,strsales)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Thank you! This worked for me.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@BoarGules How to get that aligned number dynamic as a variable?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Like this: <code>itemsales = "{item:&lt;33}{strsales:&gt;{dynamicwidth}}".format(item=item,strsales=strsales,dynamicwidth=18)</code>. Full details at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#formatspec" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#formatspec</a>. But you shouldn't ask supplementary questions in a comment like this. They generally won't be read except by the author of the original answer. If that person has moved on you won't get a response.</span>
