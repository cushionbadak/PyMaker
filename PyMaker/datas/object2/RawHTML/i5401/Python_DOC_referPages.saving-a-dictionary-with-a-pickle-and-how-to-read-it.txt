<p>I am having trouble trying to save a dictionary using pickle in python:
my code is the following:</p>
<pre><code>import re
import os

def save_obj(outputFolder,obj, name ):
    directory = outputFolder + ' obj/'
    if not os.path.exists(directory):
        os.makedirs(directory)
    with open(directory + name + '.pkl', 'wb') as f:
            pickle.dump(obj, f, pickle.HIGHEST_PROTOCOL)
</code></pre>
<p>The Error message is the following:</p>
<pre><code>File "CleanPEPS.py", line 14, in save_obj
pickle.dump(obj, f, pickle.HIGHEST_PROTOCOL)
NameError: name 'pickle' is not defined
</code></pre>
<p>It is a problem of library or something like that? Or there is something that I have forgotten?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You're missing <code>import pickle</code>. Other than that your code looks OK. If you have any more issues check out the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">pickle docs</a>.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">You probably havent set-up/ imported the library right</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Its saving but it is putting a <code>txt.pkl</code> with it why? If its forced to save as <code>pkl</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Because that is the file name you're specifying... <code>with open(directory + name + '.pkl', 'wb') as f:</code>. The file name can be whatever you want.</span>
