<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I am trying to clean a dataset and while doing so I came across a column named "production_companies" with about a 1000 values. This column contains unnecessary symbols for example: The column values are like this <code>[{name: 'Pixar', id:"3}]</code>.
I wish to remove the unnecessary symbols like: " {} [] , the text values "name" and "id" as well as the integers. </p>
<pre><code>list1=[]

list1= data.production_companies

for i in list1:

    re.sub('\d+','',list1)
</code></pre>
<p>The problem is that <code>re.sub</code> does not accept list as a parameter. It only accepts a string as an input parameter.
I need to use a list to store the <code>production_companies</code> values and iterate through it using a for loop because there are many values in the column and I need to remove the symbols and unnecessary text from all of them at once.</p>
<p>Can anyone please tell me what should I do?</p>
<p>Thanks a lot </p>

<p>You can use a <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">list comprehension</a> to create a new list from an existing one.</p>
<pre><code>list2 = [re.sub('\d+', '', item) for item in list1]
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">You better parse it with a JSON parser.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">"columns"? Are you using a <code>pandas.DataFrame</code>? Please provide a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve">Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">I have imported the data from a csv file and the data is stored in the following format for the production_companies column in csv.:  [{name: 'Pixar', id:"3}]. I am totally new to python so I don't have an in-depth knowledge about the different ways in which this can be done</span>

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks Mark. I will try doing that. But as far as I know re.sub() only accepts string as an input parameter. That's the error which I got</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Manila, you should really learn the basics of the Python programming language. Especially what a list comprehension is, and why it doesn't really make any sense for <code>re.sub</code> to take a list when list comprehension exist.</span>
