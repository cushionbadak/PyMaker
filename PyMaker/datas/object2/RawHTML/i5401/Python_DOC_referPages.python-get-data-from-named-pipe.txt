<p>How do I read from a named pipe in Python 3.5.3?</p>
<p>The pipe's name and location is <code>/tmp/shairport-sync-metadata</code> and it can be viewed by anybody, but only modified by the <code>shairport-sync</code> user.
Other websites and questions say to use <code>os.mkfifo("pipe-location")</code> but I've been getting this error:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import os
&gt;&gt;&gt; os.mkfifo("/tmp/shairport-sync-metadata")

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;pyshell#1&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
    os.mkfifo("/tmp/shairport-sync-metadata")
FileExistsError: [Errno 17] File exists
</code></pre>
<p>Is there a way to get around this? Sorry for the nooby question.</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.mkfifo" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>os.mkfifo</code></a> is used to <strong>create</strong> fifo. Use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>open</code></a> to open/read fifo already exist:</p>
<pre><code>with open('/tmp/shairport-sync-metadata') as f:   # add `rb` for binary mode

    for line in f:
        print(line)

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks! How stupid of me :P One thing I noticed was when I started a song, the metadata was split into 3 lines per item. This is just probably a shairport-sync thing, but it'll mean I'll have to join the strings together when I parse them. +1 and accepted.</span>
