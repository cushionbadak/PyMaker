<p>Say you have a word "Aabrakadaabra" and what you want to do is find the repeating characters and replace them with a single one. which in our case should return "Abrakadabra".</p>
<p>what i did was <code>re.sub(r"([a-zA-z])\1",r"\1","Aabrakadaabra")</code> which returns 'Aabrakadabra' and this regex cannot catch when there is an uppercase and a lowercase repeating. Im not sure if there is an easy, one liner way to do this but any help would be educative.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; re.sub(r"([a-zA-z])\1",r"\1","Aabrakadaabra", flags=re.IGNORECASE)
'Abrakadabra'
