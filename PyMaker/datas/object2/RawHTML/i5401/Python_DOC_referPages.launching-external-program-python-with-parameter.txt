os.system('"E:/Bootdrv/AlohaTs/Bin/grind.exe /yesterday"')

<span class="comment-copy">① What did you try? ② What did you expect to observe? ③ What did you observe instead?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What doesn't work with what you've got so far? Try to describe what you expect to happen, what you see happening, and post any error messages you get.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Maybe <code>os.system('E:/Bootdrv/AlohaTs/Bin/grind.exe /%s' % yesterday)</code> is what you want?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Try <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@hspandher, I don't think OP is trying to parse arguments, they're trying to pass arguments to a different process.</span>
