<p>I have a question regarding stretching shapes by using a constant in python. I am very beginner so novice code would help me extremely. </p>
<p>For example lets just say I wanted to create a square as such:</p>
<pre><code>_________
|       |
|       |
|       |
|_______|
</code></pre>
<p>Its not perfect but you get the point. So what I would like to do from here is have a constant labeled at the top of my program called something like, "WIDTH" and so Whenever I set the width to a different number the square will either expand or shrink depending on what the constant is set at.</p>
<p>So WIDTH = 3 
or WIDTH = 5 ---&gt; This one will be larger than the WIDTH at 3. </p>
<p>Can someone please demonstrate this with novice code, that would be greatly appreciated, thank you!</p>

<p>In python, a string is a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#common-sequence-operations" rel="nofollow noreferrer">sequence</a>. A sequence can be multiplied by an integer, yielding a sequence containing as many repetitions of the original sequence: try<br/>
<code>'abc' * 3</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>'abcabcabc'</code> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This works for underscores and spaces just the same ...</p>

<span class="comment-copy">So I guess you can't do ascii art so my drawing of a square may or may not appear to actually show but its just a simple 4x4 for the explanation</span>
