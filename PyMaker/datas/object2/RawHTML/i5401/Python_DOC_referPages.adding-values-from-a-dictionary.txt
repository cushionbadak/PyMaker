<p>I would like to know how can I, using a <code>raw_input</code> command, pick out the values of two user chosen keys to add together? </p>
<p>What I have attempted is:</p>
<pre><code>dict = {"one" : 1, "two" : 2, "three" : 3}

Total = Sum(v for v in dict.values() if raw_input1 and raw_input2 in dict) 
</code></pre>
<p>I did borrow that line from another thread but can't figure out how to shape it the way I need to.
All the above achieves is the sum of everything in the dictionary instead of the 2 the user picks. </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>dict = {"one" : 1, "two" : 2, "three" : 3}
total = dict[raw_input1] + dict[raw_input2]
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>You are making this much more difficult than necessary. I suggest writing the steps out in words, then translating the words into Python. For example:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get the first key from the user</li>
<li>Get the second key from the user</li>
<li>Get the first value from the dictionary</li>
<li>Get the second value from the dictionary</li>
<li>Add the two values together</li>
<li>Print the result</li>
</ol>

<span class="comment-copy">Where did you declare <code>raw_input1</code> and <code>raw_input2</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sorry, was saving space so I didn't write that bit out. Figured people might have guessed by Raw_1 and Raw_2. I'll be clearer next time.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I appreciate that you want to keep your code example as minimal as you can. At the same time, it must be complete. Don't leave anything for others to guess.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Please give your expression <code>if a and b in x</code> a second thought. It does not, what you think it does. Also, please refrain from naming a dictionary <code>dict</code>. You shadow a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">built-in function</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Piinthesky.  Right, thanks.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ok, thank you for the help.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Black90 When the site allows it, please accept the answer which you find the most helpful.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Is that your way of telling me not to thank people individually or just letting me know how the forum works?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Just telling you the expectations we have in this community. Written thanks are great, too! (p.s. Some of our members get upset when this is called a "forum." I think the preferred classification is "Q&amp;A site".)</span>
