<p>IÂ´m trying to write a python interface with C-API for my application.<br/>
I can create a module and add procedures and import them in the python context. Then I can run python scripts to access the module and procedures.</p>
<p>I would like to use a key to access data like:<br/>
module.someVar['key'] = value<br/>
or <br/>
print(module.someVar['key'])<br/></p>
<p>Then I would like to use the key and the data in a proceure in the C-Code.<br/>
What procedure is called in the pyTypeObject?</p>
<p>Edit: SomeVar is a variable of a type which it seems like I have to create. 
And yes, after the comments, it is a dict-like object. 
It seems that the first answer points me right point, I am currently testing it.</p>

<p>I think you are looking for <code>__getitem__</code> and <code>__setitem__</code></p>
<p>eg:</p>
<pre><code>class C:
    def __getitem__(self, item):
        print(f"a['{item}'] called")

    def __setitem__(self, item, value):
        print(f"a['{item}'] = {value} called")

a = A()
a["get"]
&gt;&gt; a['get'] called
a["set"] = 0
&gt;&gt; a['set'] = 0 called
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">What is <code>someVar</code>? Is its type a type you wrote?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">that sounds like a dict object</span>
<span class="comment-copy">So you want to define a dictionary like object in an extension module? If that is what you want please edit your question to make it clear.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That's not how it works from the C side, though.</span>
