<p>I see I can color things using <code>colorama</code> and <code>termcolor</code>.</p>
<p>I'd like to color my numbers using Python formatters:</p>
<pre><code>print("My value is %.2f" % value)
</code></pre>
<p>where the number is green if <code>value &gt; 0</code> otherwise red.</p>
<p>What's the most pythonic way to achieve this?</p>

<p>I don't believe there's anything you can easier/better that colorama or custom wrapper (take a look for this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/287871/print-in-terminal-with-colors">question</a> for reference).</p>
<p>The reason is that python doesn't have great extensibility with string templates/formatting. Terminal output should be escape sequences, and there's no other way around, so you need to modify your output somehow.</p>
<p>One-timer with f-strings may me like:</p>
<pre><code>print(f'Value is {OKGREEN if value &gt; 0 else FAIL} {value}')
</code></pre>
<p>If your case allows this, perfect thing would be encapsulating logic to value class (roughly, if you can use subclass of int/float), so you can provide <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__format__" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>__format__</code></a> spec with support for coloring.</p>
<p>If you cant, you'll probably end up with wrapper around print.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Hold on - that isn't right. I already know how to color things in terminal. This is a question about string formatters.</span>
