<p>I need to use both python2.7 and python3.6 for a task. I used conda to create two python envs. I know how to use a shell script to control the code running and switch between different envs. Say I need to run python2.7 code first, then I run python 3.6. My question is could I first run python 2.7 code, and then in the python 2.7 code, I directly activate the python3.6 conda env, and run the python 3.6 code? </p>

<p>For your task maybe it is enough to change the environment just calling the shell from python using:</p>
<pre><code>your python 2.7 code

os.system("Command to change your kernel")  

your python 3.6 code
</code></pre>
<p>Maybe you need to add some extra code to take the outputs or new inputs if there are
and continue running the code.</p>
<p>If that doesn't work maybe is easier to call the python 3.6 function direct from the command:</p>
<pre><code>os.system("python3 '/function36.py' ")
</code></pre>
<p>Or also using the function <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">subprocess.call</a> from your 2.7 code:</p>
<pre><code>return_code = subprocess.call("python3 '/function36.py'", shell=True)  
</code></pre>
<p>Using Python 3.6 you can also use the subprocess.run()</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Why do you want to do that?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why don't you just (back-)port the code?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Because some dependency only has python2.x version..</span>
