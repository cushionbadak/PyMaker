<p>I am trying to write a game that generates a random integer and the user has to guess it.</p>
<p>The problem is that if the user input is not a digit it crashes. So I tried to use <code>isdigit</code>, and it works at the beginning, but if the user decides to input not a number after the first input was a digit, it still crashes. I don't know how to make it check <code>isdigit</code> for every input.</p>
<pre><code>import random
x =(random.randint(0,100))
print("The program draws a number from 0 to 100. Try to guess it!")

a = input("enter a number:")
while a.isdigit() == False :
    print("It is not a digit")
    a = input("enter a number:")
if a.isdigit() == True :
    a = int(a)
while a != x :
    if a &lt;= x :
        print("too less")
        a = input("enter a number:")
    elif a &gt;= x :
        print("too much")
        a = input("enter a number")
if a == x :
    print("good")
</code></pre>

<p>I would suggest doing the following:</p>
<pre><code>completed = False
while not completed:
   a = input("enter a number: ")
   if a.isdigit():
      a = int(a)
      if a &lt; x:
         print("too little")
      elif a &gt; x:
         print("too much")
      else:
         print("good")
         completed = True
   else:
      print("It is not a digit")
</code></pre>

<p>If your code crashed because the user entered not a number, then either make sure the user enters a number, or handle an error while trying to compare it with a number.</p>
<p>You could go over all chars in the input and ensure that they are all digits.</p>
<p>Or you could use a <code>try/except</code> mechanism. That is, try to convert to the numerical type you wish the user to enter and handle any error throwen. Check this post:</p>

<p>The typical pythonic way to tackle that would be to "ask for forgiveness instead of looking before you leap". In concrete terms, try to parse the input as <code>int</code>, and catch any errors:</p>
<pre><code>try:
    a = int(input('Enter a number: '))
except ValueError:
    print('Not a number')
</code></pre>
<p>Beyond that, the problem is obviously that you're doing the careful checking once at the start of the program, but not later on when asking for input again. Try to reduce the places where you ask for input and check it to one place, and write a loop to repeat it as often as necessary:</p>
<pre><code>while True:
    try:
        a = int(input('Enter a number: '))
    except ValueError:  # goes here if int() raises an error
        print('Not a number')
        continue  # try again by restarting the loop

    if a == x:
        break  # end the loop
    elif a &lt; x:
        print('Too low')
    else:
        print('Too high')


print('Congratulations')
</code></pre>

<pre><code># user vs randint

import random
computer = random.randint(0,100)
while True:
    try:
        user = int(input(" Enter a number : "))
    except (ValueError,NameError):
        print(" Please enter a valid number ")
    else:
        if user == computer:
            print(" Wow .. You win the game ")
            break
        elif user &gt; computer:
            print(" Too High ")
        else:
            print(" Too low ")

I think this can solve the issues.

<p>In your code you want to check whether the user has input no or string since your not using int() in your input it will take input as string and furthur in your code it wont be able to check for &lt;= condition </p>
<h2>for checking input no is string or no</h2>
<p>code:-</p>
<pre><code>a = input ("Enter no")
try:
   val = int(a)
   print("Yes input string is an Integer.")
   print("Input number value is: ", a)
except ValueError:
   print("It is not integer!")
   print(" It's a string")
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>also you can check the eval of the inputed string with eval function</p>
<pre><code>completed = False
while not completed:
   a = input("enter a number: ")
   if type(eval(a)) == int:
      a = int(a)
      if a &lt; x:
         print("too little")
      elif a &gt; x:
         print("too much")

         print("good")
         completed = True
   else:
      print("It is not a digit")

<p>You probably will have to learn how to do functions and write your own input function.</p>
<pre><code>def my_input(prompt):
   val = input(prompt)
   if val.isdigit():
      return val
   else:
      print('not a number')
      # return my_input(prompt)

<span class="comment-copy">on which line does code crash</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The pythonic way to do that would be to simply try it and catch any exception, instead of double checking before attempting it. I.e. <code>try: a = int(a) except ValueError: # ask user again</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@TalhaIsrar it returns " Traceback (most recent call last):   File "zl.py", line 14, in &lt;module&gt;     a = int(input("podaj liczbÄ™:")) ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'g' " when i type g</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Its a simple error as you are trying to convert "g" which is a string to an integer which gives a value error</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is not the answer to the OP's question</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@TalhaIsrar The post says: "i dont know how to make it check isdigit for every input."</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is still not the answer plz read the explaination. this should have been a comment</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Well, that sounds interesting. I'm a newbie so, could you explain to me what do you mean by ValueError? i'm opening a code in powershell so shall i just copy there a error that occurs?</span>
