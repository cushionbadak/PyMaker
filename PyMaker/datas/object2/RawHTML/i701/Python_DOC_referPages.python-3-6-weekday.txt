<p><a href="https://www.journaldev.com/23365/python-string-to-datetime-strptime" rel="nofollow noreferrer">See explanation</a> of <code>datetime.strptime</code></p>
<pre><code>from datetime import datetime 

date_string = '20180104 06:09:36.234'
date = datetime.strptime(date_string, '%Y%m%d %H:%M:%S.%f')
print(date.isoweekday())  # 4
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Finally worked it out by various combinations of functions:
Identify year, month, date,
Convert to integer,
Use datetime module.</p>
<pre><code>import datetime
DateTime = '20180104 06:09:36.234'
Weekday =  datetime.date(int(DateTime[0:4]), int(DateTime[5:6]), 
int(DateTime[7:8])).weekday()
print("Weekday = " ,  Weekday)
</code></pre>
<p>Weekday = 3</p>
<p>Is there a better way??</p>

<span class="comment-copy">doesn't that give 4 because it's the fourth day in January instead of the fourth day in the week? Better us <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.date.isoweekday" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>date.isoweekday()</code></a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ahh yes, misread the question. I'll update @MaartenFabré</span>
<span class="comment-copy">if he wants 4 for Thursday (and 7 for Sunday), you better use <code>isoweekday</code> instead of ´weekday´</span>
