<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I am reading from a csv file and printing to console in Python. The first printed line is including some odd characters at the beginning of the string. The file in its entirety is:</p>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/T2s7B.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img alt="csv example" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/T2s7B.png"/></a></p>
<p>My code is:</p>
<pre><code>import csv

with open("C:\\Users\\user\\key.csv") as file:
    reader = csv.reader(file)
    for row in reader:
        print(row)
</code></pre>
<p>the output is:</p>
<pre><code>['ï»¿john', '12345']
['jacob', '23456']
['jingle', '34567']
['heimer', '45678']
</code></pre>
<p>I do not know where the "ï»¿" in the first line is coming from.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The "ï»" is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark" rel="nofollow noreferrer">byte order mark (BOM)</a>, which is used at the beginning of some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Unicode</a> files or streams to indicate the "endianness" of multi-byte encoding variants (UTF-16 or UTF-32), or, like in this case, to indicate that the file is using UTF-8. Using a BOM at the beginning of a UTF-8 file is optional, but some applications -- like Microsoft Excel -- will use a BOM to indicate that the file is using UTF-8.</p>
<p>If you're using Python 3 and you know that your file will be using UTF-8, you should be able to just add the encoding when you open the file:</p>
<pre><code>with open("C:\\Users\\user\\key.csv", encoding="utf-8-sig") as file:
    reader = csv.reader(file)
    for row in reader:
        print(row)
</code></pre>
<p>Here's the Python documentation on this:

<span class="comment-copy">Can you add a hexadecimal representation of the first line of the CSV file?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I am not too proud to admit I do not know how to do that.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you for your input. Works perfectly now.</span>
