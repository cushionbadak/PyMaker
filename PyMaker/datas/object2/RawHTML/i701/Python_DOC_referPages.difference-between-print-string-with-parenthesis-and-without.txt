<p>In Python 2.7 (interactive mode), both:</p>
<pre><code>print("Hey Joe")
</code></pre>
<p>and:</p>
<pre><code>print "Hey Joe"
</code></pre>
<p>give output: </p>
<pre><code>"Hey Joe"
</code></pre>
<p>What is the difference? When should I use the former and when the latter?</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<p>What is the difference? </p>

<p>Generally <code>print 'something'</code> is called print statement and <code>print("something")</code> is called print function. Print function has been introduced with <code>Python 3</code>. Other than that looking at the basic usage you won't notice any difference. However, you could find more <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.0.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to make your code both Python 2.7 and Python 3 compliant than you should use print function, it is safe to import it with Python 2 and Python 3 it makes difference only with Python 2.</p>
<pre><code>from __future__ import print_function
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>print "Hey Joe"</code> in python3 throws a syntax error. Are you on python2?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">There is no difference. A string with parens around it is still just a string.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Use <code>from __future__ import print_function</code> and then it's just a function (to be used with parens) like in Python 3. But why on Earth are you still on 2?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Python 3 was released in 2008, and the final end of life of 2 is january 1, 2020 -- eleven months from now.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The one is called print statement and the other print function. Print function has been introduced with python 3 as print is really a function :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">On Python 2, unless you explicitly turn off the print statement with <code>from __future__ import print_function</code>, <code>print("something")</code> is still using the print statement. It's not the print function, as you can easily see when <code>print(1, 2)</code> prints a tuple and <code>print(1, file=whatever)</code> fails to parse.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You mean if you want to use print function on Python 2 always import it?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Technically, it's a compiler directive that disables the print statement, not actually importing the print function - the print function is always there, but inaccessible because of the statement's existence. Still, yes, use <code>from __future__ import print_function</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user2357112 tnx for the explanation. I wasn't aware how its internally works.</span>
