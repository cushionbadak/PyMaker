<p>Some hidden set of Unicode characters appear in a string which needs to be removed.</p>
<p>I have a very large text which is extracted from a PDF file using PyPDF2 package. Now this extracted text has a lot of issues in it (like text in tables inside PDF which were structured will appear randomly when extracted) and lots of special characters also get embedded in it (like ~~~~~~~, }}}}}}}} etc) although those texts are not present when viewed as a PDF file. I tried removing those characters using the solution described in <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46656104/remove-x-from-string-in-a-text-file-in-python">this</a>, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20078816/replace-non-ascii-characters-with-a-single-space">this</a> and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15321138/removing-unicode-u2026-like-characters-in-a-string-in-python2-7/15321222#15321222">this</a> link but the problem still appears</p>
<pre><code>myText = "There is a set of hidden character here =&gt; &lt;= but it will get printed in console"

print(myText)
</code></pre>
<p>Now I would like to have a clean text without those hidden characters. </p>

<p>The character <code>\x7f</code> is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII" rel="nofollow noreferrer">ascii character DEL</a>, which explains why your attempts did not work. To remove all "special" ascii characters use this code:</p>
<p>See here for the bytes.decode <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=decode#bytes.decode" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation</a>.</p>
<pre><code>import string
a = b'There is a set of hidden character here =&gt;\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f &lt;= but i will get printed in console'
print(repr(a))
print(repr(''.join(i for i in a.decode('ascii', 'ignore') if i in string.printable)))
</code></pre>
<p>or this if no you don't want to import string:</p>
<pre><code>a = b'There is a set of hidden character here =&gt;\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f &lt;= but i will get printed in console'
print(repr(a))
print(repr(''.join(i for i in a.decode('ascii', 'ignore') if 31 &lt; ord(i) &lt; 127 or i in '\r\n')))
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">In order to get the hidden character between =&gt; and =&lt;, you need to edit the question and grab the entire string as StackOverflow uses some encoding mechanism which hides the special character when printed on the screen.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What was the result of doing this: <code>print(repr(s.encode('ascii', 'ignore')))</code>? (from one of the links)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is the result <code>b'There is a set of hidden character here =&gt;\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f &lt;= but i will get printed in console'</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Is that the only hidden character you have problems with?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Right now, yes. If this gets solved maybe I can find my way for other special characters.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It still doesn't work for me as in my case the string has a character 'b' prepended before it. I would suggest modifying your string to <code>a = b'There is a set of hidden character here =&gt;\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f &lt;= but i will get printed in console'</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@mdowes Then you have a bytestring, not a string. I updated the code to deal with that.</span>
