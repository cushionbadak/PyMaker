<p>I've made an address book app using MySQL in PHP but now I want to make it in Python using a text file. Is it possible to perform CRUD operations with a text file instead of a database?</p>

<p>You can use the shelve module that's in the Python standard library. It basically gives you a dictionary that is easy to save to a file. However, you don't get a lot of relational database features like joining tables; it's just a key-value dictionary.</p>
<p>The documentation for it is at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/shelve.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/shelve.html</a></p>
<p>This doesn't really scale as well as using a database though.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">actually i want to ask that , can we perform CRUD operations in File handling</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm feeling a bit confused here: Do you want to use MySQL? If not, why include it in the question. OTOH, if you want to do this with just file operations, come up with a plan, try to develop it, and come back here when you encounter specific problems (like "Why can't I get a file to open?"). Also, please remember to search for similar questions before you ask a new one. I'm not meaning to be rude, but that is how this site works.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">To address trying to do CRUD ops with just file operations: Having once maintained a database system that used a similar approach and was written entirely in FORTRAN, I'm sure it can be, but it might be a bigger task than you want to take on.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">import tkinter from tkinter import *  def writeFile():     file = open('hello.txt','a+')     file.write(metinF.get() + '\n')     file.close()  gui = Tk()  metinF = Entry(gui) metinF.grid(row=9, column=1)  butonWrite = Button(gui) butonWrite.config(text = 'Write To File', command = writeFile) butonWrite.grid(row=8, column=1)  gui.mainloop()      this is my code for writing data to file using gui. now i wan to display the data from the file on gui form</span>
