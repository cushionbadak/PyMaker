<p>I am trying to save all entries of <code>os.listdir("./oldcsv")</code> separately in a list but I don't know how to manipulate the output before it is processed.</p>
<p>What I am trying to do is generate a list containing the absolute pathnames of all *.csv files in a folder, which can later be used to easily manipulate those files' contents. I don't want to put lots of hardcoded pathnames in the script, as it is annoying and hard to read.</p>
<pre><code>import os

for file in os.listdir("./oldcsv"):
    if file.endswith(".csv"):
        print(os.path.join("/oldcsv", file))
</code></pre>
<p>Normally I would use a loop with <code>.append</code> but in this case I cannot do so, since <code>os.listdir</code> just seems to create a "blob" of content. Probably there is an easy solution out there, but my brain won't think of it.</p>

<p>There's a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/glob.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">glob</a> module in the standard library that can solve your problem with a single function call: </p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>import glob 

csv_files = glob.glob("./*.csv")  # get all .csv files from the working dir
assert isinstance(csv_files, list)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>os.listdir</code> returns a list. What exactly are you trying to do?</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>files = os.listdir("./oldcsv")</code> and then just do whatever with it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">and i really dont see why you cant use an append here.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">OK this seems like a brainfart on my side. "List" is even in the name. I was just trying to create a new list and put the output of listdir in there with append, which naturally won't work, because I can't append a list as entry of a list. Sorry that I can't give you both a check for "answered question" and I probably need more sleep. Or sugar to get my brain working again.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is actually 100% what I was looking for. Works perfectly. Great tool, thanks again!</span>
