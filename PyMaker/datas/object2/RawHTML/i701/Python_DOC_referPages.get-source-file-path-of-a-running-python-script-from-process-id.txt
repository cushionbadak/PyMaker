<p>I have a process running in the background, a python one, with <code>ps -ef</code> I can see filename from running command : <code>UID PID PPID ... python ./filename.py</code></p>
<p>How can I know where the file is located </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>pwdx &lt; PID &gt; gives full directory the process is running from.</p>
<p>So, the full script would be</p>
<pre><code>ps -ef | grep 'your process' | awk '{print $2}' | xargs pwdx
</code></pre>
<p>Though, you can simplify this into</p>
<pre><code>pgrep 'your process' | awk '{print $1}' | xargs pwdx
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Worth noting that this only works as long as the running python process doesn't do <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.chdir" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>os.chdir</code></a>, which updates the process' <code>cwd</code> attribute.</span>
