<p>I have to count the number of each word occurrence from each element of the list that iv created by re.findall. </p>
<p>For Example:
jobs = ["Java Developer","Data Scientist","Business Architect Process Mining","JavaScript Developer"]</p>
<p>jobs_split = ["Java","Developer","Data","Scientist","Business","Architect", "Process","Mining","JavaScript","Developer"]</p>
<p>Then count each of word occurrence and show it f.e. in file as Word: number of occurrences</p>
<p>I know that i can build in "Counter" in python, but tbh i don't know how to split all the elements in list</p>
<pre><code>import urllib.request
import re
from collections import Counter

jobs = []
jobs_split = []

from urllib.request import urlopen, Request
for i in range(10):
    html = Request("https://mysite?pn={}".format(i), headers={'User-Agent':         'Mozilla/5.0'})
page = urlopen(html).read().decode('utf-8')

jobs += re.findall(r'"@type":"JobPosting","title":"([A-Za-z0-9 -/]+)","description"', page)

my_set = set(jobs)
# print(Counter(my_set))
print(my_set)
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You could use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.chain" rel="nofollow noreferrer">itertools.chain</a> to join all words in one iterable:</p>
<pre><code>from collections import Counter
from itertools import chain

jobs = ["Java Developer","Data Scientist","Business Architect Process Mining","JavaScript Developer"]

tokens = chain.from_iterable(job.split() for job in jobs)
counts = Counter(tokens)

print(counts)
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Output</strong></p>
<pre><code>Counter({'Developer': 2, 'JavaScript': 1, 'Architect': 1, 'Process': 1, 'Mining': 1, 'Business': 1, 'Scientist': 1, 'Java': 1, 'Data': 1})
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>As simple as using <code>.split()</code> and splitting on the space <code>" "</code></p>
<p>but have to iterate through your list:</p>
<pre><code>jobs = ["Java Developer","Data Scientist","Business Architect Process Mining","JavaScript Developer"]

split = [ job.split() for job in jobs ]
jobs_split = [item for sublist in split for item in sublist]
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Could you add the expected output?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Developer: 2, Java: 1, Data: 1, Scientist: 1, Business: 1, Architect: 1, Process: 1, Mining: 1, JavaScript: 1</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It's exactly what i needed! Thank you!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This one works too, thanks!</span>
