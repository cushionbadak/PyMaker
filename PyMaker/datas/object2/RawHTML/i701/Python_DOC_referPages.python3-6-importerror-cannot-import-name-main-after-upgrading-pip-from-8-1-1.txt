<p>You are trying to use the pip, which is shipped with the Debian system. You better try to avoid using that pip at any cost.</p>
<p>Please use <code>python3 -m pip install package</code> instead of the system pip which you have in the debian system.</p>
<p>I also recommend using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">venv</a> - virtual environments for keeping your system environment safe.</p>
