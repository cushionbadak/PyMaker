<p>I'm stumped. Basically, I have two functions that take an input (which is a list of randomly generated numbers).</p>
<p>Then I wanted to figure out the size of the input list in which the time it takes both functions to execute is equal.</p>
<p>Here's what I have:</p>
<pre><code>def function1(inputlist):
    #does something to inputlist

def function2(inputlist):
    #does same thing to inputlist as before but in different way

time1 = timeit.timeit(stmt="function1(random.sample([x for x in range(0, 20000), 10)",setup = "from file import function1,input",number=100)

time2 = timeit.timeit(stmt="function2(random.sample([x for x in range(0, 20000), 10)",setup = "from file import function2,input",number=100)

i=0
while time1&lt;time2:
    time1 = timeit.timeit(stmt="function1(random.sample([x for x in range(0, 20000), i)",setup = "from file import function1",number=100)

    time2 = timeit.timeit(stmt="function2(random.sample([x for x in range(0, 20000), i)",setup = "from file import function2",number=100)

    i = i+1

print(i)
</code></pre>
<p>I can't figure this out. I've tried everything I could find. I know you can't reference outside variables when using <code>timeit</code>, so I tried working around that too. I basically need any sort of method where I can increase the input side of the function and calculate each time.</p>
<p>Thanks so much in advance. I've been struggling on this for over a day now.</p>

<p>I think the easiest way here, would be to format the string accordingly:</p>
<p>Instead of </p>
<pre><code>stmt="function1(random.sample([x for x in range(0, 20000)], i))"
</code></pre>
<p>write</p>
<pre><code>stmt=f"function1(random.sample([x for x in range(0, 20000)], {i}))"
</code></pre>
<p>This will put the current value of <code>i</code> where <code>{i}</code> stands. See the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.6.html#pep-498-formatted-string-literals" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs</a> for further information.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Why not just substitute <code>i</code> into the string? Via <code>.format</code>, <code>%</code>, or f-strings?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm sorry - I'm not sure how to go about that. How would I incorporate this? Thanks so much for the reply.</span>
