<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have a text file consider questions.txt, I wanted to check if all the 5 questions numbers are present or not </p>
<p>For example, if the file contains Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4
 But not Q5  it should output as "Q5 not found"
or atleast as "not all questions found"</p>
<p>Basically I wanted to search if all the given words(question numbers)are present in the txt file or not </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Here is one way to do that:</p>
<pre><code>WORDS_TO_FIND = tuple("Q{}".format(i) for i in range(5))

with open('questions.txt') as file:
    text = file.read()
    for word in WORDS_TO_FIND:
        if word not in text:
            print("{} not found".format(word))
</code></pre>
<p>You could also use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.search" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>re.search()</code></a> for more complicated patterns.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Considering the variable text as the <code>text</code> you'd like to search, I'd use:</p>
<pre><code>oc_Q = re.findall(r'[Q][1-5]', text)
print (oc_Q)
</code></pre>
<p>oc_Q will contain all occurrences of the Q[1-5]s. </p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">What's the definition of a question? I assume your file doesn't just contain literally "Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4"?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@FynnBecker Yes it does, like line 1- "Q1 : blah blah" line 2- "Q2 : blah blah" .... etc</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you, ill try it out</span>
