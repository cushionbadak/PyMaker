<p>I'm trying to rename the file names and extensions of all the files in a directory and move them to a new directory. I've read multiple post on how to do it but for some reason I haven't been successful and I've been stuck on this for 3 days now and feel like I'm doing something careless. Somebody get me on track please. 
This is the latest way I've been trying.</p>
<pre><code>import os

previousName = 'Macintosh HD⁩/⁨Users⁩/⁨kunductor/⁨Desktop⁩/⁨folder3/windeffect.asd'

newName = 'Macintosh HD⁩/Users⁩/kunductor⁩/Desktop⁩/folder4/wind.wav'

os.rename(previousName,newName)
</code></pre>
<p>When I run the code above I get the message:</p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "rename.py", line 7, in &lt;module&gt;
    os.rename(previousName,newName)
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory
</code></pre>
<p>If it matters, I'm  using macOS Mojave, version 10.14.2.</p>

<p>I tried replicating the same using Python 3 on Mojave 10.14.2. Use the paths starting from <code>'/Users'</code>, and don't include <code>Macintosh HD</code>. The code runs perfectly when both <code>folder3</code> and <code>folder4</code> exist. I got a similar error when <code>folder4</code> was removed, and the error message also specified the paths I passed as parameters.</p>
<p>If that's what you're experiencing, ensure that the directory you're trying to move the file to exists before calling <code>os.rename</code>. This can be done in Python itself by using the <code>os.mkdir</code> method. Since it throws an error if the directory already exists, you can check that by using the <code>os.path.exists</code> method.</p>

<p>this is the code that worked. I think the problem was that i was trying to change a non-audio file to a .wav and the system was rejecting it.</p>
<pre><code>import os 

# Function to rename multiple files 
def main(): 
    i = 0

    for filename in os.listdir('/Users/vfloyd/Desktop/uu/'): 
        dst ="Kick" + str(i) + ".wav"
        src = '/Users/vfloyd/Desktop/uu/'+ filename 
        dst ='/Users/vfloyd/Desktop/newD/'+ dst 

        # rename() function will 
        # rename all the files 
        os.rename(src, dst) 
        i += 1

# Driver Code 
if __name__ == '__main__': 

    # Calling main() function 
    main()
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy"><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.rename" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Looks like</a> you'd need to use the <code>src_dir_fd</code> and <code>dst_dir_fd</code> parameters to specify the path for the file you're renaming, if I'm understanding those correctly. ...Actually, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/8858026/2617068">this</a> says what you're doing should work. What doesn't work when you try that?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You might want to construct the file names with <code>os.path.join()</code>.  See <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html#os.path.join" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html#os.path.join</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>Macintosh HD</code> is almost certainly not supposed to be the first path component. <code>/Users/kunductor/...</code> seems more likely to be correct.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">i tried that too. thats how i was doing it the first couple of days. i dont know why its not working but it looks like im going to have to just spend a day and a half doing this manually until my light bulb moment.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@TheKunductor quick sanity check to see if the path is correct, just do <code>os.path.exists(my_path)</code> and if it's False, you've not got the right path.</span>
