<p>I have something dumb that is annoying me. Using flake8 linter, they like the lines short obviously, if I run a string like below to continue on the next line:</p>
<pre><code>print('\nWe interrupt this program to annoy you and make things \
          generally more irritating.\n')
</code></pre>
<p>This is what prints:</p>
<pre><code>We interrupt this program to annoy you and make things               generally more irritating.
</code></pre>
<p>What is the proper way to continue a line of code without the large space between a printout?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This works:</p>
<pre><code>print("\nWe interrupt this program to annoy you and make things "
      "generally more irritating.\n")
</code></pre>
<p>You don't need any continuation. Just put two string together with nothing in between, the Python parser will know it mean to concat them</p>
<p>This is called <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#string-literal-concatenation" rel="nofollow noreferrer">string literal concatenation</a></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I would suggest putting the long string into a variable and printing the variable.</p>
<pre><code>message = ("We interrupt this program to annoy you and make things "
           "generally more irritating.\n")
print(message)
</code></pre>
<p>Python handles the string continuation automatically because it is wrapped in the parentheses.  </p>

<span class="comment-copy">Fine  for strings, I should have been more specific I guess, what about for lines where printing a string and a variable in the middle? like <code>'string' + var + 'string'</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">does this works? <code>"string%sstring" % var</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, beautiful! Thank you! Will accept in 5 minutes when timer runs down</span>
