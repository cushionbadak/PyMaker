<p>Write code to count the number of characters in original_str using the accumulation pattern and assign the answer to a variable num_chars. Do NOT use the len function to solve the problem (if you use it while you are working on this problem, comment it out afterward!)</p>
<pre><code>original_str = "The quick brown rhino jumped over the extremely lazy fox."
num_chars = len(original_str)
print(len(original_str))
for i in original_str:
    print(len(i))
</code></pre>
<p>The computer tells me this is correct, but it's doesn't answer the question. I must replace len with another function.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you cannot use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#len" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><strong><code>len()</code></strong></a> function you could write a function like <code>num_characters</code> below that uses a for loop to iterate over the characters in the passed in <code>string</code> and increments and subsequently returns a variable <code>total</code> based on the total amount of characters. I think that is what you mean by an accumulator right?</p>
<pre><code>def num_characters(string):
  total = 0
  for character in string:
    total += 1
  return total

original_string = "The quick brown rhino jumped over the extremely lazy fox."
print(f"The numbers of characters in the original string using `len` is {len(original_string)}.")
print(f"The numbers of characters in the original string using `num_characters` is {num_characters(original_string)}.")
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>
<pre><code>The numbers of characters in the original string using `len` is 57.
The numbers of characters in the original string using `num_characters` is 57.
</code></pre>

<p>With the accumulator pattern, you have a variable, and you add to it when something happens. You can make that "something" mean "counting a particular character".</p>
<p>So, write a loop that steps through each character in the string, and each time you go through that loop, add one to a variable, starting from zero.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">What’s the “accumulation pattern”?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You may need to elaborate on what you mean by the "accumulator pattern". Is that like a reduction? Looping while maintaining an accumulator? And what have you tried? What specifically do you need help with?</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>original_str.count('') - 1</code></span>
