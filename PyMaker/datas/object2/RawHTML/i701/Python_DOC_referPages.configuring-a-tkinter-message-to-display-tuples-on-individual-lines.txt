<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I am trying to do what the Title says, Configure the Tkinter message so that each tuple in WL_ratios has its own line without being surrounded in brackets. Creating more messages is not an option as the length of WL_ratios can vary, so i have to only use the one. </p>
<pre><code>#(below) is in the __init__ of the class
self.Leaderboardtext = Message(self.LeaderboardFrame,text="",width=100)
self.Leaderboardtext.pack() 

#this (below) is in another function in the same class.
WL_ratios = [["james",3]["harrison",2]["jo",1]]
self.Leaderboardtext.configure(text="Leaderboard: {0}".format(WL_ratios))
</code></pre>
<p>So far the width=100 is the only thing that is allowing me to get text onto a new line. However this still isnt working because each tuple varies in length so some tuples spread across two lines which isnt what i want. I know you could limit each line by how number of characters but again the tuples vary in character length so i dont think that is an option. 
Does anyone have any suggestions that could work?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Just convert each tuple into a string, and add <code>\n</code> there, and that should do it. Alternatively, you could call each value in the tuple separately, and add <code>\n</code> there.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Have you tried using a textvariable rather than a simple string ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@LilianBordeau sorry, in reference to what?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sorry I misunderstood your problem, textvariable won't help. Since you are using the Message widget, you can add the breaking line character '\n' between your tuples. This will add a new line for each of them.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">But this is bad practice anyway. The fact that WL_ratios length can vary should not restrain you from creating multiples message widgets. If you are iterating over WL_ratios, you will go through all of them anyway. If you want to create a proper leaderboard table, with columns and rows, you can use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.ttk.html#tkinter.ttk.Treeview" rel="nofollow noreferrer">treeview widget</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Have you tried explicitly converting the data to lines separated by newlines before passing them to the widget?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">When taken literally, "just add <code>\n</code> inbetween your tuples" won't work. You need to convert the tuples to a string, and insert the newlines between each string. You might want to be a bit more explicit about what you're suggesting.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ill change it, thanks</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you, helped alot :)</span>
