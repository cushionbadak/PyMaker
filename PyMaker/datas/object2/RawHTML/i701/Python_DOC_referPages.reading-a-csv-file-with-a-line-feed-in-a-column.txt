<p>I've a csv file with a line feed ('\n') in a column.
The rows are separated by a carriage return + line feed (\r\n)
The separator is ';' and quoted all.   </p>
<p>I want to replace the line feed ('\n') in the column by a space.   </p>
<p>I already tried to read the whole file and used split('\r\n') to get the rows but that doesn't work. </p>
<pre><code>with open(r’d:\my_file.csv’,’r’) as fi:
    data = fi.read()
    lines = data.split(‘\r\n’)

    for line in lines:
        with open(r’d:\my_file.csv’,’a’) as fo:
        fo.write(line.replace(‘\n’, ‘ ’)

import csv

    with open(r’d:\my_file.csv’, ‘r’, newline=‘\r\n’) as csv_file:
        csv_reader = csv.reader(csv_file, delimiter=‘;’,quotechar='"')
        for row in csv_reader:
           n_row = row.replace(‘\n’, ‘ ‘)
    …
</code></pre>
<p>Is it possible to read the file line by line and using '\r\n' as a new line indicator?   </p>
<p>Any help is much appreciated!</p>

<p>Your code contains weird <code>’</code> and <code>‘</code> .. you also try to use <code>.replace()</code> on a row given to you by <code>for row in csv_reader:</code>. <em>That</em> <code>row</code> is a list of columns - nothing you can directly call <code>replace()</code> on.  You need to replace the newline inside each column of this row.</p>
<p>-- </p>
<p>You try to read the file yourself - with quoting this is difficult. Using the  <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">module csv</a> to read and store the csv again is much easier:</p>
<p><strong>Write demo file:</strong></p>
<pre><code>import csv

t = [["a", 2, "c\nd", 4], ["aa", "bb", "cc", "dd"], ["aaa", "bbb", "ccc", "ddd"]]

# using the default seperator of: ',' - use delimiter=';' to change it
with open( "d.txt", "w", newline="") as f:
    w = csv.writer(f, quotechar='"', quoting=csv.QUOTE_ALL)
    w.writerows(t)

# print files content
print(open("d.txt").read())
</code></pre>
<p>Filecontent: </p>
<pre><code>"a","2","c
d","4"
"aa","bb","cc","dd"
"aaa","bbb","ccc","ddd"
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Read demo file, manipulate data and store in list</strong></p>
<pre><code>data = []
with open("d.txt") as f:
    r = csv.reader(f, quotechar='"')
    for row in r:
        data.append( [x.replace("\n"," ") for x in row] )

print(t)
print(data)
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code># original data
[['a', 2, 'c\nd', 4], ['aa', 'bb', 'cc', 'dd'], ['aaa', 'bbb', 'ccc', 'ddd']]

# parsed and replaced data (some numbers are now strings, \n is replaced)
[['a', '2', 'c d', '4'], ['aa', 'bb', 'cc', 'dd'], ['aaa', 'bbb', 'ccc', 'ddd']]    
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Write modified data back to a new file:</strong></p>
<pre><code>with open( "d_mod.txt", "w", newline="") as f:
    w = csv.writer(f, quotechar='"', quoting=csv.QUOTE_ALL)
    w.writerows(data)   # modified data

# print new files content
print(open("d_mod.txt").read())
</code></pre>
<p>Modified filecontent:</p>
<pre><code>"a","2","c d","4"
"aa","bb","cc","dd"
"aaa","bbb","ccc","ddd"
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">@PatrickArtner : I've already tried that but it gives me an error due to the lines.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Many thanks for the sample and the explanation !</span>
