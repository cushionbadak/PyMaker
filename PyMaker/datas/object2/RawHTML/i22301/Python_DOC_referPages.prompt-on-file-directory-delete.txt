<p>When coding in Python, I often need to write a function like this one:</p>
<pre><code>def delete_dir(dir_name):

    if os.path.exists(dir_name):
        reply = raw_input("Delete directory "+dir_name+"? [y/[n]] ")
        if reply=='y':
            os.system('rm -r '+dir_name)
        else:
            print "Aborting..."
            sys.exit()
</code></pre>
<p>Which is basically just a remove command with a user prompt to double-check (I also have one for deleting files). Given the large amounts of Python modules out there, including in the standard library, I'm wondering if something like this already exists out there?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>It wouldn't be a Python thing, but if you keep using os.system() to make the delete call, you can pass the <code>-i</code> parameter to <code>rm</code>. The man page explains it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>-i       prompt before every removal</p>
</blockquote>
<p>EDIT: I just read your code again and it looks like you're only prompting once before the entire delete process, not for each file. You might be interested in the <code>-I</code> flag instead:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>-I       prompt  once  before  removing  more than three files, or when
  removing recursively.  Less intrusive
  than -i, while still giving protection
                against most mistakes</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>to remove directory, use os module os.rmdir(), os.removedirs(). Or shutil.rmtree() .check the docs for more information</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>well ,you could save this function in a module and reuse it in other modules,that way ,your problem will be solved !</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You should probably do if reply in ['y', 'Y', 'yes']:</span>
<span class="comment-copy">try not to call system programs when possible. Its not portable</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Just to note that in Python 3, raw_input() is <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.0.html#builtins" rel="nofollow noreferrer">renamed</a> to input().</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I agree these can replace the os.system('rm -r '+dir_name) line, but what I'm looking for is a routine that will automatically give a user prompt to double check if the directory should be deleted.</span>
