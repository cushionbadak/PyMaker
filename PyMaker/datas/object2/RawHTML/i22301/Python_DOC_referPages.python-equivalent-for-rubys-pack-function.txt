<p>I'm translating some of my old Ruby scripts into Python and I have trouble finding a function in Python that belongs to Ruby:
<a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/classes/Array.src/M002222.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/classes/Array.src/M002222.html</a> - which keeps the array in little endian byte order. Is there any Python module that can help me? </p>

<p>The <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/array.html?highlight=array#module-array" rel="nofollow noreferrer">array</a> module of Python's standard library may offer somewhat-similar functionality (though it's definitely not an exact match). It does not force endianness (you can swap items' endianness with method <code>byteswap</code>) and does not intrinsically keep items as "a string" (you can convert back and forth with methods <code>tostring</code> and <code>fromstring</code>) but it may be worth looking at, depending on how you're using the Ruby <code>pack</code> function I guess.</p>

<p>The Python <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#memoryview" rel="nofollow">memoryview</a> built-in allows you to "cast" an array or any bytes-like object to different endianess. Se the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#memoryview.cast" rel="nofollow">.cast</a> method. The great thing about memoryviews is that they operate without copying bytes: they share memory with the source data structure.</p>
