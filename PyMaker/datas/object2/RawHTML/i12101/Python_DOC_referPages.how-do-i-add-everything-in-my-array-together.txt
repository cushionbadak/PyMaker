<p>In my code I am attempting to generate 8 random numbers using a for loop. I then add these to the end of my array of the name 'numbers'. Now I will like to add the numbers in this array together but I can't figure out a way to do this.
Below you will see my code.</p>
<pre><code>    def get_key():
        numbers = []
        for i in range(8):
            i = random.randrange(33, 126)
            numbers.append(i)


    get_key()
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>You want to use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#sum" rel="nofollow">sum</a></p>
<pre><code>a = [1,2,3,4,5]

sum(a) # outputs 15
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>add</code> as in <code>sum</code>? simply do <code>sum(numbers)</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>As others have noted, you can use <code>sum</code> to iterate and accumulate over the list (the default accumulator for <code>sum</code> is <code>int()</code>, i.e. <code>0</code>). Also, if this is the only purpose for the list, you can save memory by using a generator. </p>
<pre><code>import random

get_key = lambda: sum(random.randrange(33, 126) for _ in range(8))
print( get_key() ) # 612
</code></pre>
<p>The real question is why are you trying to do this? It seems like there will be a more direct method by using a higher-level distribution. For example, the sum of n I.I.D. variables will approach a Normal distribution.</p>
