<p>When I go to run this code, I get the error above. I would understand if it was because one of my objects haven't been identified as strings but the error appears on the first <code>file_name.write()</code></p>
<pre><code>def save_itinerary(destination, length_of_stay, cost):
    # Itinerary File Name
    file_name = "itinerary.txt"

    # Create a new file
    itinerary_file = open('file_name', "a")

    # Write trip information
    file_name.write("Trip Itinerary")
    file_name.write("--------------")
    file_name.write("Destination: " + destination)
    file_name.write("Length of stay: " + length_of_stay)
    file_name.write("Cost: $" + format(cost, ",.2f"))

    # Close the file
    file_name.close()
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You should be using <code>itinerary_file.write</code> and <code>itinerary_file.close</code>, not <code>file_name.write</code> and <code>file_name.close</code>.</p>
<p>Also, <code>open(file_name, "a")</code> and not <code>open('file_name', "a")</code>, unless you're trying to open a file named <code>file_name</code> instead of <code>itinerary.txt</code>.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>An attribute error means that the object your trying to interact with, does not have the item inside it you're calling.</p>
<p>For instance</p>
<p><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = 1</code></p>
<p><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a.append(2)</code></p>
<p>a is not a list, it does not have an append function, so trying to do this will cause an AttributError exception</p>
<p>when opening a file, best practice is usually to use the <code>with</code> context, which does some behind the scenes magic to make sure your file handle closes. The code is much neater, and makes things a bit easier to read.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Just a note: <code>open</code>ing with <code>mode="a"</code> will append to an existing file if one exists; there is no guarantee it will be "creating" a file vs. altering an existing file. <code>mode="w"</code> will empty an existing file and let you write new content or open a new file if the file doesn't exist, and in modern Python 3, <code>mode="x"</code> will <i>only</i> create new files, raising an exception if you would have overwritten an existing file.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">To clarify the error a bit: it means "You tried to call function write() on something that's a string!". file_name is a string, hence the error.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Frankly, you shouldn't need to call <code>itinerary_file.close()</code> because you <i>should</i> be using a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#with" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>with</code> statement</a> to get guaranteed and predictable closing behavior while removing the risk of accidentally forgetting or only conditionally executing the <code>close()</code>. But yes, this is the correct answer.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I appreciate both of you two's advice, saving a young man's life.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ShadowRanger 100% agree with using <code>with</code>!</span>
