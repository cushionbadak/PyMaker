<pre><code>key_words = ("screen", "power", "wifi")

<p>When the user types in  anything in key_words it will work, but if the user enters it in the sentence its works like this:</p>
<pre><code>Type: screen is not working
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
</code></pre>
<p>It's supposed to find the keyword "screen" and enter yes but it just goes blank. I know I have to split the user's response but how would I do this for the recent python?</p>

<p>This looks like a good job for <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#any" rel="nofollow">any</a>. You want to iterate over your sentence and check to see if there exists a word in that list. If there is "ANY" match, return true: </p>
<pre><code>key_words = ("screen", "power", "wifi")

user_input = input("Type: ")

if any(i in key_words for i in user_input.split()):
    print("you should do this...")
</code></pre>
<p>You also do not need to case to str as it will already give you a string. So I removed that, it is unnecessary. </p>
<p>As mentioned in the comment, you do in fact have a syntax problem at the end of your conditional statement.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Since <code>split()</code> returns a list and not a single value, you must test each of its elements individually (in a loop).  </p>
<pre><code>key_words = ("screen", "power", "wifi")
user_input = input("Type: ")

for word in user_input.split():
  if word in key_words:
    print ("you should do this...")
</code></pre>
<p>If the user enters more than one of these keywords, multiple messages will be printed.  </p>
<p>N.b this is for python3.  For python2, use <code>raw_input</code> instead.  I also removed the <code>str()</code> in the <code>input()</code> function. </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The solution can be achieved by converting both the key_words and user_input sentence to a set and finding intersection between the 2 sets</p>
<pre><code>key_words = {"screen", "power", "wifi"}

user_input = raw_input("Type: ")

choice = key_words.intersection(user_input.split())
if choice is not None:
    print("option selected: {0}".format(list(choice)[0]))
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>Type: screen is not working
option selected: screen

Type: power
option selected: power
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>key_words = ("screen", "power", "wifi")
user_input = input("Type: ")
user_words = user_input.split()

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use set intersections.</p>
<pre><code>if  set(key_words) &amp; set(user_input.split()):
    print ("you should do this...")

<p><strong>Another Option</strong> </p>
<p>This is much easier and self-explanatory. Count each word in key_words. if any<br/>
of those just say you should do this...</p>
<pre><code>any_word =  [ True  for x in user_input.split() if x in key_words]

'''
user_input.split() return type is a list
so we should check whether each word in key_words
if so then True
'''


'''
 finally we check the list is empty
'''

if  any_word :
    print ("you should do this...")

<span class="comment-copy">If you put <code>break</code> in the <code>if</code>, the <code>print</code> will execute only once.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Some explanation would be welcome. How is this different from <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/35684588/3821804">this answer</a>, posted 10 minutes earlier?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It takes a few minutes to compose an answer.  So that two almost identical answers can be posted within a few minutes (the other one doesn't use the <code>user_words</code> variable).</span>
