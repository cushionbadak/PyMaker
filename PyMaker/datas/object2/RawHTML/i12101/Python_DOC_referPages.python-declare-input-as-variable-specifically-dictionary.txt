<p>New to Python and programming in general, and maybe I'm asking the question wrong, but I can't seem to find what I'm looking for. 
So, I'm trying to take an input:</p>
<pre><code>user = input('What is your character's name?")
</code></pre>
<p>And define it as a dictionary to then be added to as they add stats, program does math for derived stats and adds to them, that type of stuff. </p>
<p>So, if the input is 'John Doe', and I strip the whitespace out:</p>
<pre><code>usr = ''.join(user.split())
</code></pre>
<p>How do I then take the resulting string 'JohnDoe', and define it as a dictionary type? I'm keeping this in program to get more comfortable with it, then I'll eventually be looking to create files that it will load/save for different users with a GUI and everything. But that's very long term right now. I do take this and print a formatted sheet using the keys of the dictionary. </p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>character_dict = {'Name': 'None', 'Class': 'None'}

character_dict['Name'] = str(raw_input('Enter a Character Name: '))
character_dict['Class'] = str(raw_input('Choose a Class: '))

print ("The hero " + character_dict['Name'] + " is a level 0 " + character_dict['Class'])
</code></pre>

<p>Maybe this example will give you a bit of an idea how a dictonary works: </p>
<pre><code># Create an empty dictornary. 
data = dict()
# Lets put some examples in it this time. 
# Lets say, UserName:Password
data = {'Sara':'BrownCat2','John':'HelloKitty77','Magnus':'AngryCar101'}

# Show what we have in the dictonay.
print(data) 

# Inserting/Updating
data['John']='Yello1'
# Deleting 
del data['Magnus']

# Show what we have in the dictonay.
print(data) 

# Empty the whole dictonary 
data.clear()

# Show what we have in the dictonay.
print(data) 
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">For starters, you're missing a doublequote in your first code line</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What do you mean by <i>define it as a dictionary type</i>? also <code>usr = user.replace(' ', '')</code> is better</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What do you want your dictionary to look like?  What will the keys be?   (PS. instead of split and join to remove whitespace, try <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.replace" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>user.replace(' ', '')</code></a>)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I think you want something like <code>people[usr] = {}</code> so that you can dynamically create containers for more than one entry, but it's hard to tell.  Also, <code>.strip()</code> to remove leading and trailing whitespace.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user3100115, @dsh that doesn't remove tabs and newline. You should use <code>re.sub(r'\s+', '', user)</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">not quite what I am looking for, I want the input as the dictionary variable, so when input is 'John Doe', then stripped to 'JohnDoe', I now want a way to do JohnDoe = dict()</span>
<span class="comment-copy">So you want the name of the variable (in this case a dictionary) to be input by the user?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">correct, sorry I took forever to respond, moved onto another project, but an answer to this would help me nonetheless.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thank you, but this is not quite it. I'm wanting the input to become the variable itself. so instead of data, it would be &lt;result of an input&gt; = dict()</span>
