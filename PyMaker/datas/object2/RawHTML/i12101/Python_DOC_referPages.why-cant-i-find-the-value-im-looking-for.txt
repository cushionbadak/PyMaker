<p>Basically, I want to find how many S's and W's are in a data I'm reading in Python. Am I doing it correctly or not, because when I run the program it say there are 0 s's and w's found.. which isn't true.</p>
<p>This is what I've done..</p>
<pre><code>def input_function():
    my_file = open("TheData.txt", "r")

    Data = []

    for each_line in my_file:
        Data.append(each_line.split())
        print (Data)
    return Data


def Number_Of_S(Data):
    CountS= 0
    for x in range(len(Data)):
        if Data[x] == ("S"):
            CountS = CountS + 1
    print ("There are " + str(CountS) + " S's")
    return CountS


def Number_Of_W(Data):
    CountW= 0
    for x in range(len(Data)):
        if Data[x] == ("W"):
            CountW = CountW + 1
    print ("There are " + str(CountW) + " W's")

    return CountW

#Main program
Data = input_function()
Number_Of_W = Number_Of_W(Data)
Number_Of_S = Number_Of_S(Data)

<p>What about reading the whole file into a string, then counting the characters in the string using in built functions?</p>
<pre><code>with open('test.txt', 'r') as content_file:
    content = content_file.read()

sCount = content.count('S')
wCount = content.count('W')

print ("There are " + str(sCount) + " S's")
print ("There are " + str(wCount) + " S's")

<p>Your count functions work just fine:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def Number_Of_S(Data):
    CountS= 0
    for x in range(len(Data)):
        if Data[x] == ("S"):
            CountS = CountS + 1
    print ("There are " + str(CountS) + " S's")
    return CountS

&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; Number_Of_S('HASSAH')
There are 2 S's
2
</code></pre>
<p>The problem is with your <code>input_function()</code>, which creates a list of lists (first each line is split into a list, and then those lists are appended to the <code>Data</code> list). It should simply be a list of lines, or optionally you should use three nested <code>for</code> loops in your <code>Number_Of_S</code> to loop through the words:</p>
<pre><code>for line in Data:  # Line is a list of words
    for word in line:  # Word is a string
        for character in word:
            if character == 'S':
                CountS += 1  # Increment by one
</code></pre>
<hr/>
<p>Some other improvements, completely unrelated to your issue. Your coding style is rather unpythonic. I don't know where you learned it from, but I'd recommend you try to adjust to the "general" recommendations, such as <code>snake_case_variable_and_function_names</code> instead of <code>Capitalized_Names</code>.</p>
<p>Also, don't use <code>range()</code> with <code>for</code> loop unless there's no other way. In Python, you can loop directly through a list using <code>for element in my_list:</code>. With these changes in mind, this is how I think your functions should look like:</p>
<pre><code>def number_of_s(data):
    count_s = 0
    for char in data:
        if char == 'S':
            count_s += 1  # Short for count_s = count_s + 1
    return count_s
</code></pre>
<p>And it's highly recommended to do the printing outside of the function:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; my_data = 'HASSAH'
&gt;&gt;&gt; count_s = number_of_s(my_data)
&gt;&gt;&gt; print("There are " + str(count_s) + " S's")
</code></pre>
<p>And instead of having multiple functions for each letter, why not use one with two arguments:</p>
<pre><code>def number_of_characters(string, character):
    count = 0
    for char in string:
        if char == character:
            count += 1
    return count
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, I believe this is just a practice program and thus this is fine, but if you'll ever use this in a real program, you should use <code>list.count()</code> and <code>str.count()</code> instead:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; my_data = 'HASSAH'
&gt;&gt;&gt; count_s = my_data.count('S')
&gt;&gt;&gt; print("There are " + str(count_s) + " S's")
</code></pre>
<p>And even more finally, you should just read the whole file at once and count the characters in it:</p>
<pre><code>with open('TheData.txt') as infile:
    text = infile.read()
print("There are " + str(text.count('S')) + " S's")
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You just create the wrong array. Your list was e.g.</p>
<pre><code>['Wossd', 'sds', 'dsd', 's', 'd']
['Ssd', 'sds', 'dsd', 's', 'd']
['sdsdsd']
</code></pre>
<p>but for your counting functions it should be</p>
<pre><code>['W', 'o', 's', 's', 'd', ' ', 's', 'd', 's', ' ', 'd', 's', 'd', ' ', 's', ' ', 'd']
['S', 's', 'd', ' ', 's', 'd', 's', ' ', 'd', 's', 'd', ' ', 's', ' ', 'd']
['s', 'd', 's', 'd', 's', 'd']
</code></pre>
<p>Modify your input function to </p>
<pre><code>def input_function():
    my_file = open("TheData.txt", "r")

    Data = []

    for each_line in my_file:
        Data = Data + list(each_line.strip())
    return Data
</code></pre>
<p>so the output is</p>
<pre><code>There are 1 W's
There are 1 S's
</code></pre>
<p>then rest of the code works, but there are a lot of simpler solutions</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Why don't you use built-in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>list.count</code></a> method?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Your methods work fine for me. What does your <code>'TheData.txt'</code> file look like?</span>
