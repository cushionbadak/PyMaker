<p>Hi I'm teaching myself python, have downloaded 3.4 and am working through Think Python. The problem i'm having is printing a grid. I won't put the whole code up but the bit that is a problem. </p>
<pre><code>def do_twice(f):  
    f()  
    f()

def print_beam():   
    print("+ - - - - ", )

def print_beams():  
    do_twice(print_beam)
    print("+")
</code></pre>
<p>now this when called is supposed to print a beam like this + - - - - + - - - - +</p>
<p>However, the actual output is<br/>
+ - - - -<br/>
+ - - - -<br/>
+</p>
<p>I've spent a good two hours on this but the version of python i'm using is different from the book I'm working on. Could anyone help me out of this log jam?</p>

<p>The problem is that, by default, the <code>print</code> function creates a new line at the end of its output. Here's an easy fix.</p>
<pre><code>def do_twice(f):  
    f()  
    f()

def print_beam():   
    print("+ - - - - ", end='') #Don't create a new line.

def print_beams():  
    do_twice(print_beam)
    print("+")
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>With python 3 to prevent newline characters being printed set <code>end=""</code> like so:</p>
<p><code>print("+ - - - -", end="")</code></p>
<p>You can read the documentation on this <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print" rel="nofollow">here</a></p>

<span class="comment-copy">What version are you using? If you aren't sure, try <code>import sys; print(sys.version)</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">You're reading a Python 2 tutorial and running it on Python 3. That's the problem.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">3.4.4 but the book is something diff 3.2 maybe</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If your book suggested putting a comma at the end of a <code>print</code> statement in order to suppress a newline, then it's almost certainly written for 2.7 or lower. I assume that's why you've got a stray comma in your <code>print_beam</code> function?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for your help Gareth, that has fixed it immediately. So glad I came here instead of banging my head for another 2 hours. Thanks so much!</span>
