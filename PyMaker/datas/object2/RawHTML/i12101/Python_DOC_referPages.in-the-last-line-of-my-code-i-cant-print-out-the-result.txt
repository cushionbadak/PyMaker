<p>The error reminded is the indice of str can only be integer, not str. Please help me figure out the my error</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>your <code>students</code> variable is a list of 3 strings, rather than list of 3 dictionaries</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Because <code>students</code> contains Strings that just happen to be the names of students, not the student dictionaries themselves. Change:</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You created the list <code>students</code> as a list of strings, not as a list of references.<br/>
You should edit the content from:</p>

<p>you need to take away the quotes, so that would be:<code>[lloyd, alice, tyler]</code></p>

<span class="comment-copy">You want: <code>students = [lloyd, alice, tyler]</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you very much!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Since I have defined the dictionary lloyd, I can just define the students list with lloyd without the quotes. Is my understanding right? Thank you!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">When you say <code>lloyd = {...}</code>, you've created a label called <code>lloyd</code>. It's not actually quite that simple, but basically, ya. You've created a name to reference the object with, which does not require quotes to use. I recommend taking a step back and learning the Python basics if this is news to you you should understand how variables works before you start messing with dictionaries, since they require basic knowledge to use.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">OK, thank you very much!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sorry to interrupt you! Could you please recommend me for some books or other materials to learn some Python basics?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Liuyang It's been quite awhile since I've written Python; I honestly can't remember exactly how I learned it. I do remember though that the Python docs  were an amazing reference. Start here: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html</a>. It's a lot to read, but a <b>major</b> part of programming is going over documentation, which is essentially an instruction manual.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you very much!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Liuyang you're welcome.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">if you appreciated my answer please upvote it or sign it as the best answer. cheers</span>
