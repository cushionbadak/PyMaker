<p>I have a Python program that can take several days to finish running on my cloud-hosted Ubuntu machine. At it's current stage, I can only see the progress of the program only if I keep my shell open. <code>print("processed: " + str(finalCount) + " files.")</code> -- simple and straightforward. </p>
<p>Since learning <a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/396654/how-to-run-the-python-program-in-the-background-in-ubuntu-machine">of this trick</a>, I thought that it would be great if I can check the progress of the program without having to open the shell and find the process using <code>ps -e</code></p>
<p>Is there a simple way to achieve this?</p>
<p>I have a couple ideas, but I'm not sure how viable they are (since performance is paramount. These programs can run from days to weeks). The first idea would be to set up a very simple MySQL database that would be updated each time a task is finished performing. Not sure how much strain that would put on the server, however--or if this is even an efficient idea.</p>
<p>Second idea: have the program append it's status to a simple log file. Then if I'm curious, I can simply download the current version of the log file.</p>
<p>Any thoughts? Ideas? Suggestions?</p>

<p>Python have a standard library named <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html?highlight=logging#module-logging" rel="nofollow">logging</a>. It can record the progress while program running. Those logs can be outputted as a log file. You can <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html#logging-basic-tutorial" rel="nofollow">try it</a>.</p>

<p>Database will not be very good idea for this usecase.</p>
<p>Use <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/logging.html" rel="nofollow">python logging</a> module to log the status/progress of your task, it very light-foot and won't be much of an issue if you are not updating/logging very fast.</p>

<p>As suggested in an <a href="https://askubuntu.com/a/106359/315347">answer linked to the question you cite</a>, you can use GNU screen to  keep track of a long running process. I use it frequently for long running processes and wrote a <a href="http://paulremote.blogspot.fr/2014/11/gnu-screen-for-long-running-server.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">blog post with the most common command arguments</a>.</p>
<p>Start a screen session with:</p>
<pre><code>    screen -S sessionname
</code></pre>
<p>In order to find the screen session later give it a name using sessionname. Start a long running process. Then detach the session with:</p>
<pre><code>    CTRL-A-D
</code></pre>
<p>You can re-attach the session later with:</p>
<pre><code>    screen -r sessionname
</code></pre>
<p>In parallel, writing to a text log sounds like a good idea. Have a look at the official documentation explaining <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.5/howto/logging.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">how to write log files with python</a>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Yeah, I kind of figured that setting up an entire database was a bit overkill.  Thanks for the suggestion, I will check out python logging!</span>
