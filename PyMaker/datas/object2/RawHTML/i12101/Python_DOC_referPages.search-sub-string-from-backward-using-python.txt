<p>Wondering if there is a neat API in Python to search a string from backward (from a specific position in a string), for example, in string "Hello StackOverflow Hello Python", suppose I want to find the index of sub-string "Hello" which is previous to sub-string "Python"?</p>
<p>thanks in advance,
Lin</p>

<p>Yes, it's called <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=str.rindex#str.rindex" rel="nofollow"><code>str.rindex()</code></a>. It takes arguments <code>sub</code> - a substring to look for, <code>start</code> - a starting position, and <code>end</code>. </p>
<p>It is the <code>r</code>everse of the <code>index</code> function. There are some others, like <code>rsplit</code>, too.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Downvoted. First result for "python string" search gives you <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html#string.rfind" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/2/library/string.html#string.rfind</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@viraptor, nice catch. I am confused by rindex and rfind, which one is for my problem? Thanks.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Either one. The question is - do you want an exception thrown (rindex) or -1 returned (rfind) if the strings are missing.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@viraptor, I just need to get -1 when there is no hit, whether Exception is returned or not is not important, your recommendations are highly appreciated. :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks Austin, always good to learn from you. Just to clarify, do you mean using rindex or using rfind? :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That's up to you. Do you want a <code>ValueError</code>? But for your information, the <code>index</code> and <code>rindex</code> functions appear in a <i>lot</i> of languages, so they're a good pair to remember.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hi Austin, I just need to get -1 when there is no hit, whether ValueError is returned or not is not important, your recommendations are highly appreciated. :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for all the help, Austin. Mark your reply as answered.</span>
