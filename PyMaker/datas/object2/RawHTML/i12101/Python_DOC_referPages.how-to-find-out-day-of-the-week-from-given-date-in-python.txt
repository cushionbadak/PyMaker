<p>Write a function that accepts a string which contains a particular
  date from the Gregorian calendar. Your function should return what day
  of the week it was. Here are a few examples of what the input
  string(Month Day Year) will look like. However, you should not
  'hardcode' your program to work only for these input!</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>"June 12 2012"
"September 3 1955"
"August 4 1843" 
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that each item (Month Day Year) is separated by one space. For
  example if the input string is:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>"May 5 1992"
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Then your function should return the day of the week (string) such as:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>"Tuesday"
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Algorithm with sample example:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code># Assume that input was "May 5 1992"
day (d) = 5        # It is the 5th day
month (m) = 3      # (*** Count starts at March i.e March = 1, April = 2, ... January = 11, February = 12)
century (c) = 19   # the first two characters of the century
year (y) = 92      # Year is 1992 (*** if month is January or february decrease one year)
# Formula and calculation
day of the week (w) = (d + floor(2.6m - 0.2) - 2c + y + floor(y/4) + floor(c/4)) modulo 7
after calculation we get, (w) = 2
Count for the day of the week starts at Sunday, i.e Sunday = 0, Monday = 1, Tuesday = 2, ... Saturday = 6
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Since we got 2, May 5 1992 was a Tuesday</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My first question is how do I accept <code>June 12 2012</code> as input from the user? Is there any method that allows me to do this? Any help would be appreciated.</p>
