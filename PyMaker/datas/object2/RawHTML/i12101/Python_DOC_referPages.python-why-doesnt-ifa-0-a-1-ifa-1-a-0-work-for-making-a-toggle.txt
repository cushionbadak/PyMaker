<p>I'm working on a project using python to read the digital inputs on the raspberry pi. I wanted to turn one of the buttons into a toggle, as in it switches a value between 1 and 0 whenever I press it. Everything is working fine except the section:</p>
<pre><code>if(a == 0.0):
    a = 1.0
if(a == 1.0):
    a = 0.0
</code></pre>
<p>It seems like this should work with the rest of the code to make the value toggle between 1 and 0 whenever the button is pressed, but a prints as 0.0 every time, does anyone know why this is?</p>
<pre><code>import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
GPIO.setup(4, GPIO.IN, pull_up_down = GPIO.PUD_DOWN)
GPIO.setup(24, GPIO.IN, pull_up_down = GPIO.PUD_UP)
a = 0.0
b = 0.0
c = 0

while True:
    if(GPIO.input(4) ==1 and c ==0):
        print 'Button 1 Pressed'
        if(a == 0.0):
            a = 1.0
        if(a == 1.0):
            a = 0.0
        c = 1
        print a
    if(GPIO.input(4) !=1):
        c = 0
    if(GPIO.input(24) ==0):
        print 'Button 2 Pressed'
</code></pre>

<p>If you start with <code>a = 0</code>, <strong>both</strong> <code>if</code> statements match, and you end up back at <code>0</code>.</p>
<p>Use <code>if .. elif</code> instead; this is <em>one</em> statement and only one of the branches can ever match:</p>
<pre><code>if a == 0.0:
    a = 1.0
elif a == 1.0:
    a = 0.0
</code></pre>
<p>I'm not sure what you are using these values for, however. Floating point comparisons are tricky, because calculations with floats can lead to <em>very subtle differences</em>, where it may look like you have <code>1.0</code> exactly but you really have <code>0.9999999999999872545</code>. That'll not be equal to <code>1.0</code>. Perhaps you wanted to use a boolean instead? In that case use:</p>
<pre><code>a = False

# toggle
a = not a
</code></pre>
<p>If you do need to use floats, test if your value is <em>close enough</em>:</p>
<pre><code>if abs(a - 0.0) &lt; 1e-9:
    a = 1.0
elif abs(a - 1.0) &lt; 1e-9:
    a = 0.0
</code></pre>
<p>If you are using Python 3.5 or newer, you can use the new <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html#math.isclose" rel="nofollow"><code>math.isclose()</code> function</a>:</p>
<pre><code>from math import isclose

if isclose(a, 0.0):
    a = 1.0
elif isclose(a, 1.0):
    a = 0.0
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Starting with <code>a = 0</code>, what do you think the second <code>if</code> statement sees after the first has executed?</span>
