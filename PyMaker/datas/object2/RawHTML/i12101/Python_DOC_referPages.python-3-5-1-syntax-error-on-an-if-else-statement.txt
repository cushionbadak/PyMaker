<p>I'm working on a homework assignment, it looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>def main():
    keep_going = 'y'
    number_of_salespeople = 0

    while keep_going == 'y' or keep_going == 'Y':
        process_sales()
        number_of_salespeople += 1
        keep_going = input('Are there more salespeople? (enter y or Y for yes) ')

    print(' ')
    print('There were', number_of_salespeople, 'salespeople today.')

def process_sales():        
    print(' ')
    name = input('What is the salesperson\'s name? ')

    first_sale_amount = float(input('What is', name, '\'s first sale amount? '))
    while 0 &lt;= first_sale_amount &lt;= 25000:
        print('Error: that is not a valid sales amount. The amount must be greater than 0')
        first_sale_amount = float(input('Please enter a correct sale amount: '))

    highest_sale = first_sale_amount
    lowest_sale = first_sale_amount
    average_sale = first_sale_amount

    number_of_sales = float(input('How many sales did', name, 'make this month? '))

    for number in range(2, number_of_sales + 1):
        sale_amount = float(input('Enter', name, '\'s time for sale #' + str(number) + ': '))
        while 0 &lt;= sale_amount &lt;= 25000:
            print('Error: that is not a valid sales amount. The amount must be greater than 0')
            sale_amount = float(input('Please enter a correct sale amount: '))

    if sale_amount &gt; highest_sale:
        highest_sale = sale_amount

    else sale_amount &lt; lowest_sale:
        lowest_sale = sale_amount

    total_sales += sale_amount
    average_sale = (first_sale_amount + total_sales) / number_of_sales

    print('The highest sale for', name, 'was', \
          format(highest_sale, ',.2f'), \
          sep='')

    print('The lowest sale for', name, 'was', \
          format(lowest_sale, ',.2f'), \
          sep='')

    print('The average sale for', name, 'was', \
          format(average_sale, ',.2f'), \
          sep='')

main()
</code></pre>
<p>the error I am having is in the if else statement towards the bottom, </p>
<pre><code>if sale_amount &gt; highest_sale:
    highest_sale = sale_amount

else sale_amount &lt; lowest_sale:
    lowest_sale = sale_amount
</code></pre>
<p>the error looks like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Syntax Error:         else sale_amount &lt; lowest_sale:: , line
  58, pos 24</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I cannot see what the issue is, can anyone help me figure out where the error is coming from. Thank you for any assistance.</p>

<p>You should study the basic syntax of python first. Take a look at the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.5/tutorial/controlflow.html" rel="nofollow"><code>if</code> and <code>elif</code></a> in python.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There can be zero or more <code>elif</code> parts, and the <code>else</code> part is optional.
  <strong>The keyword <code>elif</code> is short for <code>else if</code></strong>, and is useful to avoid
  excessive indentation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So after the first <code>if</code> to check for more conditions, you need something like this:</p>
<pre><code>if cond1:
   # do something
elif cond2:
   # do something else
# more elif branches if needed, and finally else if there is something default
else:
   # do the default thing
</code></pre>
<hr/>
<p>There are more issues with your code.</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> The <code>input</code> is wrong as more than one argument is passed. You can use string's <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.format" rel="nofollow"><code>format</code></a> method like this:</p>
<pre><code>first_sale_amount = float(input("What is {}'s first sale amount?".format(name)))
</code></pre>
<p><strong>2.</strong> The condition in <code>while</code> has wrong logic. If you want check if the entered value is <strong>not</strong> in the range of 0-25000 inclusive, you should put a <code>not</code> before the condition like so:</p>
<pre><code>while not 0 &lt;= first_sale_amount &lt;= 25000:
        print('Error: that is not a valid sales amount. The amount must be greater than 0')
        first_sale_amount = float(input('Please enter a correct sale amount: '))
</code></pre>
<p><strong>and possibly 3, 4, 5 and so on.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>else</code> can't have a condition. Change to <code>elif</code> ("else if").</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you for your suggestions. I figured there would be more errors in the code, the error I asked about was just the first that came up in the debugger and I couldn't for the life of me figure out why it wasn't working. I just finished up the whole assignment and have everything debugged and working correctly though. Thanks for your time.</span>
