<p>It is an begginer question, but...</p>
<p>I have a list of characters</p>
<pre><code>list = [b, d, c, f, e, a]
</code></pre>
<p>and another list with the path.</p>
<pre><code>path = [5, 0, 2, 1, 4, 3]
</code></pre>
<p>How I can get the following output?</p>
<pre><code>[a, b, c, d, e, f]
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>So, you want to get the list composed of <code>list[i]</code> for each index in the same order as in <code>path</code> ? Just keep it stupid simple and do what you need to do:</p>
<pre><code>[list[i] for i in path]
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">So why you need the list called <code>path</code> ? Your output needs only <code>list</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I think you got the <code>output</code> wrong</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Don't call your <code>list</code>, <code>list</code>, it shadows the builtin name <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-list" rel="nofollow noreferrer">list</a>. And will surely give you problems down the line</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I flagged this question as unclear what you're asking.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@GarrettR That's how I interpreted the question at first, but it does not match OP's expected output. In fact, I think all those massively downvoted answers got it exactly right.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">As simple as it is, I think this is actually what OP is looking for, although the questions is somewhat misleading.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is correct answer , but we shouldn't give right answer to OP that didn't have tried anything so far.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Arman Just because there is no evidence that FÃ¡bio Alves tried anything does not mean that we need to take that as proof that he has not tried anything. The question and answer may still provide help to others.</span>
