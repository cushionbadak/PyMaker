<pre><code>Phone  - What type of phone do you have?
phone  - What type of phone do you have?

<p>The problem may be in values that you provide as arguments to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.match" rel="nofollow">re.match</a>:</p>
<p>Given the keywords in user input "i have a phone", <code>re.match</code> will return True because some of the keywords (in this case "i", "phone") are present in the variable <code>line</code> (in this case a line containing "iphone").</p>
<ul>
<li>Update: @Jasper is right - "i" would also match "iphone". Edited the answer accordingly (initially I noticed only that "phone" would be a match).</li>
</ul>
<p>P.S. It would help if you provided a snippet of the text file that the code works with. that would make it more clear what is happening. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">The problem is that the <code>i</code> of <code>i have ...</code> matches the <code>i</code> of <code>iphone</code>. What is your goal?</span>
