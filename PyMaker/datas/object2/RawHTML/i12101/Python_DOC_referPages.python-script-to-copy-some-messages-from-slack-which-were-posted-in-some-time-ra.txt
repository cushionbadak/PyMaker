<p>I want to write a python script using some slack API's which will be able to copy some messages which were pasted between say 10AM to 11AM in a <code>channel A</code> &amp; then paste the same messages in a different <code>channel B</code>.</p>
<p>I know that it's easy to write a message in slack via a python script, but is it also possible to pull some messages out of slack ?</p>

<p>One way would be to use Requests (or any http client you like) with this endpoint: <a href="https://api.slack.com/methods/channels.history" rel="nofollow">https://api.slack.com/methods/channels.history</a></p>
<p>This returns a list of messages for a given channel that you can filter with the <code>oldest</code> and <code>latest</code> arguments.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Yes, this seems to be nice , &amp; by request you mean <a href="http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python-requests.org/en/master</a> ? right??</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Absolutely - if you want something present in the standard library you can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.request.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.request.html</a> or <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/urllib2.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/2/library/urllib2.html</a> if you're on Python 2.x</span>
