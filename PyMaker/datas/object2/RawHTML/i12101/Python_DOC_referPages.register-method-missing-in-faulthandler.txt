<p>I'm getting the following error message while trying to kick off iPython's notebook:</p>
<pre><code> File "C:\Python34\lib\site-packages\ipykernel\kernelapp.py", line 326, in patch_io
    faulthandler_register = faulthandler.register
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'register'
</code></pre>
<p>This is under Python 3.4.  Looking in Python documentation I see that <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/faulthandler.html#faulthandler.register" rel="nofollow">register is a documented method</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>faulthandler.register(signum, file=sys.stderr, all_threads=True,
  chain=False)    </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Register a user signal: install a handler for the
    signum signal to dump the traceback of all threads, or of the current
    thread if all_threads is False, into file. Call the previous handler
    if chain is True.</p>

<p>However looking into the faulthandler module, I don't see the method listed:</p>

<p>I just ran into the same issue (python 3.5-64, windows, fully updated), you can upgrade ipykernel to an newer version (<code>&gt;=4.3.1</code>) version where this is  resolved :</p>
<p><code>pip install ipykernel --upgrade
</code></p>
<p>You can also downgrade it (to <code>&lt;4.3</code>) but downgraded is not recommended. </p>
<p>There is a bug in ipykernel 4.3.0. which was introduced during the 4.2.x cycle and affect only windows users.</p>
<p>An issue has been filled <a href="https://github.com/ipython/ipykernel/issues/107" rel="nofollow">on GitHub</a>, which will be fixed in 4.3.1 which has now been released. </p>

<p>If you read a bit further down in the documentation you quoted, you'll see the reason <code>register</code> is not available for you:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not available on Windows.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You might have packages out of date, try <code>pip install --upgrade jupyter ipython</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">they are brand new installs.  But regardless, I did check versions.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">And it looks like the update is out and is solving this issue.  Thanks.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Oh, crap... Good catch!  Interesting, so this means that iPython's Notebook server doesn't work under Windows. I didn't see any statements to this fact.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It's not deliberate. There will be a new release of ipykernel (4.3.1) very soon to fix that.</span>
