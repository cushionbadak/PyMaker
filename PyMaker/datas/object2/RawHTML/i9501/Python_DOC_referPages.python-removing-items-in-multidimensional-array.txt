<p>I have a multidimensional array such as this:</p>
<pre><code>[["asdf","bmnl", "123","456,"0","999","1234","3456"],["qwer","tyui","789","657,"122","9","673","1"]]
</code></pre>
<p>However, in the multidimensional array, only the last 6items of each array are needed and the first two are not needed. How can I remove the first two pieces of data from each of the arrays within the multidimensional array so it would look like:</p>
<pre><code>[["123","456,"0","999","1234","3456"],["789","657,"122","9","673","1"]]
</code></pre>
<p>So far, I have done this:</p>
<pre><code>list1 = []
list2 = []
for row in rows:
    list1.append(row[0].split(',')) #to put the split list into the top i i.e. [["asdf","bmnl", "123","456,"0","999","1234","3456"]["qwer","tyui","789","657,"122","9","673","1"]]
for i in list1:
    for index in len(list1):
        if index &gt;=2:
             list2.append(index) #this does not work and causes errors
</code></pre>
<p>How could I go about fixing this so the output would be:</p>
<pre><code>[["123","456,"0","999","1234","3456"],["789","657,"122","9","673","1"]]
</code></pre>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Just use a list comprehension and grab every element from index <code>2</code> and beyond in each sublist:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; array = [["asdf","bmnl", "123","456","0","999","1234","3456"],["qwer","tyui","789","657","122","9","673","1"]]
&gt;&gt;&gt; [sublist[2:] for sublist in array]
[['123', '456', '0', '999', '1234', '3456'], ['789', '657', '122', '9', '673', '1']]

<pre><code>lst = [["asdf","bmnl", "123","456","0","999","1234","3456"],["qwer","tyui","789","657","122","9","673","1"]]
for i in lst:
    del i[0:2] #deleting 0 and 1 index from each list

print lst

<p>This is a typical use case for a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">list comprehension</a>:</p>

<p>You can use a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">list comprehension</a> like below:</p>
<pre><code>[item[2:] for item in my_list]
</code></pre>
<p><code>item[2:]</code> called list slicing, and it means that for each sub-list of <code>my_list</code>, we take <code>items</code> from the index <code>2</code> till the last item.</p>
<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; my_list = [["asdf", "bmnl", "123", "456", "0", "999", "1234", "3456"], ["qwer", "tyui", "789", "657", "122", "9", "673", "1"]]
