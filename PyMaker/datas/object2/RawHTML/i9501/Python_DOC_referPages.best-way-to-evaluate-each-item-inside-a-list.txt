<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have a list of integers, let's say <code>myList</code>. I want to do something when every item is equal to one. The idea is to optimize this kind of code:</p>
<pre><code>if myList[0] == 1 and myList[1] == 1 and ... :
        do something
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Use the built-in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#all" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>all</code></a> function:</p>
<pre><code>if all(item == 1 for item in myList):
    do_something()
</code></pre>
<p>This is efficient because it will stop testing as soon as the <code>item == 1</code> condition fails.</p>
<hr/>
<p>FWIW, you <em>could</em> do it this way:</p>
<pre><code>if all(map((1).__eq__, myList)):
    do_something()
</code></pre>
<p>However, the first way is much nicer to read. And it's generally considered bad style to call "dunder" methods like <code>__eq__</code> directly. </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Use <code>all</code>:</p>
<pre><code>if all(x == 1 for x in myList):
    ...
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">make a boolean allOne, set it to True. Loop over every item, if it is 0, set it to false, and break out of the loop. continue with what you want  EDIT: while correct, you can use the all function..</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>if all(element == 1 for element in myList):</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">yes!!! this is what i need to do... what exactly do the keyword "all"?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">do not answer me ... i am looking for the response. Thanks a lot!</span>
