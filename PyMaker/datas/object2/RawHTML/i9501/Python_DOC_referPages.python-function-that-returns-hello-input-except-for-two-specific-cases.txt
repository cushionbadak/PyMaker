<p>I'm trying to create a Python function that returns a polite greeting for everyone except for Lewis and Clark. Here is what I tried:</p>
<pre><code>def politeGreeting(name):
    #if the user's name is Lewis or Clark, say "Oh, it's you." 
    if name == "Lewis" or "Clark":
        return("Oh, it's you")
    #if the user's name is anything else
    else:
        return("Hello," + name + "!")

name = input("please enter your name")        
print (politeGreeting(name))
</code></pre>
<p>Right now, this is printing <code>Oh, it's you</code> for everyone, not just for Lewis and Clark. I don't understand why - my IDE isn't returning any error messages. Please help if you can, thank you. </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This should fix your problem of not restating the condition <code>==</code> for each comparison. <code>Lewis</code> or <code>Clark</code>:</p>
<pre><code>def politeGreeting(name):
  #if the user's name is Lewis or Clark, say "Oh, it's you." 
  if name == "Lewis" or name == "Clark":
    return("Oh, it's you")
  #if the user's name is anything else
  else:
    return("Hello, " + name + "!")

name = input("Please enter your name:")        
print(politeGreeting(name))
</code></pre>
<p>However if you want to allow for different capitalizations of input try something like this which uses <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.lower" rel="nofollow noreferrer">str.lower()</a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.title" rel="nofollow noreferrer">str.title()</a>:</p>
<pre><code>def politeGreeting(name):
  #if the user's name is Lewis or Clark, say "Oh, it's you." 
  if name.lower() in {"lewis", "clark"}: # Use set for O(1) lookup time
    return("Oh, it's you " + name.title())
  #if the user's name is anything else
  else:
    return("Hello, " + name.title() + "!")

name = input("Please enter your name:")        
print(politeGreeting(name))
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>def politeGreeting(name):
    #if the user's name is Lewis or Clark, say "Oh, it's you." 
    if if name == "Lewis" or name == "Clark":

    #if the user's name is anything else
    else:
        return("Hello," + name + "!")

name = input("please enter your name")        
print (politeGreeting(name))
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The expression <code>name == "Lewis" or "Clarke"</code> will always evaluate to True. Use <code>name in ("Lewis", "Clarke")</code> instead.</p>
<pre><code>def politeGreeting(name):
    #if the user's name is Lewis or Clark, say "Oh, it's you." 
    if name in ("Lewis", "Clark"):
        return("Oh, it's you")
    #if the user's name is anything else
    else:
        return("Hello," + name + "!")

    name = input("please enter your name")        
    print (politeGreeting(name))
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">You must restate the condition for every condition! <code>if name == "Lewis" or name == "Clark":</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">You should describe what the problem is in the original code as well as providing the solution</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@shash678 Made sense after realizing I needed to restate the condition. Also good to know how to answer for different capitalization cases. Thanks for the link to repl.it - really cool compiler / IDE!</span>
