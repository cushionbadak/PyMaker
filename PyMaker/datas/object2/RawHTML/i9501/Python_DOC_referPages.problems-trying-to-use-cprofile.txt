<p>I am trying to run the code below at Python 2.7 GUI:</p>
<pre><code>python -m cProfile -s time abc.py
</code></pre>
<p>However here is the error I have:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; python -m cProfile -s time abc.py     
&gt;&gt;&gt;                  ^

<p>Any idea how can I solve it?</p>

<p>You need to run this from the command line, <strong>not</strong> a GUI or the interactive Python prompt. Seeing the <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> means you are on the interactive Python prompt.</p>
<p><strong>On the command line</strong> a.k.a terminal window, change to the directory in which <code>abc.py</code> is located and enter:</p>
<pre><code>python -m cProfile -s time abc.py

<p>I get this:</p>

<h2>EDIT</h2>
<p>If you want to do it from the interactive prompt, probably the easiest way is to use <a href="http://ipython.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">IPython</a> or <a href="https://jupyter.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Jupyter Notebook</a>. Then you can do this:</p>
<pre><code>[1] %run -m cProfile -s time abc.py
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>python -m ...</code>  is not itself Python syntax: it's a syntax for starting Python from outside.   Therefore, the Python interpreter (GUI or not) will fail to process that command.  (We know you're working from inside the Python interpreter because of the telltale <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> prompt.)</p>
<p>What does "from outside" mean?  It means you need to type that command at the <code>&gt;</code> prompt in the Command Window (in Windows) or at the <code>$</code> prompt in a terminal window running the bash shell (in other likely OSes).</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Side-note: DO NOT NAME YOUR MODULE <code>abc</code>! There is already a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/abc.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">built-in <code>abc</code> module</a> that is used to support abstract base classes (which are used in many parts of Python under the covers). If you name your module <code>abc.py</code> and run Python in the same directory as that file, it will shadow the built-in module, and you will get mysterious errors when it turns out Python (or some import you perform) actually depends on the original <code>abc</code> module. You might get away with it for a while, until you accidentally take a dependency on <code>abc</code> and everything dies.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thanks for the note ShadowRanger! abc was just a random name I used for this question, would defo take that note in the future though</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I have already changed the directory to where abc.py is located. Plus if it is because of the directory address, it wouldn't say "cProfile" is causing the syntax error, rather it would say "can't find file" instead I suppose?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You are in the interactive Python interpreter when you see <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>. You need to be on command line of your OS for this command to work.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, in prompt it does work, but i was thinking whether I can do that in interpreter, because interpreter is more flexible for me to copy and paste the result and analyse.</span>
