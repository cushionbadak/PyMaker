<p>I'm new to python and i am  trying to split the filenames that i have read from a directory. I could split the file names from the extension but splitting the name is what i want. Here is my code...can you help me on how to do this. I want to split error log and December with the date( i.e into two parts with error in one and date time into 2nd part.</p>
<pre><code>import os
import os.path
path = 'C:\\Users\\abc\\Desktop\\xls'
text_files = [os.path.splitext(f)[0] for f in os.listdir(path)]
print (text_files)
r = str(text_files)
f = "C:\\Users\\abc\\xls"
f = open('output.txt', 'w')
f.write(r)
f.close()
</code></pre>
<p>The exact names of files in the directory are : </p>
<ol>
<li>Error_Log_December_10_2016_06_19_05 PM.txt</li>
<li><p>Error_Log_December_15_2016_06_19_05 PM.txt</p>
<p>around 50 files are present like this which are to be split. Please help.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Since you already know how to remove the extension.</p>
<pre><code>v = 'Error_Log_December_15_2016_06_19_05 PM'

a = v.split('_')

errLog = '_'.join(a[0:2])

dateString = '_'.join(a[2:])
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>To split the file name between <code>Error_Log</code> and <code>December_...</code> you might want to look at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#strings" rel="nofollow noreferrer">string slicing</a></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If the name always start with <code>Error_Log</code> you simply silice it like an array of characters.</p>
<pre><code>v = "Error_Log_December_10_2016_06_19_05 PM.txt"
print v[0:9]
print v[10:]
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">What do you mean by splitting the name? What do you want the result to look like?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Forget about everything else. You just want to split a string in a particular way, the rest is a distraction. See how to create a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve">Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I want the file to be like this -- Error_Log &amp; December_10_2016_06_19_05 PM</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No, It doesn't work. Code runs but doesn't work</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ahh, I see what you mean. Its because you are not printing the variable, you have no output.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No, it says ----- 'list' object has no attribute 'split'!!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The above code first splits the string with <code>_</code> and then a list is created. This list is then joined such that you can get the desired two parts of that string. It should work @AkhilKodicherla</span>
