<p>I am trying to call the list I created in a sub-function, into another sub-function. Using parameters and call functions are my Achilles heel as it relates to python. I want to call the newList I created in the calculateZscore function, into mu globalChi function.</p>
<p>My current code: </p>
<pre><code>import os
import math

'''
c:/Scripts/Lab2Data
NCSIDS_ObsExp.txt
chisquare.txt
output.txt
'''
def main():
    directory = raw_input ("What is the working directory? ")    
    input_file = raw_input ("What is the name of the input file? ")    
    chiTable = raw_input ("What is the name of the chi-squared table? ")    
    outPut = raw_input ("What is the name of the output file? ")    
    path = os.path.join(directory,input_file)
    path_1 = os.path.join(directory, chiTable)
    path_2 =  os.path.join(directory, outPut)

if __name__ == "__main__":
   main()    

def calculateZscore(inFileName, outFileName):
    inputFile = open(inFileName,"r")  
    txtfile = open(outFileName, 'w')

for line in inputFile:
    newList = line.strip().split(',')
    obsExp = newList[-2:]
    obsExp = list(map(int, obsExp))
    obs = obsExp[0]
    exp = obsExp[1]
    zScore = (obs - exp) / math.sqrt(exp)
    zScore = map(str, [zScore])
    newList.extend(zScore)
    txtfile = open(outFileName, 'w')
    txtfile.writelines(newList) 

    inputFile.close() #close the files
    txtfile.close()
    return newList #return the list containing z scores

def globalChi(zscoreList):
print newList

<p>You should read about the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#defining-functions" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>return</code></a> statement. It is used to make a function return a result (the opposite of taking an argument), and cannot be used outside a function.
Here, you are doing the exact opposite.</p>
