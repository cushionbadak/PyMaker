<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I want to make a function to sort through the data from the file and put it in a dictionary. I have made the following:</p>
<pre><code>def fileread(filename, filetype, readlist):
returnslist = {}
with open(filename + "." + filetype, "r") as f:
    for line in f:
        for entry in readlist:
            if(line[:(entry.len() + 2)] == entry):
                returnslist[entry] = line[(entry.len() + 2):]
</code></pre>
<p>At the moment the laptop I am using can't use Python so I am working on an Online IDE which can't use files. Would this work? I want the file to work out like a config file. For example:</p>
<pre><code>Int1: 2
Int2: 12
Int3: 32
Int4: 65
Str1: Lol
Bool1: True
</code></pre>
<p>My code should make the dictionary:</p>
<pre><code>{"Int1": "2", "Int2": "12", "Int3": "32", "Int4": "65", "Str1": "Lol", "Bool1": "True"}
</code></pre>
<p>Is there a more cleaner way of doing this? I can't think of any. Also can you see any errors in this?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>import yaml

my_data = """
    Int1: 2
    Int2: 12

data_dict = yaml.load(my_data)

<span class="comment-copy">if you need something like "config file" then better use <code>pickle</code>, <code>YAML</code> or <code>JSON</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">if you have <code>Int1: 2</code> in file then read line, split it using <code>"Int1: 2".split(':')</code> and you get two strings <code>Int1</code> and <code>2</code> (with spaces so use <code>strip()</code>), and then you can check <code>if "Int1" in readlist</code></span>
