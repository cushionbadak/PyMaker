<p>You don't have Python in your <code>PATH</code> environment variable. You should <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/9674051/70170">add to your PATH environment variable</a> <code>;C:\Python27;C:\Python27\Scripts</code> (or wherever you installed your Python).</p>
<p>Alternatively, use <code>py -m pip</code> in place of <code>python -m pip</code>. If you have a late version of Python installed, <code>py</code> launcher will be in your path already.</p>
