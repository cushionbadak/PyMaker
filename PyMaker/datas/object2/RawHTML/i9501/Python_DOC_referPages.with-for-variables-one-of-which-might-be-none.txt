<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have a function which acquires 1 or 2 resources:</p>
<pre><code>def my_function():
  res1 = None
  if some_cond:
    res1 = get_resouce1()

  res2 = get_resouce2()
  return res2, res1
</code></pre>
<p>When I'm doing this and <code>some_cond</code> is False, I get an exception:</p>
<pre><code>  a2, a1 = my_function() 
  with a2, a1:
    # doing something.....


    # "a1" might be None here
    # thus the exception `AttributeError: __exit__` 
    # might be thrown when `a1` is None.

  print("helllllloooo")
</code></pre>
<p>How to fix that?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Quite new to Python here, but why don't you store your (res2,res1) return values in a tuple, and then go through it with a for loop?</p>
<p>Like :</p>
<pre><code>foo = my_function()

for element in foo:
    doSomething(element)
</code></pre>
<p>And you could then check if a value is None.</p>
<p>(Sorry if this is not THE right way, trying to learn too... :))</p>
<p>EDIT :</p>
<p>Of course, I guess you can then use <em>with</em> on each element if it is not <em>None</em></p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Do not return <code>None</code>, use <em>Null Object Pattern</em> and return dummy context manager. It may be done quickly with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html#contextlib.contextmanager" rel="nofollow noreferrer">contextlib.contextmanager</a> decorator.</p>
<pre><code>import contextlib
@contextlib.contextmanager
def null_ctx_mgr():  # context manager that does nothing on enter and exit
    yield

def get_ctx_mgrs():
    # your function - returns context managers, never returns None
    return null_ctx_mgr(), null_ctx_mgr()

# actual usage
c1, c2 = get_ctx_mgrs()
with c1, c2:
    print(1)
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">As mentioned by the error message ; I guess the value of <code>a1</code> is <code>None</code> due to which <code>with</code> is unable to call <code>__enter__</code> and <code>__exit__</code> magic functions</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MoinuddinQuadri, you've guessed right.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Moinuddin Quadri : I understand my solution is wrong, and I was surprised seeing my proposition accepted by OP... But could anyone please tell me what's wrong with my noob approach instead of just downvoting ? Thanks in advance</span>
<span class="comment-copy">how can that be applied to my code?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">By returning empty context manager instead of <code>None</code>? Are you expecting an answer which you can copy paste without any effort? That's not how Stack Overflow works.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">it returns yield in your case. how can that be applied to my code?</span>
