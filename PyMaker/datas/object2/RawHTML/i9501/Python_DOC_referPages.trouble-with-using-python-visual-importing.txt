<p>I'm trying to use the visual function in python which I have imported but I am still getting an error saying <code>"no module named visual"</code>.</p>
<p>What can i do to fix this?</p>
<p>My code: </p>
<pre><code>     from visual import *
</code></pre>
<p>The error:</p>
<pre><code>    line 3, in &lt;module&gt;
    from visual import *
    ImportError: No module named 'visual'
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This means that you don't have the module 'visual' installed. Have you installed the module?
 If you have installed it that means your IDE isn't finding the module.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>In python <code>from something import *</code> probably means one of:</p>
<ol>
<li>You are trying to import things (functions, variables, classes) from another module in the current path, <code>something.py</code>, or <code>something/__init__.py</code>. </li>
<li>You are trying to import from the module <code>something</code> found in the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">standard library</a>.</li>
<li>You are trying to import from a 3rd-party module probably installed from the <a href="https://pypi.python.org" rel="nofollow noreferrer">python package index</a> with <code>pip install something</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>So.... what is <code>visual</code> in your case?</p>

<span class="comment-copy">What is visual? Where's it supposed to come from?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Please make use of the code formatting. You are trying to import the module <code>visual</code> which can not be found in your python path. So you need to install it. For this you can use the packet manager <code>pip</code>.</span>
