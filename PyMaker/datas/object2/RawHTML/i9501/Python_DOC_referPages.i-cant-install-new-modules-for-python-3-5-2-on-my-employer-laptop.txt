<p>I am trying to install openpyxl 2.4.1 on Python 3.5.2 using pip. I tried running the code below in both Windows' Command Prompt and the Python 3.5 Desktop app created when I installed the software: </p>
<pre><code>python pip install openpyxl
</code></pre>
<p>I also tried</p>
<pre><code>pip install openpyxl
</code></pre>
<p>Error I receive from cmd.exe:</p>
<pre><code>C:\Users\'username'&gt;pip install openpyxl
'pip' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.

C:\Users\'username'&gt;python pip install openpyxl
'python' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
</code></pre>
<p>I think the issue is that I'm using my employer laptop so the file path is different; i.e. instead of <code>C:\Python35\...</code>; mine is <code>C:\Users\'username'\AppData...\Programs\Python 3.5</code></p>
<p>Could this be my problem, and, if so, how do I fix it?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>You're trying to run <code>pip</code> <em>in the Python interpreter</em>, while you should run it in <strong>the terminal</strong> (i. e. <code>cmd.exe</code>).</p>

<span class="comment-copy">That shouldn't be a problem. What was the error message when you tried <code>pip install openpyxl</code>? That is the correct command.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@mprat &gt;&gt;&gt; pip install openpyxl   File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1     pip install openpyxl               ^ SyntaxError: invalid syntax &gt;&gt;&gt;</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sorry I was not specific enough. You have to type that into the windows command prompt, not the Python Desktop app.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Python version 3.x.x has lots of issue with ref to installing packages so the packages which worked with older versions might throw error while trying to installing it in python 3.x.x</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@mprat apologies, I just updated the question with the error i receive from cmd.exe.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I tried using both because I wasn't sure why it wasn't working. Updated the question with the error I get from cmd.exe</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@iStillHaveToGoPee, now this is a different question... <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/installing/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">This</a> is what the Python docs says about installing modules on different platforms, including Windows.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">yes... I've read through the install guide but it does not address this issue. I have followed the guide to the letter but cmd.exe still doesn't recognize Python or pip as valid commands</span>
