<p>I was wondering how I'd select a set number of variables out of a list using python</p>
<p>For example:
If my list was - <code>list=["a","b","c"]</code>
and I wanted to select 2 of the variables I the list how would I do so?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>import random
random.sample(set(list), 2)
</code></pre>
<p>This will select random two values from list</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Which two do you want? (I'm guessing by the "random" tag that you want to pick any two at random, but you should say that explicitly in your question.)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Please post a clear sample of the <b>input</b> and desired <b>output</b>.</span>
