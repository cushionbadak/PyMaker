<p>I was debugging my python script and came across <code>traceback</code> object, which is present at 2nd index in result, returned by <code>sys.exc_info()</code> function. However, I tried to google out information related to <code>traceback</code> object, but everywhere i got link to <code>traceback module</code> in standard python lib. Then, I tried doing <code>dir()</code> on traceback object, which gives me a list of attributes. In that list, following attributes looks interesting :-</p>
<pre><code> 1. tb_frame,
 2. tb_lasti,
 3. tb_lineno,
 4. tb_next
</code></pre>
<p>I know about tb_frame and tb_lineno, but what rest of other attributes indicates ? </p>
<p>Apologizing for bad English. Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>As specified by in docpage specified by @vaultah,</p>
<p>These all are special read-only attributes.
1. tb_next is the next level in the stack trace (towards the frame where the exception occurred), or None if there is no next level; 
2. tb_frame points to the execution frame of the current level; 
3. tb_lineno gives the line number where the exception occurred; 
4. tb_lasti indicates the precise instruction. </p>
<p><strong>Note :-</strong> 
The line number and last instruction in the traceback may differ from the line number of its frame object if the exception occurred in a try statement with no matching except clause or with a finally clause.</p>
