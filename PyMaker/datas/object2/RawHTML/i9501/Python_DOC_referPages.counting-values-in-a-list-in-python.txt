<p>I'm a beginner in python and having a hard time figuring out what the problem is with my code.</p>
<p>What i'm trying to do here is to convert a text into tuples in a list and then count the number of DTs in the list.</p>
<p>let's say the first three lines of the txt file looks below:</p>
<pre><code>The/DT Fulton/NNP County/NNP Grand/NNP Jury/NNP said/VBD Friday/NNP an/DT investigation/NN of/IN Atlanta/NNP 's/POS recent/JJ primary/JJ election/NN produced/VBD ``/`` no/DT evidence/NN ''/'' that/IN any/DT irregularities/NNS took/VBD place/NN ./. 
The/DT jury/NN further/RB said/VBD in/IN term-end/JJ presentments/NNS that/IN the/DT City/NNP Executive/NNP Committee/NNP ,/, which/WDT had/VBD over-all/JJ charge/NN of/IN the/DT election/NN ,/, ``/`` deserves/VBZ the/DT praise/NN and/CC thanks/NNS of/IN the/DT City/NNP of/IN Atlanta/NNP ''/'' for/IN the/DT manner/NN in/IN which/WDT the/DT election/NN was/VBD conducted/VBN ./.
The/DT September-October/NNP term/NN jury/NN had/VBD been/VBN charged/VBN by/IN Fulton/NNP Superior/NNP Court/NNP Judge/NNP Durwood/NNP Pye/NNP to/TO investigate/VB reports/NNS of/IN possible/JJ ``/`` irregularities/NNS ''/'' in/IN the/DT hard-fought/JJ primary/NN which/WDT was/VBD won/VBN by/IN Mayor-nominate/NNP Ivan/NNP Allen/NNP Jr./NNP ./. 
</code></pre>
<p>This was saved as "practice.txt" in the workspace.</p>
<p>So my code looks as below:</p>
<pre><code>with open("practice.txt") as myfile:
    for line in myfile:
        cnt += 1
        word = line.split()
        total_word_per_line += len(word)
        total_type_of_words += len(set(word))
        a = [tuple(i.split('/')) for i in word]

    for x in a:
        DT_sum = 0
        if x[1] == 'DT':
            DT_sum += 1

        total_DT_sum += DT_sum

    print total_DT_sum
</code></pre>
<p>But the output shows 2 for total_DT_sum, which means it only counted DTs in the third list. Any suggestion to count all DTs?</p>
<p>The desired output is 5(total number of DT from the three sentences above)</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If it is required to store your data in a list of tuples before counting the number of <code>'DT'</code>, you can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#filter" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>filter()</code></a> like this:</p>
<pre><code>my_list = []

with open('practice.txt', 'r') as f:
    for line in f:
        my_list.extend([tuple(i.split('/')) for i in line.split()])

res = filter(lambda i: i[1] == 'DT', my_list)
print(len(res))  # Output: 13
</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3.1/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>extend()</code></a> is used to add each line's constructed tuples to <code>my_list</code></p>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#filter" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>filter()</code></a> will return only items with <code>'DT'</code> in the second position.</p>
<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; res = filter(lambda i: i[1] == 'DT', my_list)
&gt;&gt;&gt; res
[('The', 'DT'), ('an', 'DT'), ('no', 'DT'), ('any', 'DT'), ('The', 'DT'), ('the', 'DT'), ('the', 'DT'), ('the', 'DT'), ('the', 'DT'), ('the', 'DT'), ('the', 'DT'), ('The', 'DT'), ('the', 'DT')]
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; len(res)
13

<p>Your error:</p>
<pre><code>for x in a:
    DT_sum = 0
</code></pre>
<p><code>DT_sum</code> is reset to 0 each time...</p>
<p>In case you want to do it from scratch, the simplest way to do it would be with a <code>sum</code> of the <code>count</code> on each line:</p>
<pre><code>with open("practice.txt") as myfile:
    nb_dt = sum(line.count("/DT") for line in my_file)
</code></pre>
<p>result is 13, not 5 as you stated (which can be manually verified)</p>
<p>That solution does not take into consideration word split. It means that it will find <code>/DTXXX</code> as well if there are some.</p>
<p>So a little more complex code does that:</p>
<pre><code>with open("practice.txt") as myfile:
    nb_dt = sum(1 if word.partition("/")[2]=="DT" else 0 for line in my_file for word in line.split())
</code></pre>
<p>Counts 1 for each time splitting according to <code>/</code> has <code>DT</code> on its right for each word of each line.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">You set <code>DT_sum</code> to 0 at the start of every iteration. You should move that initialisation to before the loop.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm just guessing, but should'nt the <code>DT_sum = 0</code> be before the <code>for x in a:</code> line?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">there are 13 <code>/DT</code> strings in your 3 sentences.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Is this a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41259747/how-to-convert-a-text-into-tuples-in-a-list-in-python">homework question</a> or something? This is the 3rd time I've seen this question this morning.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thank you so much!!!</span>
