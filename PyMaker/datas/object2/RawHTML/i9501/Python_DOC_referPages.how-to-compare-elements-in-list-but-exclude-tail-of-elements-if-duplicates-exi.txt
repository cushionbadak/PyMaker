<p>I have looked around here, and found a ton of list comparing methods. but not one that cover my specific question...so here it goes:</p>
<p>I have a list:</p>
<pre><code>currentList = ["Blur1['size']: $gui index:1", "Blur1['size']: $gui index:3",
               "Blur2['mix']: $gui?4:8"]
</code></pre>
<p>I want to remove duplicates, but I don't want to include <code>' index:1'</code> or <code>' index:3'</code> or <code>'index'</code> with any number behind it for that matter.</p>
<p>Then I want to make a new list, and if any duplicates are found in <code>currentList</code>, I would like to make a new list with only one element of the duplicates, but I would also like the new element to include the numbers found in the duplicates.</p>
<p>Essentially when the new list is created, I would like the difference to be like this:</p>
<pre><code>currentList = ["Blur1['size']: $gui index:1", "Blur1['size']: $gui index:3",
               "Blur2['mix']: $gui?4:8"]
</code></pre>
<p>and the new list created after comparing elements in <code>currentList</code>.</p>
<pre><code>newList = ["Blur1['size']: $gui 13", "Blur2['mix']: $gui?4:8"]
</code></pre>
<p>The new list only have 1 element of <code>"Blur1['size']: $gui"</code>
but it has the combined numbers 1 and 3 added to the tail of the string, coming from the duplicates in <code>currentList</code>.</p>
<p>I know how to remove duplicates leaving out the index, I could do that with a if test on if <code>'index'</code> exists in the string.. the problem I'm facing is that I want to keep the numbers behind <code>'index'</code> and recreate 1 single element with all the numbers behind the <code>'index'</code> string.</p>
<p>I hope this makes sense. I would greatly appreciate any help on this python problem.</p>

<p>An approach would be using an <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.OrderedDict" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>OrderedDict</code></a> (to keep the same order of <code>currentList</code>) with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.split" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>split()</code></a> and some <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">list comprehensions</a> like this:</p>
<pre><code>from collections import OrderedDict

current_list = ["Blur1['size']: $gui index:1", "Blur1['size']: $gui index:3",
                "Blur2['mix']: $gui?4:8"]

temp = [item.split('index:') for item in current_list]

d = OrderedDict()

for i in temp:
    if len(i) == 2:
        d[i[0]] = i[1] if i[0] not in d else '{}{}'.format(d[i[0]], i[1])
    else:
        d[i[0]] = ""

new_list = ['{}{}'.format(*item) for item in d.items()]
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; new_list
["Blur1['size']: $gui 13", "Blur2['mix']: $gui?4:8"]
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks @ettanany, very useful for keeping the order. Much appreciated!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You're welocme! Please let me know if it does not work for your generic use case, because I tested it only for your above <code>currentList</code>. For example, I do not know what you expect if you have <code>"Blur2['mix']: $gui?4:8"</code>, <code>"Blur2['mix']: $gui?4:9"</code> and <code>"Blur2['mix']: $gui?3:5"</code> in your list.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Seems to be working fine after a quick test. I'll let you know if I run into problems after more testing with different parameters. Thanks!</span>
