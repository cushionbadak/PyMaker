<p>I'm trying to make a simple log in program using python (still fairly new to it), and I have the log in information stored in a text file for the user to match in order to successfully log in. Whenever I run it it says "list index out of range" but I'm able to print out the value of that element in the list, which is where I'm confused. I am trying to add the first line (username) and the second line (password) in the file to the list to compare to the user inputted values for each field, but am unable to compare them.</p>
<pre><code>def main():
    username = getUsername()
    password = getPassword()
    authenticateUser(username, password)


def getUsername():
    username = input("Please enter your username: ")

    return username


def getPassword():
    password = input("Please enter your password: ")

    return password


def authenticateUser(username, password):
    credentials = []
    with open("account_information.txt") as f:
        content = f.read()
        credentials.append(content)

    if(username == credentials[0] and password == credentials[1]):
        print("Login Successful!")

    else:
        print("Login Failed")



main()

<p>You should use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.6/tutorial/inputoutput.html#methods-of-file-objects" rel="nofollow noreferrer">readline</a> to get your infos in a list :</p>
<pre><code>def authenticateUser(username, password):
    credentials = []
    with open("account_information.txt") as f:
        content = f.readlines()
</code></pre>
<p>Using this, accordingly to what you describe, content[0] will be your username and content<a href="https://docs.python.org/3.6/tutorial/inputoutput.html#methods-of-file-objects" rel="nofollow noreferrer" title="readline">2</a> your password.</p>

<p>Depending on what is in your <code>account_information.txt</code>, <code>file.read</code> might not be the function you want to use.</p>
<p>Indeed, <code>read</code> will return a <em>string</em>, that is a list of all the <em>characters</em> in the file. So if you have your username and password on two separate lines for instance</p>
<pre><code>foo
H0weSomeP4ssworD
</code></pre>
<p>you may instead use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html?highlight=readlines#io.IOBase.readlines" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>readlines</code></a> to parse your file into a list of strings where each element is a line within the file.</p>

<p>If you look at the python documentation at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.6/tutorial/inputoutput.html#methods-of-file-objects" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><em>7.2.1. Methods of File Objects</em></a>, you'll see</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To read a fileâ€™s contents, call f.read(size), which reads some quantity of data and returns it as a string or bytes object</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You will see that f.read() is not the function you are looking for. try f.readlines() instead to put the content in a list of lines.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you want to read all the lines of a file in a list you can also use list(f) or f.readlines().</p>

<p>After having <em>"your problem solved"</em>, I invite you to come back to your problem description:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Python giving list out of bounds but it shows both elements in the list</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What have you learned besides the fact that you have used the wrong method? I hope also something about your diagnostic skills. How should you print out a list to see how many items it contains?</p>
<p>If you do it like this</p>
<pre><code>items = []
items.append("hello\nworld")
for i in items:
    print(i)
</code></pre>
<p>you'll <strong><em>see</em> 2 items</strong>, but is this correct?</p>
<p>And python definitely reports that you're accessing the list <strong>out of bounds</strong>. You saw the conflict between your and python's perspective. </p>
<p>I think you should at least have learned using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/functions.html?highlight=len#len" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>len()</code></a> for out-of-bounds diagnostics today.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You only append one item to <code>credentials</code>. Why would you expect <code>credentials[1]</code> to be a thing?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Try printing the value of <code>credentials</code> after you have read in the file and you should see where you are going wrong.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I suggest to <b>think next</b> about the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/9202224/2932052">actual password input</a> and about <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/7014953/2932052">storing passwords other than in plain text</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, I thought that if I did just f.read() it would give me each line in the file to add to the list. Using readlines() gave me the username and password, I just had to strip the newline for it to work.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Adding typography and a link to the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.6/tutorial/inputoutput.html#methods-of-file-objects" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>readline</code></a> suggestion would help to improve your answer.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You're right, will do</span>
<span class="comment-copy">...splitting the file content afterwards would be another option ;)</span>
