<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have to create a list of lists that is summarized below:</p>
<pre><code>list_of_lists = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3]....[0,N]]
</code></pre>
<p>Basically just need the first element of each sub-list to be 0, and the second element to be 1 more than the prior value of the second element. </p>
<p>The value for N is about 2000, so obviously I do not want to type out the whole thing. Is there a simple way to automate with Python?</p>
<p>Thank You</p>

<p>You can use simple list comprehension with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-range" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>range</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; N = 5
&gt;&gt;&gt; [[0, i] for i in range(1, N + 1)]
[[0, 1], [0, 2], [0, 3], [0, 4], [0, 5]]
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Have you made any attempt at achieving this programmatically? Python is, after all, a programming language, not a text editor - automation is the main goal.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Awesome. That is for sure going to work. Thank you!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I just wanted to add this one as well. I have been getting more and more into functional programming.  <code>list(map(lambda x: [0, x + 1], range(1, N + 1)))</code></span>
