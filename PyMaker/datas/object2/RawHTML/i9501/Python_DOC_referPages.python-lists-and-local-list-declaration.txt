<p>Python is the interpreted language and it hasn't such statements.</p>
<p>Here is from the documentation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Private” instance variables that cannot be accessed except from inside an object don’t exist in Python. However, there is a convention that is followed by most Python code: a name prefixed with an underscore (e.g. _spam) should be treated as a non-public part of the API (whether it is a function, a method or a data member). It should be considered an implementation detail and subject to change without notice</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can notice such <code>_pseudo_private_var</code>(one underscore) naming.It is just a convention, it just tells you SHOUDN'T touch this variable but you CAN change value of this one at the same time. It is a python). There is <code>__dynamic_obj_relative_naming</code> as well(two underscores).</p>
<p>More about scopes and namespaces rules you could find here <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#tut-private" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Classes, namespace and scope rules</a>. There are few interesting statements you are interested in probably <code>global</code> and <code>nonlocal</code>. They are like opposites of yours.</p>
