<p>I am new to python - however have encountered a problem</p>
<p>I have a file saved which looks like:</p>
<pre><code>a,1
b,2
c,3
</code></pre>
<p>I can convert this to a dictionary by using this code:</p>
<pre><code>file = open("dict.txt",'r')
dictionary = {}

    for line in file:
        x = line.split(",")
        key = x[0]
        value = x[1]
        value = value [:-1]
        dictionary[key] = value
</code></pre>
<p>There is code that allows the user to element (so dictionary now consists of a:1, b:2, c:3, d:4)</p>
<p>However, I need to get the dictionary in the form mentioned above</p>
<p>So</p>
<pre><code>a,1
b,2
c,3
d,4
</code></pre>
<p>Is this possible?</p>
<p>Also if some explanations could go with the answer I'd appreciate it</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>For what you've specified, you can loop through a dictionary's key/value pairs using the <code>items()</code> function, and write each pair to the file:</p>
<p>
<pre><code>data_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}

with open('data.txt', 'w') as file:
    for key, value in data_dict.items():
        file.write(str(key) + ',' + str(value) + '\n')
</code></pre>
<p>Of course, change <code>data_dict</code> to your dictionary, etc - this is just an example. </p>
<p>There are a couple of edge cases where this will not work, such as if either the key or the value contain commas. If you're looking to properly store comma-separated data, you may want to have a look at the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">builtin csv module</a>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Use the <code>csvWriter</code> module.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm trying to find a solution without importing modules</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Then use a simple <code>for</code> loop that iterates over the dictionary, and writes the key and value separated by comma.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Can I ask what is wrong with importing modules?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Your example works as long as the keys do not have commas.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Nope, that's not how CSV works. When there is a comma in a CSV field, it is escaped (<code>\,</code>): <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/769621/dealing-with-commas-in-a-csv-file" title="dealing with commas in a csv file">stackoverflow.com/questions/769621/â€¦</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">It' ok, I'm just warning the OP about its limitations.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@DYZ i'll edit a description of the limitations into the post :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks! It seems to work</span>
