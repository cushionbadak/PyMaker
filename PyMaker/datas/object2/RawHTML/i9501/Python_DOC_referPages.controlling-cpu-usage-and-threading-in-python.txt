<p>I'm running a computation heavy program in Python that takes about 10 minutes to run on my system. When I look at CPU usage, one of eight cores is hovering at about 70%, a second is at about 20%, and the rest are close to 0%.Is there any way I can force the program into 100% usage of a single core? </p>
<p>edit: I recognize that utilizing all 8 cores isn't a great option, but is there a way to force the one core into 100% usage?</p>

<p>For multi-core applications you should use the <code>multiprocessing</code> module instead of <code>threading</code>. Python has some (well documented) performance issues with threads. Search google for Global Interpreter Lock for more information about Python and thread performance</p>

<p>Python isn't really multithreaded. You can create threads as a convenient way to manage logical processes, but the application itself has a <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/GlobalInterpreterLock" rel="nofollow noreferrer">global thread lock</a>. Because of this, you'll only ever be able to utilize a single thread.</p>
<p>You can use a different flavor of python, but that may provide you with other issues. If you're willing to break it out into distinct processes, you may be able to utilize the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">subprocess</a> module. This creates two distinct python processes, but they can operate independently. Unfortunately, you'll have to code a method by which they communicate.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">if there is it wouldn't be specific to python, it'd be for your operating system which you have not mentioned.</span>
