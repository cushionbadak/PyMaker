<p>I'm trying to install the io module in python3.4 or in py 2.7 on my Win10 with </p>
<pre><code>python -m pip install io
</code></pre>
<p>in order to use io.StringIO with pycurl but in both cases it says:</p>
<pre><code>   Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement io (from versions: )
   No matching distribution found for io
</code></pre>
<p>I actually want to use curl with the GET method to access a https site on spotify <br/>and process the json result...</p>
<p>Any idea?<br/>
Thanks</p>

<p>You do not have to explicitly install <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/io.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>io</code></a>. It comes along with python bundle at the time of installing python. Within your code, just do:</p>
<pre><code>import io
</code></pre>
<p>and it will work fine</p>

<p>The <code>io</code> module is part of Python <em>already</em>. It is in the standard library from Python 2.6 onwards. See the <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/io.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python 2</a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python 3</a> versions of the documentation.</p>
<p>In fact, there is no <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/io" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>io</code> package on PyPI</a> <em>to</em> install (the link gives a 404 not-found error).</p>
<p>Note that I expect pycurl to write <em>bytestrings</em>, not Unicode text. You probably want to use <code>io.BytesIO</code> instead here. See <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19606447/pycurl-and-io-stringio-pycurl-error-23-failed-writing-body">Pycurl and io.StringIO - pycurl.error: (23, 'Failed writing body)</a> and the <a href="http://pycurl.io/docs/latest/unicode.html#writing-to-stringio-bytesio" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PyCurl documentation</a>.</p>
