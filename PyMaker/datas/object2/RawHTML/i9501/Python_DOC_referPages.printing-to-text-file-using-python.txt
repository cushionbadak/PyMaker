<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have written the following code and have executed it several times:</p>
<pre><code>import statements....

#Scrape some information....
text_file = open("Output.txt", "w")
text_file.write('some text')
for each in array:
   #some code to find the value of row...
   text_file.write(str(row.encode('ascii', errors='ignore')))
   print (row.encode('ascii', errors='ignore'))
text_file.close()
</code></pre>
<p>However, only the 'some text' is written to the file. I have printed the row text and it produces the correct output. What am I doing wrong?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Open the file in as open("Output.txt", "a") instead of just "w". This will allow you to append the rest of the text.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">That code won't work. You'll get an <code>IndexError</code> and you need <code>range</code> to iterate on the array or simply iterate on the array directly</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MosesKoledoye The code executes fine and prints the right output. However, it is not written to the file.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">that looks like it should work, you sure is not that you have the output file open somewhere else like a text editor and that is causing some interference/confusion? if so, close those, run the code and then check the file. Also, the recommended way to work with files is with the <code>with</code> statement</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Copperfield Nope, the text file isn't open. Running in Atom v1.12.7 using Script package.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I also think your code should work. Could you try to change the code <code>text_file.write(str(row.encode('ascii', errors='ignore')))</code> to <code>text_file.write('ok\n')</code> to see whether the <code>ok\n</code>-s are writed into the <code>Output.txt</code>? If yes, then you should check what it's returned in <code>str(row.encode('ascii', errors='ignore'))</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Did that but received this error: <code>ValueError: must have exactly one of create/read/write/append mode</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">I think the error is pretty verbose. Python doesn't take mixes of file modes as parameter in <code>open()</code>. Replace <code>wa</code> with <code>a</code>.</span>
