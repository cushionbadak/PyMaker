<p>What is the difference between a MappingView container and a Sized container? Any examples on how to implement a MappingView container? </p>
<p>I might be misunderstanding ABCs and the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.abc.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs</a> entirely, but a MappingView container is  any container that inherits from Sized, right? If so, then why doesn't my dummy example work?</p>
<pre><code>import collections

class MySized:
    def __len__():
        pass

class MyMappingView(MySized):
    pass

print(issubclass(MySized, collections.Sized)) # True
print(issubclass(MyMappingView, collections.MappingView)) # False
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Because you don't subclass from it (virtually or otherwise). <code>MappingView</code> is used as a base class for the <code>keys/items/values</code> views. <code>Sized</code> is used for any object for which getting its size (<code>len</code>) makes sense. </p>
<p>These <code>ABC</code>s are used to check if certain objects in Python follow the interface they define. Instead of creating a custom <code>MappingView</code> you can just <code>register</code> any new classes that conform to it. </p>
<p>Suffice to say, you wouldn't <code>register</code> a class to <code>MappingView</code> since it used solely as a base class to provide a default <code>__len__</code>, <code>__repr__</code> and <code>__init__</code> to <code>Keys/Values/Items</code> views. If you have defined a new mapping type that returns custom views, simply register these views to the appropriate <code>Keys/Values/Items</code> views.</p>
