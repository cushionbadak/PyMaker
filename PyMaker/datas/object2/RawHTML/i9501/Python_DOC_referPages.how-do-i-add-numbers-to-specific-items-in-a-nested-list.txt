<p>So I'm working on a school project themed on Christmas and am a bit stuck.
From the brief, the program is meant to deliver presents to children and so I am trying to remove one present at a time from this list:</p>
<pre><code>Presents = [["Toys",10],["Games",5],["Sweets",15]]
</code></pre>
<p>However, I have yet to find a way to do this as I can't seem to be able to minus one singular number from one section of this nested list.</p>
<p>In simple is it possible from this list:</p>
<pre><code>Presents = [["Toys",10],["Games",5],["Sweets",15]]
</code></pre>
<p>to, for example, just remove one toy and then end up with the list as</p>
<pre><code>Presents = [["Toys",9],["Games",5],["Sweets",15]]
</code></pre>
<p>instead of having toys as 10.</p>
<p>If so please can someone help me as this is due very soon</p>
<p>Thank you in advance</p>

<p>You should be using <code>collections.OrderedDict</code> here. You can convert this to dict as:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from collections import OrderedDict   # To also maintain order of original list

&gt;&gt;&gt; Presents = [["Toys",10],["Games",5],["Sweets",15]]
&gt;&gt;&gt; my_dict = OrderedDict(Presents)
&gt;&gt;&gt; my_dict
OrderedDict([('Toys', 10), ('Games', 5), ('Sweets', 15)])
</code></pre>
<p>Then, to decrease the value of <code>"Toys"</code> key, do:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; my_dict['Toys'] -= 1
&gt;&gt;&gt; my_dict['Toys']
9
</code></pre>
<p>For converting it back to <code>list</code> of <code>tuples</code>, call <code>dict.items()</code> as:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; list(my_dict.items())
[('Toys', 9), ('Games', 5), ('Sweets', 15)]
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">You are using the wrong dataformat. Why not use a dictionary instead? Or better still, use a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.Counter" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>Counter()</code></a>, which is a dictionary specialising in amounts per key. <code>Presents['Toys'] -= 1</code> is then trivial.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I haven't really played about with dictionaries and especially not counter() but I will definitely try that, thank you!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks a lot! I will try this out now.</span>
