<p>Recently I've deployed a python bot on Heroku and every time I try to run it, this error pops up. </p>

<p>Here's the code block it refers to. I do understand the error they throwing but can't see the cause? (Code was from a Git repository.) </p>

        except Exception as e:
            print(str(e)) # prints the error msg, if u dont want it comment it out
            pass</code></pre>
<p>Can someone help? Give me an eye? or do roast me XD</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>First, you cannot have no code under the <code>if</code> statement. That is the most likely culprit and you can fix this by adding <code>pass</code> in that block. If you want to test this for yourself, you can run the following very simple example and verify that the interpreter gives an error when you try to run it.</p>
<pre><code>if 1 == 1:
else:
    print "This will never print."
</code></pre>
<p>Second, it is difficult to tell because of re-encoding on SO, but you may also have mixed spaces and tabs incorrectly. If you are using vim, you can do <code>set list</code> to show the invisible characters and make sure you are consistent.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Your code has an <code>if</code> statement with no instructions:</p>
<pre><code>if("false" in retweet_ed):
    #call what u want to do here
    #for example :
    #fav(tweet_sid)
    #retweet(tweet_sid)
</code></pre>
<p>Python expects an indent, but since everything is commented out, there is none.</p>
<p>This is basically what the error indicates:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>2016-12-28 T04:32:08.770168+00:00 app[worker.1]: else:</p>
<p>2016-12-28 T04:32:08.770171+00:00 app[worker.1]:^</p>
<p>2016-12-28 T04:32:08.770172+00:00 app[worker.1]: IndentationError:
  expected an indented block</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You cannot have an <code>else</code> statement that is not following an indented block (that is, an <code>if</code> block, or even a <code>for</code>).</p>
<hr/>
<p>If you want to keep the <code>if</code> in plain code, add a <code>pass</code> statement, as for the following <code>else</code>:</p>
<pre><code>if("false" in retweet_ed):
    #call what u want to do here
    #for example :
    #fav(tweet_sid)
    #retweet(tweet_sid)
    pass
</code></pre>
<p>Then, the code will not raise any <code>IndentationError</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You need to include something in the if statement. Just type </p>
<pre><code>pass
</code></pre>
<p>Or set a useless variable for now.</p>
<p>And also, indent everything by one indent I think (because of the first line, correct me if I'm wrong.)</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Yes that can be it. but I'm running on free services? any free alternative for this? thanks.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@AACaN, I do not understand your question. You do not need to pay to change the code as far as I know.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">no i was referring to vim. i have implemented your solution, testing it now.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@AACaN, <a href="http://www.vim.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Vim</a> is free and open source. :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You are perfectly right; however, since OP's code ran until that <code>else</code> statement, I think it's just a bad copy-paste.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">"Just type print()" isn't a very good way to do a no-op in Python. In fact, <code>print()</code> does have an effect. Use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#pass-statements" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>pass</code></a> instead.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Chris Right, although something like <code>print("Entering if statement")</code> could help debug.</span>
