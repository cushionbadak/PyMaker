<p>I am using Selenium tests. 
I have a class with many functions and a setup function that runs before every function on the class:</p>
<pre><code>Class myClass (object):
    def setup(self):
        #something here
</code></pre>
<p>I would like to detect on setup function which function in going to run after. How can I do that?
Thank you !</p>

<p>Unit-tests executes test functions in lexicographic order by their names.</p>

<p>Note The order in which the various tests will be run is determined by sorting the test method names with respect to the built-in ordering for strings.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that if you care about the order of execution of tests then you've done something wrong: tests should be independent of each other and should not rely on the order they are executed in.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">maybe using a decorator that would run before every function. In that decorator, put the code you want to call before your function</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I know that the tests executes by order, but I want to save in variable the name of the upcoming function or an ID. it it possible ?</span>
