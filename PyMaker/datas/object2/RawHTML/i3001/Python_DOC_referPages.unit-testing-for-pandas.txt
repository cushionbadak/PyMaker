<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I am trying to unit test a class that I have written in Python called NeuralNetworkModel(). It is a class that takes in a file and trains a ANN model and saves it as a pickle file. Currently I have a very basic unit test that the class is reading in a file as a data frame correctly. My code is below.</p>
<pre><code>import unittest
import pandas as pd
from pandas.util.testing import assert_frame_equal
from NN_model import NeuralNetworkModel

class NeuralNetworkModel(unittest.TestCase):

    def test(self):
        self.assertTrue(True)

    @classmethod
    def set_up(cls):
        """ SetUp """
        test_input_dir = '/home/student/data_analytics/prediction_model/clean_files/'
        test_file_name = '25_1.csv'
        try:
            data = pd.read_csv(test_input_dir + test_file_name, sep = ',')
        except IOError:
            print('Cannot Open File')
        cls.fixture = data

    def test_dataFrame_constrcuted_as_expected(self):
        """ Test that the dataframe read in equals what you expect"""
        foo = pd.DataFrame()
        assert_frame_equal(self.fixture, foo)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
</code></pre>
<p>Error I get when I run this file is </p>

<p>I am very new to unit testing and I struggle with it, but I can't work out why my test isn't passing?</p>

<p>Make sure you're naming things correctly. <code>unittest</code> doesn't recognize <code>set_up()</code>, so it never gets called. Rename it to <code>setUpClass()</code> and it should work.</p>
