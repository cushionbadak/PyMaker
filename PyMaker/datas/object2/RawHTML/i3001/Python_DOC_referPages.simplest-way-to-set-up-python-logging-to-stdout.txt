<p>I have the following to set up a basic logger to print output in a cron job:</p>
<pre><code>import logging
log=logging.getLogger()
log.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
log.addHandler(logging.StreamHandler())
log.info('hi')
</code></pre>
<p>Is this the most straightforward way to do this, or is there a better method?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you just need to print the messages to the stdout, then <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logging.basicConfig" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>logging.basicConfig</code></a> is a handy shortcut for the configuration you listed. It will create a <code>StreamHandler</code>, attach the default <code>Formatter</code> to it and attach the handler to the root logger.</p>
<pre><code>import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
logging.getLogger().info('hi')
</code></pre>
<p>Check out the docs for more configuration possibilities; for example,</p>
<pre><code>logging.basicConfig(filename='some.log', level=logging.DEBUG)
</code></pre>
<p>will configure writing to file <code>some.log</code> instead of stdout.</p>
<p>Note that <code>logging.basicConfig</code> won't do a thing if the logger is already configured (meaning that there are handlers attached to the root logger already). So this code:</p>
<pre><code>import logging

logging.getLogger().addHandler(logging.FileHandler(filename='some.log'))
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
</code></pre>
<p>will not configure logging to stdout anymore; you will have to do it yourself.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Can you just write to a file?  A coworker once pointed this out to me, and for my situation that was enough.  Certainly simpler and avoids a dependency which can break easily.  EDIT: I initially misunderstood your question, thinking logging wasn't working for you.  As long as logging is working, your question is valid.  I do not know the answer offhand, unfortunately</span>
