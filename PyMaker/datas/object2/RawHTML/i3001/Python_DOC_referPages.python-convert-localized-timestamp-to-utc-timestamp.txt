<p>An external device provides me a titmestamp IN LOCALIZED TIMEZONE.
This means I get the number of seconds since 1970 January,1st 00:00:00 IN LOCALTIME.</p>
<p>I need to convert this to UTC timestamp (or any other standard notation) to use it to set the Linux clock (e.g.: "date -s @&lt; timestamp &gt;").
My current TZ is CEST (Europe/Rome), but that might change.</p>
<p>What is the right way to do that?</p>
</div>

<p>Just apply to your retrieved timestamp the local time zone's difference from UTC - the easiest way to do that is to use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.altzone" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>time.altzone</code></a> (if you don't want to account for DST, use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.timezone" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>time.timezone</code></a> instead) and add it to your timestamp, so:</p>
<pre><code>import time

timestamp = 1532821394  # current CEST timestamp
utc_timestamp = timestamp + time.altzone  # 1532814194, UTC+2 atm.
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can add/take the difference between your current timezone and UTC in seconds.</p>
<p>For example, if your are in CEST, then this is UTC+2, so you can simply do: </p>
<pre><code>utc = timestamp + (-1 * 2 * 60 * 60)
</code></pre>
<p>60 minutes in an hour, 60 seconds in a minute, 2 because we are 2 hours away from UTC and -1 because we are ahead of it.</p>
