<p>My Code:</p>
<pre><code>VowelsInString = False
String = 'bbbb000'
if 'a' or 'e' or 'i' or 'o' or 'u' in String:
  VowelsInString = True
elif 'a' or 'e' or 'i' or 'o' or 'u' not in String:
  VowelsInSting = False
</code></pre>
<p>So, I was expecting that when this ran, the if statement would be skipped and the  VowelsInString would remain False, but upon running the code, the value of VowelsInString is True. </p>
<p>I expect that I may have done something wrong whilst typing the vowel checker if argument as I am fairly new to the concept of reading characters in strings. I would appreciate if someone would help me on debugging this code.</p>
<p>If that however is not the case, than I would, again, appreciate if someone would help on telling me what I've done wrong.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>'a' or 'e' or 'i' or 'o' or 'u' in String:</code></p>
<p>evaluates as</p>
<p><code>('a') or ('e') or ('i') or ('o') or ('u' in String)</code>. </p>
<p>Since 'a' is truthy in python, this evaluates to <code>True</code>.</p>
<p>You can either write</p>
<p><code>if 'a' in String or 'e' in String ...</code></p>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code>def has_vowel(String):
    for s in String:
        if s in 'aeiou':
            return True
</code></pre>
<p>or perhaps</p>
<p><code>if any(s in String for s in 'aeiou'):</code></p>
<p>or (credit to Onyambu):</p>
<pre><code>import re
...
re.search('[aeiou]',string)

<p>Your conditions is a tautology:</p>
<pre><code>if 'a':
    print("I am always going to print")

</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Looks like you are evaluating the character itself as a bool.</p>
<p>It is detecting 'a' as True and returning true.</p>
<p>Try something more like:</p>
<pre><code>if any(i in '&lt;string&gt;' for i in ('a','b','c')):
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>'a' or 'e' or 'i' or 'o' or 'u' in String</code> is always true. What you meant to do is:</p>
<pre><code>if 'a' in String or 'e' in String or ...:

<p>Or, using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#any" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>any</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>if any(c in String for c in 'aeiou'):

<span class="comment-copy">wow this question got answers quickly</span>
<span class="comment-copy">you could import re and use <code>if re.search('a|e|i|o|u',string)</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Onyambu oh, clever!</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>VowelsInString = any(v in String for v in 'aeiou')</code> You don't need an <code>if/elif</code> for this, it can be done as a one-liner.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ZeddCodes_ This is one of the most common duplicate questions on Stack Overflow. It's already got plenty of great answers, but it's so easy to answer that lots of people try to write a new answer anyway every time it comes up.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">so instead, i would do if 'a' in String... or 'u' in String?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That's correct.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You could also use a loop "the other way": for s in string: if s in ['a', 'e' ...]: return true</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Alright. Thanks for the answer!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">(I can only accept answers after 7 minutes it says)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You can just do <code>for i in 'abc'</code> here, since strings are iterables of their characters. But, while that might be more readable for experienced Python devs, it might be less readable to novices, so I'm not sure whether the tradeoff is worth it in this case.</span>
