<span class="comment-copy">"Is there any option....?" The answer is probably "yes", but the question is vague. What is the problem exactly?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">instead of opening an application and doing some brainless work, what is the option (Eg: which python library / how to write a python script) , so that by double clicking on .exe file it should do all those process in the background.</span>
