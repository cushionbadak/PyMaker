<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>players = {"Mark": 0, "Bob": 0}

print(players["Mark"])  

players["Mark"] += 1

print(players["Mark"])
</code></pre>
<p>Gives output</p>
<pre><code>0
1
</code></pre>
<p>Now I want to use this</p>
<pre><code>players = {"Mark": [1, 2, 3], "Bob": [1, 2, 3]}
</code></pre>
<p>I only want to add 1 to the first element in the list attached to the key "Mark". Then, I want to print that first element.
How would I do this?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Like so:</p>
<pre><code>players = {"Mark": [1,2,3], "Bob": [1,2,3]}

print(players["Mark"])  

players["Mark"][0] += 1

print(players["Mark"][0])
</code></pre>
</div>

<span class="comment-copy">There isn't any other possible answer to this I guess :) As simple as that</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you! I was doing players["Mark"](0) += 1 oops!</span>
