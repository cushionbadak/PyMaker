<p>I have a text :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What would I do without your smart mouth?<br/>
  Drawing me in, and you kicking me out<br/>
  You've got my head spinning, no kidding, I can't pin you down<br/>
  What's going on in that beautiful mind<br/>
  I'm on your magical mystery ride<br/>
  And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me, but I'll be alright</p>
</blockquote>
<p>...now I want to create a string with this text. For example in Python:</p>
<pre><code>string = " What would I do without your smart mouth?
Drawing me in, and you kicking me out
You've got my head spinning, no kidding, I can't pin you down
What's going on in that beautiful mind
I'm on your magical mystery ride
And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me, but I'll be alright "
</code></pre>
<p>But Python didn't consider this as string as it contain line breaks. How can I make this text as a string?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<h1>Using triple-quotes</h1>
<p>You can use the triple-quotes (<code>"""</code> or <code>'''</code>) to assign a string with line breaks:</p>
<pre><code>string = """What would I do without your smart mouth?
Drawing me in, and you kicking me out
You've got my head spinning, no kidding, I can't pin you down
What's going on in that beautiful mind
I'm on your magical mystery ride
And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me, but I'll be alright"""
</code></pre>
<p>As explained by <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><strong>the documentation</strong></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>String literals can span multiple lines. One way is using triple-quotes: <code>"""..."""</code> or <code>'''...'''</code>. End of lines are automatically included in the string [...]</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>Using <code>\n</code></h1>
<p>You can also explicitly use the newline character (<code>\n</code>) inside your string to create line breaks:</p>
<pre><code>string = "What would I do without your smart mouth?\nDrawing me in, and you kicking me out\nYou've got my head spinning, no kidding, I can't pin you down\nWhat's going on in that beautiful mind\nI'm on your magical mystery ride\nAnd I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me, but I'll be alright"
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<h2>Through the following code lines:</h2>
<pre><code>value = '''

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The easiest way would be to triple-quote it:</p>
<pre><code>string = '''What would I do without your smart mouth?
Drawing me in, and you kicking me out
You've got my head spinning, no kidding, I can't pin you down
What's going on in that beautiful mind

<span class="comment-copy">Is there any other way to do it? (i ask like this coz you say that this is the easiest way,that means there may exists some other ways to do it ) btw i'm a mathematician..lol</span>
