<p>I have a list of numbers, let's say <code>A = [9,10,16,19]</code>.</p>
<p>I have four sets <code>{8, 9, 10}, {11, 12, 13}, {14, 15, 16}, {17, 18, 19, 20}</code>.</p>
<p>For each element in list <code>A</code>, categorize the element into the given sets and count the occurences corresponding to each set.</p>
<p>Considering the example I gave the output should be <code>[2,0,1,1]</code>.</p>
<p>What is the best way to do this??</p>

<p>I've used the <code>set.intersection()</code> method of <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#sets" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>set</code></a> to do this:</p>
<pre><code># Sets are generated with curly brackets
# or the set() constructor
mysets = [{8,9,10} , {11,12,13} , {14,15,16}, {17,18,19,20}]

# A is a list, which is a very different datatype
# For this problem here, it wouldn't make a difference if A
# were a set as well
A =  [9,10,16,19]

[len(s.intersection(A)) for s in mysets]
&gt;&gt; [2, 0, 1, 1]
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>s0,s1,s2,s3 = [8,9,10] , [11,12,13] ,[14,15,16], [17,18,19,20]
sets = [s0,s1,s2,s3] #(these aren't sets, but ok) 
A= [9,12,16,19]

numbers = []
for s in sets:
    n = sum(1 for x in s if x in A)
    numbers.append(n)    

# numbers[i] is the number of shared elements between A and sets[i]
# you should consider extension to duplicate elements. 
# as written this may not give you the result you want on duplicate elements 
</code></pre>
<p>The same thing as a one liner would read </p>
<pre><code>numbers = [sum(1 for x in s if x in A) for s in sets]
</code></pre>
<p>Consider what you want to do with duplicate elements carefully. You may need to modify this </p>

<span class="comment-copy">What's the output like? How far have you tried solving it?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You mean you have for sets: <code>{8,9,10} , {11,12,13} ,{14,15,16}, {17,18,19,20}</code> ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">ya if they're actually sets and not lists, this is what you want</span>
