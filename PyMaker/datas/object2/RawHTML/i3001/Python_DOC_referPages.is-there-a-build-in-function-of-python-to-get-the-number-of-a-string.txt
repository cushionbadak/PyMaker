<p>Is there a build-in function of Python to get the number of a string?</p>
<p>I have a type of string like this <code>'20180318_beta'</code>.</p>
<p>I want to get the <code>20180318</code> of it, so is there a build-in method for achieving this?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Here is a list of built in functions: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html</a></p>
<p>As you can see, there is no specific function for what you are asking. However, if you wanted to build a function for it, there are many questions you have to ask yourself. Can it handle negatives? Can you find non-integers? What about numbers in different places?</p>
<p>You can always use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">regex</a> to attempt this problem. Here is a previous post about it: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4289331/python-extract-numbers-from-a-string">Python: Extract numbers from a string</a></p>
<p>If all of your cases will be similar to the one above, you can always use the <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/string_split.htm" rel="nofollow noreferrer">split</a> method. In other cases, I would refer to this post: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26825729/extract-number-from-string-in-python/26825781">Extract Number from String in Python</a></p>
<p>Just as a side note, if you do use the last link, be careful with the top answer with Python 3.x as the filter function is slightly different than its counterpart.</p>

<p>Well depending on the robustness you require, casting to int will work in this case because your string starts with numbers. However, If it started with a letter it would fail. </p>
<p>It's pretty simple to roll your own, see this stack overflow answer. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">this will do int(filter(str.isdigit, str1)) from  <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26825729/extract-number-from-string-in-python/26825781">here</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">If it's always number followed by underscore, do <code>int(mystring.split("_")[0])</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@NidhinSajeev: This assumes no digit are separated from the main block of numbers required (a string like <code>'20180318_beta2'</code> would be parsed as <code>201803182</code>, which is probably not the intention). Also, using <code>filter</code> (without wrapping with <code>''.join()</code> to convert the <code>filter</code> iterator back to a <code>str</code>) will only work on Python 2.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ShadowRanger ok but here he want to Extract numbers from a string only</span>
<span class="comment-copy">"Casting" to <code>int</code> won't work; <code>int('20180318_beta')</code> will raise a <code>ValueError</code>; <code>int</code> is for strings composed solely of valid digits, with optional leading and trailing whitespace (which is ignored).</span>
