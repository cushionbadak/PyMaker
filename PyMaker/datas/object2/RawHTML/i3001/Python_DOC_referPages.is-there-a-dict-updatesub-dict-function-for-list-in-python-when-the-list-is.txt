<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Suppose a list in Python -&gt; mylist:</p>
<pre><code>mylist = []
</code></pre>
<p>I want to now take input from users and update the values afterward in mylist:</p>
<pre><code>input1 = ["xyz","wyh",34]
print mylist
Output: [["xyz","wyh",34]]

input2 = ["yo","hey",657]
print mylist
output: [["xyz","wyh",34],["yo","hey",657]]
</code></pre>
<p>append() only works when list has some values already.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I'd advise  you take a look through <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/datastructures.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a> to see what exactly you need. It sounds like what you want is list.append() however.</p>
<pre><code>mylist = [["X","Y",12], ["A","B",23]]
mylist.append(["L","M",56])
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>you can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">list.append</a></p>
<pre><code> mylist.append(["L","M",56])
 (or)
 mylist+[["L","M",56]]
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">... <code>list.append</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yea, I'm not sure what the confusion is...perhaps we should link the documentation?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Also you may want to tag the question with <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python-2.7">python-2.7</a> or <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python-3.x">python-3.x</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Possible duplicate of <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3748063/what-is-the-syntax-to-insert-one-list-into-another-list-in-python">What is the syntax to insert one list into another list in python?</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">I would flag it as well but I don't have any more flags :(</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What if the list value is null, then it won't append. What in such cases?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You should initialize the list at first with mylist = [] if you don't have any initial values. Append will work on any list, even if it's empty</span>
<span class="comment-copy">talk about low effort answers -_-</span>
<span class="comment-copy">what?...how?....</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@pyd Nothing wrong with that, actually...</span>
