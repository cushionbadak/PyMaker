<pre><code>import os

print("Process id before forking: {}".format(os.getpid()))

try:
    pid = os.fork()
except OSError:
    exit("Could not create a child process")

if pid == 0:
    print("In the child process that has the PID {}".format(os.getpid()))
    exit()

print("In the parent process after forking the child {}".format(pid))
finished = os.waitpid(0, 0)
