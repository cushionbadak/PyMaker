<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>My main objective is as below:</p>
<p>(1) Calculate the number of "id", "id_value". Then find what which value is not present in "id_value" based on "id". Example, "id" = [1,2,3,4],  "id_value"=[1,2]. Then add a new dictionary of "id_value" into the main({"id_value":3},{"id_value":4}).</p>
<p>I tried to use set to find the difference between value within these two variables but with error. Could anyone please assist me. </p>
<pre><code>main = [ {
  "y" : {
    "a" : [ {
      "u" : [ {
        "y" : 0
  "x" : [ {
    "check" : {
      "value" : 0
</code></pre>
<p>My code is as below:</p>
<pre><code>forid= []
forvalueid= []

for x in main[0]["x"]:
    for y in x["example"]:
        forid.append(y["id"])
</code></pre>
<p>I am getting error for "lambda cannot contain assignment"... can I know why?</p>
<p><strong>* I solved this</strong> Thank you for commenting </p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Not sure if that will produce what you intend, but this is the lambda free version of your current code:</p>
<pre><code>def func(x):
    y["id_value"] = x

map(func, addvalue(forvalueid))
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">I won't answer "why" since I don't have the expertise. But I can ask: why do you absolutely want to use lambdas? If you need assignments, and lambdas won't let you do it, just define a regular function...</span>

<span class="comment-copy">I see but is there a way to implement my objective?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Humbalan I will edit it now.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I tried this too but apparently, it produced invalid syntax. But when I changed it to def func(x):     {y["id_value"]:x} then I get keyerror of "id_value"</span>
