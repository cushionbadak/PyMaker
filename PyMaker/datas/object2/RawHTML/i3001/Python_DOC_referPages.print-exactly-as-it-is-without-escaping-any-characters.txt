<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I want to print <code>{alias fmtime='find . -type f -printf "%T+\t%p\n" | sort'}</code> exactly. I don't want to escape any characters. Is there a function that prints exactly anything we give it without having to escape any special characters? </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Wrap your string in triple quotes (either <code>'''</code> or <code>"""</code>) and prefix the quotes with <code>r</code> (for "raw string").</p>
<pre><code>s =    r"""{alias fmtime='find . -type f -printf "%T+\t%p\n" | sort'}"""
print(s) # {alias fmtime='find . -type f -printf "%T+\t%p\n" | sort'}
</code></pre>
<p>That way you won't have to escape <code>\</code>, <code>'</code>, or <code>"</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Limitation</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[...] a raw literal cannot end in a single backslash (since the backslash would escape the following quote character). Note also that a single backslash followed by a newline is interpreted as those two characters as part of the literal, not as a line continuation.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You can use <code>raw string</code> <code>r</code></span>
