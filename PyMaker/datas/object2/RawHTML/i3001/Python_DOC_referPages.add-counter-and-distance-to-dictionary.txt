<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Hello I have a specific string and I am trying to calculate its distance using edit distance and I want to see the number of counts of the string that occurs and then sort it.</p>
<pre><code>str= "Hello"
</code></pre>
<p>and a txt file named- xfile I am comparing with is:</p>
<pre><code>"hola"
"how are you"
"what is up"
"everything good?"
"hola"
"everything good?"
"what is up?"
"okay"
"not cool"
"not cool"
</code></pre>
<p>I want to make a dictionary that compares all the lines with the xfile and give it's edit distance and count. 
For now, I am able to get it's key and distance, but not it's count. 
Can someone please suggest me it?</p>
<p>My code is:</p>
<pre><code>data= "Hello"

Utterences = {}

for lines in readFile:
    dist= editdistance.eval(data,lines)
    Utterances[lines]= dist
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>For every utterance you can have a dictionary containing the distance and count:</p>
<pre><code>import editdistance

data = 'Hello'

utterances = {}

xlist = [
    'hola',
    'how are you',
    'what is up',
    'everything good?',
    'hola',
    'everything good?',
    'what is up?',
    'okay',
    'not cool',
    'not cool',
]

for line in xlist:
    if line not in utterances:
        utterances[line] = {
            'distance': editdistance.eval(data, line),
            'count': 1
        }
    else:
        utterances[line]['count'] += 1
</code></pre>
<p>Then if you need the utterances sorted by distance or count you can use an <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.OrderedDict" rel="nofollow noreferrer">OrderedDict</a>:</p>
<pre><code>from collections import OrderedDict

sorted_by_distance = OrderedDict(sorted(utterances.items(), key=lambda t: t[1]['distance']))
sorted_by_count = OrderedDict(sorted(utterances.items(), key=lambda t: t[1]['count']))
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">If the size of the xlist is small you can convert it to dictionary with associated counts via Counter <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/collections.html#collections.Counter" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/2/library/collections.html#collections.Counter</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Is <code>edit-distance</code> an external library?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">yes! it's imported via line-&gt; import editdistance</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I gave an example of the xlist. The actual list has more than 2000 instances</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Are you comparing <code>str="Hello"</code> to every line in xfile, getting the edit distance of those comparisons?</span>
