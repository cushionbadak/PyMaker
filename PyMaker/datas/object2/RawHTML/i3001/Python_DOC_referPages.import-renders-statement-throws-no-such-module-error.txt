<p>I am trying to run PCA on my dataset. I came across a tutorial by Ritchie Ng: <a href="https://www.ritchieng.com/machine-learning-project-customer-segments/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.ritchieng.com/machine-learning-project-customer-segments/</a> 
and i am trying to recreate it on my dataset. However, the blog uses a package called "renders" which i am unable to find in Anaconda. How and where do i get and enable this package from? I have searched for this package in Anaconda navigator and google but i cant seem to find it.</p>
