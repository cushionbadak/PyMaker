<p>Elham Here, I have made a simple code to something like this:
- It accepts a string (name) from user
- then it do some customization to the string (turn lowercase and replacing space with "_"{under score})
- then after customization, it will search for a file with same name as string
- then display the content of file. here is its code:</p>
<pre><code>import coder
import time
import calc

mainfunc = ["clears", "action mode"]

main_loop = "main"
coder.clear_screen()
while main_loop == "main":
    ask = input("BOT: You say? &gt; ")
    mask = ask.replace(" ", "_")
    if mask == mainfunc[0]:
        print("\n" * 100)
        coder.clear_screen()
    else:
        prt = open(mask, "r")
        pr = prt.read()
        print(pr)
        prt = open(mask, "r")
        pr = prt.read()
        print(pr)
</code></pre>
<p>this is what I can with text, and I have plan to do same thing with some python modules (like instead of displaying its code, it should execute the code), which search for the module name with the string given by user! its like unknown module to be executed with name of string.</p>
<p>I have tried getattr and others like {}.format, ...
but non worked. I have researched the documentation section of functions and modules, but didn't found anything to help or it was too confusing while I don't know name of what I am searching for : (</p>
<p>so if you know the fix, please send the code! You will save my life (I have made a bet with a friend on this :p</p>
<p>-thanks</p>

<p>Python's <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#exec" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>exec</code> function</a> will execute a string as raw code, which lets you do something like this:</p>
<pre><code>module = input("Enter module to import:")
exec("import " + module)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Sorry, I can't make sense of what you're asking. What do you mean w.r.t. running code instead of displaying it?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Are you asking for the ability of a user to specify what module they want to import? This probably creates more issues than it solves; what is the application?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes Roganjosh, I want the user to specify what module to import! Iam making a custom system for my artificial intelligence</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This would expose you to vulnerabilities. You're asking for user input to dictate what code is run. This is not advisable unless you're confident that you know how to contain this freedom. I strongly suggest you rethink the  foundations of this approach rather than us answer how this can be done.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I am ready captin roganjosh :p I have been around code and A.I. for like around 3-5 years now. I am sure that I know the results captin!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Let me try this bro :D</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Damn man, You just saved my future! WOHOOOO! Finally after weeks! Thanks again pal : D</span>
