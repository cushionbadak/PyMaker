<p>I need to write a program that retrieves the IP addresses of a list of domain names. The simple example can be shown here:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import socket
&gt;&gt;&gt; socket.gethostbyname('google.com')
'172.217.160.14'
&gt;&gt;&gt; socket.close()
</code></pre>
<p>After I try to close the socket, I get this error:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Traceback (most recent call last):   File "", line 1, in
   AttributeError: module 'socket' has no attribute 'close'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How can I close this socket? I need to close it because my actual program has loop where in each domain name in the list I needs to get its IP, so I need to close the socket in each iteration for the new host.</p>
<p>Can you tell me what is the problem? </p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The <code>socket</code> in your code refers to the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">socket</a> module, which has no <code>close</code> function. A new module level <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html#socket.close" rel="nofollow noreferrer">close</a> function has been added in Python 3.7, but it requires a socket descriptor as an argument. If I get it right, you want to call the close method of <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html#socket.socket" rel="nofollow noreferrer">socket object</a>, not the module. In your case you don't need to close any connection.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You don't create a socket here neither you bind it to any port. What <code>socket.gethostbyname('google.com')</code> does is translate a host name to IPv4 address format. The method <code>.close()</code> has effect in open connections.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">So is it safe to put it in a loop where I call it socket.gethostbyname(domain[i]) where I have a list of domain names? will this cause any confusion?</span>
