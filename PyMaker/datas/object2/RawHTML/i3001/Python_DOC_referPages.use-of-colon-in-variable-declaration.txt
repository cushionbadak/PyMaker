<p>I was asked recently what this means in python:</p>
<p><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; char : str</code></p>
<p>I had no idea.  I'd never seen that before.  I checked the docs and there isn't anything like that.  One person's suggestion was that it is static type declaration, but there is absolutely nothing in the docs about that either.  </p>
<p>With the above, if I
<code>&gt;&gt;&gt; type(char)</code> it fails</p>
<p>If I <code>&gt;&gt;&gt; char : str = 'abc'</code> it works, and the results of type(char) is <code>&lt;class: str&gt;</code>.  It can't be static declaration though, because I can <code>&gt;&gt;&gt; char : str = 4</code> and type(char) becomes <code>&lt;class: int&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>So I come here to collect the wisdom of the many SO overlords.  What does that mean?</p>

<p>You are looking at an <em>annotation</em> for a variable. The hint is moved to the <code>__annotations__</code> mapping:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; char: str
&gt;&gt;&gt; __annotations__
{'char': &lt;class 'str'&gt;}
</code></pre>
<p>Variable annotations are there to support third-party tooling, such as type checkers; the syntax is new in Python 3.6.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0526/" rel="noreferrer">PEP 526 -- <em>Syntax for Variable Annotations</em></a>, and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.6.html#whatsnew36-pep526" rel="noreferrer"><em>What's new in Python 3.6</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just as for function annotations, the Python interpreter does not attach any particular meaning to variable annotations and only stores them in the <code>__annotations__</code> attribute of a class or module.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">@HåkenLid I don't think it's a duplicate.  This is specifically asking the question about the unknown use for the syntax.  It will lead people to learn that the colon use is for type annotation.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks!  Looks like it started in 3.5. &gt;.&lt;  Guess I missed this one.  <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.5.html?highlight=hint#whatsnew-pep-484" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/…</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Jaberwocky: 3.5 added type hinting, but the <i>variable annotation</i> syntax you used is specific to Python 3.6. (don't get confused with annotations in function definitions, those have been part of Python 3 since version 3.0).</span>
