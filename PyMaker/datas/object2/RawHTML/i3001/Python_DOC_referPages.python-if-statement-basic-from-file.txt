<p>I have a CSV file containing wind speeds, their directions in degrees, and the date on which each datum was recorded.</p>
<p>I am trying to write an if statement so that if the direction is 180 and the date is within a certain month, then put those wind speeds into a new variable.</p>
<p>These are two attempts out of many others:</p>
<pre><code>if ['Wind Direction'] == 180:
    if ['Wind Speed'].loc['2016-8-1':'2016-8-31']
        windS = ['Wind Speed']
        print(windS)
</code></pre>
<p>Another try that also didn't do anything:</p>
<pre><code>for ['Wind Direction'] == 180:
    winddate = 'Date'
    if winddate == timedata[['Wind Speed']].loc['2016-8-1':'2016-8-31']:
        windspeedS = 'Wind Speed'
        print(windspeedS)
</code></pre>
<p>Can anyone help me do this?</p>

<p>You seem to be fine with comparing the degree, but comparing the dates is what will need more tools. Python provides the library <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">datetime</a> that lets you create date objects to compare dates, which you can't really do with just strings. For example</p>
<pre><code>from datetime import datetime

date1 = datetime.strptime("2016-8-1", "%Y-%m-%d")
date2 = datetime.strptime("2016-8-3", "%Y-%m-%d")
date3 = datetime.strptime("2016-8-30", "%Y-%m-%d")
</code></pre>
<p>First you give it the date as a string, then how the string is formatted, so that it will be parsed correctly. Now you can compare dates</p>
<pre><code>date1 &lt; date2 # returns True
date2 &lt; date3 # returns True
date1 &lt; date2 &lt; date3 # returns True
</code></pre>
<p>If you only want data with dates in a certain month (as opposed to comparing two arbitrary dates), you can try something like this</p>
<pre><code>date2.strftime("%B") == "August" # returns True
date2.month == 8 # returns True
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">It would really help if you give a link to the CSV file</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Is the code directly from your own solution, because you are missing <code>:</code>s at the end of your <code>if</code> statements.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">perhaps check the type of windS to make sure it is an int, could be if int(windS) == 180</span>
<span class="comment-copy">it seems the code lacks understanding of basic Python syntax. Have you read <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the tutorial</a>? It is not so long, but quite comprehensive</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Everything like <code>['Wind Direction']</code> must be <code>X['Wind Direction']</code>, where <code>X</code> is the name of the dataframe that you loaded from the file. (I assume that you <i>did</i> load the CSV file as a DataFrame.)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Is there a way to change the datatime to just data?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why do you want to do that? (note it's datetime, not datatime)</span>
