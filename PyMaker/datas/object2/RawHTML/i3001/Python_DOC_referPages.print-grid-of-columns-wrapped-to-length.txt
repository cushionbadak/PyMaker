<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I am trying to print a 2-dimensional list in a format that wraps the length of each column to the length of the longest word in that column (plus 2 spaces padding). Example of what I'm trying to achieve below:</p>
<pre><code>t1      thing2   t3            t4
thing5  t6       thingymajig7  thing8
thing9  thing10
</code></pre>
<p>Currently, my code almost achieves this, but it keeps clipping off the last 'n' number of columns if there is a row with less than the max number of items in it. Example below:</p>
<pre><code>t1      thing2
thing5  t6
thing9  thing10
</code></pre>
<p>This is the part of my code so far:</p>
<pre><code>rows = [[thing1, thing2, thing3, t4], [t5, t6, thingymajig7, thing8], [thing9, thing10]]

widths = [max(len(item) for item in col) for col in zip(*rows)]

for r in rows:
    print("  ".join((item.ljust(width) for item, width in zip(r, widths))))
</code></pre>
<p>What do I need to add/change to stop it from removing incomplete columns?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The problem seems to be with this line:</p>
<p><code>widths = [max(len(item) for item in col) for col in zip(*rows)]</code></p>
<p>From the docs on zip: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#zip" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#zip</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The iterator stops when the shortest input iterable is exhausted. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>So each list in <code>rows</code> would have to be lengthened to the length of the longest list in <code>rows</code> for this script to work. You could achieve that with this:</p>
<pre><code>rows = [['thing1', 'thing2', 'thing3', 't4'], ['t5', 't6', 'thingymajig7', 'thing8'], ['thing9', 'thing10']]

max_row_len = len(max(rows, key=len))

for row in rows:
  row_len = len(row)
  row.extend(['blank' for f in range(max_row_len - row_len)])

widths = [max(len(item) for item in col) for col in zip(*rows)]

for r in rows:
    print("  ".join((item.ljust(width) for item, width in zip(r, widths))))
</code></pre>
<p>You could then replace <code>'blank'</code> with <code>''</code></p>
</div>
