<p>i was working on a programm, that changes your MAC adress in python. I'm really struggling with this error. This is my code so far:</p>
<pre><code>import subprocess
import optparse

parser = optparse.OptionParser()

parser.add_option("-i", "--interface", dest="interface", help="Interface to change its MAC adress")
parser.add_option("-m", "--mac", dest="new_mac", help="New MAC adress")

(options, arguments) = parser.parse_args()

interface = options.interface
new_mac = options.new_mac

print("[+] Changing MAC adress for " + interface + " to " + new_mac)

subprocess.call(["ifconfig", interface, "down"])
subprocess.call(["ifconfig", interface, "hw", "ether", new_mac])
subprocess.call(["ifconfig", interface, "up"])
</code></pre>
<p>This is the error that I'm getting: <br/></p>
<pre><code>TypeError: must be str, not NoneType
</code></pre>
<p>This error refers to my print line. I have already tried: <br/><br/> <code>print("[+] Changing MAC address for " + str(interface) + " to " + str(new_mac))</code><br/> <br/>but that didn't work. 
When I do that, I'm getting this error: <br/></p>
<pre><code>TypeError: expected str, bytes or os.Pathlike object, Not NoneType
</code></pre>
<p>Changing <code>optparse</code> to <code>argparse</code> in the entire code, didn't solve the problem.
I didn't give any command line arguments, because I want the user to be able to give them themselves. </p>
<p>Hope you can help me out. Thanks.</p>

<p>Turnes out my code was perfectly fine. I just had to pass some command lines in the terminal first before running the code. Instead I wanted to run the code and then pass arguments.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Your program requires command line arguments (the interface and the mac address). You didn't pass any.</span>
