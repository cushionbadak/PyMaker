<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>My input file <code>test.sas</code> file looks like below:</p>
<pre><code>My    
Name is Joe
How are you?;
/* Comment 1 */
/*Comment 2 
blah blah
blah blah blah
blah blah blah blah;*/
/* Comment 3 */
I am great
</code></pre>
<p>When I use the following code I get the result that is right after the code:</p>
<pre><code>writing = True

with open('test.sas', 'r') as file:
    with open('output.sas','w') as out:
        for line in file:
            if writing:
                if '/*' in line:
                    writing = False
                else:
                    out.write(line)
            elif '*/' in line:
                writing = True
</code></pre>
<p>the result:</p>
<pre><code>My    
Name is Joe
How are you?;
</code></pre>
<p>But I would like to get the following result:</p>
<pre><code>My    
Name is Joe
How are you?;
I am great
</code></pre>
<p>I can't figure out what I am doing wrong. Basically I want to remove the text within the comment block and write the rest to the output file.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Change your final</p>
<pre><code>        elif '*/' in line:
            writing = True
</code></pre>
<p>to</p>
<pre><code>        if '*/' in line:
            writing = True
</code></pre>
<p>That way you can hit both statements if they both exist on the same line.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I've added some comments showing the status of your <code>writing</code> variable at the end of each line.</p>
<pre><code>My                     //True
Name is Joe            //True
How are you?;          //True
/* Comment 1 */        //False
/*Comment 2            //False
blah blah              //False
blah blah blah         //False
blah blah blah blah;*/ //True
/* Comment 3 */        //False
I am great             //False
</code></pre>
<p>Do you see where the problem comes in? Since the if-statement can is only evaluated once per line (once per loop), it does not set <code>writing</code> to <code>True</code> after lines that have both the <code>/*</code> and <code>*/</code>.</p>
<p>To check for both of the comment signs on a single line, allow both if-statements to work in one loop. Change <code>elif '*/' in line:</code> at the end of your program to <code>if '*/' in line</code>. This way, it can set to writing at the end of each loop, <em>even if it set writing to False at first!</em></p>

<h2>One Option may be to use regex (re.sub()) to match your quotes and substitute it with an empty string.</h2>
