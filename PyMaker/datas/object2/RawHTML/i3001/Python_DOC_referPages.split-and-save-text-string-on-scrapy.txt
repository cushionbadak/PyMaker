<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I need split a substring from a string, exactly this source text:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Article published on: Tutorial</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I want delete "Article published on:" And leave only </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tutorial</p>
</blockquote>
<p>, so i can save this 
i try with:</p>
<pre><code>category = items[1]
category.split('Article published on:','')
</code></pre>
<p>and with</p>
<pre><code>for p in articles:
            bodytext = p.xpath('.//text()').extract()
            joined_text = ''
            # loop in categories
            for each_text in text:
                stripped_text = each_text.strip()
                if stripped_text:
                    # all the categories together
                    joined_text += ' ' + stripped_text
            joined_text = joined_text.split('Article published on:','')
    items.append(joined_text)
            if not is_phrase:
                title = items[0]
                category = items[1]
                print('title = ', title)
                print('category = ', category)
</code></pre>
<p>and this don't works, what im missing?</p>
<p>error with this code:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TypeError: 'str' object cannot be interpreted as an integer</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You probably just forgot to assign the result:</p>
<p><code>category = category.replace('Article published on:', '')
</code></p>
<p>Also it seems that you meant to use <code>replace</code> instead of <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.split" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>split</code></a>. The latter also works though:</p>
<p><code>category = category.split(':')[1]
</code></p>

<span class="comment-copy">What's your input?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">And what specifically is going wrong?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I don't think I understand you correctly, but are you looking for <code>category.split(':')[1]</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">i cant modify the text, if i do a print, i got the text " Article published on: Tutorial" without any modifications ( i want remove "article published on"</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Can you post the code including the print statement?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thanks ! the problem was what i have a + with unicode at the beginning of the sentence invisible on the html of the source (painted with the same colour of the theme)</span>
