<p>When running this in Python 3.7 I get no errors but nothing happens, I'm using it for work to encrypt a sensitive user directory when the user logs out, all other parts of my program work. Could someone explain what's wrong with it?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>From <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/glob.html#glob.glob" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the doc for glob</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If recursive is true, the pattern “**” will match any files and zero
  or more directories and subdirectories. If the pattern is followed by
  an os.sep, only directories and subdirectories match.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, if you want to use <code>glob</code> here, you need to include this pattern:</p>
<pre><code>for filename in glob.iglob(os.path.join(startPath, '**'), recursive=True):
     # ....
</code></pre>
