<p>I’m trying to install a Python script in ImageJ.  My preference is to use the script with ImageJ 1.x but can use Fiji if required.  </p>
<p>I am trying to use the script with ImageJ 1.x by placing it in the plugins folder.  The script appears in the plugins menu but when I try to run it I get an error that it can't find <code>__future__</code></p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last): 
File "&lt;string&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt; 
ImportError: No module named __future__
</code></pre>
<p> 
This makes no sense to me as the <code>__future__</code> module is being used to import the <code>with_statement</code> module and python version is listed as :</p>
<pre><code>2.5.4rc1 (2.5:723492dbab02, Feb 8 2013, 10:13:55) 
[Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (Oracle Corporation)]
</code></pre>
<p>from <code>__future__ import with_statement</code> is specifically designed for use with Python versions 2.5.x</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/__future__.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/<strong>future</strong>.html</a></p>
<p>So ... moving on ... </p>
<p>I tired to use Fiji instead since it is based on ImageJ2.  </p>
<p>I'm able to paste the code into the Script Editor using <code>File &gt; New &gt; Script ..</code>. </p>
<p>The code runs when executed from there.  However, when saved I can't get it to show up in the plugins menu.  I've tried saving it to :</p>
<p><code>Fiji/plugins</code></p>
<p><code>Fiji/plugins/Scripts</code></p>
<p><code>Fiji/plugins/Scripts/Plugins</code></p>
<p>The file name has an <code>_</code> in it.</p>
<p>The version of Fiji I'm running is 
     ImageJ 2.0.0 rc-68/1.52e / Java1.8.0_172 (64-bit)</p>
<p>The version of ImageJ 1.x I'm running is 
    ImageJ 1.52e / Java1.8.0_172 (64-bit)</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>The canonical place to put scripts for ImageJ2 is <code>scripts/Foo/Bar/My_Script.py</code>, if you want it located in the menu at <em>Foo &gt; Bar &gt; My Script</em>.</p>
<p>It also works for backwards compatibility to use <code>plugins</code> or <code>plugins/Scripts</code>. However, there was recently a critical bug preventing scripts from appearing in the plugins-based locations; see <a href="http://forum.imagej.net/t/missing-plugins-menu-item/11888" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this thread</a>. The bug is fixed in the latest release.</p>
