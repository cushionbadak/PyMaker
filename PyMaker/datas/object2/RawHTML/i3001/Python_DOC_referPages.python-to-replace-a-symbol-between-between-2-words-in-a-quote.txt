<p>trying to replace <strong>comma</strong> between 2 words <strong>Durango and PC</strong> in the second line by <strong>&amp;</strong> and then remove the quotes " as well. Same for third line with <strong>Orbis and PC</strong> I would like to retain the rest of the lines using Python:</p>
<pre><code>2,SIN-Rendering,Core Tech - Rendering,PC,147,Reopened
2,Kenny Chong,Core Tech - Rendering,"Durango, PC",55,Reopened
3,SIN-Audio,AAA - Audio,"Orbis, PC",13,Open
...
... 
...
</code></pre>
<p>Like these, there can be 100 lines in my sample. So the expected output is:</p>
<pre><code>2,SIN-Rendering,Core Tech - Rendering,PC,147,Reopened
2,Kenny Chong,Core Tech - Rendering, Durango &amp; PC,55,Reopened
3,SIN-Audio,AAA - Audio, Orbis &amp; PC,13,Open
...
...
...
</code></pre>
<p>So far, I could think of reading line by line and then if the line contains quote replace it with no character but then replacement of symbol inside is something I am stuck with.</p>
<p>How to achieve this, any suggestion? Learning Python.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Use a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">regular expression</a> for this. Write a regular expression that catches your string, and then use it to replace it. </p>
<p>It should look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>\"(\w*),\ (\w*)\"
</code></pre>
<p>This will catch  your <em>Durango</em> and <em>PC</em>, and map both of them into two groups which you later use when you replace them.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Something like this? Add proper <code>if()</code> if you want to switch comma to ampersand only in second line: </p>
<p>This code goes trough all lines with  <code>..., "..., ...", ...</code> =&gt; <code>..., ... &amp; ..., ...</code></p>
<pre><code>import re

expr = r'2,Kenny Chong,Core Tech - Rendering,"Durango, PC",55,Reopened'

expr2 =  re.findall('"(.*?)"', expr)
if len(expr2)!=0:
    expr3 = re.split('"',expr)
    expr4 = expr3[0]+expr3[1].replace(","," &amp;")+expr3[2]
    print(expr4)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Something like below: </p>
<pre><code>st = "2,Kenny Chong,Core Tech - Rendering,\"Durango, PC\",55,Reopened"
res = re.sub(r'\"(.*),\ (.*)\"',lambda x : (" &amp; ").join(re.findall(r'\"(.*),\ (.*)\"', st)[0]),st)

<span class="comment-copy">Could you please include more example of what you are targeting? Is it any group such as ("Word1, word2") to (Word1 &amp; word2)?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">why does "Orbis, PC" remain the same?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Are you targeting exactly ("Durango, PC") and no other groups such as ("Orbis, PC")?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Fixed the original question for other groups as well @AshishAcharya</span>

<span class="comment-copy">this closely works with what i expect but what if i have input like:  2,Kenny Chong,Core Tech - Rendering,"Durango, Orbis, PC",55,Reopened ...how about 3 words inside for some lines and 2 words for others</span>
<span class="comment-copy">the expected output should be 2,Kenny Chong,Core Tech - Rendering, Durango &amp; Orbis &amp; PC,55,Reopened</span>
