<p>7, but also need to use libraries that I have installed on a different version of python - 3.7</p>
<p>My main script runs with python 2.7, from which I need to pass some parameters to a separate python script which requires python 3.7</p>
<p>Is this feasible ?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Maybe you could use the pickle module to save the parameters from the 2.7 script and then load the pickle object in the 3.7 script. </p>
