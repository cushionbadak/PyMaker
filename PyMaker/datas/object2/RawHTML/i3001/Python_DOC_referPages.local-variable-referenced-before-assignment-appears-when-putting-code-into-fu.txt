<p>My code works fine until I try putting it into a function. Once I define the function, indent the code, and call the function, I get the error message "Local variable 'print' referenced before assignment. Why is that popping up when all I'm changing is putting it into a function? I never assign a variable 'print.' Please help!

<blockquote>
<p>I never assign a variable 'print.'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes you do:</p>
<pre><code>print:("No email found")
</code></pre>
<p>This is an <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#annotated-assignment-statements" rel="nofollow noreferrer">annotated assignment statement</a>, which annotates <code>print</code> with type <code>"No email found"</code>, but assigns no value.</p>
<p>An annotated assignment always creates a local variable, even if you aren't assigning a value. From the docs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If a name is annotated in a function scope, then this name is local for that scope.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In case you're wondering, empty annotated assignments are useful for cases like this:</p>
<pre><code>n: int
if spam:
    n = spam**2
else:
    n = -1
</code></pre>
<p>This is the only way you could tell a static type checker like Mypy to verify that <code>n</code> ends up holding an <code>int</code> no matter which <code>if</code> branch you take.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>"I assign parsed_json elsewhere in my code"</p>
<p>Well that's the issue. You have to pass the variable to the code, or declare it global, but best to avoid this. You could make the simple change like so. </p>
<pre><code>def printSet(parsed_json):
    for user in range (0,len(parsed_json['members'])-1):
       userDict=parsed_json['members'][user]
    #####do a bunch of stuff or whatever

printSet(parsed_json)
</code></pre>
<p>Note that you would need to do this for each variable you use in your function</p>
<p>Something else to simplify you code and help debug would be getting rid of all the try-excepts</p>
<pre><code>keylist=["id", "real_name", ..... "last_name"] #not required, but helpful if you want to print "not found" type messages
for k in keylist:
    if k in userDict.keys():
        print('{}: {}'.format(k, userDict[k]))
    else:
        print('No {} found'.format(k))
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">You'll have to show us what the code looks like when it produces the error. Showing us the working code and asking about the non-working code doesn't give us a lot to work with.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sorry! Pasted the wrong thing. Fixed now.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Well <code>parsed_json</code> doesn't seem to be defined anywhere</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Where is <code>userProf</code> defined?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@SuperStew Sorry, now I explain in the question. I define it at the top of my code and I'm sure that's not the issue. I only pasted that function</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you so much! I made that change, but I'm still getting the same error message. Any ideas?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This couldnâ€™t cause the error the OP reports, with <code>print</code> being an unassigned local variable.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@NoaKligfeld which line exactly does the error occur on</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@NoaKligfeld i made an edit to my answer that might help</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@SuperStew here is the error message: "Traceback (most recent call last):   File "C:\Users\noak\OneDrive - California Association of Realtors\My Files\Desktop\StackExchange", line 61, in &lt;module&gt;     printSet()   File "C:\Users\noak\OneDrive - California Association of Realtors\My Files\Desktop\StackExchange", line 11, in printSet     print("id: "+userDict["id"]) UnboundLocalError: local variable 'print' referenced before assignment"</span>
