<p>Looking at the datetime <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#timedelta-objects" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs</a>, I can't seem to get the difference between the attribute <code>seconds</code> and the method <code>total_seconds()</code> used on a timedelta object. Is it just precision? Begin that the former is and <em>int</em> and the latter a <em>float</em>? Or am I missing something?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>seconds</code> is the number of seconds within a day, which is in [0, 86399].  <code>total_seconds</code> is the entire timedelta converted to seconds, and can be any value, for example 604800.0 for one week, or 0.1 for 100 milliseconds.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">I see now that the docs say that seconds are <code>Between 0 and 86399 inclusive</code>, i.e. number of seconds in a day. So for timedeltas less than a day, seconds and total_seconds would be identical, given that you don't use millisecond resolution. Still don't understand why the seconds attribute just couldn't be the total number of seconds in that timedelta though. Legacy thing?</span>
