<p>Python 3.8 introduces assignment expressions, described in <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0572/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PEP 572</a>. Is there a way to test this new feature in Python 3.7.x?</p>
<p>In the past, new language features have been backported to earlier Python versions using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/__future__.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>__future__</code></a> imports.</p>
<ul>
<li>Is there a <code>__future__</code> import for assignment expressions?</li>
<li>If yes, what is the feature name?</li>
<li>If no, are there plans to add it? (3.7 is going to be around for a while)</li>
</ul>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>There is no <code>__future__</code> import for assignment expressions in Python 3.7 â€“ and adding one in a micro (or "bugfix") release is prohibited by <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0006/" rel="noreferrer">PEP 6</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0006/#prohibitions" rel="noreferrer"><strong>Prohibitions</strong></a></p>
<p>Bug fix releases are required to adhere to the following restrictions:</p>
<ol>
<li>There must be zero syntax changes. All <em>.pyc</em> and <em>.pyo</em> files must work (no regeneration needed) with all bugfix releases forked off from
  a major release.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0006/#applicability-of-prohibitions" rel="noreferrer"><strong>Applicability of Prohibitions</strong></a></p>
<p>The above prohibitions and not-quite-prohibitions apply both for a
  final release to a bugfix release (for instance, 2.4 to 2.4.1) and for
  one bugfix release to the next in a series (for instance 2.4.1 to
  2.4.2).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since assignment expressions constitute a change to the syntax of Python, there's no way they can be added to a future 3.7.x release of Python without breaking this prohibition.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I've started working on a terrible-idea backport with a similar approach as <a href="https://github.com/asottile/future-fstrings" rel="nofollow noreferrer">github.com/asottile/future-fstrings</a>, though it's slightly more difficult to enable due to bytecode rewriting being necessary.  Here's my current progress: <a href="https://twitter.com/codewithanthony/status/1017584595292729345" rel="nofollow noreferrer">twitter.com/codewithanthony/status/1017584595292729345</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>__future__</code> is only used for things that break backwards compatibility, which assignment expressions are not.</span>
