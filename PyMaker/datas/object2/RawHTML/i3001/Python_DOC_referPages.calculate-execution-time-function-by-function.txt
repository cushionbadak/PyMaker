<p>I have made a program which has like 6-7 functions. I want to see how much time each function takes so that I can improve the one which is consuming a lot of time.</p>
<p>Also, is it possible to calculate cell-wise also?</p>

<p>You could do it by creating a decorator function and applying it to the functions of interest. </p>
<p>Here's what I mean:</p>
<pre><code>from functools import wraps
import time

def time_this(func):
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start = time.perf_counter()
        ret = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end = time.perf_counter()
        elapsed = end - start
        print('elapsed time: {}'.format(elapsed))
        return ret
    return wrapper

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Test it

    @time_this
    def myfunc():
        time.sleep(.25)

    myfunc()  # -&gt; elapsed time: 0.24919553
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Yes I did. But how to call it function wise?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you want to test specific functions - as Luca said - timeit. If you want to get representation of how whole program works: <a href="https://pycallgraph.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/index.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python Call Graph</a> will help.</span>
