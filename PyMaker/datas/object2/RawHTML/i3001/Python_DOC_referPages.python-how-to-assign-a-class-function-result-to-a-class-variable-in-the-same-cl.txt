<p>I am a beginner to python and want to understand the python class modules and class variables.</p>
<p>I just want to assign a class function's return value to the class variable.
I tried in different ways, are these valid in python?</p>
<p>Sample code:</p>
<pre><code>class Example():
    def class_member(self):
        dict_1 = {'k1' : 'v1','k2' : 'v2'}
        return dict_1

    class_var = class_member()
    print(class_var)

x_obj =  Example()
</code></pre>
<p>Errors:</p>
<pre><code>    class_var = class_member()
TypeError: class_member() takes exactly 1 argument (0 given)

    class_var = class_member(self)
NameError: name 'self' is not defined

    class_var = Example.class_member()
NameError: name 'Example' is not defined
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>There are a number of issues with your class usage here. Error 1 occurs because in your class definition you've stated that class_member() takes in 'self', which is a reference to the current instance of the class, which you have not created. Error 2 occurred because 'self' has been passed into class_member() as if it was a variable. Error 3 is most likely caused by the class definition not being in the file that requires it.</p>
<pre><code>    class Example(): 
        def __init__ (self):
            self.dict_1 = {'k1' : 'v1','k2' : 'v2'} 

        def class_member (self): 
            return self.dict_1

    my_object = Example()
    class_var = my_object.class_member()
    print(class_var)
</code></pre>
<p>Be sure to check out the Python docs first next time. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html</a> </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Another way to achieve this is to make dict_1 property of the Example class and then return it in the class_member function.</p>
<pre><code>class Example():
  dict_1 = {'k1' : 'v1','k2' : 'v2'}
  def class_member(self):
    return self.dict_1

example = Example()

print(example.dict_1) # prints {'k1': 'v1', 'k2': 'v2'}
print(example.class_member()) # prints {'k1': 'v1', 'k2': 'v2'}
</code></pre>
<p>I would recommend to go through this <a href="https://pythontips.com/2013/08/07/the-self-variable-in-python-explained/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">link</a> and read it in detail.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You should include your class and the full error to get a exhaustive answer.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I think what youâ€™re looking for is an <code>__init__</code> method that will do <code>self.var = self.method()</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>class_var=x_obj.class_member()</code> ?</span>
