<p>suppose I have some data that looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>time value
 1    1
 2    2
 3    3
 4    4
</code></pre>
<p>and it goes to 20,000, how would I get the average and stdev of this data?</p>
<pre><code>1    import sys
2    import os
3    import string
4    import csv
5    import math
6    average = []
7    filename = 'pei1.rg'
8    fin1 = open(filename,"rb")
9    line1 = fin1.readline()
10   line1 = fin1.readline()
11   while line1:
12       line1 = map(string.strip,line1.strip().split())
13       average.append(float(line1[1]))
14       line1 = fin1.readline()
15   #print float(average)/float(count)
16   print "Number of steps: ", len(average)
17   print "Average over entire trajectory: ", float(sum(average))/float(len(average))
18   second = int(len(average)/2)
19   print "Average over second half: ", float(sum(average[second:]))/float(second)
20   sys.exit()
</code></pre>
<p>I think this works for calculating averages, but I do not know how to get the stdv from here. </p>

<p>In Python 3 you can use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html#module-statistics" rel="nofollow"><code>statistics</code></a> module, but first you need to arrange the values from your data into a sequence. Your data comes from a CSV file, so open the file, read in the lines, and convert the value to a float:</p>
<pre><code>import statistics

with open('input.csv') as f:
    _ = next(f)    # skip the header line
    values = [float(line.split()[1]) for line in f]
    print('Average: {:.3f}'.format(statistics.mean(values)))
    print('Stdev: {:.3f}'.format(statistics.stdev(values)))
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Output</strong></p>
<p>Using the 4 values from your sample data:</p>
<pre>
Average: 2.500
Stdev: 1.291
</pre>
<p>It looks like you are using Python 2. There is a back port of the Python 3 statistics module for Python 2, and the above code will run without change. See <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/statistics" rel="nofollow">https://pypi.python.org/pypi/statistics</a> for info and install with <code>pip</code>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">i tried to post the code but it keeps telling me error code, I will try to post again. Sorry.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">here is the code ive tried:</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Do it by editing the question, not in a comment.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">could you check now? I think this is better format</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thanks, I am trying this out now, pretty new to programming so I am working out some kinks</span>
<span class="comment-copy">it worked! Thanks and it is much simpler than my code.</span>
