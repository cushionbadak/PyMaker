<p>I just started with Python and I'm having some troubles with one exercise. I am really sorry if the question is too "basic stuff" but I've done my research on google and can't find any short and not too complicated answer. And now the exercise:</p>
<p>"Write a program that reads the words in words.txt and stores them as keys in a dictionary. It doesn't matter what the values are. Then you can use the in operator as a fast way to check whether a string is in the dictionary."</p>
<p>I tried this: </p>
<pre><code>import os
os.chdir("/Users/MissOgra/Documents")
fname = input("File name: ")
if len(fname) &lt; 1 : fname = "words.txt"
fh= open(fname)
counter = 0
dictionairy = dict()
for line in fh:
    word = line.rstrip()
    dictionairy[word] = counter
    counter += 1
    print(dictionairy)
</code></pre>
<p>However, I don't get the words, but sentences. So I thought I could use <code>split()</code> like this:</p>
<pre><code>import os
os.chdir("/Users/MissOgra/Documents")
fname = input("File name: ")
if len(fname) &lt; 1 : fname = "words.txt"
fh= open(fname)
counter = 0
dictionairy = dict()
for line in fh:
    word = line.rstrip().split()
    dictionairy[word] = counter
    counter += 1
    print(dictionairy)
</code></pre>
<p>But now it doesn't work. I get:</p>
<pre><code>dictionairy[word] = counter
TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'
</code></pre>
<p>Can anyone please explain to me why is that happening and give me a hint about how can I fix it? Please, pretty please? </p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>After using <code>str.split()</code> you would get a list of the split words, you would need to iterate over that list and set it to the dictionary. Example -</p>
<pre><code>for line in fh:
    words = line.rstrip().split()
    for word in words:
        dictionairy[word] = counter
        counter += 1
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Hint: print <code>word</code> before you use it; it's not what you think it is.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.split" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>split</code></a> returns a list which is mutable and cannot be <i>hashed</i>.  <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#mapping-types-dict" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Dictionary</a> keys must be <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-hashable" rel="nofollow noreferrer">hashable</a> - that is why you are getting an error.  Print statements/functions can really help when you have these kinds of problems.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks :) it helped me a lot!</span>
