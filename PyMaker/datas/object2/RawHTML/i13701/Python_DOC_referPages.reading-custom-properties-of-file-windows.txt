<p>My family has a hard time deciding what to eat for any particular week. Because of this, I am going to make a program that will select randomly select recipe files from a directory based on recipe attributes: amount of preparation required, serving temperature of the dish, etc.</p>
<p>In order to accomplish this, I am hoping to store recipe attributes in the custom attributes section of the file. Any suggestions on python modules that would allow me to access the custom properties? I am currently running Windows 10, if that makes any difference.</p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> I am aware that this question has been asked before. However, it has been quite a while, and the win32 solution suggested is not compatible with Python 3.4.</p>

<p>Pywin32 has builds for Python3.4 available, both 32-bit and 64-bit.</p>
<p>But if you <em>know</em> which MS-Windows API calls you need, and you know which DLL they are in, you could always use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html" rel="nofollow"><code>ctypes</code></a>.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Alternative solutions are to put the attributes in a file (probably in the root of your tree of recipes). Each method has its pros and cons.</p>
<ul>
<li>JSON (easiest to edit)</li>
<li>A pickled <code>list</code> of <code>dict</code> or <code>namedtuple</code> object (fast to load, easy to use in your program)</li>
<li>SQLite database (easiest to <em>select</em> recipes)</li>
</ul>
<p>Since you want to choose from recipies based on criteria, the SQLite database might be the most suitable option in this case.</p>
