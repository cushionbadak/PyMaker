<p>I have a set of two values called mySet. It looks something like this:</p>
<pre><code>mySet = {1010101, 20202030}
</code></pre>
<p>And I have a list, myList, of lines that contain four strings each. A line in the list looks something like this:</p>
<pre><code>1 1010101 20202030 15.3
</code></pre>
<p>with each of the four strings separated by a single space. I would like to construct a loop where if both of the values in mySet are contained in a single line of myList, the loop will return TRUE. I have an idea that maybe I could make a new list of just the second and third elements of each line of myList and then check the values from mySet against that, but I'm not sure how I would implement that either. Thanks in advance for your time.</p>

<p>If by "return" you meant a function (or any callable), you need to do so separately despite the <code>for</code> loop, because <code>for</code> loops don't return anything. </p>
<p>However, this problem can be easily solved with the builtin <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#any" rel="nofollow"><code>any</code></a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#all" rel="nofollow"><code>all</code></a> functions like this:</p>
<pre><code>mySet = {str(i) for i in {1010101, 20202030}}
myList = ["1 1010101 20202030 15.3"]

result = any(all(s in l for s in mySet) for l in myList)

print(result)
</code></pre>
<p>It will print <code>True</code>. We have done all of the calculation in one single line. Also, notice how I converted all the integers in to strings in the mySet - you might want to do it separately in another set, if you don't want to mutate that set.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You should have a go at the problem yourself, and then if you can't solve it, show your code and let us help fix a specific problem.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Aside: <code>mySet = ([1010101, 20202030])</code> creates a list (from the brackets <code>[]</code>; the parentheses do nothing), not a set.  Possibly you forgot <code>set</code>, as in <code>set([1010101, 20202030])</code>, although <code>{1010101, 20202030}</code> would also work.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Is each line a string?  If your problem that you don't know how to extract the four substrings, have a look at str.split.  Type <code>help(str.split)</code> in the shell.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You probably want a function, not a loop.  Loops don't return anything.</span>
