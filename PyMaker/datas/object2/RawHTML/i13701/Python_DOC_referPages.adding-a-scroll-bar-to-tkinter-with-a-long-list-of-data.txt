<p>I currently have an issue with my Output in Tinker. So whenever I try to output my data read from a file the output dialog is too small to fit the huge list of data. For example:</p>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jppyg.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img alt="screenshot with no scrollbars" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jppyg.png"/></a></p>
<p>The window is too large to display all my data so I looked into adding a scrollbar for the window in order to better fit the data and easily see all of it.</p>
<p>The issue arises in my code:</p>
<pre><code>from Tkinter import *
import tkSimpleDialog
import tkMessageBox

root = Tk()
w = Label(root, text ="my Program")
w.pack()

tkMessageBox.showinfo("Welcome", "Add your welcome message here")

with open("Logs.txt", "rb") as f_input:
    start_token = tkSimpleDialog.askstring("Serial Number", "What is the device serial number?")
    end_token = tkSimpleDialog.askstring("End Keyword", "What is the end keyword")
    reText = re.search("%s(.*?)%s" % (re.escape(start_token + ",SHOWALL"), re.escape(end_token)), f_input.read(), re.S)
    if reText:
        output = reText.group(1)
        scrollbar = Scrollbar(root)
        scrollbar.pack( side = RIGHT, fill=Y, expand = False)

        mylist = Listbox(root, yscrollcommand = scrollbar.set )
        mylist.insert(END, output)

        mylist.pack( side = LEFT, fill = Y, expand = False)
        scrollbar.config( command = mylist.yview )
        mainloop()
        # tkMessageBox.showinfo("Output", output)
        print output
    else:
        print "not found"
</code></pre>
<p>When I add the scrollbar I get his as an output:</p>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jdR8K.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img alt="Scrollbar Error" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jdR8K.png"/></a></p>
<p>So what I am trying to do is fit the data in a nice window dialog that has a scrollbar.</p>
<p>This is the output: </p>

<p>I think you need to change how the <code>output</code> is inserted into the <code>Listbox</code>, assuming its contents is newline separated (as shown in your updated question).</p>
<p>The <a href="http://effbot.org/tkinterbook/listbox.htm#Tkinter.Listbox.insert-method" rel="nofollow">documentation</a> presents the <code>insert()</code> method's calling sequence as:<br/><br/>
    <b>insert(index, *elements)</b></p>
<p>So one way to do things would be to call it multiple times, once for each element, in a loop:</p>
<pre><code>for element in output.splitlines():
    mylist.insert(END, element)
</code></pre>
<p>However, the <code>*</code> prefix on the second argument in  the documentation means that the method accepts a <em>variable</em> number of arguments starting at the point (each of which will be put on a separate line). </p>
<p>This means the same thing could accomplished in a single call:</p>
<pre><code>mylist.insert(END, *output.splitlines())
</code></pre>
<p>What that does is first split the <code>output</code> data up into a list based upon the newlines in it, and then passes them as a bunch of <em>separate arguments</em> in the method call by prefixing the result returned from <code>output.splitlines()</code> with an <code>*</code>, which causes it to be "unpacked" into multiple calling arguments.</p>
<p>This is a fairly common Python idiom, so is worth learning and remembering. See <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html?#unpacking-argument-lists" rel="nofollow"><em>Unpacking Argument Lists</em></a> in the documentation.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Is your data all on one line?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Please show a sample of the contents of the <code>output</code> being inserted into <code>mylist</code>. It looks like you need to add newlines between the items in it (or modify your regular expression to include them in matches).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@martineau I add the contents of the OUTPUT to the original post.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for adding that to your question. My guess about needing to add newlines was wrong. In fact you need to do the opposite and remove them — one way is shown in my answer.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ahh okay. That seemed to work correctly. Hopefully I can expand on my own from there. Thank you for the help. Marking this as the correct answer!</span>
