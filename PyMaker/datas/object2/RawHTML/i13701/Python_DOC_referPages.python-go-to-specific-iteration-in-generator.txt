<p>I'm looking for a way to navigate to a particular iteration in a generator object.</p>
<p>I have a generator object that goes through a list of JSON objects. Instead of loading all of them at once, I created a generator so that each JSON object loads only at each iteration.</p>
<pre><code>def read_data(file_name):
    with open(file_name) as data_file:
        for user in data_file:
            yield json.loads(user)
</code></pre>
<p>However, now I am looking for some way to navigate to the nth iteration to retrieve more data on that user. The only way I can think of doing this is iterating through the generator and stopping on the nth enumeration:</p>
<pre><code>n = 3
data = read_data(file_name)
for num, user in enumerate(data):
    if num == n:
        &lt;retrieve more data&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Any better ways to do this?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This should do it:</p>
<pre><code>from itertools import islice

def nth(iterable, n, default=None):
    "Returns the nth item or a default value"
    return next(islice(iterable, n, None), default)
</code></pre>
<p>This is one of many <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools-recipes" rel="nofollow">useful utilities included in the <code>itertools</code> documentation</a>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">That's fundamentally how you have to do it, but you should probably use <code>itertools.islice()</code>. Can't do a full answer; I'm on my phone :P.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You could / should store the results in a <code>list</code> if you're going back and forth in the results.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">There you go, I answered anyway :P.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Cyphase is there a way to create a dictionary? maybe of objects that point to the iteration?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Cyphase Aww, a database might be what I'm missing here! map each user with a key and then call the database key!!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for fixing the indentation Anand; I'm on my phone and I accidentally posted without properly formatting it :P.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks Padraic. Using my phone is no excuse for sloppy answers :).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">works nicely. i'll consider mapping each user to a database key if performance doesn't meet my requirements. thanks for the help!</span>
