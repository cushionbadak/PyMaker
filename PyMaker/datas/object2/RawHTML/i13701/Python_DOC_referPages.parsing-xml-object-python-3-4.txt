<p>Basically what I am doing is using urllib.request to make an API call to pubmed, receive an XML file in return, and am trying to parse it with no luck.</p>
<p>I have tried using Element Tree and other modules with no luck.  I believe there may be an issue with XML object itself.</p>
<pre><code>#Imorting URL Request Modules for API Calls
#Also importing ElemenTree as it seems to be best for XML parsing

import urllib.request 
import urllib.parse 
import re 
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET 
from urllib import request 

#Now I can make the API call.  
id_request = urllib.request.urlopen('http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/esummary.fcgi?db=pubmed&amp;id=17570568')

#id_request will be an object that I'm not sure I understand?  
#id_request Returns: "&lt;http.client.HTTPResponse object at 0x0000000003693FD0&gt;"
#Let's now read this baby in XML format!
id_pubmed = id_request.read()

#If I look at the id_pubmed object, I not have the XML file I want to parse.
</code></pre>
<p>You can see what the XML file id_pubmed is calling/prints here: <a href="http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/esummary.fcgi?db=pubmed&amp;id=17570568" rel="nofollow">http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/esummary.fcgi?db=pubmed&amp;id=17570568</a></p>
<p>My issue is I can't get Element Tree to parse this at all.  I have tried:</p>
<pre><code>tree = ET.parse(id_pubmed)
root = tree.getroot()
</code></pre>
<p>as well as various other suggestions from <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html#module-xml.etree.ElementTree" rel="nofollow">https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html#module-xml.etree.ElementTree</a></p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>ET.parse() method requires either the location of the xml file (on local file system) or a file like object , but your id_pubmed seems to be a string .</p>
<p>In that case , you should use ET.fromstring() . Example -</p>
<pre><code>root = ET.fromstring(id_pubmed)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">This seems to work!  Thank you, I suspected it was an issue with the method I was trying to use on my object.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ahh, I tried to do this earlier and it did not work.  It works now!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Glad Its working for you. I would like to request you to accept the answer, if its working (by clicking on the tick mark on the left side ) , if the answer was helpful to you. It would be helpful to the community</span>
