<p>I have a Python script that inputs all words from a file and sorts them in order:</p>
<pre><code>with open(raw_input("Enter a file name: ")) as f :
     for t in sorted(i for line in f for i in line.split()):
           print t
</code></pre>
<p>But instead of asking every time for the input file I would like to choose the input file with a "-i" and save the output file with a "-o", this way:</p>
<pre><code>python myscript.py -i input_file.txt -o output_file.txt 
</code></pre>
<p>and BTW, how to save the output on a target file?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This should do it:</p>
<pre><code>import argparse

parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
parser.add_argument('-i', dest='infile',
                    help="input file", metavar='INPUT_FILE')
parser.add_argument('-o', dest='outfile',
                    help='output file', metavar='OUTPUT_FILE')
args = parser.parse_args()

with open(args.infile, 'r') as infile:
    indata = infile.read()

words = indata.split()
words.sort()

with open(args.outfile, 'w') as outfile:
    for word in words:
        outfile.write('{}\n'.format(word))
</code></pre>

<pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"><code>$ ./SO_32030424.py --help
usage: SO_32030424.py [-h] [-i INPUT_FILE] [-o OUTPUT_FILE]

optional arguments:

<p>To get started on your parameters, take a look at <code>sys.argv</code>.</p>
<p>To write into an output file, use the write mode "w", and <code>.write()</code> to it.</p>
<p>For the latter there are definitely good tutorials out there.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">All good, but it gives me an error: I do think that in this way is not creating a file: Traceback (most recent call last):   line 15, in &lt;module&gt;     with open(args.outfile) as outfile: IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'dest.txt'</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Whoops! I didn't specify the mode; fixed.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you. I tried to add 'w' but it didn't worked. What else have you changed? I want to learn.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@FrancescoMantovani, that's all I changed. Can you paste your code that didn't work even with <code>'w'</code> on a pastebin?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">too late. Probably it was caused by no come before 'w'</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>sys.argv</code> takes only bare parameters as a list but did not deal with flags like <code>-i</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yeah, you can write that yourself though. Or use argparse.</span>
