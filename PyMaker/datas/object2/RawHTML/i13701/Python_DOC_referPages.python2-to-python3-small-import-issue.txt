<p>My code is no longer working after moving from <strong>Python 2.7.9 to Python 3.4.3</strong>. I am trying to get my little program to run on my RPI and when I tried running with 2.7.9 via <code>python server.py</code> I get this error:</p>
<p><strong>Code Issue:</strong></p>
<pre><code>def setVolume(volume):
    volume = max(90, min(30, volume)) #Max Volume Spam Protection
    sendPost(speakerAddress+"volume","&lt;volume&gt;"+str(volume)+"&lt;/volume&gt;")
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You are importing <code>Request</code> object and yet you are trying to</p>
<pre><code>return request.urlopen(address).read()
</code></pre>
<p>As far as I know you can keep your old <code>from urllib import request</code> in the new code aswell. Here's  what Python 3.4.3 docs say about it: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.request.html" rel="nofollow">https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.request.html</a></p>
<p>So you should be able to import <code>request</code> and <code>parse</code> from <code>urllib</code> in Python 3.4.3. If that doesn't work for you maybe consider reinstalling your Python 3.4.3 distribution.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You said "I get this error:", yet you've provided us with your code instead of an error? What's the actual <b>error</b>??</span>
<span class="comment-copy">So what is the fix for this then for I am confused honestly. TY for commenting :D For I can not run the script via <code>python2</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Like I mentioned in my question, the code will work in <code>python3</code> but not in <code>python2</code>. So when I am running in <code>Python3</code> when I send a request for volume set of 50% it will always be received as 100% even when I try 30% or 20% and etc.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>python3</code> docs is quite clear about it. Try calling your raw <code>python3</code> interpreter in command line then try <code>from urllib import request, parse</code>. <code>urllib</code> is Python's kind of default lib and you should have it with your distribution. If you don't consider reinstalling maybe</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I am running with <code>python3</code> interpreter with that code <code>from urllib import request, parse</code> but again my commands are not taken correctly when I text my RPI.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Have you tried debugging your code? Like printing the whole request data?</span>
