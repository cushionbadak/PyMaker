<p>I have an import statement and it has periods.</p>

<p>Is it equivalent to<code>xyz/app/lib_procs</code>?</p>

<p>Dots denote namespaces. Usually that means the code is organised into <em>packages</em>, and the easiest way to create such packages is by using directories with <code>__init__.py</code> files in them.</p>
<p>There are esoteric ways to make such a statement work without directories, using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html" rel="nofollow">custom loaders</a> for example, but 99.9% of cases where you come across such a statement you probably have directories yes.</p>
<p>For your example, you would expect there to be a <code>xyz</code> directory, containing an <code>app</code> directory, in which either lives a <code>lib_process.py</code> file that contains the <code>procs</code> name, or there is a <code>lib_process</code> directory and <code>procs</code> is eiter a name available in the <code>__init__.py</code> module in that directory, or a <code>procs.py</code> module file.</p>

<p>No, app is a submodule of app, which is itself a submodule of xyz</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I meant xyz/app/lib_procs.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">@Two-BitAlchemist I know, but I can always try.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">But <code>app</code> is <i>almost certainly also a directory</i>. Inside the <code>xyz</code> directory.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">ah, yes. You are correct. Your answer is better. I guess I jumped the gun on this one &gt;&lt;</span>
