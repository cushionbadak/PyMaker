<p>I use a data structure which is a multi-dimensional numpy array. For some use cases, this array has <code>n</code>, and for other <code>n+1</code> dimensions. I want to keep the nice structure it has and not clutter the code with too many conditions, so I was wondering if there's a way to always use <code>n+1</code> indices and have the last index ignored by an indexing operation.</p>
<p>For instance the following should work equivalent:</p>
<pre><code># case 1 (n+1) - no neutral index required
a = np.asarray([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
last_index = 1
# this works
value = a[0, last_index]

# case 2 (n) - last index is neutral
a = np.asarray([1, 2, 3])
last_index = &lt;neutral index&gt;
# last_index will be ignored in this case
value = a[0, last_index]
</code></pre>

<p>How about <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#Ellipsis" rel="nofollow"><code>Ellipsis</code></a>?  Normally I see it in the brackets, but this test shows it can be assigned to a variable</p>
<pre><code>In [68]: i=Ellipsis
# i=... # works in Python3

In [69]: np.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,5]])[0,i]
Out[69]: array([1, 2, 3])

In [70]: np.array([1,2,3])[0,i]
Out[70]: array(1)

In [71]: np.array([1,2,3])[0,...]
Out[71]: array(1)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">What do you want <code>value = a[0, last_index]</code> in second case to return?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The same as if <code>last_index</code> was just ignore. In this case that would be <code>1</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No, i mean what should happen when you access <code>a[0, last_index]</code> ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">As I said, <code>1</code> should be returned.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This looks promising. Does this also work in Python 2?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Awesome - works like a charm in Python 2.7.9. Thanks!</span>
