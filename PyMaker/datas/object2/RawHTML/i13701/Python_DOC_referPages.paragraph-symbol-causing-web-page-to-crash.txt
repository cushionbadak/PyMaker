<p>I'm writing a website/search engine with a Python back end, and every time a paragraph symbol shows up in my search results, the page gets a 500 server error. Does anyone know how I might be able to reformat the string containing the results so that it will get rid of the paragraph symbol?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>This sounds like a problem with text encoding. Make sure you're using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/unicode.html" rel="nofollow">Unicode strings</a> as much as possible, and if it's not possible, always specify the encoding.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">This is probably a encode/decode error. <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/howto/unicode.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/2/howto/unicode.html</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Can you paste the traceback nor the code ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is happening in deployment, so I have no traceback unfortunately. But I think you're right that it's an encode/decode error. Thanks for the link!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The traceback should be in the server log on the productive system.</span>
