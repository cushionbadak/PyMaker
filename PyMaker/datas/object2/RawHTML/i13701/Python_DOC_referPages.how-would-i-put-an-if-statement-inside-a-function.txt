<p>I am very very new to Python and before this I only used extremely simple "programming" languages with labels and gotos. I am trying to make this code work in Sikuli:</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/gbtdMZF.png" rel="nofollow">http://i.imgur.com/gbtdMZF.png</a></p>
<p>Basically I want it to loop the <code>if</code> statement until any of the images is found, and if one of them is found, it executes the right function and starts looping again until it detects a new command.</p>
<p>I have been looking for tutorials and documentation, but I'm really lost. I think my mind is too busy trying to go from a goto/label to an organized programming language.</p>
<p>If someone could give me an example, I would appreciate it a lot!</p>

<p>In Python indentation matters, your code should look like this:</p>
<pre><code>def function():
    if condition1:
        reaction1() 
    elif condition2:
        reaction2()
    else:
        deafult_reaction()
</code></pre>
<p>I recommend reading <a href="http://www.diveintopython.net/getting_to_know_python/indenting_code.html" rel="nofollow">the chapter about indentation</a> in Dive Into Python as well as <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" rel="nofollow">PEP 0008</a>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">provide indent in your code in python indentation matter that is <code>function</code> next line should be indented</span>
<span class="comment-copy">put your code in your question</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@VigneshKalai Ughh I am so sorry, I didn't know that formatting was actually required... I've never seen that in a programming language before, usually it can still run. I feel like such an idiot now.. well, thanks!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">For your future questions, you should put your code directly into the question, not as a screenshot.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Most question python beginners have is anwered in the tutorial: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/tutorial</a></span>
