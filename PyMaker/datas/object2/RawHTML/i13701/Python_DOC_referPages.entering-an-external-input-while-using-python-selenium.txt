<p>I would like to write a python selenium script which works as follows:</p>
<pre><code> my_python_selenium_function.py &lt;-- inputvar1, inputvar2
</code></pre>
<p>It will simply use <strong>my_python_selenium_function.py</strong> file as a function and use <code>inputvar1</code> and <code>inputvar2</code> while I am trying to use those variable in my python selenium file to provide what my python file does. Does any one have an idea about how I can make this ? </p>

<p>It looks like want to supply arguments to your python file.
You can do it in numerous ways.</p>
<p>Here is an approach that uses <code>sys</code> module and works with the file arguments.</p>
<pre><code>import sys
filename = sys.argv[0]
one = sys.argv[1]
two = sys.argv[2]
three = sys.argv[3]
print 'You are running '+filename
print one+' '+two+' '+three
</code></pre>
<p>On running this file on the terminal, like:</p>
<pre><code>$ python arg.py hello world "i am learning python!"
</code></pre>
<p>the command will return:</p>
<pre><code>You are running arg.py
hello world i am learning python!
</code></pre>
<p>I hope you got the idea what you'll need to implement.</p>
<p>For complex arguments and options, it is recommended to use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html" rel="nofollow">argparse</a>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">If you're talking about giving command-line arguments to python file, you can do it with argparse.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Make sense. I'll look through argparse. I am simply trying this python script on  bash script. By giving <code>chmod 777 my_bash_script.sh</code> , then using like <code>./my_bash_script.sh input1 input2</code> is giving almost what I want. But, this does not work for python script. Does <code>argparse</code> provide the same methodology ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">So you want something like.. ./my_python.py option1 optiontwo, and assign optionone and optiontwo to variables?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, exactly what I want</span>
