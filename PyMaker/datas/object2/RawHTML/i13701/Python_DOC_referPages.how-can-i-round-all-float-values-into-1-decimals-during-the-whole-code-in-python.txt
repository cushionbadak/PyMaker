<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I coded an algorithm in python and intend to compare its results with another software. Unfortunately, I am getting different results for an identical problem because python considers all decimals in parameters while the other software round numbers into two decimals. I wonder if there is any option or package in python that automatically rounds decimals as mentioned. I have a lot of calculations during the code so I need a solution which automatically does that.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>You can use the built-in function round()</p>
<p>It is explained here:
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#round" rel="nofollow">https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#round</a></p>
<p>if you want to round the float a to 2 decimals you need to use:
    round(a,2)</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You could probably do this with some hard-core hackery by patching float but thats definatly overkill (and extreamly ugly)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">why arent you writing a script for the same?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It doesnt work. It still shows all decimals</span>
<span class="comment-copy">you have to redirect the return value of the function to the float variable: a=round(a,2)</span>
