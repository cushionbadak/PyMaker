<p>I'm in a virtualenv and trying to run a script I get the following:</p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "blah.py", line 15, in &lt;module&gt;
    from xmlrpc import server
ImportError: No module named xmlrpc
</code></pre>
<p>Ok so that seems that I need xmlrpc, which I'm assuming means I need xmlrpclib</p>
<p>So I try that:</p>
<pre><code>(env) ❯❯❯ pip2.7 install xmlrpclib                                                                
Collecting xmlrpclib
  Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement xmlrpclib (from versions: )
  Some externally hosted files were ignored as access to them may be unreliable (use --allow-external xmlrpclib to allow).
No matching distribution found for xmlrpclib
</code></pre>
<p>Ok, so then I'll try the --allow-external to get it working:</p>
<pre><code>(env) ❯❯❯ pip2.7 install --allow-external xmlrpclib                                                                                                                           ⏎ ◼
You must give at least one requirement to install (see "pip help install")
</code></pre>
<p>Not sure why xmlrpclib isn't seen to be a valid argument?</p>

<p>The answer is that the module <code>xmlrpc</code> is part of python3, not python2.x</p>
<p>details: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/xmlrpc.server.html" rel="nofollow">https://docs.python.org/3/library/xmlrpc.server.html</a></p>
<p>Should already be installed, just go ahead and use it.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if <code>pip</code> provides this lib. Just download <code>xmlrpclib</code> from here <a href="http://effbot.org/downloads/#xmlrpclib" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://effbot.org/downloads/#xmlrpclib</a>, unpack it and then run:</p>
<pre><code>python3 setup.py build
python3 setup.py install
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you are using python 2.x then <code>xmlrpclib</code> is part of standard lib. No need of installing it.</p>
<p>Anyway you can download xmlrpclib from <a href="http://effbot.org/media/downloads/tkicon-0.9-19980218.win32-py2.1.exe" rel="nofollow">http://effbot.org</a></p>

<p>I believe the answer to your question can be <a href="https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/1423" rel="nofollow">found here</a>. </p>
<p>Try adding <code>--allow-unverified</code> to your last command.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I think your import statement is wrong. The module is called <code>xmlrpclib</code>, not <code>xmlrpc</code></p>

<span class="comment-copy">This is what I'm confused about, I'm not sure is there is an xmlrpc module and was hoping that the xmlrpclib module would somehow provide what this one is doing (I didn't write the script)</span>
