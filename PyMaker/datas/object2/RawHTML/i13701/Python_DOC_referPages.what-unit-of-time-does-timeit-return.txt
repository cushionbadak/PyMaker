<p>I don't know how to interpret the output from Python's timeit.timeit() function. My code is as follows:</p>
<pre><code>import timeit

setup = """
import pydash
list_of_objs = [
    {},
    {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 0: 0},
    {'a': 1, 'c': 1, 'p': lambda x: x}
]
"""
print(timeit.timeit("pydash.filter_(list_of_objs, {'a': 1})", setup=setup))
</code></pre>
<p>The output from this is <code>11.85382745500101</code>. How do I interpret this number?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The return value is <em>seconds as a float</em>.</p>
<p>It is the <em>total time taken</em> to run the test (not counting the setup), so the average time per test is that number divided by the <code>number</code> argument, which defaults to 1 million.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/timeit.html#timeit.Timer.timeit"><code>Time.timeit()</code> documentation</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Time <em>number</em> executions of the main statement. This executes the setup statement once, and then <strong>returns the time it takes to execute the main statement a number of times, measured in seconds as a float</strong>. The argument is the number of times through the loop, defaulting to one million.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">So this means that it is better to <code>repeat</code> 1e6 times with a <code>number</code> of 1 and take the minimum (implied by the docs)?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MadPhysicist no. Because then you are enabling and disabling the garbage collector a million times too. Do not set <code>number</code> to 1.</span>
