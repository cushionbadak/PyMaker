<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>results list: 80 rows(entries) containing 3 items each (year, age, amt).  I want to print first 10, thereafter print only a row whose age ends in 0 or 5.  </p>
<pre><code>for row in results:
  if row = results[:9] or results[10:].row[1] % 5 == 0:

<p>There is a syntax problem with the second part.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You are trying to use assignment in an expression (<code>row = results[:9]</code>). Assignment is a statement.</p>
<p>That's not how you test if you are in the first 10 rows however. Instead, add a counter to the rows with the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#enumerate" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>enumerate()</code> function</a>, and test against that row counter:</p>
<pre><code>for i, row in enumerate(results):
      if i &lt; 10 or row[1] % 5 == 0:
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>It's probably easier to use a counting index in this situation</p>
<pre><code>for i in range(len(results)):
    if (i &lt;= 9 or row[i] % 5 == 0):
         print(row[i])
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">You can't do assignment (<code>=</code>) in an <code>if</code> statement (unlike in C/C++). Did you mean to use <code>==</code>? I am not following what you're trying to accomplish here. Try giving an example input -&gt; example output.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">yea, I mis-typed; should have been if row ==</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Dennis: that's your syntax error however. There are also <i>runtime</i> errors in your code, which I address in the rest of the answer.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Assuming I had the == in the line of code, how would I modify MY CODE to do what I want -- I only need to know how to code the part about accessing any row in the list (After the 10th row) where the age ends in 0 or 5 -- I know the .row[1] is not correct.  Is it possible to make my code correct?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Dennis: That's what I did, I gave you the correct code. No, your approach can't work.</span>
