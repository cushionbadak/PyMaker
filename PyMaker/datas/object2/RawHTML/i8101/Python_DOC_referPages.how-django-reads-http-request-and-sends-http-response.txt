<p>If I write a simple http server in C. I can read http request through a file descriptor generated by <code>accept()</code> function in a while loop. And I can send http response to client through that file descriptor.</p>
<p>In Django I know the <code>HttpRequest</code> object will be passed to view function as a argument, but I want to know which function reads the <code>HttpRequest</code> through the socket and generate a <code>HttpRequest</code> object? </p>
<p>I know view function will return a <code>HttpResponse</code> object. But which function will send the actual http response to the client? </p>
<p>And where is the while loop?</p>

<p>Django doesn't do this. It implements <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Server_Gateway_Interface" rel="nofollow noreferrer">WSGI</a> standard and sits behind a WSGI server (such as Gunicorn or uWSGI) and lets it interact with sockets. If you want to learn more about it, you need to look up what's going on inside a wsgi server.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">So when I type <code>python manage.py runserver</code> in terminal, starting development server at local host. Which WSGI server interacts with sockets?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@24April14, it uses <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/wsgiref.html#module-wsgiref.simple_server" rel="nofollow noreferrer">wsgiref.simple_server</a> - simple wsgi server that comes with Python.</span>
