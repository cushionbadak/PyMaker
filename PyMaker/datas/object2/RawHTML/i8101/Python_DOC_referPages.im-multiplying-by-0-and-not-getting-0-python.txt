<p>Can anyone explain what's going on here!?</p>

<p>Order of operations. Multiplication and division go left-to-right; it doesn't do all the division first and then the multiplication. So your expression expands like this:</p>
<pre><code>n//2*m//2 = ((n//2)*m)//2 = ((4//2)*1)//2= (2*1)//2 = 2//2 = 1
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to take <code>n//2</code> and multiply it by <code>m//2</code>, you have to parenthesize it that way:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; n=4
&gt;&gt;&gt; m=1
&gt;&gt;&gt; (n//2)*(m//2)
#=&gt; 0
</code></pre>

<p>In python, multiplication and division carry the same weight and are therefore calculated from left to right. As a result of that, this is how Python reads your equation:</p>
<pre><code>((4//2)*1)//2) = ((2)*1)//2) = ((2)//2) = 1
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">What about <code>2*m//2</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">double // is floor division. 4 // 2 is equal to 4 / 2 since it is division without rest. 1 // 2 is not equal to 1 / 2, see my answer below</span>
<span class="comment-copy">this is not the question I believe, see my answer below</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Perfect thanks. Is modulo also treated as a division operation?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, it is. Python follows the usual algebraic order of infix operations, and modulus is the same precedence as multiplication and both division operators. See <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#operator-summary" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this table</a>.</span>
