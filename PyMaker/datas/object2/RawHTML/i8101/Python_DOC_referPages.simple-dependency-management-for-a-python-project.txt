<p>I am coming from Java background and completely new at Python.</p>
<p>Now I have got a little project with a few Python files that contain a few imports. I know I does not have the imported dependencies installed on my computer, so I try to figure out the required dependencies and run <code>pip</code> to install them. </p>
<p>I would like to do it differently. I would prefer to have the dependencies listed in a single file and install them automatically during the build process.</p>
<p>Does it make sense ? If it does I have a few questions: </p>
<ul>
<li>How to list the project dependencies required to install by <code>pip</code> ?</li>
<li>How to run <code>pip</code> to install the dependencies from the list ?</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>A common way to manage dependencies for a python project is via a file in root of the project named "requirements.txt". An easy way to make this is:</p>
<pre><code>1. Setup a python virtualenv for your project
2. Manually install the required modules via pip
3. Execute `pip freeze &gt; requirements.txt` to generate the requirements file
</code></pre>
<p>You can then install all the dependencies in other locations using <code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code>. </p>
<p>If you want dependencies to be installed automatically when other people <code>pip install</code> your package, you can use <code>install_requires()</code> in your <code>setup.py</code>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Thank you. Just one minor question: what is <code>python virtualenv</code> you suggested set up ?</span>

<span class="comment-copy">Their is a good official tutorial about package management and virtual environment : <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html</a></span>
