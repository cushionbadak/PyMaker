<p>Any ideas why this list that I'm passing as my command to subprocess() isn't expanding properly?</p>
<pre><code>file_name = "some_make_file"
cmd = ['gmake', '-pn', '-f', file_name, '|', 'grep', '-A1', '"^# makefile"', '|', 'grep', '-v', '"^#\|^--"', '|', 'sort', '|', 'uniq']
proc = Popen(cmd, stdout=PIPE, stderr=PIPE)
stdout, stderr = prod.communicate()
</code></pre>
<p>The output is a gmake error, and if I join the cmd to test it on the cmd line myself, I get this:</p>
<pre><code>#join
" ".join(cmd)

#output
('gmake -pn -f some_make_file | grep -A1 "^ makefile" | grep -v '
'"^#\\|^--" | sort | uniq')
</code></pre>
<p>For the life if me, I cannot seem to figure out what's wrong with this command. Any ideas? Am I not escaping something properly? Adding a special char and not realizing it?</p>

<p>You are not running an intermediate shell so there is nothing to interprete the | as a pipe command. Even if you set shell=True, because you passed in a list, it will be escaped.

<span class="comment-copy">Does the actual command run as presented? What error does your shell show when trying to execute the joined command?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The command runs as presented, that's why I tried to join the list to test what was actually being passed to subprocess.Popen(). The issue is that the list is mangling the command somehow. The output is a gmake error message.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No, the issue is that you're passing the pipe character as an argument to gmake, not creating a shell pipeline.  Either use <code>shell=True</code> or (preferably) use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pipes.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>pipes</code></a> instead.  Or even write your shell scripts in bash or zsh instead of Python.</span>
