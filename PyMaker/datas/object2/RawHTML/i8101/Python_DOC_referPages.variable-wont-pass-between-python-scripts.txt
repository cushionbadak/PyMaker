<p><code>lenny.py</code> works fine on its own when I print <code>report.lon</code> and <code>report.lon</code>.  Just not able to export the variables to <code>pullgps.py</code>.  It should be simple, but for some reason, the variables just will not pass.  Thanks!</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You're using <code>from lenny1 import *</code> which imports everything from lenny1.py into the global namespace.  Not only that, but you're actually running everything in lenny1.py on the first import, which contains a while loop that could potentially block.  This is really bad code practice.  However, I think the problem you're having is that you are referencing <code>lenny1.lon</code> and <code>lenny1.lat</code> while using a starred import.  Just print <code>lon</code> and <code>lat</code> and it should in principle "work" provided the loop terminates.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I think you should read <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this</a> about the import statement.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, did as you mentioned.  It just hangs.  Changed to import lenny1 and removed the while loop.  It still hangs.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Which while loop did you remove? The one in lenny1.py looks like it will be blocking forever.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Also, are you planning to run the two processes concurrently? Because this is not the way to do it, as pointed out by user3591723 (comment now deleted).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Removed the loop in pullgps.py .</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Right, then you should not expect your code to work. You probably have to look into threading or multiprocessing to get something that does what you want. But it won't look anything like what you have currently.</span>
