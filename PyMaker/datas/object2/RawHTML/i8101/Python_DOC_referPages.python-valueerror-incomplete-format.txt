<p>I followed a tutorial on youtube that was pretty flawed to begin with but it was the best I could find. I have pywin32 installed and pyhook and they are both installed so I have no idea what it could be.</p>
<pre><code>   import pyHook, pythoncom, sys, logging

file_log = 'C:\Users\Nathan\Fun Stuff\log.txt'

def OnKeyboardEvent(event):
    logging.basicConfig(filename=file_log, level=logging.DEBUG, format='%(message)')
    chr(event.Ascii)
    logging.log(10,chr(event.Ascii))
    return True

hooks_manager = pyHook.HookManager()
hooks_manager.KeyDown = OnKeyboardEvent
hooks_manager.HookKeyboard()
pythoncom.PumpMessages()
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>"format" refers to the <code>"%(message)"</code> which is incomplete and should read <code>"%(message)s"</code>, the <code>s</code> denoting a "str conversion type" (see the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#old-string-formatting" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs</a>) - the message is put through the <code>str</code> builtin.</p>
<p><code>"$(message)s"</code> happens to be default, I think you can just omit this argument.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">The error was "value error incomplete format" on line 8 so I put an equal sign and it no longer shows the error but its still not working properly its supposed to log all of my key presses into a log.txt but the log file is not sowing anything</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I am no longer getting the format error but at this point its not logging the key presses into the log.txt file like it should</span>
