<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have a text file which looks like:   </p>
<pre><code>{

    "content": 
    [
    {
        "id": "myid1",
        "path": "/x/y"
    },
    {
        "id": "myid2",
        "path": "/a/b"
    }
    ]
 }
</code></pre>
<p>Is there a way to get the value corresponding to "id" when I pass the 
    "path" value to my method? For example when I pass /a/b I should get "myid2" in 
    return. Should I create a dictionary?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Maybe explain briefly what it is you need to actually do as I get a hunch that there might be an easier way to do what you're trying to do.</p>
<p>If i understand the question correctly, if you wanted to find the id by passing a value such as "/x/y" then why not structure the dictionary as </p>
<pre><code>{

    "content": 
    {
        "/x/y": "myid1"
    },
    ...(more of the same)
 }
</code></pre>
<p>This would give you direct access to the value you want as otherwise you need to iterate through arrays.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This looks very much like JSON, so you can use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>json</code></a> module to parse the file. Then, just iterate the dictionaries in the <code>"contents"</code> list and get the one with the matching <code>"path"</code>.</p>
<pre><code>import json
with open("data.json") as f:
    data = json.load(f)
    print(data)

    path = "/a/b"
    for d in data["content"]:
        if d["path"] == path:
            print(d["id"])
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>{'content': [{'path': '/x/y', 'id': 'myid1'}, {'path': '/a/b', 'id': 'myid2'}]}
myid2
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">That is correct, I have a file <a href="https://gist.github.com/anonymous/764bef476511ff532802d0097e6f8994" rel="nofollow noreferrer">gist.github.com/anonymous/764bef476511ff532802d0097e6f8994</a> I will pass a string that will be same as the path. I will then return a value of the id corresponding to that path</span>
