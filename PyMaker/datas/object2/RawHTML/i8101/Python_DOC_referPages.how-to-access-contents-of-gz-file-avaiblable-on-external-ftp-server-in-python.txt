<p>You cannot access contents of an archive file stored on a remote FTP server without actually downloading the file.</p>
<p>Of course, you can extract the contents while downloading on-the-fly, without actually storing the archive file locally (as suggested by @Cheney in a comment). This way, you spare a local storage, but you will still waste a bandwidth.</p>
<hr/>
<p>If you have a shell access to the server, you can extract the file remotely and access only the part of the extracted contents you are after.</p>

<span class="comment-copy"><b>It only a suggestion to have a try</b>.  Firstly, use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ftplib.html?highlight=ftplib#module-ftplib" rel="nofollow noreferrer">ftplib</a>  and overwrite` ftplib.FTP.storlines` to get the data you want. Then try <code>gzip.GzipFile(data)</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Cheney You probably mean <code>retrlines</code> or even better <code>retrbinary</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I have shell access but Read Only , whether it would work.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Do you mean you can run shell commands, but you cannot create any files? Not even in <code>/tmp</code>?</span>

<span class="comment-copy">You do not need a write access to the archive to extract it.</span>
