<p>How can I write something like:</p>
<pre><code>module_path = os.path.join(root_dir,_dir,'Tests.py')
</code></pre>
<p>to be able to also take into considerations files named Test.py and test.py and tests.py? </p>
<p>If the file Tests.py isn't found, how can it check for another of the two to make sure that who ever wrote the program gets their file seen?</p>
<p>What I am trying to say is is there something that would allow me to do this?:</p>
<pre><code>module_path = os.path.join(root_dir,_dir,'(T or t)est(s).py')
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If it is literally those four files you are searching for then something like the following will work:</p>
<pre><code>import os

_dir = 'test'
names=['Test.py','test.py','Tests.py','tests.py']

for fname in names:
    test_path = os.path.join(_dir, fname)
    if os.path.isfile(test_path):
        module_path = test_path
        break
</code></pre>
<p>You will need to modify to suit your environment.  </p>

<p>You could use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/glob.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>glob</code> module</a>, which supports a <em>simple</em> version of regular expressions ("Unix-style wildcards"). E.g., you can use this:</p>
<pre><code>for name in glob.glob("[tT]est*.py"):
    print("I found", name) 
</code></pre>
<p>This matches files whose name <em>begins</em> with "Test" or "test", and ends with <code>.py</code>. It won't give you the names in order of preference, but it might be all you need.</p>
