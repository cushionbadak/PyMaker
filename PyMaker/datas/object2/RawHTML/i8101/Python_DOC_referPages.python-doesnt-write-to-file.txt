<p>I'm trying to write to a file like this:</p>
<pre><code>debugfile = open("file.txt", "w")
debugfile.write("%i" % (feature['properties']['cellId']))
debugfile.close()
</code></pre>
<p>Here <code>feature['properties']['cellId']</code> is an integer. The file is created, but stays empty. What am I missing?</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>
I tried writing to the console.</p>
<pre><code>debugfile = open("file.txt", "w")
print(feature['properties']['cellId'])
debugfile.write("%i" % (feature['properties']['cellId']))
debugfile.close()
</code></pre>
<p>This shows the console:
<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8Iule.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img alt="enter image description here" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8Iule.png"/></a>
The file is still empty.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Check the value by printing <code>feature['properties']['cellId']</code>. </p>
<p>If I initialize <code>feature</code>, </p>
<pre><code>feature = {'properties':{'cellId':1}}
</code></pre>
<p>the code works. So there's nothing wrong with the code. </p>
<pre><code>debugfile = open("file.txt", "w")
debugfile.write("%i" % (feature['properties']['cellId']))
debugfile.close()
</code></pre>

<hr/>
<p>Never mind, this works either way:</p>
<pre><code>#!python
#coding=utf-8

import sys
print(sys.version)

debugfile = open("file1.txt", "w")
debugfile.write("%i" % (123))
debugfile.close()

debugfile = open("file2.txt", "w")
debugfile.write("%i" % 123)
debugfile.close()
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">I don't know what <code>feature</code> is so can't test, but <code>debugfile.write("%i" % 42)</code> works fine. So something else is wrong. Are any errors raised? Can you update your example to something that fails for you but that we can run? Maybe add <code>print(</code>feature['properties']['cellId'])` then post that?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">LOL - you did! that as fast.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Try to print with the string formatting</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Okay, so this is part of a larger loop? You keep opening in "w" mode, which overwrites the content, so you have at most 1 item. If your loop has a conditional (an <code>if</code>) after the open which skips the write, then you'll have an empty file. Open in <code>"a"</code> mode instead.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">you have this file open in some editor while you write on it with this code? if so, close it, use this code and open it again</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Updated the question. Appears on the console, not in the file.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It looks like you are writing this in a loop &amp; the values are getting overwritten as suggested by @tdelaney. You might get a better answer if you share the code with more context i.e. with the loop.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That's normal for old-style formatting. If the format string has only ` 1 substitution, you can pass in an object or a 1 element tuple. If there are more substitutions, you pass in a tuple for each.</span>
