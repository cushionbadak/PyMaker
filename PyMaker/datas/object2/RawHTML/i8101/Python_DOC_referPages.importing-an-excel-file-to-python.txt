<p>I have a basic question about importing xlsx files to Python. I have checked many responses about the same topic, however I still cannot import my files to Python whatever I try. Here's my code and the error I receive:</p>
<pre><code>import pandas as pd

import xlrd

file_location = 'C:\Users\cagdak\Desktop\python_self_learning\Coursera\sample_data.xlsx'
workbook = xlrd.open_workbook(file_location)
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Error:</strong></p>
<pre><code>IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'C:\\Users\\cagdak\\Desktop\\python_self_learning\\Coursera\\sample_data.xlsx'
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>With pandas it is possible to get directly a column of an excel file. Here is the code.</p>
<pre><code>import pandas
df = pandas.read_excel('sample.xls')

#print the column names
print df.columns

#get the values for a given column
values = df['collumn_name'].values

#get a data frame with selected columns
FORMAT = ['Col_1', 'Col_2', 'Col_3']
df_selected = df[FORMAT]
</code></pre>

<p>You should use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">raw strings or escape your backslash</a> instead, for example:</p>
<pre><code>file_location = r'C:\Users\cagdak\Desktop\python_self_learning\Coursera\sample_data.xlsx'

<p>or</p>
<pre><code>file_location = 'C:\\Users\\cagdak\\Desktop\python_self_learning\\Coursera\\sample_data.xlsx'
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>go ahead and try this:</p>
<pre><code>file_location = 'C:/Users/cagdak/Desktop/python_self_learning/Coursera/sample_data.xlsx'

<span class="comment-copy">Your problem is that the file is not found, not a problem of importing: verify that the file is at the path you think it's at.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hint: Did you verify that the xlsx file does exist in the location ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, it does. I am copying the folder path here : C:\Users\cagdak\Desktop\python_self_learning\Coursera and the name of the excel file is : sample_data</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks but I still receive "IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory " error although I am 100% sure the file location and file name is correct. I spent almost 3 hours to do this.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I've tried these as well but still getting the same error...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@CagdasKanar Do you have read access to the file? What happens if you run <code>python -c "import os; print(os.stat(r'C:\Users\cagdak\Desktop\python_self_learning\Coursera\sample_data.xlsx'))"</code> ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Should I run this on notebook or terminal?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">In a terminal for that exact command. If you still get a "file not found" error, I suspect the file just isn't where you think it is, or you don't have access to that file for python to read it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">add details to your code.</span>
