<p>Hi I am having some issues with trying to run a very simple program in Spyder:</p>

</code></pre>
<p>The .txt file contains only letters from the latin alphabet. The error I am getting when running in spyder IPython or Python console is:</p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):

File "&lt;ipython-input-5-eccaeae0c773&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;

    return codecs.ascii_decode(input, self.errors)[0]

UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xc3 in position 
7869: ordinal not in range(128)
</code></pre>
<p>Now the weird thing is that the program runs just fine from the terminal and both Spyder and the terminal are using the same interpreter so I'm really struggling to see why Spyder is doing this. At the bootom of the screen in Spyder it also explicitly says coding is UTF-8.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The file does contain Unicode characters, the preferred way to open files is it by using the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/codecs.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">codecs</a> module as it follows:</p>
<pre><code> import codecs

 with codecs.open('file', 'r', 'utf-8') as fp:
      lines = fp.readlines()
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">That coding is for the <i>script</i>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yeah I understand that, however the .txt file is also utf-8 encoded and I am using Python 3.5.2 interpreter provided by Anaconda</span>
<span class="comment-copy">So? What matters is whatever encoding the file is being opened with by default, not the encoding of the script.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Or the Python 2/3 compatible way: <code>io.open(...)</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I think you mean codecs.open and yeah this works thanks but do you have any idea why the standar open function works in my terminal but not in spyder?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you are using Python 3, no need for codecs because the builtin <code>open</code> has the same functionality.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">hi I am using Python 3 and the builtin open function is not opening the file in spyder</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Someguy: It works on your terminal because it support utf-8. See:sys.getfilesystemencoding() in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#file-names-command-line-arguments-and-environment-variables" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/â€¦</a></span>
