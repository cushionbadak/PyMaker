<p>I was writing a program to send a directory of contents to the client side via socket. A part of the program deals with making an array with a certain code (ex: code 1 means client should expect a file name, 2 means client should expect file content) and the other deals with decoding this array. But while decoding using .decode() method, i get </p>
<pre><code>AttributeError: 'builtin_function_or_method' object has no attribute 'decode'
</code></pre>
<p>I'm new to socket programming, but have successfully decoded strings sent via socket what am I doing wrong? </p>
<p>server code:</p>
<pre><code>   cab=['1'.encode,c.encode()] #since file is not created, file name 'c'  is sent
   client.send(pickle.dumps(cab)) #transmits the cab
</code></pre>
<p>client code:</p>
<pre><code>cab=pickle.loads(client.recv(r_size))
if(cab):
    d=cab[0]
    print(d.decode())
    return 0
else:
    print("error")
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This would seem to be the issue:</p>
<pre><code>cab=['1'.encode, # &lt;-- no parentheses
     c.encode()]
</code></pre>
<p>You didn't call the method, you just passed the callable.
Should be:</p>
<pre><code> cab=['1'.encode(),c.encode()]
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Find out by printing d before trying to decode it. Also have a look at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#type" rel="nofollow noreferrer">type()</a>. Finally, the question isn't really about sockets...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I did try that, it returned the address of an encoded string.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It should be a bytes object (<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes.decode" rel="nofollow noreferrer">decode()</a>). Is that a typo in your server code (missing brackets)?</span>
