<p>Most ms-windows programs have a GUI which is started by an icon or menu-entry. So there is no need for a standardized location for binaries (which is then put in the <code>$PATH</code>) such as UNIX has. Also, the name <code>bin</code> wouldn't <em>mean</em> anything like it does to UNIX users.</p>
<p>Additionaly, ms-windows only has a very primitive package management (if you can even call it package management), so applications tend to be installed in their own directory tree where they won't interfere with each other.</p>
