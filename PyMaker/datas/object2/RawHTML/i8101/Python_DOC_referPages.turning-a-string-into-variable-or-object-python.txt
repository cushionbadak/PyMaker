<p>I've had this problem in the past and never found the solution. I've checked ton's of google links and still don't know.
What I want to do is use a string as a variable. I'm working with SQLalchemy so will use the example straight from my project: (look for the variable 'objective' in the function)</p>
<p>Here's an example:</p>
<pre><code>def win_ratio_p_obj(objective):
    #want to find the win/loss ratio for each obj_first, ie. 60% of times when team gets fblood you also win vs. 40% of time you lose
    obj_totals = session.query(Match.win, func.count(Match.win)).filter(Match.**objective** == 't').group_by(Match.win).order_by(Match.win).all()
    win_chance = obj_totals[1][1]/(obj_totals[0][1]+obj_totals[1][1])
    return win_chance

objective = 'first_dragon'    
x = win_ratio_p_obj(objective)
objective = 'first_blood' 
y = win_ratio_p_obj(objective)
objective = 'first_turret' 
z = win_ratio_p_obj(objective)
objective = 'first_inhib'    
</code></pre>
<p>Returns:</p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  Python Shell, prompt 15, line 1
builtins.AttributeError: type object 'Match' has no attribute 'objective'
</code></pre>
<p>So what I want to do is use each objective as a variable name with the aim of reducing code repetition. I know I could very easily copy paste the function a few times but that seems silly.
At the moment the code above won't recognise the objective variables values as variables instead of strings. </p>
<p>Any answers will be super well appreciated!</p>

<p>It seems like you could use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#getattr" rel="nofollow noreferrer">getattr</a>:</p>
<pre><code>getattr(Match, objective)
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>getattr(Match, objective)</code>.</span>
