<p>Is it possible to declare a number in Python as </p>
<pre><code>a = 35_000
a = 35,000  
</code></pre>
<p>Neither seem to work of course. How do you emphasize things like these, for clarity in Python? Is it possible?</p>

<p>This is actually <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.6.html#whatsnew36-pep515" rel="noreferrer">just now possible</a> in Python 3.6.</p>
<p>You can use the first format that you showed:</p>
<pre><code>a = 35_000
</code></pre>
<p>because underscores are now an accepted separator in numbers. (You could even say <code>a = 3_5_00_0</code>, though why would you?)</p>
<p>The second method you showed will actually create a tuple. It's the same as saying:</p>
<pre><code>a = (35, 000)  # Which is also the same as (35, 0).
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Yes, this is possible <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.6.html#whatsnew36-pep515" rel="nofollow noreferrer">starting with python 3.6</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>PEP 515 adds the ability to use underscores in numeric literals for improved readability. For example:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; 1_000_000_000_000_000
1000000000000000
&gt;&gt;&gt; 0x_FF_FF_FF_FF
