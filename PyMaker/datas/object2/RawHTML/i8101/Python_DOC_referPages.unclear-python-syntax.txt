<p>I'm having a hard time understanding the following list comprehension:</p>
<pre><code>words = [word for line in open('words.txt', 'r') for word in line.split()]
</code></pre>
<p>I understand the first part, the <code>word for line in open('words.txt', 'r')</code> but the second part confuses me. Does it mean <em>for each line in <code>words.txt</code>, loop for each <code>word</code> on the split <code>line</code></em>?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The <code>for</code> loops are nested, from left to right. You can write it out as regular loops like this:</p>
<pre><code>words = []
for line in open('words.txt', 'r'):
    for word in line.split():
        words.append(word)
</code></pre>
<p>So the expression before the <code>for</code> loops is the final value added to the produced list, and all the <code>for</code> loops (and any <code>if</code> tests) are executed nested inside the preceding loop or test.</p>
<p>So, yes, for each line in the opened file, the line is split and the resulting words from those lines are added to the list being built.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Yes. That's exactly what it means.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@JeanFrançoisFabre: that dupe is for using a list comprehension as the expression of another list comprehension, not for using multiple for loops in a single list comprehension.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The second answer there may cover this case, but the answer is in entirely the wrong context there (it is the wrong answer for the question posted).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I note that the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python tutorial</a> covers the syntax in enough detail, including multiple <code>for</code> loops.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Jean-FrançoisFabre: no, we just had to find a better dupe.</span>
