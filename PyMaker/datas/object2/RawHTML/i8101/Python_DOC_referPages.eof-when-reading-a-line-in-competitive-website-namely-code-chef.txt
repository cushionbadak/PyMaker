<p>I'm trying to solve a problem using the following code:</p>
<pre><code>X,Y = map(float, input().split())

if X &lt; Y and not X % 5:
    print(Y - X - 0.50)
else:
    print(Y)
</code></pre>
<p>This code gives me the desired output when I run using IDLE. However, when I try running this code using an interpreter provided by a competitive programming website, I get the following error:</p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "./prog.py", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
EOFError: EOF when reading a line
</code></pre>
<p>I tried reading the answers of other similar questions, but none of them seemed to work in my case.</p>

<p>Take another look at the codechef page. Notice the checkbox marked 'Custom Input'. With that checked/ticked a textbox will open where you can put your input lines.</p>

<p>The competitive programming website is likely running python 2. Python 2 treats <code>input()</code> differently than python 3.</p>
<p>You should rather use <code>raw_input()</code> than <code>input()</code>.</p>
<p>From the docs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#raw_input" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>raw_input()</code></a> reads a line from input, converts it to a string
  (stripping a trailing newline), and returns that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your problem can be explained from what was explained <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4915361/whats-the-difference-between-raw-input-and-input-in-python3-x">here</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In Python 2, raw_input() returns a string, and input() tries to run
  the input as a Python expression.</p>

<p>I am not sure of the reason but the program is trying to read after the end of the data. You can solve the problem by exception handling</p>
<pre><code>try:
    data = input()
except EOFError:
    break
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Maybe the interpreter isn't passing any information to stdin, so your <code>input</code> call fails to get anything. Are you sure you're supposed to be getting X and Y through input? Maybe they're actually command line arguments or something. What competitive programming website is this, specifically?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Without having actual samples of the problem, it's hard to say.  Try debugging this by decoupling your input process: grab a line of input, check its contents for validity, print the line, etc.  See what sort of input is crashing your program.  It may be as simple as recognizing a null line at the end of the file.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What is the function call <code>input()</code> ? is that supposed to be the standard python 3.x <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html?highlight=input#input" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>input()</code></a>? maybe need to pull that line out out, and first <code>user_input = input().split()</code> and get the result first, then pass that user input into <code>map(float, user_input)</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Kevin It's CodeChef</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Prune The values do get recognised and work in IDLE</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You can choose which language to run it in. So, no that's not the problem. I'm explicitly running it in python 3.4</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Are you providing the input using the "custom input" feature on codechef? I did not run into any problem providing: <code>1 2</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">custom works fine. Just not their input. For reference use problem code HS08TEST in the compiler</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I think you need to clarify exactly where you are running the code and what input you are providing.</span>
