<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have a list of tuples [(x,y,z),...,] and I want to store this list of tuples in a file. For this I chose a .txt file. I write to the file in the mode "wb" and then I close it. Later, I want to open the file in mode "rb" and convert this byte object back to a list of tuples. How would I go about this without regular expression nonsense? Is there a file type that would allow me to store this data and read it easily that I've overlooked?</p>

<p>The <code>.txt</code> extension is typically not used for binary data, as you seem to intend.</p>
<p>Since your data structure is not known on a byte level, it's not that simple.
If you do know your data (types and length), you could "encode" it as a binary structure with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/struct.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/struct.html</a> and write that to a (binary) file.</p>
<p>Otherwise, there are many solutions to the problem of writing (structured) data to and reading data from files (that's why there are soo many file formats):</p>
