<p>For python programming, in most IDE's, the programmer must write the following in order to see a_var's value displayed in output: </p>
<pre><code>print(a_var) 
</code></pre>
<p>Contrarily, when using python in the Unix/Linux terminal, or in an Jupyter Notebook, simply writing: </p>
<pre><code>a_var
</code></pre>
<p>on a line will cause this variables value to display in output. </p>
<p>How and why does this differ intrinsically between different programming or development environments?</p>

<p>Python running interactively, or via a Ipython/Jupyter session is using a REPL, Read–Eval–Print Loop.  This code reads your input, evaluates it, and prints the result.  Each REPL will have its own rules for suppressing or allowing the display.  It may display the <code>str</code> or <code>repr</code> version.  It may also save the result in a temporary variable (often called <code>_</code>).</p>

<p>In the first case, you're using your IDE to write a program for Python to read in the whole thing and then execute, but in the second case you're just typing directly into the Python interpreter/shell. </p>
