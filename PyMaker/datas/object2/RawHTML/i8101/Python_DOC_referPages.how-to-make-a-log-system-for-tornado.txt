<p>I've read the documentation: <a href="http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/log.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/log.html</a><br/></p>
<p>But I still don't know how to make a suitable log for my server, which is built with tornado.<br/></p>
<p>For now, I need such a log system:<br/>
It can log everything with time format, and for each day it create a new log file.</p>
<p>It seems that <code>TimedRotatingFileHandler</code> is what I need but I don't know how to use it with tornado.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The Tornado logging streams are just standard loggers from the "logging" python module.</p>
<p>There is nice tutorial on the python website <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html#advanced-logging-tutorial" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html#advanced-logging-tutorial</a> </p>
<p>As per how to set the handler (same tutorial)

<span class="comment-copy">It might be easier for you to just write a logrotate configuration file for your application.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Blender Does logrotate have any major advantages over logging modules <code>RotatingHandler</code> or <code>TimeRotatingFileHandler</code>? I have no experience with logrotate but from the quick read of the documentation, all these seem to be doing exactly same things.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@xyres: It handles most common log rotation operations in a single line, like compression, deleting old logs, renaming, etc. It's what a lot of software uses. It's not as powerful as something written from scratch in Python, but I've never needed anything beyond compressing logs daily and removing anything older than a month.</span>
