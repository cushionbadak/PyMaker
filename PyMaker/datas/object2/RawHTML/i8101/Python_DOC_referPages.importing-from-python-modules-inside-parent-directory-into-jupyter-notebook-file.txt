<p>I have a file structure like this:</p>
<pre><code>project_folder/
     notebooks/
          notebook01.ipynb
          notebook02.ipynb
          ...
          notebookXY.ipynb
     module01.py
     module02.py
     module03.py
</code></pre>
<p>In <code>.ipynb</code> files inside <code>notebook/</code> folder I want to import classes and functions from <code>module01.py, module02.py</code> and <code>module03.py</code>.</p>
<p>I have found answer in this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34478398/import-local-function-from-a-module-housed-in-another-directory-with-relative-im">question</a> that it is possible using following lines of code inside every notebook and run those lines as first cell every time:</p>
<pre><code>import os
import sys
module_path = os.path.abspath(os.path.join('..'))
if module_path not in sys.path:
    sys.path.append(module_path)
</code></pre>
<p>Is there please a better way for this? What if I have A LOT of <code>.ipynb</code> files inside <code>notebooks/</code> folder, do I have to paste those lines of code at the beginning of every single one? Is there a better, more minimalist or cleaner way?</p>

<p>Try adding the <code>project_folder</code> to your <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html?highlight=pythonpath#envvar-PYTHONPATH" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>PYTHONPATH</code> environment variable.</a> This will allow you to tell python to search that directory for imports.</p>
<p>You would do this in your user profile settings, or in your startup script - not in python. It's something that has to be set before python ever gets run.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">how can I do this please?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">How are you running the <code>ipynb</code> files? From a command line, by clicking with a mouse, something else?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">clicking in Jupyter Notebook, I can do it by running cell with code: <code>sys.path.append(os.path.dirname(os.getcwd()))</code> but it does not solve my problem permanently, just until I restart kernel, it's almost the same as original solution in my Q body</span>
