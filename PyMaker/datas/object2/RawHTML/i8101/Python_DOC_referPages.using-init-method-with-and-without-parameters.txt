<p>I am new in python and please excuse me if my question is a basic question or is not clear. </p>
<p>I have a class in python and I want to set some attributes for my objects whenever I generate my objects from this class. I know, I must use <code>__init__</code> method for this purpose. </p>
<p>The problem is that I want to have this ability that I can set my attributes in two ways. For some of my objects, I want to pass some values to <code>__init__</code> method and set the attributes with those values. In addition, for some objects, I want to set some default values for attributes of my objects in <code>__init__</code> method.</p>
<p>My question: How can I have an <code>__init__</code> method that for some objects uses passed values for setting its attributes, and for some other objects, that are not passed, use default values? </p>

<p>Simply equate the the parameters that you would want to be defaulted to their default value. </p>
<p>For instance, <code>__init__(a,b,c=0)</code> would give 0 as the default value to c which you can override by passing another value when object is created. </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>def __init__(a,b,c='your default value')
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">It is also a good idea to know the behavior of <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1132941/least-astonishment-and-the-mutable-default-argument">mutable objects as default arguments</a>.</span>
