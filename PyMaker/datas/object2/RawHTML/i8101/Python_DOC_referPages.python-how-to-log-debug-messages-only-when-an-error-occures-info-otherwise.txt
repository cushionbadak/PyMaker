<p>My objective:</p>
<ul>
<li>If no error happened in the method, log only messages of level INFO
and higher.</li>
<li>If an error message appears, log all messages of level DEBUG and
higher prior to the error as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>I found logging.handlers.MemoryHandler class:
<a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/logging.handlers.html#memoryhandler" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/2/library/logging.handlers.html#memoryhandler</a></p>
<p>It partly fits my purpose. It buffers all messages and flushes them whenever an error-level message appears. But if there is no error-message, it won't log anything at all.</p>
<p>I want my app to still log INFOs and WARNINGs if there were no error.</p>
<p>What's the best way to implement that?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The way I see it you can achieve something similar by configuring two loggers.</p>
<ol>
<li>INFO-Logger to log only INFO level logging</li>
<li>DETAIL-Logger to log in DEBUG mode</li>
</ol>
<p>As an example see the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging-cookbook.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation</a></p>
<p>You can decide how to log them, same file (maybe) or separate files (my-simple.log and my-detailed.log)</p>
