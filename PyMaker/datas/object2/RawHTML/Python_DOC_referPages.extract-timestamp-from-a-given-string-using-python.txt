<p>I tried multiple packages to extract timestamp from a given string, but no package gives correct results. I did use <code>dateutils</code>, <code>datefinder</code>, <code>parsedatetime</code>, etc. for this task. They extract some datetimes which are in certain formats but not all formats, sometimes they extract some unwanted numbers also as timestamps.</p>
<p>Is there any python package which extracts <code>datetime</code> from a given string.</p>
<p>Assume, I have 2 strings like these: </p>
<pre><code>scala&gt; val xorder= new order(1,"2016-02-22 00:00:00.00",100,"COMPLETED") 
</code></pre>
<p>and </p>
<pre><code>Fri, 10 Jun 2011 11:04:17 +0200 (CEST)
</code></pre>
<p>and want to extract only <code>datetime</code>. Is there any function which extracts both formats of <code>datetimes</code> from above strings. In other cases formats may be different, still it should pick out <code>datetime</code> strings</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use the datetime function strptime() as follows</p>
<pre><code>dt = datetime.strptime("21/11/06 16:30", "%d/%m/%y %H:%M")
</code></pre>
<p>You can create your own formatting and use the function as well.</p>

<p>I created a small python package <strong>datetime_extractor</strong> to pull out timestamps from a given strings. It can extract many datetime formats from given strings. Hope it will be useful.</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>pip install datetime-extractor

from datetime_extractor import DateTimeExtractor
import re

samplestring1 = 'scala&gt; val xorder= new order(1,"2016-02-22 00:00:00.00",100,"COMPLETED")'

DateTimeExtractor(samplestring1)

Out: ['2016-02-22 00:00:00.00']

samplestring2 = 'Fri, 10 Jun 2011 11:04:17 +0200 (CEST)'

DateTimeExtractor(samplestring2)

Out: ['10 Jun 2011 11:04:17']

<span class="comment-copy">Could you give us an example of input string you want to extract a timestamp from?</span>

<span class="comment-copy">The above function you mentioned can be useful once datetime strings are extracted from text summaries. We need to pull out those strings first. Ex:- 'scala&gt; val xorder= new order(1,"2016-02-22 00:00:00.00",100,"COMPLETED")' from this first, we need to extract "2016-02-22 00:00:00" and then convert it to python datetime.</span>
