<p>I'm trying to take a regular expression as an argument to my python program (which is a string naturally) and simply match it against another string.</p>
<p>Let's say I run it as</p>
<p><code>python program.py 'Hi.there'</code></p>
<p>I'd like to be able to then take that input (call it input) and say whether or not it matches 'HiTthere' (it should).</p>
<p>How should I do this? I'm inexperienced at regex.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>From my understanding, you're looking for something like:</p>
<pre><code>import sys, re

regex = sys.argv[1]

someOtherString = 'hi there'

found = re.search(regex, someOtherString)
print('ok' if found else 'nope')
</code></pre>
<p>Run this program with an expression as a first argument:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; python test.py hi.th
ok
&gt; python test.py blah
nope
</code></pre>
<p>Unlike, say, javascript, python regexes are simple strings, so you can directly use <code>sys.argv[1]</code> as an argument to <code>re.search</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Python 3 syntax (Python 2, use <code>print xxx</code> instead of <code>print(xxx)</code>):</p>
<pre><code>import re

if re.match(r'^Hi.there$', 'HiTthere'): # returns a "match" object or None
    print("matches")
else:
    print("no match")
</code></pre>
<p>Note that I'm using the anchors <code>^</code> and <code>$</code> to guarantee that the match spans the entire input. <code>^</code> matches the start of the string and <code>$</code> matches the end of the string.</p>
<p>See <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html" rel="nofollow">the documentation</a> for much more detail.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Okay, cool. This helps (I didn't know that regexes are just strings). Just a quick note, I was looking for the number of times that was found (so instead of search, I'm now using findall)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Although, you really only need the <code>$</code> anchor since <code>re.match</code> starts at the start of the string by default.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yep. I find using <code>^</code>/<code>$</code> as a pair to be more explicit, but you can skip <code>^</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is helpful, but the thing is that I have the 'Hi.there' as a string object first (as I pass it as an argument to the program, not as a string literal). Can I do the same thing?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@RiverTam -- Sure.  Just substitute <code>'HiTthere'</code> with <code>sys.argv[1]</code> (with proper import of course).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Are you looking for a pattern <i>in</i> another string? My answer was for <i>matching</i> an entire string with a pattern. To search, use <code>re.search</code> and leave off the anchors (<code>^</code>/<code>$</code>).</span>
