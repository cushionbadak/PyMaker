<p>I know that if I want to get the intersection of two sets (or frozensets) I should use the ampersand <code>&amp;</code>. Out of curiosity I tried to use the word 'and' </p>
<pre><code>a = set([1,2,3])
b = set([3,4,5])
print(a and b) #prints set([3,4,5])
</code></pre>
<p>I am just curious why? what does this <code>and</code> represent when used with lists?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>x and y</code> just treats the whole <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> expressions as boolean values. If <code>x</code> is false, it returns <code>x</code>. Otherwise, it returns <code>y</code>. See <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#boolean-operations-and-or-not" rel="noreferrer">the docs</a> for details.</p>
<p>Both <code>set</code>s (as in your example) and <code>list</code>s (as in your question) are false if and only if they're empty. Again, see <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#truth-value-testing" rel="noreferrer">the docs</a> for details.</p>
<p>So, <code>x and y</code> will return <code>x</code> if it's empty, and <code>y</code> otherwise.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">@thewolf: Good addition; let me add that link to the answer as well.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Nice and succinctly stated</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@JonClements: Actually, looking at the docs, they're even nicer and more succinct. <code>x and y</code> is defined as "if <code>x</code> is false, then <code>x</code>, else <code>y</code>". That's really all that needs to be said.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you. Just waiting the 10 minutes to accept the answer :)</span>
