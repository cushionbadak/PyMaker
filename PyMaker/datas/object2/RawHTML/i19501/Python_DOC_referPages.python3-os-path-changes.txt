<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I am using <code>python 3.3</code> in Windows 7.</p>
<p>The python file, <code>main.py</code> is in <code>D:\my proj\$MY\1</code></p>
<p>I wrote the following code in that file:</p>
<pre><code>import os

file_usage = "usage.txt"
p1 = os.getcwd()
print ("os.getcwd(): ", p1)

p5 = os.path.join(p1,"report")
print ("os.path.join: ", p5)

file = open(file_usage, "a")
file.write ("*****BLAH-BLAH*****")
file.close()
</code></pre>
<p>So, When I run my program in cmd, it gives me output like:</p>
<pre><code>os.getcwd():  D:\my proj\$MY\1
os.path.join:  D:\my proj\$MY\1\report
</code></pre>
<p>Now, <code>usage.txt</code> file is generating in the directory where my <code>main.py</code> is located means inside the <code>1</code> folder.</p>
<p>But I have tried to modify the path that it should be saved in <code>report</code> folder as you can see the value of <code>os.path.join</code>.</p>
<p>So, I want to save the generated <code>usage.txt</code> in the <code>report</code> folder instead of <code>1</code>. 
What type of changes should I do? or what other modules do I need to use?</p>
<p>I'm a novice user. So, please try to tell me in-depth or send me links from where I can get more knowledge or examples related to this. I'm awaiting for your reply.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>open(os.path.join(p5, "usage.txt"), "w")
</code></pre>
<p>Since <code>p5</code> is the path to the report directory, this will open a <code>usage.txt</code> file inside that dir.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Hey, thanks for your help. It really works. And now I learned it too! Can you suggest me some links regarding python 3 from where I can learn about routine or general examples.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@magneto The documentation at <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3</a> is quite excellent. Check out <a href="https://developers.google.com/edu/python/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Google's Python class</a> for exercises.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">hmm, but why I feel like it's for a good programmer who can implement new things or can solve big errors. Because I have tried my best before asking anything here but I failed to understand most of the time. Sorry for late reply as I was out of town. Thanks again.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@magneto: Hmm, maybe <a href="http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Learn Python the hard way</a> is more your cup of tea? Given that you seem to understand the basic concepts of programming but have some difficulty combining them, I think some intermediate tutorial with lots of practical exercises might suit you best.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">yup, thanks but it seems on python 3. Anyway, I'm gonna try that. And how can I contact you personally? Can I have your email-id?</span>
