<p>I am writing a python script to read a file which consists of three columns separated by commas, create a tuple of each line, and make a list of these tuples. With the following script I achieve what I want; I was just wondering whether there is an easier / more elegant approach than writing each of the following steps in a seperate line.</p>
<pre><code>import sys
fin=open(sys.argv[1],'r') 

list  = []

for line1 in fin:
        line2 = line1[:-1]
        line3 = line2.split(',')
        line4 = tuple(line3)
        list.append(line4)
print(list)
</code></pre>
<p>Thank you for your answers. </p>

<p>Python comes with batteries included! If you need to read csv files, just use the <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html" rel="nofollow">csv module</a>:</p>
<pre><code>import sys, csv

with open(sys.argv[1]) as f:
    lst = list(csv.reader(f))
</code></pre>
<p>Note that this creates a list of lists, if you want tuples for some reason, then</p>
<pre><code>with open(sys.argv[1]) as f:
    lst = [tuple(row) for row in csv.reader(f)]
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Using a list comprehension:</p>
<pre><code>lst = [tuple(line.rstrip().split(',')) for line in fin]
</code></pre>
<p>(Don't name your variables <code>list</code>; it shadows the built-in and can lead to unexpected bugs).</p>

<span class="comment-copy">To add/fix the <code>csv</code> module requires one more argument for the <code>open()</code>. It is <code>newline=''</code> for Python 3 or <code>'rb'</code> for Python 2.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@mgilson: use a proper font if you confuse <code>l</code> and <code>1</code>! :-P</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I probably have <code>l</code> variable names all over my personal code, but PEP8 <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#names-to-avoid" rel="nofollow noreferrer">warns against it</a>.  I feel like answers from top users should be examples of pristine python code :-) (feel free to clean up any of my less than ideal posts at any time ;-)-- Plus it gets me one edit closer to some badge about editing that I don't know the name of ...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@mgilson: :-P Okay, if PEP-8 warns against it I'll be more careful in the future..</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you, this was what I was looking for. I will call my lists "List" in the future; will this be fine?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Julian -- Usually names like <code>List</code> are reserved for classes (as that follows the <code>CapWords</code> convention).  I think it's more typical to see something like <code>lst</code> for a general purpose throw-away list (that's what I use)</span>
