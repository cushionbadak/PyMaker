<p>No, there isn't. Roll your own.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">just create a list of python keywords and build a hashset (or something equivalent). It's not like they change often...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">When the script does not require to be human readable, just make any name end with an underscore and they won't clash with any keyword.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Actually I want to know "is there a library for this ?"</span>
<span class="comment-copy">maybe you could try to describe your problem more... do you have examples? Actually your question is not very understandable .-(</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm looking for a library like <b>Microsoft.Scripting</b> which including python keywors.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Roll your own by referring to the Python function iskeyword() in the standard library in keyword.py and translate this to c#. Also 'as' and 'None' may or may not be in this list but should be included for future compatibility (<a href="http://docs.python.org/release/2.3.5/ref/keywords.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/release/2.3.5/ref/keywords.html</a>)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@leancz That is a <i>very</i> old version of python to be referencing. <code>as</code> and <code>None</code> are keywords and have been for several years (since 2.6 IIRC).  See <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#keywords" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#keywords</a> for an up-to-date list.</span>
