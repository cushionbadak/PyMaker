<p>I have a constantly running Python code on Linux, every so often outside data needs to be fed into this code so Python code can alter a file. 
How do I go about structuring Python code so it receives these arguments for further processing?</p>
<p>I found some stuff on outgoing args, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6998955/running-external-program-using-pipes-and-passing-arguments-in-python">Running external program using pipes and passing arguments in python</a></p>
<p>But looking for in coming args</p>
<p>Flexible with how arguments get passed down</p>

<p>You need some kind of Inter Process Communication.</p>
<p>For example, you can feed program's standard input. You can read it by reading from <code>sys.stdin</code>, but it requires the program that started your process to give its handle to another process.</p>
<p>Another way is to create a <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html" rel="nofollow">socket</a> of some kind. That's far more scalable, allows connecting to the program when it's running on another machine, and allows non-Python processes to easily communicate with your process.</p>
