<p>I am writing a program in Python 3 that will take data from a csv file, make adjustments to it and write the new data to a csv file that will be named by the user.</p>
<p>I'm just trying to understand the command line part.
I want it to execute properly in this format.</p>
<pre><code>$ program.py input.csv output.csv
</code></pre>
<p>I plan to also make it check that there are 3 total arguments.</p>
<p>My question is where do this filename inputs on the command line go?
Are they saved to a default variable? How can I call these filenames within my python program?</p>

<p>Command line options are stored in sys.argv. You may want to check this:</p>
<p><a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html?highlight=argv#sys.argv" rel="noreferrer">http://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html?highlight=argv#sys.argv</a></p>
<p>Beside, if you need more complex command-line argument parsing and deciding your program logic based on that, you should try <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html?highlight=argparse#argparse" rel="noreferrer">argparse</a></p>

<span class="comment-copy">For calling these filenames, you already have sys.popen, os.system, subprocess modules.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">perfect. thanks</span>
