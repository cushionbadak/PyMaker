<p>Sorry if it is a stupid question.
Normally when I need a package, I import filename.py.
How is about this <a href="https://github.com/simplegeo/python-oauth2" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/simplegeo/python-oauth2</a> ? How can I import this package since I cannot find oauth2.py file.</p>
<p>Do I copy this oauth2 folder to project root and then do import oauth2?</p>
<p>I am just a beginner so can you give me detail instruction?
Thanks for your time</p>

<p>Read <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html#packages" rel="nofollow"><strong>this</strong></a> first.</p>
<p>Now if you check out <a href="https://github.com/simplegeo/python-oauth2/blob/master/oauth2/__init__.py" rel="nofollow"><code>oauth2/__init__.py</code></a>, you will see oauth already do <code>import httplib2</code> so you don't have to import it yourself. (Unless you also are using httplib2, of course.)</p>

<p>In essence, you are correct. If you want to use a python package in a GAE app you have to have a copy of it it in the applications root directory where it can be accessed by your application as a normal import. It will then be uploaded along with your applications code and be usable when deployed too. </p>
<p>There are exceptions where you don't have to do this as the library is provided for you, you can read about those here: <a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/tools/libraries27" rel="nofollow">Supported 3rd Party Libraries</a></p>
<p>For those you need to edit your app.yaml. </p>
<p>For oauth2 you should look at google specific implementations. I don't know what you've linked to there, all I know is the endless stream of oauth/gae questions usually end up here: <a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/oauth/overview" rel="nofollow">https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/oauth/overview</a></p>

<span class="comment-copy">how is that you don't get any error doing <code>import filename.py</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thank you very much</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thanks for helping. I am doing import httplib2 and import oauth2 as oauth in views.py. However, it seems like oauth2 depends on httplib2, so do I have to go inside oauth2 to add 'import httplib2'? if so, where should I add that in oauth2, I am so confused.</span>
