<p>Trying to create a train booking system.
Having trouble searching my csv and printing that certain line.</p>
<p>The user already has there id number,and the csv is is set out like</p>
<p>This is what I have so far:</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You are matching the entire line against the ID. You need to split out the first field and check that:</p>
<pre><code>def buySeat():
    id = raw_input("please enter your ID")

for line in open("customers.csv"):
    if line.split(',')[0] == id:
        print line
    else:
        print "sorry cant find you"
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Try using the built-in CSV module. It will make things easier to manage as your requirements change.</p>
<pre><code>import csv

id = raw_input("please enter your ID")

ID_INDEX = 0

with open('customers.csv', 'rb') as csvfile:
    csvReader = csv.reader(csvfile)
    for row in csvReader:
        # Ignore the column names on the first line.
        if row[ID_INDEX] != 'counter':
            if row[ID_INDEX] == id:
                print ' '.join(row)
            else:
                print 'sorry cant find you'
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Just FYI, the built-in <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#module-csv" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>csv</code></a> module will do most of the CSV parsing for you.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>if id in line:</code> would work but is not precise enough as <code>id = 1</code> would match all lines with <code>1</code> in it. You need to pull out the <code>id</code> column which doesn't seem to be in your dataset anyway.!</span>
