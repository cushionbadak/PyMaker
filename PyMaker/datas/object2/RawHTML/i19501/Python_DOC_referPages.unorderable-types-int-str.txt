<p>I'm trying to make a retirement calculator right now on Python. There's nothing wrong with the syntax but when I run the following program:</p>
<pre><code>def main():
    print("Let me Retire Financial Calculator")
    deposit = input("Please input annual deposit in dollars: $")
    rate = input ("Please input annual rate in percentage: %")
    time = input("How many years until retirement?")
    x = 0
    value = 0
    while (x &lt; time):
        x = x + 1
        value = (value * rate) + deposit
        print("The value of your account after" +str(time) + "years will be $" + str(value))
</code></pre>
<p>It tells me that:</p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/myname/Documents/Let Me Retire.py", line 8, in &lt;module&gt;
    while (x &lt; time):
TypeError: unorderable types: int() &lt; str()
</code></pre>
<p>Any ideas how I could solve this?</p>

<p>The issue here is that <code>input()</code> returns a string in Python 3.x, so when you do your comparison, you are comparing a string and an integer, which isn't well defined (what if the string is a word, how does one compare a string and a number?) - in this case Python doesn't guess, it throws an error.</p>
<p>To fix this, simply call <a href="http://docs.python.org/3.3/library/functions.html#int" rel="noreferrer"><code>int()</code></a> to convert your string to an integer:</p>
<pre><code>int(input(...))
</code></pre>
<p>As a note, if you want to deal with decimal numbers, you will want to use one of <a href="http://docs.python.org/3.3/library/functions.html#float" rel="noreferrer"><code>float()</code></a> or <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/decimal.html#decimal-objects" rel="noreferrer"><code>decimal.Decimal()</code></a> (depending on your accuracy and speed needs).</p>
<p>Note that the more pythonic way of looping over a series of numbers (as opposed to a <code>while</code> loop and counting) is to use <code>range()</code>. For example:</p>
<pre><code>def main():
    print("Let me Retire Financial Calculator")
    deposit = float(input("Please input annual deposit in dollars: $"))
    rate = int(input ("Please input annual rate in percentage: %")) / 100
    time = int(input("How many years until retirement?"))
    value = 0
    for x in range(1, time+1):
        value = (value * rate) + deposit
        print("The value of your account after" + str(x) + "years will be $" + str(value))
</code></pre>

<p>Just a side note, in Python 2.0 you could compare anything to anything (int to string). As this wasn't explicit, it was changed in 3.0, which is a good thing as you are not running into the trouble of comparing senseless values with each other or when you forget to convert a type. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">okay I figured it all out. Thank you so very much for your time and effort. I really do appreciate it. Thank you so much kind sir. There's one last issue to resolve which is that the annual rate decreases with time. For example if I input 500 dollars over 10 years at 50% rate it gives me 550 dollars after one year, 555.0, 555.55, 555.5555, etc...As in it doesn't actually do 50 percent yearly.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user2074050 That's just a maths error. You are adding to the deposit, not the current value. You want <code>value *= (1 + rate)</code> (multiply last year's value by the rate plus one).</span>
