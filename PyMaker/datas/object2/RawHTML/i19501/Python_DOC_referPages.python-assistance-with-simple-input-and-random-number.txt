<p>I am trying to get this simple piece of code to run, which iterates a sequence of four random numbers until it matches the four digit number input by the user. I know there are simpler ways to do this, but I'm just wondering as to why this it not working. The program will compile and when it reaches the while check, the screen the terminal just never updates and the program doesn't terminate. thanks</p>
<pre><code>import random
attempts = 0
pin = input("Please enter your four digit pin: ")
str_pin1 = str(pin)


while True:
    digit1 = random.randint(0,9)
    digit2 = random.randint(0,9)
    digit3 = random.randint(0,9)
    digit4 = random.randint(0,9)
        digit1 = str(digit1)
        digit2 = str(digit2)
        digit3 = str(digit3)
        digit4 = str(digit4)
    attempts = attempts +1

    if digit1 == str_pin[0] and digit2 == str_pin[1] and digit3 == str_pin[2] and   str_pin[3]:)
        break
print('it took', attempts, 'for random number to find your code')
</code></pre>

<p>A simple typo: you have <code>digit2</code> in both the second and third cases of your <code>if</code> statement, so unless the <code>pin</code> has the same digits in both places it will never match.</p>
<p>In addition a comparison of an integer with a string will never be equal. You need to convert each random digit to a string.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You could just do this:</p>
<pre><code>import random
attempts = 0
pin = input("Please enter your four digit pin: ")
guess = ""

while guess != pin:
    guess = str(random.randint(0,10000))
    while len(guess) &lt; 3:
        guess = "0" + guess
    attempts = attempts +1

print('it took', attempts, 'for random number to find your code')

<span class="comment-copy"><code>input</code> <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html?highlight=input#input" rel="nofollow noreferrer">returns a string</a> so there is no need to call <code>str()</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">The lines of code to be repeated in the <code>while</code> loop should be indented four (4) spaces.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">They are indented, forgot to do that here</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You are checking that digit2 matches str_pin[3] which does not match the first two conditional checks.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@J.F.Sebastian: Except that most PIN systems don't consider "23" and "0023" to be the same PINâ€¦</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yeah thanks for pointing this out, don't know why i was trying to compare a string with a int!</span>
