<p>I recently wrote this script in Python 3.5 to search a text file for a given string, I can't seem to figure out how to have the script remove the rest of the words after the word "log" shows up in the line.</p>
<pre><code>file1 = input ('What is the name of the file? ')
search_string = input ('What are you looking for? ')
with open(file1) as cooldude:
for line in cooldude:
    line = line.rstrip()
    if search_string in line:
        print(line)
</code></pre>
<p>An example would be:
"I want to keep this stuff. log I don't want this stuff."
I would want to remove everything after and including the word "log". Thanks!</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If all you want is to remove the part of the text after a pattern <code>'log'</code>  in a line, you could use either the first part of the output of <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.partition" rel="nofollow"><code>str.partition</code></a> or the 0'th index of <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.split" rel="nofollow"><code>str.split</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; line = "I want to keep this stuff. log I don't want this stuff."

&gt;&gt;&gt; line1,sep,_ = line.partition('log')
&gt;&gt;&gt; line1
"I want to keep this stuff. "

&gt;&gt;&gt; line2 = line.split('log')[0]
&gt;&gt;&gt; line2  
"I want to keep this stuff. "
</code></pre>
<p>For a slight variation one could remove only the part after the last <code>'log'</code> using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.rsplit" rel="nofollow"><code>str.rsplit</code></a> with <code>maxsplit=1</code>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; line = "I want to keep this stuff. log log I don't want this stuff."
&gt;&gt;&gt; line3 = line.rsplit('log',1)[0]
&gt;&gt;&gt; line3
"I want to keep this stuff. log"
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">What if a line contains the word "<b>log</b>ic" or "<b>log</b>arithm"? Or "ana<b>log</b>"?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The file(s) I would be searching would not have any of those words within the line.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">so <code>line,sep,_ = line.partition('log')</code> or <code>line = line.split('log')[0]</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@M.T why did you write that as a comment, it's is a perfectly good answer :-)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@M.T thank you so much! :D</span>
