<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html" rel="nofollow">Python's documentation</a> doesn't mention the operator precedence of <code>=</code>. So what is it?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>=</code> is not an operator. <code>=</code> is an <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#assignment-statements" rel="nofollow">assignment <strong>statement</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Because it is a statement, it can't be part of an expression (expressions are instead part of certain statements, and never the other way around), so ordering is irrelevant. The expression is always executed to serve a statement.</p>
<p>For assignments, the grammar specifies that specific types of expressions are permitted after the <code>=</code> symbol:</p>
<pre><code>assignment_stmt ::=  (target_list "=")+ (starred_expression | yield_expression)
</code></pre>
<p>and the documentation for that statement details what order things are executed in:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An assignment statement evaluates the expression list (remember that this can be a single expression or a comma-separated list, the latter yielding a tuple) and assigns the single resulting object to each of the target lists, from left to right.</p>
