<p>basically I have a structure like  "myapp/installed_application_10101010/", however, the number of that folder will change regularly. </p>
<p>Therefore I need a way to find this folder everytime. Almost similar to how unix works when you press tab in the terminal, it'll autofill the rest of the name. </p>

<p>You could use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/glob.html" rel="nofollow">glob</a> module for this.</p>
<pre><code>import glob

possible_folders = glob.glob('myapp/installed_application_*/')
# returns ['myapp/installed_application_10101010/']
</code></pre>
<p>The method returns a list because there could be multiple matches. </p>
