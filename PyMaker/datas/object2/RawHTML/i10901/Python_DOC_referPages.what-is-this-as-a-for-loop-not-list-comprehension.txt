<p>I came across a program and want to know what the program would be without the list comprehensions. Shown below is the code Thank You:</p>
<pre><code>sentence = input("Enter a sentence: ")
sentence = sentence.lower().split()
uniquewords = []
for word in sentence:
    if word not in uniquewords:
        uniquewords.append(word)

positions = [uniquewords.index(word) for word in sentence]
recreated = " ".join([uniquewords[i] for i in positions])

print (positions)
print (recreated)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>A list comprehension can be replaced by a more-or-less equivalent <code>for</code> loop. Consider these two snippets:</p>
<pre><code># 1
a = [f(b) for b in expression]

# 2
a = []
for b in expression:
    a.append(f(b))
</code></pre>
<p>You can see how the elements of the list comprehension appear in the expanded <code>for</code> loop.</p>
<p>These two list comprehensions:</p>
<pre><code>positions = [uniquewords.index(word) for word in sentence]
recreated = " ".join([uniquewords[i] for i in positions])
</code></pre>
<p>Are roughly equivalent to:</p>
<pre><code>positions = []
for word in sentence:
    positions.append(uniquewords.index(word)
recreated_temp = []
for i in positions:
    recreated_temp.append(uniquewords[i])
recreated = " ".join(recreated_temp)
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">It would throw an error, 'recreated' uses the variables in the list 'positions'. 'Recreated' returns a string of parsed words located at the indices specified in positions</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Try reading the docs on list comprehensions? <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/tutorial/â€¦</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">I just assumed the OP was asking about a literal deletion, not a reworking</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No, wait. It's worse: it just rebuilds the original list. The only change is that it's all lowercase and words are spaced by a single space... So I'm pretty sure this is just a bad way of writing <code>" ".join(sentence.lower().split())</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank You helped</span>
