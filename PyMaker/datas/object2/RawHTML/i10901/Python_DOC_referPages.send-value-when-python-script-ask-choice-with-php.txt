<p>I want to sending data from php frontend to python. I have the following php code.</p>
<pre><code>shell_exec ("sudo python /python/ba10e.py &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp;");
</code></pre>
<p>With the above code, sending data to python works, However when python program asks for a choice mentioned below:</p>
<pre><code>The money that you input is incorrect, you want to continue?
</code></pre>
<p>There are two choices, "Y" and "N".</p>
<p>How should implement the part of sending value to Python program when "Y" is entered. Is it possible to do so?</p>
<p>Thanks and regards!</p>

<p>Since you are looking for communication rather than just script invocation, I think you should look at inter-process communication methods, such as sockets. You can find plenty of resources online on how to do this, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/sockets.html" rel="nofollow">here's</a> one from the python docs.</p>
