<p>I am trying to teach my friend Python and showed him 3 methods of printing variables of different types without the need for converting them to strings first, but he wants to know which one should he use and I don't know as I have not used Python in a long time so hopefully you can help us out:</p>
<pre><code>print("There are %d people in total" % num_people)
</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code>print("There are", num_people, "people in total")
</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code>print("There are {} people in total".format(num_people))
</code></pre>
<p>I know that the format method can do other, more powerful, string manipulation operations but other then that I am not sure which is the preferred method to use. I don't know why the first method exists as the 2nd seems simpler.</p>
<p>Any thoughts on this? Thank you!</p>

<p>With regards to <code>%</code> vs. <code>.format</code> please see similar questions like <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5082452/python-string-formatting-vs-format">this</a>, as others have pointed out.</p>
<p>Regarding</p>
<pre><code>print("There are", num_people, "people in total")
</code></pre>
<p>This is really just a convenience provided by the <code>print()</code> function. In stead of printing just one argument, the signature allows for multiple arguments, which are converted to string separately and then joined with one blank (by default) as a separator. This is quite useful for a quick output of several objects, but generally unsuited for generating formatted output. Just printing a decimal number that is given with high precision may produced an output of limited usability. See <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the documentation of print()</a> for more information on its capabilities.</p>

<p>The Python style guide recommends using the <code>format</code> method. Here is the link to that document: <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3101/" rel="nofollow" title="PEP 3101">"PEP 3101"</a></p>

<span class="comment-copy">Thank you, I was mainly concerned with the difference between printing with multiple arguments and formatting so this helped.</span>
