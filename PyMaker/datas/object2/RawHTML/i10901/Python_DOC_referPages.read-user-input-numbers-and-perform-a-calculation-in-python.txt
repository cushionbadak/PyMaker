<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>please help me... "Read in two numbers from user input without a prompt, add them, and print the result. 
 Hint: Use int() to convert the numbers to integers. </p>
<p>Note: These activities may test code with different test values. This activity will perform two tests: the first with num1 = 5 and num2 = 10, the second with num1 = 6 and num2 = 3. "</p>
<p>I tried just doing one and it didn't work but I can't wrap my head around how to do two tests let alone one...
I tried this so far and it came out with 510..noob please help</p>
<pre><code>num1=int(input(5)) 
num2=int(input(10))
num3=num1 + num2
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>in fact you need just:</p>
<pre><code>num1 = int(input())
num2 = int(input())
num3 = num1+num2
print(num3)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The argument to the input() function is the string to display as a prompt.</p>
<p>In your case, you'd want that to be simply input().</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Don't pass parameters into <code>input</code>. You're asking the <em>user</em> for input.</p>
<p>I don't think the assignment is asking you to write your own tests. I think it's saying that whatever code you give it will be tested.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">also <code>input()</code> evaluates to <code>int</code> automatically so you could remove that to just <code>num1=input()</code></span>

<span class="comment-copy">@depperm: Are you sure about that? The return value of input() is always a Type 'str'. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">it evaluates it, see <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20449427/how-can-i-read-inputs-as-integers-in-python" title="how can i read inputs as integers in python">stackoverflow.com/questions/20449427/â€¦</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ahh I see, the input() function in Python2.x has different behavior. My answer is only valid for Python3.x where raw_input and input are the same.  Learnt something new today. Cheers!</span>
