<p>I'm trying to run environments OpenAI gym ("gym") on some reinforcement learning code I found on github: <a href="https://github.com/rllab/rllab" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/rllab/rllab</a>.</p>
<p>However, whenever I import gym, I get an error message:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You have 'numpy' version 1.8.2 installed, but 'gym' requires at least 1.10.4</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Straightforward right? However, that leads me to problem 1: I started with a later version  of NumPy (in fact, I upgraded to 1.11.1 a few days ago, before downgrading), but had to downgrade to version "0x9" for rllab to work. That's where version 1.8.2 came from. However, rllab claims to be compatible with gym.</p>
<p>But anyways, I still continued because maybe I could have better luck with version 1.10.4. Because I don't have root access, I use:</p>
<pre><code>pip install numpy==1.10.4 --user
</code></pre>
<p>That works. Then I import gym again, but I still get the same error message! According to python (both in shell and in an IDE), the numpy version is still 1.8.2. Thus problem 2.</p>
<p>In sum:
1. How can I make rllab compatible with gym, given the errors I've seen?
2. How do I uninstall version 1.8.2 without sudo privileges to make sure gym can run?</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<ol>
<li>rllab has now been deprecated and is actively maintained as <a href="https://github.com/rlworkgroup/garage/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">garage</a>. Garage is completely compatible OpenAI gym and has no 'numpy' version conglicts.</li>
<li>Regarding unistall without sudo privileges, you can avoid these issues by simply using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Virtual environments</a></li>
