<p>I want to make my program open first 5 searches of google. Currently I have only simple google search generator which opens a search. Is there a way to open 5 searches into new tabs then close them ?</p>
<pre><code>dict = readdict()

lenght = len(dict)
search_term=""
for _ in range(self.variable2.get()):
    skc=randint(0,lenght)

    word = dict[skc].split(',')

    search_term+=word[0]+" "

url = "https://www.google.com.tr/search?q={}".format(search_term)    
webbrowser.open(url)
</code></pre>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>
<pre><code>url = "https://www.google.com.tr/search?q={}".format(term)
webbrowser.open_new_tab(url)
</code></pre>
<p>to open new tab, but now could anyone tell me how to click first 5 results which I get from opening some google search
<strong>EDIT</strong>
so I figured a way out with lib called google</p>
<pre><code>for url in search('"search_term', stop=5):
</code></pre>
<p>also I just decided that I would close them all just with task kill because webbroser lib doesn't have close window command</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/webbrowser.html#webbrowser.open_new_tab" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>open_new_tab</code></a> function:</p>
<pre><code>import webbrowser
search_terms = []

# ... construct your list of search terms ...

for term in search_terms:
    url = "https://www.google.com.tr/search?q={}".format(term)
    webbrowser.open_new_tab(url)
</code></pre>
<p>This should open your URLs each in a new tab, if supported by the browser. If not, it will fall back to opening a new window for each tab.</p>
<p>If you have issues getting it to open specifically in Chrome, even as default browser (<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22445217/python-webbrowser-open-to-open-chrome-browser">see here</a>), try replacing the last line with:</p>
<pre><code>chrome_browser = webbrowser.get("C:/Program Files (x86)/Google/Chrome/Application/chrome.exe %s")
chrome_browser.open_new_tab(url)
</code></pre>
<p>using the equivalent location of your Chrome install.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Why is this tagged with google-crome?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@linusg, I'm guessing OP has Chrome as their default browser.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@whrrgarbl - Yes, that might be a reason. I just saw your answer and remembered me using the <code>open_new_tab</code> function - which opened new <i>Windows</i> instead of <i>Tabs</i> using Firefox, IDK why. I've tried the code snippet, the default Browser of my OS is Firefox, and <b>it opens new windows of InternetExplorer - Arhhhh!</b></span>
<span class="comment-copy">I changed the default browser to Chrome, Edge, FF - nothing. It always opens the IE in new windows.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@linusg uh oh. I thought it was just my (restricted) work setup doing that... I'll try a few things. Looks like this is a common issue though: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22445217/python-webbrowser-open-to-open-chrome-browser" title="python webbrowser open to open chrome browser">stackoverflow.com/questions/22445217/…</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">okay that solves one problem, but how could i open first 5 search results?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Kojimosa Oh, when I posted I thought your main issue was with the new tabs and you already had URLs. I don't know offhand what sort of API Google offers, but a quick search turned up <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1657570/google-search-from-a-python-app" title="google search from a python app">stackoverflow.com/questions/1657570/…</a>, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3898574/google-search-using-python-script" title="google search using python script">stackoverflow.com/questions/3898574/…</a>, and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/35125696/search-all-of-google-with-google-python-api" title="search all of google with google python api">stackoverflow.com/questions/35125696/…</a> which may be useful. I see your question edits though, have you solved that part already?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">yes I solved practicly most part with google module, just didn't found right way to close tabs</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You can't close specific tabs through webbrowser, see <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30326196/how-to-close-the-existing-browser-tab-using-the-python-webbrowser-package" title="how to close the existing browser tab using the python webbrowser package">stackoverflow.com/questions/30326196/…</a>. Unfortunately it seems you're pretty much limited to issuing an OS command to kill all Chrome processes.</span>
