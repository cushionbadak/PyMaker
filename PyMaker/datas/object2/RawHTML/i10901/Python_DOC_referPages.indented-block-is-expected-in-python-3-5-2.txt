<p>I think you mean to have code that looks something like this:</p>
<pre><code>x = 2
x = x + 12
if x &lt; 10:
    print (x , ' is smaller than 10.')
else:
    print (x , 'is greater than or larger than 10.')
</code></pre>
<p>Because here as you can see there are indents, if you don't already know that about python, you should give the basics a read again. Try <a href="ftp://91.193.237.1/pub/docs/linux-support/programming/Python/[O%60Reilly]%20-%20Programming%20Python,%204th%20ed.%20-%20[Lutz]/[O%60Reilly]%20-%20Programming%20Python,%204th%20ed.%20-%20[Lutz].pdf" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">But before that, please read any introduction to Python; significant indentation is literally the first thing to know about the language.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">All experienced programmers, in any language, indent their conditional blocks of code.  That is, the code which is executed when an <code>if</code> is true, and after an <code>else</code> is executed.  The message says that python expects an indented block, so why not try that and see what happens?</span>
