<p>Hey I have some code in C but at the same time I need that bit of code in python,
is there a way i can convert <code>for(i = 0; i &lt; MAXFDS; i++)</code> to python i'v tried <code>for i in range(i = 0, MAXFDS = i++)</code> but that will not work please help.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Have you tried this?
<code>for i in range(0, MAXDFS)</code></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I would do :</p>
<pre><code>for i in xrange(MAXFDS):
    pass
</code></pre>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p>for python 3</p>
<pre><code>for i in range(MAXFDS):
    pass
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Nopes, SO is no code conversion site.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">^ i was hoping someone who knew more about python then me could help not use a site lol, sites are over rated and not accurate</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Please read <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/how-to-ask">How to Ask</a> page first. Also, try to re-word your question.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why not read the python.org docs? Here is a good start: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">This worked thanks but instead of for (i in range(0, MAXDFS)) i did for (i in range(0, MAXDFS)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yea, edited... <code>(</code> is kinda muscle memory after a <code>for</code> :P. Please consider accepting an answer if it helped.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm going to make this the right answer in a bit it says i need to wait 10 mins :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Only in Python 2.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That works in python 2</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That's my point.  It works only in Python 2, not in Python 3.</span>
