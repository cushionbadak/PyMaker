<p>I have code that finds the input name in a CSV if it is present it says yes else no. But I entered a name present in the CSV yet it still says no.</p>
<p>Here is the code:</p>
<pre><code>import csv

f=open("student.csv","r")
reader=csv.reader(f)
for row in reader:
    print
studentToFind = raw_input("Enter the name of sudent?")
if studentToFind in reader:
        print('yes')
else:
    print('no')
f.close()
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Simply ask the question before you loop over the file:</p>
<pre><code>import csv

studentToFind = raw_input("Enter the name of student?")

f=open("student.csv","r")
reader=csv.reader(f)
found = "No"
for row in reader:
    if studentToFind in row:
        found = "Yes"

f.close()

print('{}'.format(found))
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You've got a couple of issues:</p>
<p>First <code>reader</code> is empty at this point, since you've already looped over its elements. Reading from a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-file-object" rel="nofollow noreferrer">file</a> is a one-time deal, if you want to access its contents more than once you need to write it to a data structure, e.g.:</p>
<pre><code>rows = []
with open("student.csv", newline='') as csvfile:
  reader = csv.reader(csvfile)
  for row in reader:
    rows.append(row)
</code></pre>
<p>However this also won't be sufficient, because <code>rows</code> is now a 2D list, as each <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/csv.html#csv.reader" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>row</code> the reader returns</a> is itself a list. An <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/11963711/113632">easy way to search for a value in nested lists</a> is with list comprehensions:</p>
<pre><code>if studentToFind in [cell for row in rows for cell in row]:
  print('yes')
else:
  print('no')
</code></pre>
<hr/>
<p>Put it together, so the indentation's easier to see:</p>
<pre><code>rows = []
with open("student.csv", newline='') as csvfile:
  reader = csv.reader(csvfile)
  for row in reader:
    rows.append(row)

if studentToFind in [cell for row in rows for cell in row]:
  print('yes')
else:
  print('no')
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You've already iterated over the file once. When you try to loop over <code>reader</code> again there is nothing to loop over.</p>
<p>Instead don't even use the <code>csv</code> module and save the lines in the file into a list:</p>
<pre><code>with open("student.csv","r") as f:
    lines = []
    for line in f:
        lines.append(line.rstrip())

studentToFind = raw_input("Enter the name of student?")
if studentToFind in lines:
    print('yes')
else:
    print('no')
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">That works, +1.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">it works if i enter the name that is not present "NO". But when i enter the name that is present in the csv then output is both "Yes" "NO"</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ah yes good observation, fixed it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It workeddd.........................</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It gives output 4 times'</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Notice the <code>if</code> statement is not inside the <code>with</code> statement. You read the file, close it, <i>then</i> search <code>rows</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">break is working but it is also printing NO after yes when the entered name is found</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yep, my first comment was wrong; you should not be calling the <code>if</code> statement inside the loop. See my edit.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This worked too........ Thanks</span>
<span class="comment-copy">still "no"  is an answer ..</span>
