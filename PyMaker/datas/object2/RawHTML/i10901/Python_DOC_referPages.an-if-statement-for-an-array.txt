<p>How do I make a two dimensional array an if statement.</p>
<pre><code>for row in range(6):
    for column in range(7):
        if board[row][column] &gt; 0:
            Draw = True
</code></pre>
<p>I have a grid of blank squares, 7 by 6, and if a square is clicked its given a value of 1 and if not it stays 0. When all the squares have been clicked making the now 1 I want Draw = True, but this statement above finds the row and column I've just chosen rather then the entire grid.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you mean check the whole board if all are 1's, then its a simple fix.</p>
<pre><code>DRAW = True

for row in range(6):
    for column in range(7):
        if board[row][column] == 0:
            DRAW = False
</code></pre>
<p>Going about it the other way is easier.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>What you want is only when all <code>board</code> values are 1, the <code>Draw</code> is set to True. You code will set <code>Draw</code> to 1 if there is ANY grid clicked.</p>
<p>The solution is simple, you can think reversely, preset the <code>Draw</code> to True and whenever the grid is not 1, set it to False.</p>
<pre><code>Draw = True
for row in range(6):
    for column in range(7):
        if board[row][column] == 0:
            Draw = False
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use <code>all</code> as another way to @Wboy's forloop:</p>
<pre><code>all(x for y in z for x in y)

#or x !=0 but that's redundant here since 1 equates to True.
</code></pre>
<p>Here, z would be your two dimensional list. You can evaluate uneven dimensions this way as well without getting "bogged" down in ranges etc.</p>
<p><strong>Caveat</strong>: If you had an empty list in your grid, then <code>all</code> here would still evaluate to true. </p>
<p>Example grid for caveat:</p>
<pre><code>[[],
 [1, 1, 1],
 [1, 1], #some more rand elements of the grid, first one's the point.
]
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you need to check that all values in a collection have a value that is <code>True</code> you could always use the built in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#all" rel="nofollow"><code>all()</code></a> function which checks that all values in an iterable satisfy a given condition (which, in your case is <code>i &gt; 0</code>):</p>
<pre><code>if all(i &gt; 0 for i in board[row] for row in range(6)):
    Draw = True
</code></pre>
<p>Which can get simplified to:</p>
<pre><code>if all(i for i in board[row] for row in range(6)): 
    Draw = True
</code></pre>
<p>Since positive values evaluate to <code>True</code>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Need more clarification. Do you mean when the whole board is "1" then set draw = True?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">yeah thats what I mean, sorry</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ah yes, much nicer way to do it :)</span>
