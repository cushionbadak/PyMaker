<p>I'm using python 3.5.1 and I've had this problem with a few scripts. When I have multiple <code>input()</code> lines in a row, the ipython window will skip lines in between them. Here's my code:</p>
<pre><code>def DMScalc(D, M, S):
    if D &lt; 0.:
        DD = D + M*(-1)/60 + S*(-1)/3600
    else:
        DD = D + M/60 + S/3600
    return DD

print("\nConvert Degrees-Minutes-Seconds to Decimal Degrees")
D = float(input("Degrees: "))
M = float(input("Minutes: "))
S = float(input("Seconds: "))
print('Decimal Degrees:', end=' ')
print(DMScalc(D, M, S))
</code></pre>
<p>The ipython window shows the following:</p>
<pre><code>Convert Degrees-Minutes-Seconds to Decimal Degrees

Degrees: 33

Minutes: 29

Seconds: 38
Decimal Degrees: 33.49388888888889
</code></pre>
<p>I'd like to remove the skipped lines above Degrees, Minutes, and Seconds so the end result is this:</p>
<pre><code>Convert Degrees-Minutes-Seconds to Decimal Degrees
Degrees: 33
Minutes: 29
Seconds: 38
Decimal Degrees: 33.49388888888889
</code></pre>
<p>I checked the documentation for <code>input()</code> and it only talks about a <em>trailing</em> newline, which I don't think is the problem here.</p>

<p>With the <code>input()</code> function alone you can't.</p>
<p>Try the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html" rel="nofollow">Curses</a> library so you can take more control of terminal behaviour, because <code>input()</code> will always give you a new line.</p>

<p>Carlos Cordoba, a Spyder developer, says this is a bug in their IPython console, see here:</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Cannot reproduce with python 3.5.1 on windows. I tried <code>python script.py</code> and <code>ipython script.py</code>. None added additional newlines. How did you start your script?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I can't duplicate the problem in python 3.4.3</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Wombatz I edited the post to include my entire script. Also, I'm using Spyder IDE if that makes a difference.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I can't reproduce using python 3.5.1 and ipython 5 on Arch Linux. It's probably Spyder IDE</span>
<span class="comment-copy">cannot reproduce in python 2.7 using raw_input either</span>
<span class="comment-copy">How does this answer the OPs question?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The issue is that the new line that appears in not Python's issue. It is the terminal emulator that inserts it when he presses enter anter inserting some input.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm not sure how curses is really going to help within IPython and Spyder.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hm yes your'e right, it's useless in IPython's console. I'm sorry.</span>
