<p>I am following Python tutorials (<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>) on <strong>files</strong>.</p>
<p>I have a simple text file, containing 3 lines. According to the tutorial page, putting this simple snippet in a file and executing the script should display the contents, but it does not.</p>
<pre><code>f = open('myFile.txt', 'r')
f.read()
f.readline()
f.close()
</code></pre>
<p>What am I missing or doing wrong?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Here is a simple example:</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>fp = open(r"d:\test.txt")
print ( fp.read() )
fp.close()
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">How would you see its content without <code>print f.readline()</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">you haven't printed the output.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks guys. got it!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The tutorial is to blame. It uses Python's Immediate Mode, where the result of every command is printed immediately - but does not mention that.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yeah, after a while I realized there was never any printing commands! But I am improving now. Thanks for your comment.</span>
