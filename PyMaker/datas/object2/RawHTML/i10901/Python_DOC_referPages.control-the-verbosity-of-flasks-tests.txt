<p>I'm running tests for my Flask app from Bash using <code>python manage.py test</code>. In addition to failures and errors, the console prints out</p>
<pre><code>    test_name (test_file.TestClass) ... ok
</code></pre>
<p>for every single test. That's super annoying when you have a lot of tests. How can I control the verbosity of the printout?</p>

<p>@jonrsharpe was right. I didn't realize that the project was using Flask-Script, which I guess is the reason for the manage.py file. Flask-Script calls unittest with a default verbosity. I reduced the default verbosity and that culled the extra output. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">It's standard <code>unittest</code>, I think, so you can only turn <i>up</i> the verbosity: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#cmdoption-unittest-discover-v" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/â€¦</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">There's something going on in manage.py that keeps normal methods from working. Running <code>python manage.py test -v</code> gives "manage.py: error: too many arguments"</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Wait, <i>Flask</i> <code>manage.py</code>? I was thinking Django. Are you using some plugin, I don't think that's standard.</span>
