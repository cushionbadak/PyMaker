<p>Shouldn't we keep code as simple and easy to understand as possible? What are the advantages of binary over floats and integers in python and is it possible to create floats with binary. Also, when would you use it?</p>

<p>Why does Python have binary <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#integer-literals" rel="nofollow noreferrer">integer literals</a>?</p>

<p>e.g. allowing  <code>0b1010</code> as well as <code>10</code>, then the answer is that sometimes that <em>is</em> the most <em>"simple and easy to understand"</em> approach to writing code. </p>
<p>For example, the number I use above could be a bitmask, indicating the combination of the second and fourth options. Which is clearer:</p>
<pre><code>a = 0b0001
b = 0b0010
c = 0b0100
d = 0b1000

x = 0b1010
</code></pre>
<p>or:</p>
<pre><code>a = 1
b = 2
c = 4
d = 8

x = 10
</code></pre>
<p><em>(In practice you'd just use <code>x = a | c</code> and e.g. <a href="https://hg.python.org/cpython/file/tip/Lib/sre_constants.py#l164" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>re</code></a> actually uses decimal literals for the flags, but I needed an example and note that the bitwise operations on integers are also easier to understand in binary notation.)</em></p>

<span class="comment-copy">...what? Could you provide examples of what you mean? Do you mean <i>"binary <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#integer-literals" rel="nofollow noreferrer">integer literals</a>"</i>, like <code>0b1010</code>?</span>

<span class="comment-copy">Bitmasks &amp; their manipulations can be a lot clearer in binary notation than in integer or floating point notation.</span>
