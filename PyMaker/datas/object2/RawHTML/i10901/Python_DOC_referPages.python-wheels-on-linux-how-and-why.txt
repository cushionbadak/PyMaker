<p>I know that wheels are binary version of a module uploaded on PyPI.</p>
<p>with <code>pip install</code></p>
<ul>
<li>On Windows: I get wheels downloaded and installed.</li>
<li>On Ubuntu: I should get the source distribution of the package <strong>BUT</strong> in <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyQt5/5.6" rel="noreferrer">some cases</a> I get wheels.</li>
<li>On fedora: <em>Tricky</em> I have to install with dnf</li>
</ul>
<p>I tried to add <strong>wheels</strong> to <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ModernGL" rel="noreferrer">my package</a> as well. But I am only able to upload wheels for windows.</p>
<ul>
<li>Why do some packages provide wheels for Linux platform?</li>
<li>Is this okay? Providing binaries instead of the source?</li>
<li>Why I cannot provide wheels?</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: I know a bit about Fedora rpm packages. I am interested now in wheels on Ubuntu.</p>

<p>Why shouldn't they, as long as source distributions are available as well? :)</p>
<p>Your question is not clear. If you meant</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why do some packages provide platform-specific wheels for Linux platform instead of platfom-independent ones?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>then take a look at <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31573107/how-to-create-a-pure-python-wheel">this question</a> and its answers. If not, please clarify your question.</p>

<p>Try using:</p>
<pre><code>pip install --no-binary :all: somepackage
</code></pre>
<p>This should make <code>pip</code> download a source distribution if it exists on PyPI. I don't know why there are no source packages for PyQt5 on PyPI, probably because they are not installable with <code>pip</code> and need a whole toolchaing for compilation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is this okay? Providing binaries instead of the source?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's okay as long as you provide both binaries and the source. I suggest you doing so.</p>
<hr/>
<blockquote>
<p>Why I cannot provide wheels?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Try <code>python setup.py bdist_wheel</code>. You need to install <code>wheel</code> package (on <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/wheel" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PyPI</a>) to make it work. If your package supports both Python 2 and 3 and contains no C extensions, append the <code>--universal</code> option to make a "<a href="https://packaging.python.org/distributing/#universal-wheels" rel="nofollow noreferrer">universal wheel</a>".</p>
<p>Replace <code>bdist_wheel</code> with <code>sdist</code> to make a source distribution. It will create an archive in <code>dist</code> directory.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>sdist</strong> creates the archive of the default format for the current platform. The default format is a gzipâ€™ed tar file (<code>.tar.gz</code>) on Unix, and ZIP file on Windows.</p>
<p>You can specify as many formats as you like using the <code>--formats</code> option, for example:</p>
<pre><code>python setup.py sdist --formats=gztar,zip
</code></pre>
<p>to create a gzipped tarball and a zip file</p>
