<p>I have some code to set up a log in Python 2.7 (using the logging module): </p>
<pre><code>import os
import logging
logger=logging.getLogger('CopasiTools')
logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
log_filename=os.path.join(os.path.dirname(copasi_file),os.path.split(copasi_file)[1][:-4]+'_log.log')
handler=logging.FileHandler(log_filename,mode='w')
formatter = logging.Formatter("%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s")
handler.setFormatter(formatter)
logger.addHandler(handler)
logger.debug('debugging message')
</code></pre>
<p>This code works and I am getting the output, however I intend to use this log to do a lot of debugging so I want to overwrite the log file each time its run. In the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.handlers.html" rel="nofollow">docs</a> say to use the <code>mode</code> keyword argument to the 'FileHandler<code>. It doesn't specify precisely *which* mode to use for overwrite file each time but I think a reasonable assumption would be</code>mode='w'`. This however doesn't work. Can anybody tell me why? </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The problem is that the file doesn't actually get overwritten until a new python shell is started. </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This solves problem for me:</p>
<pre><code>handler = logging.FileHandler(log_filename, 'w+')
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I am not familiar with this to much, and I did not really see anything that stuck out in google. Have you tried just using:</p>
<pre><code>    handler=logging.FileHandler(log_filename, 'w')
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">I can't reproduce the behavior. I used the code you provided and just changed the file name, the log is overwritten every time I run the code. If I change <code>mode</code> to <code>a</code> then new run adds line to end,</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is strange and may be related to a previous <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/38396050/why-does-this-code-for-creating-a-python-log-not-work?noredirect=1#comment64203174_38396050">question</a> I had. Do you know if it possible to permanently override the logging modules basic behaviour?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I don't know a way to do it but it doesn't mean it's impossible,</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, but this behaves the same way.</span>
