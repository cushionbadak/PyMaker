<p>I have a dictionary : </p>
<pre><code>diff_params = {0: [a, b], 
               1: [c, d]}
</code></pre>
<p>Each key is a setting_name, and each value is a specific setting. I would like to be able to make a list like:</p>
<pre><code>[[a, c], 
 [a, d],
 [b, c],
 [b, d]] 
</code></pre>
<p>I can't figure out how to do cleanly when I have 3 or 4 or 5 settings and each setting has several options.</p>

<p>It seems that you are more specifically looking for <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.product" rel="nofollow"><code>itertools.product()</code></a> which can be used like this with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#unpacking-argument-lists" rel="nofollow">unpacking</a>:</p>
<pre><code>from itertools import product

result = product(*diff_params.values())
</code></pre>
<p>You may need to cast the result if you really want a list of list (surrounding <code>list</code> is useless if you are using Python 2 because <code>map()</code> return a list):</p>
<pre><code>result = list(map(list, result))
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">what are those colons for? are these strings? edit <code>[0 : a, 1: c]</code> doesn't make sense in python</span>
<span class="comment-copy">My mistake, they weren't supposed to be there.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is it, thank you.</span>
