<p>I have the below code snippet and the function <code>chdir</code> doesn't seem to work.. </p>
<pre><code>cwd_path = os.getcwd()
print("CWD: " + cwd_path)
changed = os.chdir(r"C:/CISCO/PYTHON/My_Learning/prank")
print(changed)
</code></pre>
<p>The below is the output:</p>
<pre><code>CWD C:\CISCO\PYTHON\My_Learning
None

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>As you can read <a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/os_chdir.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a> os.chdir returns None in all the cases.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>os.chdir</code> returns <code>None</code>. </p>
<p>In that case, you should set <code>changed</code> as a flag that checks if the current directory is the same as the last one:</p>
<pre><code>cwd_path = os.getcwd()
os.chdir(r"C:/CISCO/PYTHON/My_Learning/prank")
changed = (cwd_path != os.getcwd())
print(changed)
# True
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>os.chdir</code> doesn't return anything back to you. When you want to see what directory you are in you want <code>os.getcwd</code>. E.g.</p>
<pre><code>print(os.getcwd())
os.chdir('/')
print(os.getcwd())
</code></pre>
<p>Outputs something like;</p>
<pre>
/my/home
/
</pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>os.chdir does not have a output, you have to make a os.chdir() then make:</p>
<pre><code>    changed = os.getcwd()
</code></pre>
<p>that way you get the new directory</p>

<span class="comment-copy">As far as i'm aware os.chdir doesn't have an output, hence the none. So it' will have changed directory it just doesn't print anything. if you try another os.getcwd() after you've changed directory that should do it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why do you conclude that hasn't worked? It isn't documented to return anything, what were you expecting to get back?</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.chdir" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>os.chdir</code></a> does not return anything.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@FullName: Of course <code>os.chdir</code> returns something. It returns <code>None</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I was just in the mood of being pedantic. ;-)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Posting a link is not an answer.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@FullName That's not <i>just</i> a link. It's the answer (<code>os.chdir</code> returns <code>None</code> in all cases) with a link as a reference. However it surely isn't a very good answer since 1) lacks proper formatting 2) Links to external sources instead of the official python documentation 3) Uses <i>here</i> as a link anchor. In any case <i>it is an answer</i>.</span>
