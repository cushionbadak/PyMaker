<p>I'm writing a program in python and I am having issues getting idle to read my file out. If I use improper syntax it tells me, so it is being read by the compiler but not printing it for the user. Any help would be appreciated. Here is my code.</p>
<pre><code>#! python3.5.2

import sys

if input() == ('im bored'):
    print('What season is it?')
    if input() == ('summer'):
       f = open('callfilesummer.txt', 'r')
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You only put file into variable 'f', so you need to read it or work it with someway to show it.</p>
<pre><code>import sys

if input() == ('im bored'):
    print('What season is it?')
    if input() == ('summer'):
       f = open('callfilesummer.txt', 'r')
       print f.read()
       f.close()
</code></pre>

<p>This doesn't do anything. Maybe take a look at the Python documentation? <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html" rel="nofollow">https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html</a></p>
<p>That's a start.</p>
<p>If you want to display the file, you can <em>very</em> easily iterate over a file in Python like this:</p>
<pre><code>f = open('hurdurr', 'r')
for line in f:
    print line
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">You aren't actually reading the file. Or printing it for that matter.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You're opening a file, that's all. It doesn't produce any output. What's more, Python is an <i>interpreted</i> language, it doesn't need a compiler.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Here</a> is the Python documentation for input and output. Use one of the methods there to read your file, then print it out.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">i tried f.read() and it did not recognize</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ForceBru That is incorrect; the default implementation, CPython, compiles Python code to bytecode, which is then run in a VM. (horribly off-topic, I know)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">okay, i didnt understand print could used in another way than print('this'). It is just telling it what needs to happen rather than a specific function. Thank you</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You need to understand fact you have opended file in variable "f", so all operation go to that. Function read() does is read the file from begining to end in variable "f", which you also immediately print.  You could also store content of the file in other variable like <code>content = f.read()</code> and then <code>print content</code></span>
