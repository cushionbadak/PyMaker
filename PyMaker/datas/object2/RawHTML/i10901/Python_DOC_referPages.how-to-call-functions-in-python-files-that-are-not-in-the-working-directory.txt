<p>Say now my working folder is <code>.</code> and my supporting python files are in <code>./supporting_files/</code>, I want to call a function <code>func</code> in the <code>a.py</code> file under <code>./supporting_files/</code>, what should I do? I tried calling <code>from supporting_files.a import func</code> and that does not work. How am I suppose to do that without changing the actual working directory?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Add an <code>__init__.py</code> file (it can be empty) to the <code>supporting_files</code> directory, and python will treat it as a package available for imports. More details are available in the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#packages" rel="nofollow">Python documentation</a>.</p>

<p>There are two ways you can do that I'm aware of.</p>
<h1>Wrong way</h1>
<pre><code>import sys
sys.path.append('./supporting_files')    
from a import func
func()
</code></pre>
<h1>Right way</h1>
<pre><code>$ touch supporting_files/__init__.py
</code></pre>
<p>Then</p>
<pre><code>import supporting_files.a as a

a.func()
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Do you have the <code>__init__.py</code> in <code>supporting_files</code> directory? What's your python version?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No I don't have one. It's python 2.7</span>
<span class="comment-copy">works for me, cannot reproduce. edit: works in python3 but not in 2.7</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You need to put an empty <code>__init__.py</code> in your directory in order to be interpreted as a module, by python.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">What do you mean by this is a wrong way?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I mean it works, but works in kind of the same way that a Rube Goldberg machine works. It's fine for entertainment/education but you wouldn't ever want to drive your space program that way.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks I think I got it</span>
