<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have a series of variable lists inside a list, and I'm comparing it to another list.  I want, run through each list in aList, analyze each number and as soon its a match in bList, append that number to finalList.  I want to return the first match in other words and ignore future matches.  For Example:</p>
<pre><code>aList = [[0,1],[8,9,4,5],[7,6,3,2]]
bList = [0,5,1,4]
finalList = [0,4]
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Use a for loop with a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#break-and-continue-statements-and-else-clauses-on-loops" rel="nofollow"><code>break</code></a>.</p>
<pre><code>finalList = []

for sl in aList:
    for item in sl:
        if item in bList:
            finalList.append(item)
            break
</code></pre>
<p>To iterate with a single for loop you could use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/itertools.html#itertools.chain.from_iterable" rel="nofollow"><code>itertools</code> module</a></p>

<span class="comment-copy">I would generally recommend using <code>set(bList)</code>...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ReutSharabani smells like premature optimization to me :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Smells like the right data structure to me, but yeah if it's some one-off it doesn't matter.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ReutSharabani Also, if you were going to do that, you would want to create the set variable outside of the loop (since set creation is O(N)).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That's what I was aiming at, I just put the idea out there for you to add it if you want. Had it been that important I'd add my own answer.</span>
