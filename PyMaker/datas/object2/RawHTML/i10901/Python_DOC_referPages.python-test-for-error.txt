<p>In my program, It sometimes encounters an error. The only way to stop the error, is to restart the program.</p>
<p>So how could I get python to know when there is an error?</p>
<p>Example - If there is an error, close down the program.</p>
<p>How do I do this - Thanks!</p>

<p>That is called <strong>exception handling</strong>. You should <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#handling-exceptions" rel="nofollow">read</a> about it.</p>
<p>The basic syntax is the following:</p>
<pre><code>try:
    code that might give an error (aka exception)
except TheExceptionExpected:
    thing to do if error happends
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">There is a construct called <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>try/except</code></a> in python...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ok, thanks I'll look it up! I wasn't sure if there was a programming term for it :D</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You can call <code>import sys; sys.exit()</code> when there is a specific exception</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, that is what I was going to do, but I didn't know how to do the <code>if error</code> part. thanks- I've got it now :D</span>
<span class="comment-copy">How are there 'too many answers', there is only 1 answer for this question?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">How do I except ANY Error: for example</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>try</code> (code)  - then <code>except (any error)</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">To except ANY error just use the widest exception whitch is "Exception" (upper case first letter). It is generaly not recommanded to do that because it is much harder to debug rather than using just the specific exceptions you know could happend.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ok, thanks. I'll use it :D</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Consider accepting the answer if you find it satisfactory ;)</span>
