<p>I am a beginner working on Django Project.
Settings.py file of a Django project contains these two lines:</p>
<pre><code>BASE_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)))
PROJECT_ROOT = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
</code></pre>
<p>I want to know the difference as I think both are pointing to the same directory. Also it would be great help if you could provide some links os.path functions.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>BASE_DIR</code> is pointing to the <em>parent</em> directory of <code>PROJECT_ROOT</code>. You can re-write the two definitions as:</p>
<pre><code>PROJECT_ROOT = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
BASE_DIR = os.path.dirname(PROJECT_ROOT)
</code></pre>
<p>because the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html#os.path.dirname" rel="noreferrer"><code>os.path.dirname()</code> function</a> simply removes the last segment of a path.</p>
<p>In the above, the <code>__file__</code> name points to the filename of the current module, see the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html?highlight=__file__" rel="noreferrer">Python datamodel</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>__file__</code> is the pathname of the file from which the module was loaded, if it was loaded from a file.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, it can be a <em>relative</em> path, so the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html#os.path.abspath" rel="noreferrer"><code>os.path.abspath()</code> function</a> is used to turn that into an absolute path before removing just the filename and storing the full path to the directory the module lives in in <code>PROJECT_ROOT</code>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Did you try them both and compare?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No, they are not pointing at the same directory.</span>
