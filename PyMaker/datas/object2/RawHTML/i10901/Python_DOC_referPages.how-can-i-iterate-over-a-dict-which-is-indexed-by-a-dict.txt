<p>If I have an iteration like:</p>
<pre><code>for index in my_dict:
   print index.keys()
</code></pre>
<p>Is <code>index</code> possible to be a dictionary in this case? If possible, could you please give me an example of what <code>my_dict</code> will look like?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>index</code> cannot be a <code>dict</code> as dictionary keys must be <em>hashable</em> types. Since dictionaries are themselves not <em>hashable</em>, they can not serve as keys to another dictionary.</p>
<pre><code>for index in my_dict
</code></pre>
<p>iterates over the dictionary keys and will yield the same result as </p>
<pre><code>for index in my_dict.keys()
</code></pre>
<p>You can however have a dictionary nested as a value of another dictionary:</p>
<pre><code>{'parent': {'nested': 'some value'}}
#          ^   nested dictionary  ^
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Dictionaries are an unhashable type in Python so another dictionary cannot be used for as a key (or index) to a parent dictionary but it can be used as a value. </p>
<p>That dictionary would look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>my_dict = {'example': {'key': 0}}
</code></pre>
<p>And if you wanted to loop over it and select the dictionaries rather than the keys the code would look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>for key in my_dict:
    print(my_dict[key].keys())
</code></pre>
<p>Which if you've been following along with the example should just output <code>['key']</code>.</p>
<p>It wasn't part of your question but I'd recommend using a tuple for the kind of data storage and access you want, and if you'd like I can show you how to do that as well.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Are you asking, is it possible to have nested dictionaries? If so, yes</span>
<span class="comment-copy">But the nested dictionaries will be <i>values</i>, and you're iterating over the <i>keys</i> (which <b>cannot</b> be dictionaries). As written, that code will not work.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Per document: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries</a> keys of dictionary need to be immutable type, so answer is no, 'index' in this case can not be a dict</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That is the answer I want to confirm. Many thanks.</span>
