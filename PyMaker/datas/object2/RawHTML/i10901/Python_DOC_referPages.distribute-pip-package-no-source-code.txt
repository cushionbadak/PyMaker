<p>I have an "homemade" python package which i can successfully install via pip package manager.</p>
<p>I'd like ti distribute it without giving the source code (*.py files)... i tried to compile them with</p>
<p><code>python -m compileall .</code></p>
<p>and then installed by typing <code>pip install .</code></p>
<p>However it can't find the module when i try to import it in my application.</p>
<p><code>ImportError: No module named...</code></p>
<p>What do you suggest to solve?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>I guess it is to do with setuptools not packaging up <code>*.pyc</code> files, because normally you don't want them.</p>
<p>You should create a file <code>MANIFEST.in</code> with the content</p>
<pre><code>global-include *.py[co]
global-exclude *.py
</code></pre>
<p>This tells setuptools to exclude <code>*.py</code> source files and include <code>*.pyc</code> compiled files.</p>
<p>Afterwards create a source distribution package</p>
<pre><code>python setup.py sdist
</code></pre>
<p>or a wheel</p>
<pre><code>python setup.py bdist_wheel
</code></pre>
<p>which also compiles C extensions.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, something is moving on, but now i don't know how install the compressed file with *.py[co] files.  I have dist/package.tar.gz file but it hasn't setup.py file inside (i think according to manifest.in file)   How should i proceed?</span>

<span class="comment-copy">MANIFEST.in does not affect what goes into the wheel.</span>
