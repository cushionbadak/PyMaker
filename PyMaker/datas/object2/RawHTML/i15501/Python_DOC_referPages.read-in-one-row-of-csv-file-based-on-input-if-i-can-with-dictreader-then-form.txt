<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I'm trying to read in a csv file with many rows and columns; i would like to print one row, in a particular format, to a text file, and do some hashing on the values. SO far, i have been able to read in the file, parse thru it using DictReader, find the row i want using an IF statement and then print the keys and values. I cannot figure out how to format it to the format i want in the end ( Key = Value \n), and i cannot figure how to write to a file (much less in the format i want) using the value of 'row' obtained below. I've been trying for days and make a little progress but cannot get it to work. Here is what i got to work (with much detail left out of results):</p>
<hr/>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt;import csv

with open("C:\path_to_script\filename_Brief.csv") as infh:
    reader = csv.DictReader(infh)
    for row in reader:
        if row['ALIAS'] == 'Y4K':
            print(row)
</code></pre>
<h1>result-output</h1>
<p>{'Full_Name': 'Jack Flash', 'PHONE_NO': '555 555-1212', 'ALIAS': 'Y4K'}</p>
<hr/>
<p>I'd like to ask the user to input the Alias and then use that to determine row to print. I've done a ton of research but am new-ish to Python so am asking for help! i've used pyexcel, xlrd/xlwt, even thought I'd try pandas but too much to learn. I also got it to format the way i wanted in one test but then could not get the row selection to work--in other words, it prints all the records rather than the row i want. Have 30 Firefox tabs open trying to find an answer! Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>The following may at least be close to what you want (I think):</p>
<pre><code>import csv

with open(r'C:\path_to_script\filename_Brief.csv') as infh, \
     open('new_file.txt', 'wt') as outfh:
    reader = csv.DictReader(infh)
    for row in reader:
        if row['ALIAS'] == 'Y4K':
             outfh.write('Full_Name = {Full_Name}\n'
                         'PHONE_NO = {PHONE_NO}\n'
                         'ALIAS = {ALIAS}\n'.format(**row))
</code></pre>
<p>This would write 3 lines formatted like this into the output file for every matching<code>row</code>:</p>
<pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"><code>Full_Name = Jack Flash 
PHONE_NO = 555 555-1212
ALIAS = Y4K            
</code></pre>
<p>BTW, the <code>**row</code>notation means basically "take all the entries in the specified dictionary and turn them into keyword arguments for this function call". The <code>{keyword}</code> syntax in the format string refers to any keyword arguments that will be passed to the <code>str.format()</code> method.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">my tabs/indents are all off. I do have them correct in IDLE.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">How, exactly, do you want the row shown formatted in the output file?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">For example: Full Name = Jack Flash</span>
<span class="comment-copy">i am liking this! i  want it to be Full_Name = Jack Flash \n PHONE_NO = 555-555-1212, etc. all on their own lines. I will look up that format--i don't understand (**row)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">it worked perfectly; now i just need to format and hash values. thank you!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That's good to hear. Please also read the answer to the question <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/help/someone-answers"><i>What should I do when someone answers my question?</i></a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thank you for the explanation too. That explains why i kept getting  not defined errors when i just tried to write it using (key, record[key]). and various other ways i tried.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">To do it that way you would have needed something like <code>'Full_Name = {}\nPHONE_NO = {}\nALIAS = {}\n'.format(row['Full_Name'], row['PHONE_NO'], row['ALIAS']))</code> to accomplish the same thing. See the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#format-string-syntax" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><i>Format String Syntax</i></a> section in the online documentation. Also note the <code>r</code> prefix I added to your <code>'C:\path_to_script\filename_Brief.csv</code>' file path string because of the backslashes.</span>
