<p>I am learning python34 and I read here in my course book the following line:</p>
<p>"The comma separating the two print() commands in this file instructs Python to no start a new
line."</p>
<p>I am guessing by "no" they actually mean not?</p>
<p>Using the next script:</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python3 

print ("Hello from a Python file!"),
print ("Welcome to Python!")
</code></pre>
<p>And I have the following example of its execution on mac:</p>
<pre><code>$ python3 ~/Desktop/Python/Hello.py
Hello from a Python file! Welcome to Python!
</code></pre>
<p>But my windows8 gives me this output:</p>
<pre><code>c:\f&gt;a.py
Hello from a Python file!
Welcome to Python!
</code></pre>
<p>I am running the file via cmd without the Python command (as shown above), since it doesn't work otherwise...
I added manually the system Environment Variables path to Python default installation
folder (C:\Python34)</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The comma doesn't work in Python3, see <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.4/whatsnew/3.0.html#print-is-a-function" rel="nofollow">what's new in Python 3</a>. Also see the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print" rel="nofollow">docs for print function in Python 3</a>.</p>
<pre><code>Old: print x,           # Trailing comma suppresses newline
New: print(x, end=" ")  # Appends a space instead of a newline
</code></pre>
<p>Your example would be:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def test():
...   print("Hello from a Python file!", end=" ")
...   print("Welcome to Python!")
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; test()
Hello from a Python file! Welcome to Python!
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Output in Python3 </p>
<pre><code>Hello from a Python file!
Welcome to Python!
</code></pre>
<p>Output in Python2</p>
<pre><code>Hello from a Python file! Welcome to Python!
</code></pre>
<p>This is because the <code>comma</code> notation has been removed as <code>print</code> has been made a function in 3 whereas it was a keyword in 2. </p>
<p>You can achieve what you want by using</p>
<pre><code>print ("Hello from a Python file!",end = ' ')
print ("Welcome to Python!")
</code></pre>
<p>This making use of keyword arguments of the <code>print</code> function in python3</p>

<span class="comment-copy">What is the name of course book, The notation is for python 2 and not python3</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Python 2.x doesn't allow comma usage whereas Python 3.x allows both (comma and lines) to separate print out statements into each new line.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It is something internal nothing official but I believe it is based on the python documentation with changes though and it is updated when needed, so I am really not sure where it was taken from anymore.  @hagubear What do u mean python 2.x doesn't allot comma usage if it is a notation of python 2? I am puzzled...and I read it is suppoused to prevent a new line but u say it should cause a new line</span>
<span class="comment-copy">end = ',' doesn't give the same output as Python 2's print with comma at the end</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@miles82 Oh yeah, <code>end = ','</code> will print <code>Hello from a Python file!,Welcome to Python!</code></span>
