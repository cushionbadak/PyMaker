<p>This sounds so simple, but I cannot find anything on how to do this on the internet. I've gone through documentation but that didn't help me.</p>
<p>I have to get inputs from the user to create a list. This is what I am using right now.</p>
<pre><code>t = raw_input("Enter list items: ")
l = map(str,t.split())
</code></pre>
<p>But this is converting every element into  a string. If I use int in map function, then every element would be converted to int. </p>
<p>What should I do? Is there any other function that I am missing?</p>

<p>You can use a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions" rel="nofollow">list comprehension</a> to only call <code>int</code> on the strings which contain nothing but numerical characters (this is determined by <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.isdigit" rel="nofollow"><code>str.isdigit</code></a>):</p>
<pre><code>t = raw_input("Enter list items: ")
l = [int(x) if x.isdigit() else x for x in t.split()]
</code></pre>
<p>Demo:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; t = raw_input("Enter list items: ")
Enter list items: 1 hello 2 world
&gt;&gt;&gt; l = [int(x) if x.isdigit() else x for x in t.split()]
&gt;&gt;&gt; l
[1, 'hello', 2, 'world']
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>use try/except.  Try to make it an int.  If that fails, leave it as a string.</p>
<pre><code>def operation(str):
    try:
        val = int(str)
    except ValueError:
        val = str
    return val

t = raw_input("Enter list items: ")
l = map(operation,t.split())

print l
</code></pre>
<p>You can use a list comprehension rather than map for more "pythonic" code:</p>
<pre><code>t = raw_input("Enter list items: ")
l = [operation(x) for x in t.split()]
</code></pre>
<p>Edit:  I like iCodez's better... the isDigit test is nicer than try except.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Check to see if the item is suitable to be an <code>int</code> and convert it if it is, if not leave it. It isn't rocket science.</span>
