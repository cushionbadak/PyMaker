<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have a list of Farsi characters (utf8) like this:</p>
<pre><code>my_list = ['ﯾ', 'ﻲ', 'ﻴ']
</code></pre>
<p>And I would like to replace every occurrence of characters in this list in a text with another character like 'a'. Right now my code is like this:</p>
<pre><code>text = text.replace('ﻴ', 'a')
text = text.replace('ﻲ', 'a')
text = text.replace('ﯾ', 'a')
</code></pre>
<p>Is there any way to do this in one shot, for example using Regex and lists in Python 3?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>3&gt;&gt; 'ﻴ ﻲ ﯾ'.translate({0xfbfe: 'a', 0xfef2: 'a', 0xfef4: 'a'})
'a a a'
</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.translate" rel="noreferrer"><code>str.translate()</code></a></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You could use a for loop instead:</p>
<pre><code>for char in my_list:
    text = text.replace(char,'a')
</code></pre>
<p>This way your list could be an arbitrary length but the size of your code wont change. Plus you aren't repeating code.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">That's not UTF-8, at least not in Python 3.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">what is not utf-8?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Those strings .</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I think they are, but even if they are not, do you know how to do what I want?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You are showing a <i>gylph</i> (a visual representation of a character). UTF-8 is an encoding (it translates "numbers" (called code points) to letters). So what you have is a string, not "utf-8".</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You are too quick.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">how did you get the codes like <code>0xfbfe</code>, etc?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Those are the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_point" rel="nofollow noreferrer">code points</a> of the characters.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, how can I get code points of characters in Python like what you got from my characters?</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>3&gt;&gt; hex(ord('.'))</code> <code>'0xXXXX'</code> Replace the "." with the actual character.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for the answer, but I do not want to use <code>for</code> loop. I know that in Python using <code>re</code> it is possible to do something like I want, but I don't know how to do it with UTF-8 characters like what I have.</span>
