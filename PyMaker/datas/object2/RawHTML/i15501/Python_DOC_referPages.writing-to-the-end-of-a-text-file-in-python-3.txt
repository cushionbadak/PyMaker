<p>I'm currently working on a bit of code that requires me to keep records of the outcome.
However, at the minute, the code I'm using only overwrites the document, rather than adding on.
What can I write to add something to the end of a text document?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>open the file in <code>append mode</code> </p>
<pre><code>open(filename, 'a')
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Just use append mode:</p>
<pre><code>with open('something.txt', 'a') as f:
    f.write('text to be appended')
</code></pre>
<p>Documentation <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open" rel="nofollow">can be found here</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Open your file with something like </p>
<pre><code>f = open('myfile.log', 'a')
</code></pre>
<p>you can also check <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/inputoutput.html" rel="nofollow">documentation</a> for more alternatives </p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Everyone is correct about using append mode for opening files that you want to add to, not overwrite. Here are some links that helped me learn a bit more about opening and editing files in python.</p>

<p>I am not sure if it's written in your code, but it is always a good idea to .close() the file when you are done writing to it. If it's not a terribly huge file it doesn't hurt to make sure what you appended is actually in the file. So it would be something like:</p>
<p><code>with open('file.txt', 'a') as f:
     f.write("Some string\n")</code></p>
<p><code>with open('file.txt', "r") as f:
     for line in f:
         if "Some string" in line:
             f.close()
             return True
 return False</code></p>
<p>There are more concise ways to write this, but I wanted to try and make it as accessible to everyone as I could. Also note checking for the string I am assuming that exact string does not repeat.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You should show us the code you uses to write in your file.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sorry about the original broadness, and I found an answer on the website too. Thanks for the help anyway.</span>
