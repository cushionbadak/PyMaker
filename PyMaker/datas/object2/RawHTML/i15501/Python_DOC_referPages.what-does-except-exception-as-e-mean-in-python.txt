<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The typical structure for exception handling is below:</p>
<pre><code>try:
    pass
except Exception, e:
    raise
else:
    pass
finally:
    pass
</code></pre>
<p>May I know what does <code>except Exception, e:</code>or<code>except Exception as e:</code> mean?
Typically I will use <code>print (e)</code> to print the error message but I am wondering what the programme has done to generate the e.</p>
<p>If I were to construct it in another way (below), how would it be like?</p>
<pre><code>except Exception:
    e = Exception.something
</code></pre>
<p>What should the method be to replace the <code>something</code>?</p>
<p>When the body of code under <code>try</code> gives no exception, the progeamme will execute the code under <code>else</code>. But, what does <code>finally</code> do here?</p>
<p>Thanks! :)</p>

<p><code>except Exception as e</code>, or <code>except Exception, e</code> (Python 2.x only) means that it catches exceptions of type <code>Exception</code>, and in the <code>except:</code> block, the exception that was raised (the actual object, not the exception class) is bound to the variable <code>e</code>.</p>
<p>As for <code>finally</code>, it's a block that <em>always</em> gets executed, regardless of what happens, after the <code>except</code> block (if an exception is raised) but always before anything else that would jump out of the scope is triggered (e.g. <code>return</code>, <code>continue</code> or <code>raise</code>).</p>

<span class="comment-copy">There sure are a lot of questions in the question.  I would recommend you read the documentation for <code>try</code>: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-try-statement" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/reference/â€¦</a>  That will answer most of them.</span>
