<p>How do I represent this structured English 'code' in Python code?</p>
<p>Structured English:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>FOR NoOfGamesPlayed &lt;-- 1 TO NoOfGamesInMatch Do</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I can do it in VB.NET:</p>
<pre><code>For NoOfGamesPlayed = 1 To NoOfGamesInMatch
</code></pre>
<p>I'm confused on how to do it in Python.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>for NoOfGamesPlayed in range(1, NoOfGamesInMatch+1):
    # do stuff
</code></pre>
<p>But note that Python uses 0-based indexing, not 1-based indexing.</p>
<p>So for a list of 5 elements, the valid indices are <code>[0]</code> through <code>[4]</code>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Did you read the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#for" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation</a> for <code>for</code>?  It has an example of what you are looking for.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I did, my silly problem was that I couldn't figure out what the structured English stuff meant. Thank you anyway :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you. The work we're given isn't meant to be used in Python really, which is why it gets confusing at times.</span>
