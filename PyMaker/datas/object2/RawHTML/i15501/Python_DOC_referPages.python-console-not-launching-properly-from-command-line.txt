<p>I seem to have problem launching python from command line. I tried various things with no success.
Problem: When trying to run <code>python</code> from the command line, there is no response i.e. I do not get message about 'command not found' and console does not launch. Only option to open python console is to run <code>C:\Python34\python.exe</code> directly. Running using <code>python</code> command does not work even when in the python directory but <code>python.exe</code> launches. Issue with the launching this way is that python console is launched in new window. This whole problem is present only on one machine while on my other machine I am able to run python correctly and console launches in the command prompt window from which the <code>python</code> command was executed. </p>
<p>PATH is correctly set to 
<code>C:\Python34\;C:\Python34\Scripts;...</code>
and <code>where python</code> correctly returns <code>C:\Python34\python.exe</code>. I verified that running other commands imported through PATH (such as <code>javac</code>) run correctly.</p>
<p>Things I tried:</p>
<ul>
<li>Completely re-installing python both with x86 and x64 python installations with no success.</li>
<li>Copy installation from my second machine and manually set the path variables - again no success.</li>
</ul>
<p>Can anyone hint how to resolve this behavior?</p>
<p>(Additional info: Win 8.1 x64, python 3.4.2)</p>

<p>Issue resolved. Since no feasible solution was found in 2 days, I decided to wipe all keys containing 'python' from registry as well as some files that were not parts of other programs. This resolved the issue after re-installing python.</p>
<p>If anyone finds the true cause of this misbehavior and other - less brutal - solution, please write it here for future reference.</p>

<p>Recent Python installer has option to add PATH.
If you didn't use it, you can register directory where python.exe is to PATH environment variable.</p>
<p>But I prefer <code>py</code> launcher. It may be installed via Python 3.3 or 3.4.
With it, you can start Python via <code>py</code> or <code>py -3.4</code>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Did you try setting the path to <code>C:\Python34</code> ? Notice the lack of the last backslash.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MikeDriscoll Interesting idea, but does not fix it. Notice that <code>where python</code> already finds correct path to the executable. My most logical theory is that python.exe actually launches when invoked with <code>python</code> command but immediately terminates without printing any error or other messages. When I try running pip using <code>pip</code> command from any location, it runs but in new window just like python when invoked using <code>C:\Python34\python.exe</code> command. Does python maybe have a log file somewhere?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The <code>C:\Python34</code> works for my on Windows 7. Have you tried both 32-bit and 64-bit Pythons to see if there's a difference?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">"Things I tried: Completely re-installing python both with x86 and x64 python installations with no success." as I state. Don't get me wrong, I have same setup on other machine (Win 8.1 x64, Python 3.4.2) where the <code>python</code> command launches the python console properly.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">In my question I mentioned that PATHs are set correctly. <code>py</code> command indeed launches python shell but also as new window and not  in the windows command line as on my other machine. I might not have explained myself properly in my question but I am looking for a way to fix discrepancy between behaviors on the two machines, not work-arounds.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Do you use normal cmd.exe?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, attempted both with and without administrator rights.</span>
