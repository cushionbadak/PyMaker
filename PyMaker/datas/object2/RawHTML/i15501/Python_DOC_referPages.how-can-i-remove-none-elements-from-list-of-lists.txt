<p>I have a list like this:</p>
<pre><code>a = [[None, None, None],
     [None, None, None],
     [40.069, 18.642, 1.0],
     [41.18, 19.467, 1.0],
     [None, None, None]]

<p>I want this to be like this. What is the best way to do this? Thanks </p>
<pre><code>b = [[40.069, 18.642, 1.0], [41.18, 19.467, 1.0]]
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use <code>filter</code>:</p>
<pre><code>filtered = list(filter(any, a))
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use this:</p>
<pre><code> b = [i for i in a if i.count(None) != len(i)]
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The following does exactly what you said you wanted (including keeping any sublist that wasn't all<code>None</code>, even though you didn't show one like that in your sample data):</p>
<pre><code>a = [[None, None, None],
     [None, None, None],
     [40.069, 18.642, 1.0],
     [41.18, 19.467, 1.0],
     [None, None, None],
     [42.13, None, 1.5]]  # added mixed case

b = []
for sublist in a:
    cleaned = [elem for elem in sublist if elem is not None]
    if len(cleaned):  # anything left?
        b.append(cleaned)

print(b)
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">

<p>It seems like your sub-lists will either be lists of <code>None</code> values or lists of float values.  This means that you can use a simple <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions" rel="nofollow">list comprehension</a> to filter list <code>a</code> by checking if the first item of each list is <code>None</code>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = [[None, None, None],
...      [None, None, None],
...      [40.069, 18.642, 1.0],
...      [41.18, 19.467, 1.0],
...      [None, None, None]]
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = [x for x in a if x[0] is not None]
&gt;&gt;&gt; b
[[40.069, 18.642, 1.0], [41.18, 19.467, 1.0]]
&gt;&gt;&gt;

<span class="comment-copy">To me, this is not clear. will you remove <code>[None, 1.0,None]</code>? As I think it would result in different answer.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This would exclude lists such as <code>[0.0, 0.0, 0.0]</code>, which should be kept.</span>
