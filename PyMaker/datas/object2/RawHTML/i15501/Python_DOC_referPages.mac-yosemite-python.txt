<p>I am usually an R user for all my statistical analysis work, but I wanted to learn Python. At the time I did not know that Python comes native to the Mac OS, so I went to python.org and installed Python 3.4.2 on my Mac. This created a Python folder in my Applications from where I can access IDLE. For my purposes specifically, I also needed a few libraries, namely Pandas and Numpy. After some research I learnt that the best way to do this was to get Anaconda. </p>
<p>Hence, I went ahead and installed Anaconda for Python 3.4 from their website. Now, the issue is, the Anaconda launcher came with its own IDE called Spyder and I found that this was much easier to use than IDLE, since it contained all the libraries I needed already. So this raised a couple of questions for me:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Do I still need the Python 3.4 I installed from python.org? If not, how can I remove this? I should mention that I'm not very familiar with how the Mac command line works, so if I could get instructions that have more detail, it would be easier for me</p></li>
<li><p>Do I have 2 installs of Python 3.4 on my Mac now or did the Anacondas one replace the one from python.org? If this is the case, can I just go ahead and delete the Python 3.4 folder in my Applications folder (which contains IDLE, etc.)?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>You now have three versions of Python on your Mac -- Anaconda will have installed itself into the directory <code>anaconda</code> in your home directory. You can remove the python.org install by following the instructions at: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/using/mac.html?highlight=uninstall" rel="nofollow">https://docs.python.org/3/using/mac.html?highlight=uninstall</a> -- you may need to use the command line and <code>rm</code> command to remove files (for example, the symlink in <code>/usr/local/bin/</code>). Don't do this unless you're sure of what you're doing because they don't go to the Trash.</p>
<p>Important note: <strong>do not</strong> delete or modify the system-provided Python in <code>/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework</code> and <code>/usr/bin/python</code> or you will hose your operating system and need to reinstall Yosemite.</p>
<p>If this all seems too scary, I would live with the bloat as long as anaconda is your default Python and you're happy with it.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Have you actually had any <i>problems</i>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No, i have not had any problems, but i just wanted to avoid the bloat of having three versions of python on there</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Okay i see. Thanks a lot for clarifying. I wanted to try and delete the python.org version. Could you just clarify something for me? I had initially started reading the instructions on how to remove it, but there are some things in this that i don't really know how to manipulate. Like i understand that i should bring up the terminal, and then change the version from 2.7 to whatever version is on here.</span>

Also the last instruction about removing the symbolic information i don't really understand. If you could explain that, it would be really helpful.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Type <code>ls /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/</code> and see which version you have installed. Replace 2.7 from your instructions with this version. The symbolic link is just an entry in the <code>/usr/bin</code> directory that points to the real executable file you'll have just deleted, so you want to get rid of that too, probably.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Okay got it done. thanks a lot. very much appreciated!</span>
