<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I need to do something like this:</p>
<pre><code>if A
 function(a)
elif B
 function(b)
else
 function(c)
</code></pre>
<p>I found here simpler version:</p>
<pre><code>function(a if A else c)
</code></pre>
<p>Is there version for <code>elif</code>? Something like:</p>
<pre><code>function(a if A b elif B else c)
</code></pre>
<p>How should I write this (if this exists)? The code above doesn't look right.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>No, no <code>elif</code>s. Just chain the <code>if</code>s:</p>
<pre><code>function(a if A else b if B else c)
</code></pre>
<p>Which is equivalent to (as <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#operator-precedence" rel="nofollow">precedence</a> is left to right):</p>
<pre><code>function(a if A else (b if B else c))
</code></pre>
<p>Obviously this could get complicated (and over the PEP8 80 char limit), E.G.:</p>
<pre><code>move(N if direction == "N" else E if direction == "E" else S if direction == "S" else W)
</code></pre>
<p>In which case the longer form is better:</p>
<pre><code>if direction == "N":
    move(N)
elif direction == "E":
    move(E)
elif direction == "S":
    move(S)
else:
    move(W)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Are you sure you need that? This is too abstract to tell, but I can see some pretty undecipherable one-liners coming out from here. Perhaps a dictionary?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">what are A and B ? values or expressions ? can you share the real code ? you need to call the same function with different parameters or different functions with same parameter ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Expressions. I'm calling function (method actually). With matsjoyce help my code looks like this: pytanie.add_pytanie_rodzaj('Białe' if licznik_wewnetrzny &lt; 10 else 'Czerwone' if licznik_wewnetrzny &lt; 18 else 'Musujące')</span>
<span class="comment-copy">About question title, I see that python version is not important, but I would google for answers with "if" or "elif" phrase, not "inline conditional".</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Oh... So elif is going back into else if. Looking at in now, I can't understand why I didn't figure it out, it's so nice and simple. I like python because of this. Thank you very much!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes. I think adding elif would have made the expression uglier, not nicer, so they left it out.</span>
