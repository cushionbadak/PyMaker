<p>I do not have trouble setting variables in the program with the <code>var = f.readline()</code> function, but I am having trouble with the <code>if</code> statement when it comes to reading out of a text file. I am trying to see if a 0 is in a text file and every time I use the <code>if f.readline() == '0':</code> it acts as if it does not equal 0.</p>
<p>Example of my script below:</p>
<pre><code>f = open("file.txt","r")

myvar = f.readline()
f.close



if myvar == "0":
    print "The variable is 0"
    raw_input("Press enter to continue")
else:
    print "The variable is not 0"
    raw_input("Press enter to continue")
</code></pre>
<p>My code would come out as <code>The variable is not 0</code></p>
<p>Why is this? And how can I use an <code>if</code> statement with the <code>readline</code> function?</p>

<p>The <code>readline</code> method does not remove trailing newlines from lines.  You need to do this manually:</p>
<pre><code>myvar = f.readline().rstrip()
</code></pre>
<p>Otherwise, <code>myvar</code> will be equal to <code>"0\n"</code>, which is not equal to <code>"0"</code>.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Also, you forgot to close the file by calling the <code>close</code> method:</p>
<pre><code>f.close() # Notice the parenthesis
</code></pre>
<p>Of course, using a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-with-statement" rel="nofollow">with-statement</a> would be better:</p>
<pre><code>with open("file.txt") as f:
    myvar = f.readline().rstrip()
</code></pre>
<p><code>with</code> will automatically close the file when control leaves its code block.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">What about a <code>print(repr(myvar))</code> at the right place? It would help you understand what happens...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks! I struggled with this for a little bit. I really appreciate it. Thanks for the fast reply.</span>
