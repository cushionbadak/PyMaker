<p>I'm a extremely beginner in Python and all I want to do is to delete space in some sells in the table.
But because of the error, I cannot write csv.
I've already checked several related posts in stackoverflow, but still couldn't correct my cord.</p>
<h1>Error</h1>

<p>Apparently, <code>csv.writer</code> in Python 3 <a href="http://grokbase.com/t/python/python-bugs-list/111me0k9fm/issue10954-no-warning-for-csv-writer-api-change" rel="nofollow"><em>doesn't support binary output streams</em></a>. This isn't mentioned in the documentation, and worse, it's <em>backwards</em> from the Python 2 recommendation of always opening the underlying files with <code>b</code>. </p>
<p>Luckily for you, the fix is easy: just open the file in text mode instead of binary. The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.writer" rel="nofollow">docs</a> also recommend that you specify <code>newline=''</code> when opening the file, so you might as well do that too.</p>
<pre><code>g = open('/Users/Study/Data/WGI/WGI_Data_Renamed_Python.csv', 'a', newline='')
csvWriter = csv.writer(g)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Thank you very much for your post, Henry! But I still got the same error even if I modified the line you've mentioned.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user51966 Python 3 seems to have silently dropped support for binary output streams in the csv writers. I'd updated my answer accordingly; take a look and see if it helps!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Now it works!! Thanks so much!!</span>
