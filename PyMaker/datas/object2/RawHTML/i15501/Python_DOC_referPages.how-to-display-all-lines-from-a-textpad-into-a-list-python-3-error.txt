<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>What I want to achieve is trying to open a text file with text. The format of the text is something like this:</p>
<pre><code>Bear
Car
Plant
</code></pre>
<p>Etc. Now the code that I have now:</p>
<pre><code>try:
    with open(info) as information:
        for line in information.readlines():
            line = line.split()
except IOError as error:
    print("Failed to open. Try again.")
</code></pre>
<p>Only prints out the last line in a list. What I want to do is print out ALL the words in the list.</p>
<p>So for the example above when I print(line) it prints <code>['Plant']</code> but I want <code>['Bear','Car','Plant']</code>.</p>
<p>Can anyone steer me in the right direction please? </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You don't need to split, you need to <em>strip</em> (to remove the newline) using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.strip" rel="nofollow"><code>str.strip()</code></a>, then add the result to a list:</p>
<pre><code>lines = []
with open(info) as information:
    for line in information:
        lines.append(line.strip())
</code></pre>
<p>Note that the <code>file.readlines()</code> call is not needed at all; just iterating over the file is enough.</p>
<p>You can do this in one go by reading the whole file and using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.splitlines" rel="nofollow"><code>str.splitlines()</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>with open(info) as information:
    lines = information.read().splitlines()
</code></pre>
<p>or you can use iteration still, in a list comprehension:</p>
<pre><code>with open(info) as information:
    lines = [line.strip() for line in information]
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>readlines</code> reads file as list</p>
<pre><code>try:
    with open(info) as information:
        lines =  information.readlines()
except IOError as error:
    print("Failed to open. Try again.")
</code></pre>
<p>you can also use <code>list</code>:</p>
<pre><code>try:
    with open(info) as information:
        lines = list(information)
except IOError as error:
    print("Failed to open. Try again.")
</code></pre>
</div>
