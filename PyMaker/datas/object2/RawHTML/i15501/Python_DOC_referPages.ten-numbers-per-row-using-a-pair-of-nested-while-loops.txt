<p>I was trying to do an exercise, but have a hard time doing it. I need to write a program containing a pair of nested while loops that displays the integer values 1-100, ten per row. I'm not sure how I should use while loops in such a task, I was trying something like this, but it seems like it only gives me first line to 10 and then all other numbers in second line:</p>
<pre><code>i = 1
while i &lt;=100:
    print(i, end=' ')
    i = i + 1
</code></pre>
<p>Any advice?</p>
</div>

<p>Hope This will help</p>
<pre><code>#python 2.7.6

for i in range(1, 101):
    print(i),
    if i%10==0:
        print
</code></pre>
<p>another solution with nested while loop:</p>
<pre><code>loop1 = 10
loop2 = 10
num = 1

while(loop1&gt;0):
    while(loop2&gt;0):
        print num,
        num = num+1
        loop2=loop2-1
    print
    loop2=10
    loop1=loop1-1
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Seems like I did the job right, thanks guys for helping me out.</p>
<pre><code>i = 1
per_row = 10
while i &lt;=100:
    while(per_row &gt; 0):
        print(i, end=' ')
        i = i + 1
        per_row = per_row - 1
    print()
    per_row = 10
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">You've been told to use a pair of nested <code>while</code> loops. So far you have neither <code>while</code> loops nor a pair of nested loops.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm confused where to put any, for example, should I somehow use while instead of ''for i in range(1, 101)''?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, exactly. See the tutorial, starting <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#first-steps-towards-programming" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/tutorial/â€¦</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Dinozauras yes - that appears to be what you're being asked to do... try writing a loop that increments a counter <code>while</code> the counter is less than another value to start with...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thanks guys, have edited my code, now I on my way to make it 10 integers per row, but could it be also made using while loop?</span>
