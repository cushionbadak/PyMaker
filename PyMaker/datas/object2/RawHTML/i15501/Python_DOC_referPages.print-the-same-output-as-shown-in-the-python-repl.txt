<p>Consider the following Python shell dump:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from datetime import datetime
&gt;&gt;&gt; d = datetime(2014,1,1)
&gt;&gt;&gt; d
datetime.datetime(2014, 1, 1, 0, 0)
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(d)
2014-01-01 00:00:00
</code></pre>
<p>How can I create the string <code>'datetime.datetime(2014, 1, 1, 0, 0)'</code> within a Python 3 program?</p>
<p>My objective is to generate code from a snapshot of data in order to provide a fixed set of data for unit testing.  I tried searching "python print repl output" and similar terms, and didn't find the answer I was hoping for.</p>

<p>I had a look at the list of <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html" rel="nofollow">built-in functions</a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#repr" rel="nofollow">repr(<em>object</em>)</a> caught my eye.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Return a string containing a printable representation of an object. For many types, this function makes an attempt to return a string that would yield an object with the same value when passed to <code>eval()</code>, otherwise the representation is a string enclosed in angle brackets that contains the name of the type of the object together with additional information often including the name and address of the object. A class can control what this function returns for its instances by defining a <code>__repr__()</code> method.</p>

<p>Sample code, extending from the question's terminal:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; repr(d)
'datetime.datetime(2014, 1, 1, 0, 0)'
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(repr(d))
datetime.datetime(2014, 1, 1, 0, 0)
</code></pre>
