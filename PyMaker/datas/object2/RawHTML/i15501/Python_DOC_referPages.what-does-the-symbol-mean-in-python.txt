<p>Semi-colons are used in Python to separate statements in the same line.</p>
<pre><code>print 1; print 2
</code></pre>
<p>Common use example:</p>
<pre><code>import pdb; pdb.set_trace()
</code></pre>

<p>The semicolon can be used as a statement separator in Python, called <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#compound-statements" rel="nofollow">stmt_list</a> in the language reference, but its use is generally discouraged (<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" rel="nofollow">PEP 8</a>, compound statements). We prefer one statement per line. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">Can you quote any tutorial here?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Actually, nothing. Its just for Java players :-)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">And sometimes they are just remnants of code conversion between Python and languages which use the semicolons as line delimiter like C++, Java, etc.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Okay, just another follow up question, what if I am writing a really large dictionary, and I don't want all the keys to be on the same line because it makes it hard to read over, is there someway that I can denote that is continues to the next line?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@A-P , use a new line after the comma on each value.</span>
