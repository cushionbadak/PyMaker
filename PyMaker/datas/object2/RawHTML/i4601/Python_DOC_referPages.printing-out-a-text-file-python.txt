<p>I am making a Quiz. When I try to print the results which are stored in a file, this is the output:</p>
<p>Instead of actually creating new lines when there is a '\n' it prints the '\n' instead.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>['\n', 'Username:\n', 'Tes123\n', 'Subject:\n', 'Computer Science\n',
  'Difficulty:\n', 'Hard\n', 'Score:\n', '5\n', 'Grade:\n', 'A\n']</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the text file the results are presented like this. <strong>This is what I want the output to look like:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rf4QH.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img alt="enter image description here" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rf4QH.png"/></a></p>
<p>This is my code to read the data from this text file and then print it into the interpreter.</p>
<pre><code>with open(leaderboarddetails) as f:
    data = f.readlines()
    print("Here are all the current results:")
    print('\n')
    print(data)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Here is a simple and efficient way to read data in from a file and creating a new lines.</p>
<pre><code>for line in f:
 print(line, end='')
</code></pre>
<p>This reads the data into new lines every time it reaches the end of the sentence or line. For more information see <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#reading-and-writing-files" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Input / Output</a> for python.</p>

<p>You might want to try this instead:</p>
<pre><code>with open(leaderboarddetails) as f:
data = f.readlines()
print("Here are all the current results:")
print('\n')
for item in data:
    print(item)
</code></pre>
<p>p.s
it might be better for you not to save \n in the file at all and just do this:</p>
<pre><code>with open(leaderboarddetails) as f:
data = f.readlines()
print("Here are all the current results:")
print('\n')
for item in data:
    print("\n"+str(item))
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You basically have to iter on your data.</p>
<p>How about this?</p>
<pre><code>with open(leaderboarddetails) as f:
    data = f.readlines()
    print("Here are all the current results:")
    print('\n')
    for info in data:
        print(info)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>you can try these after your print method</p>
<pre><code>for line in data:
    print(line, end='')
print('-'*10)
print(''.join(data))
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Another way of '\n' is <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">os.linesep</a>.
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8084260/python-printing-a-file-to-stdout">This page</a> helped me with printing the file if that is what you need.</p>
<pre><code>with open(leaderboarddetails,'r') as f:
    print(f.read())
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>data</code> is a list. When you print it will print entire list</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You can think of it in the following way: When you print <code>data</code> you are trying to display the value of it as a string. In your case the value is a collection of <code>string</code> elements. Each of the strings contains the <code>\n</code> character. If you want the <code>\n</code> character to be read as an escape sequence and cause a line feed, you have to pass the string itself as an argument to the print function.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you so much.</span>
