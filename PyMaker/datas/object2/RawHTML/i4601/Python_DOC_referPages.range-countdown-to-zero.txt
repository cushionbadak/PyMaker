<p>I am taking a beginner Python class and the instructor has asked us to countdown to zero without using recursion.  I am trying to use a for loop and range to do so, but he says we must include the zero.  </p>
<p>I searched on the internet and on this website extensively but cannot find the answer to my question.  Is there a way I can get range to count down and include the zero at the end when it prints?</p>
<p>Edit:</p>
<pre><code>def countDown2(start):
#Add your code here!
    for i in range(start, 0, -1):
        print(i)
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-range" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>range()</code></a> function in Python has 3 parameters: <code>range([start], stop[, step])</code>.  If you want to count down instead of up, you can set the <code>step</code> to a negative number:</p>
<pre><code>for i in range(5, -1, -1):
    print(i)
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>5
4
3
2
1
0
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>As another option to @chrisz's answer, Python has a built-in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#reversed" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>reversed()</code></a> function which produces an iterator in the reversed order.</p>
<pre><code>start_inclusive = 4
for i in reversed(range(start_inclusive + 1)):
   print(i)
</code></pre>
<p>outputs</p>
<pre><code>4
3
2
1
0
</code></pre>
<p>This can be sometimes easier to read, and for a well-written iterator (e.g. built-in range function), the performance should be the same.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">The whole idea behind an instructor asking you to do it, is so that you can learn... researching for a solution <i>might</i> get you through this one assignment... but will hurt you in the long run. Attempt to answer it yourself and if you get stuck, post your code and ask a specific question.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hi Pashta, welcome to Stack Overflow. ZeroPiraeus had the right intentions as <i>this site is <b>not</b> a forum</i>, and most users here feel strongly that salutations should not be included in posts as it is a distraction from the Q&amp;A format. @ZeroPiraeus, please avoid minor edits to remove salutations, but try to look at and improve the post as a whole (including the title and tags). I'll now remove the previous comments so we can move on.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Rushikumar I wasn't looking for a solution but an answer to a particular way things work in python.  I forgot to include my work, but I edited my question and put it in there.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Right, that's what I did but it won't print the zero... OH wait!  You ended it at -1!  Thank you!</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>range(start, stop)</code> does not include stop as one of it's values, so you must use <code>end + 1</code> (or -1) in your case if you wish to decrement</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I like this approach, especially since it will include <code>0</code>, might want to clarify that you must start at <code>start + 1</code> to include <code>start</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, I haven't heard of reversed yet.  This is even better.  :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Good idea @chrisz. The typical inclusive-start, exclusive-end style of iterators is more ambiguous when reversed.</span>
