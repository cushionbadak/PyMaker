<p>I'm trying to see if it's possible to execute a command from a variable</p>
<p>Example of what I'm going for:</p>
<pre><code>variable = print ("something")
print ("Done")
</code></pre>
<p>And then be able to print that by writing the variable name after this.
Example:</p>
<pre><code>variable
</code></pre>
<p>but when I try the output is:</p>
<pre><code>something
Done
</code></pre>
<p>I know you could do this by just writing the thing you want to print in the variable, but I would like to use this for other commands.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>For this you define functions or in this short case you can wrap it into a lambda-function:</p>
<pre><code>print_that = lambda: print("something")
print_that()
print("done")
</code></pre>
<p>You call it with the <code>()</code>. The <code>print_that</code> would be that what you called <code>variabel</code>. With a function you can execute more commands:</p>
<pre><code>def print_that():
    print("something")
    print("something else")
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.partial" rel="nofollow noreferrer">functools.partial</a> to call any already defined function with some fixed arguments.</p>
<pre><code>from functools import partial
print_something = partial(print, "something")

# Use () to call as a normal function
print_something() # prints "something"

# You can pass more arguments later
print_something("another thing") # prints "something another thing"
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Functions. You're looking for functions. Your <code>variabel</code> should be a function.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I've accepted the edit @Peter Dolan so you have no reason to keep the downvote.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Mr.Blue I did not downvote!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes ty I will accept it as soon as I can</span>
<span class="comment-copy">One complaint... <code>lambda</code> builds anonymous function objects and is used when you <i>don't</i> want to assign the function to a variable. The first part of your answer is promoting bad habits. If you want to assign a function object to a variable... that's what <code>def</code> is for.</span>
