<p>When declaring variables that large you can use <strong>scientific notation</strong></p>

<p>and to get "very large decimal values" on division operations you can use string formatting and scientific notation</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Are you just looking for large numbers, or large numbers with high precision? A <code>float</code> only keeps as much information as it can cram into 64 bits; if you want dozen of digits worth, you want to use <code>decimal.Decimal</code>. Start by reading <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/decimal.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the module docs</a>; there's a lot to learn, but it's worth it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, that was exactly  what i was looking for, thanks.</span>
