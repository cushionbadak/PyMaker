<p>I tried to run the code down below, but I couldn't because it launched the following error:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'str' and 'int'.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've been searching and I found that it has something to do with the input, but not in this case.</p>
<pre><code>st = "text"
for i in range(0, n):
    for j in st:
        if j == 0:
            st[j] = st[len(st)]
        else:
            st[j] = st[j - 1]
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The problematic part is <code>st[j] = st[j - 1]</code>, more specifically <code>j - 1</code> where you are subtracting 'str' and 'int' types. This is not supported in Python.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You have several errors. Here is a code which I believe does what you want:</p>
<pre><code>n = 1
st = "text"
# Make a copy of st, but make it a list
st_new = list(st)
for i in range(0, n):
    # Loop over characters c and their indices j in st
    for j, c in enumerate(st):
        # Assign to st_new, lookup values in st
        if j == 0:
            st_new[j] = st[len(st) - 1]  # The last index is len(st) - 1
        else:
            st_new[j] = st[j - 1]
# Convert st_new to a str
st_new = ''.join(st_new)
</code></pre>
<p>The comments should explain the changes. Main points:</p>
<ul>
<li>You cannot assign to a <code>str</code> (the <code>st</code> variable), because <code>str</code>s are immutable. Use <code>list</code>s instead, with each element being a single character (<code>str</code> of length 1).</li>
<li>When you loop over a <code>str</code>, what you get are its characters, not the indices <code>j</code> you are looking for. I've used <code>enumerate()</code> which gives you both characters and indices.</li>
<li>The last index in <code>st</code> is not <code>len(st)</code>, but <code>len(st) - 1</code>, because Python's indexing is 0-based. Also, because Python supports negative periodic indexing, your whole if statement is not actually needed. Try leaving it out.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The first problem you are encountering is that <code>j</code> is a string and you cannot substract an integer from a string.</p>
<pre><code>j = 't'
j - 1 # TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'str' and 'int'
</code></pre>
<p>The next problem you will encounter is that strings are immutable so you cannot set a given character of a string.</p>
<pre><code>st = 'test'
st[0] = 'a' # TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment
</code></pre>
<p>Since a string is immutable, you will need to create a new one if you want to change even one character. In that case, it seems what you want to do is rotate your string by <code>n</code>. This can be achieved like this.</p>
<pre><code>def rotate(s, n):
    if s:
        n = n % len(s)
        return s[-n:] + s[:-n] # This creates a new string
    else:
        return ''

rotate('test', 1) # 'ttes'
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">What is the code <i>meant</i> to do?</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>1</code> is an <code>int</code> and <code>j</code> is a <code>str</code>. The <code>-</code> operator does not work between <code>str</code> and <code>int</code> objects. Furthermore, you cannot mutate a string, so things like <code>st[0] = 'x'</code> will not work <i>anyway</i> even if the expression <code>j - 1</code> evaluated to an <code>int</code>. IOW, you have a lot of problems in this piece of code.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Post the full traceback.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">So note, <code>j</code> will <b>never</b> equal <code>0</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ok, I already know that, what I try to do is to change the index of the character to a new one.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It really depends what you are trying to solve here. If you want <code>j</code> to be integer depending on <code>st</code> you could write: <code>for j, chr in enumerate(st)</code>. <code>j</code> would be now index ranging from 0..3 and <code>chr</code> would be individual characters of your string.
