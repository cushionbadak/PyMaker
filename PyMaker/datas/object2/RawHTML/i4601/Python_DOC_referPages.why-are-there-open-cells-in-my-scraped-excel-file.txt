<p>Im am trying to scrape developer jobs from indeed.nl to Excel using Python and bs4. Everything works fine but when I open it in Excel, there are extra lines cells between the jobs 
<img alt="Excel file" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UpTfy.png"/> </p>
<p>Can anyone see what I did wrong?</p>
<pre><code>from urllib.request import urlopen as uReq
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup as soup

my_url = 'https://www.indeed.nl/jobs?q=developer&amp;l='

# opening up connection, grabbing the page
uClient = uReq(my_url)
page_html = uClient.read()
uClient.close()

page_soup = soup(page_html, "html.parser")

#grabs each job
containers = page_soup.findAll("div",{"class":"row"})

filename = "indeedjobs.csv"

f = open(filename, "w")

headers = "Company; Job; City\n"
f.write(headers)

for container in containers:
    jobtitle = container.a["title"]
    city_container = container.findAll("span",{"class":"location"})
    City_name = city_container[0].text
    company_container = container.findAll("span",{"class":"company"})
    company_name = company_container[0].text

    print("Company: " + company_name)
    print("Job: " + jobtitle)
    print("City: " + City_name)

    f.write(company_name + ";" + jobtitle + ";" + City_name + "\n")
f.close()

<p>The <code>&lt;span class="company"&gt;</code> element starts with a newline and some spaces. Remove those with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.strip" rel="nofollow noreferrer">.strip()</a>.</p>
<p>You can also consider the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.writer" rel="nofollow noreferrer">csv module</a> to write well-formatted CSV files. The module will help you with correct escaping of special characters.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">for you're writing it as csv</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Are you sure that <code>company_name</code> has no leading line break?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This was it, thanks!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes this was it. Thanks a lot for the quick answer!</span>
