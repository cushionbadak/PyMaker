<p>Hey there so i have my number guesser in python3.But i want to give out an Error if the User types letters instead of numbers.When i type a letter it says</p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "nummerlol.py", line 14, in &lt;module&gt;
    guess = int(guess)
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10:"
</code></pre>
<p>Is there a way to change this error? thx</p>
<pre><code>import time
import random 
from secrets import randbelow
guesscount = 0
print("Hey whats your name")
name = input()
number = randbelow(20)
print("The Number is between 1 &amp; 20")
while guesscount &lt; 6:
    print("Guess.")
    guess = input()
    guess = int(guess)
    guesscount = guesscount + 1
    if guess &lt; number:
        print("My Number is bigger")
    if guess &gt; number:
        print("My Number is lower")
    if guess == number:
        break
if guess == number :
guesscount = str(guesscount)
print("Nice",name ,".")
print("You needed" ,guesscount ,"Tries")
if guess != number:
    number = str(number)
    print("Bruh,My Number was" ,number)`
</code></pre>

<p>You could use a try-except loop.  With <code>continue</code> (as below) the user can keep guessing.  You could also put your own exception in place of the <code>print</code> and <code>continue</code> if you want the script to break with a more informative message.</p>
<pre><code>import time
import random 
from secrets import randbelow
guesscount = 0
print("Hey whats your name")
name = input()
number = randbelow(20)

while guesscount &lt; 6:
    print("Guess.")
    guess = input()
    try:
        guess = int(guess)
    except:
        print("That is not a number")
        continue
    guesscount = guesscount + 1
    if guess &lt; number:
        print("My Number is bigger")
    if guess &gt; number:

<p>A <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8075877/converting-string-to-int-using-try-except-in-python">similar question</a> to yours already exists, but I'll answer your question anyway.</p>
<p>As you already know, the reason you're getting a traceback response is because you're trying to convert a non-integer into an integer when you call <code>int(guess)</code>. You can catch this exception using a try/except block. For example, you could replace the offending line of code with the following:</p>
<pre><code>while True:
  try:
    guess = int(guess)
    break
  except ValueError:
    print("You must enter a valid number.")
</code></pre>
<p>This code will cause the program to require input from the user until that input is valid. Have a look at this Python3 <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">handling errors and exceptions</a> documentation for more information.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Please indent your code properly.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What does <code>give out an Error</code> mean.  You need to describe what you want to happen when the user gives an invalid response.</span>
