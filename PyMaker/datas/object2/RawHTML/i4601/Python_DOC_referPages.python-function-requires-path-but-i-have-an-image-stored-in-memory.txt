<p>I have a python function (using the Pythonista app) to show an image in the console. I have the image saved in a BytesIO object but the function requires a file path.</p>
<p>Is there any way to give it a path to the bytesIO or somehow give it the image without needing to save it as a file?</p>
<p>The specific function is console.show_image(image_path)</p>
</div>

<p>The general answer is that if the function you call expects a filesystem path and cannot handle a file-like object instead then your only solution is to write your data to a file (and ask the function's author to add support for file-like object, or if it's OSS implement it by yourself and send a merge request). </p>

<span class="comment-copy">Did you read the documentation?  Pythonista <a href="http://omz-software.com/pythonista/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">apparently</a> only runs on IOS, so I can't access it.  It says it has full documentation within the app.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Itâ€™s not in the documentation. My question is not specifically about pythonista, I just added this for additional information.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Have you tried passing your BytesIO ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">you could write it to a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/tempfile.html#tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile" rel="nofollow noreferrer">NamedTemporaryFile</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">or you can use <code>Image.show()</code> according to this <a href="https://forum.omz-software.com/topic/1705/displaying-an-image/3" rel="nofollow noreferrer">post</a></span>
