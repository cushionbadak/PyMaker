<p>When writing up a program in python version 3.3.0 (because of non-admin privileges i can't update) it worked completely fine, however now that i am using python version 3.3.2 it no longer works, the program goes as follows:</p>
<pre><code>num = input("please enter a value and press enter: ")
</code></pre>
<p>(assuming 1 is chosen)</p>
<pre><code>conv = input("what unit is the measurement in? cm, m, or km: ")
</code></pre>
<p>(assuming cm is chosen)</p>
<pre><code>if conv == "cm":
print("chosen value is cm, converting to m and km")
m = num/100
print(m , "meters")
km = num/100000
print(km , "kilometers")
</code></pre>
<p>the desired output is (found in 3.3.0):</p>
<pre><code>please enter value and press enter: 1
your chosen value is:  1
what unit is the measurement in? cm, m, or km: cm
you have chosen cm, converting to m and km
0.01 meters
1e-05 kilometers
</code></pre>
<p>but instead i get (in 3.3.2):</p>
<pre><code>please enter value and press enter: 1
your chosen value is:  1
what unit is the measurement in? cm, m, or km: cm
you have chosen cm, converting to m and km
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "C:/Users/USER/Desktop/QUESTION.py", line 10, in &lt;module&gt;
m = num/100
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for /: 'str' and 'int'
</code></pre>

<p>I am surprised that it works somewhere anyway. When using the <code>input()</code> function, Python <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input" rel="nofollow noreferrer">returns a string</a> (<code>str</code>) from what has been entered.</p>
<p>So basically, you just need to convert the text to an integer, using <code>num = int(num)</code> after having initialized your <code>num</code> variable. To be clean, you'd also need to implement a basic error handling system, in case the input entered by the user is not implicitely convertable to an integer.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>num = ""
while not isinstance(num, int):
    num = input("Please, enter a number\n&gt;&gt;&gt; ")
    try:
        num = int(num)
    except ValueError:
        pass
# proceed with your code...
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">your traceback error and your posted code do not match. Are you really using python3 and not python2?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Convery <code>num</code> to an integer value. <code>num = int(num);</code> You are attempting to divide a string.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">sorry, i didn't change that part of the code to the updated one, "data" is actually "num" , and, as far as i can tell, it is definitely python3 (as it states: Python 3.3.2 Shell. whenever i open IDLE</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Okay, open the version of python that runs this code, and type <code>import sys; print(sys.version)</code>, what does it say?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Fairly sure the same error will pop up in 3.3.0</span>
