<p>I currently trying to build an online random color generator with python and flask. I have created my function which generate a random hex color code and I struggle to pass it into the css background color.</p>
<pre><code>def random_color():
def r():
    return random.randint(0, 255)
return ('#%02X%02X%02X' % (r(), r(), r()))
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You could try to genrate the random hex values as you did (or the way I did, by just just slightly improving code with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.sample" rel="nofollow noreferrer">random.sample</a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#ranges" rel="nofollow noreferrer">range</a>) in your code example and pass that value into the template context, where you would put it somewhere in <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tag. This will render template and substitute dynamic value every time you visit the page.</p>
<pre><code># app.py
import random

from flask import Flask, render_template

app = Flask(__name__)


@app.route('/')
def home():
    hex = '#{:02x}{:02x}{:02x}'.format(*random.sample(range(256), 3))
    return render_template('index.html', hex=hex)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

# templates/index.html
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Home Page&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;
    &lt;style&gt;
        body {
            background-color: {{ hex }};
        }
    &lt;/style&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Home Page&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

<span class="comment-copy">yes actually I thought about this way but I don't know how to have my html style the background color and keep my css for other elements.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I don't think I understand what you are trying to say. You could use multiple <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tags to include other css files. If you have any code example showing what&amp;how you are trying to achieve, and what part is not working then we would be able to better understand the problem.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Well, I already attached a css to my html page which will display the color. I don't figure how to conciliate the css and html style:                                                                                                                                                          <code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="static/style2.css?q=1280549770"&gt;  &lt;style&gt; body {   background-color:white } &lt;/style&gt;</code>                                                                                                             It only take the css information and not the html one also.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sounds like you are having problem with CSS? Try to update your question or create a new one. Because in this one you asked how to pass a variable into CSS and the answer above seems to give a working solution to your question.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I figured it out, I just delete the background color information in my css. Many thanks for youR help !</span>
