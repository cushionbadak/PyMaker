<p>I have tried to install libraries using pip but my console doesnt recognize as a command. I checked the python/scripts folder and there was no ppip.exe in the folder. I reinstalled Python 3.6 a couple of times but I havent been able to use it. I tried it on another computer and pip installed itself with python 3.6. </p>
<p>I've seen answers that say to open a Python shell, then insert </p>
<blockquote>
<p>python -m pip install 'packagename' </p>
</blockquote>
<p>but i tried this and the shell marked invalid syntax at the end of writing pip</p>

<p>if <code>pip</code> is installed the following will work for sure</p>
<p>open a python shell then</p>
<p><code>import pip</code></p>
<p><code>pip.main(['install', 'packagename'])</code></p>
<p>replace the <em>packagename</em> with the package you want to install</p>
<p>because of the path problem try to use <em>absolute paths</em> ( in windows beginning with drive letter i.e. <code>C:/.../.../pip.exe</code>). in batch script it is generally  good idea to use absolute paths. Alternatively check if your path has to be fixed : <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html</a></p>

<p>Operating systems search for executables in the <em>system path</em>. I.e. windows knows by default where its own executables are located because the directory is in the system path, however when new software is installed that contains executables like <code>pip</code> the system path has to be edited to inform windows ( or linux ) where the new executables are located. The path is an <em>environment variable</em>. This is also valid for other languages and programs like java ( <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1672281/environment-variables-for-java-installation">Environment variables for java installation</a> ) ,...
Now your problem very likely is that the directory where the <code>pip.exe</code> executable is stored is not part of your windows path. This has to be fixed like in <strong><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html</a></strong>, chapter <strong>3.3. Configuring Python</strong></p>

<span class="comment-copy">You probably have to install <code>pip</code>. Take a look at the <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">pip documentation</a> for tips on how to install <code>pip</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Maybe a path problem</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What OS? Just search for pip.exe, go to the directory and run from there to see if it works. If yes, check your system/environment path settings. If there is a problem, reinstall.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">While this might help someone get something installed interactively and get them over the hurdle in the short term, it doesn't really help a person understand why pip isn't available on the command line or how to find it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This solved my issue. Thanks, ralf. Although I would like to know why one method works and not the other.</span>
