<p>I'm trying to get the output from a variable redirected and written into a file but only the last line from the output shows up in the file I'm writing to. However when I do a print of the variable I get all the lines I would expect.</p>
<pre><code>rds = boto3.client('rds')
rds_instances = rds.describe_db_instances()['DBInstances']
for databases in rds_instances:
    arns = ("{0}".format(databases['DBInstanceArn']))
#    print (arns)
f = open('/tmp/arns', 'a')
f.write(arns)
f.close()
</code></pre>
<p>Example output of when I do print I get multiple rds arn's:</p>
<pre><code>arn:aws:rds:us-east-1:222222222222:db:databasename01

arn:aws:rds:us-east-1:222222222222:db:databasename02

arn:aws:rds:us-east-1:222222222222:db:databasename03
</code></pre>
<p>However when I check the file I've written there's only:</p>
<pre><code>arn:aws:rds:us-east-1:222222222222:db:databasename03
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You should use a <code>with open(filename, mode) as f:</code> to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#reading-and-writing-files" rel="nofollow noreferrer">write to files</a>, ensuring they get closed even if exceptions happen. </p>
<p>As soon as the code leaves the block below the <code>with</code> your file will be auto-closed - no need to do it manually.</p>
<p>You could reformulate your code like this:</p>
<pre><code>rds = boto3.client('rds')
rds_instances = rds.describe_db_instances()['DBInstances']
with open('/tmp/arns', 'a') as f:
    for databases in rds_instances:
        arns = ("{0}".format(databases['DBInstanceArn']))
        f.write(arns + '\n') # indented so it is executed foreach "for" loop
</code></pre>
<p>You might also addd a <code>'\n'</code> to your write output - it is not automatically added.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>When you print the results it prints the value of <code>arns</code> for every single time the loop runs.</p>
<p>And when you're writing the value into the file it will only take the value of <code>arns</code> the last time the loop runs.</p>
<p>What you can do is open the file before the loop and write the value within the loop instead of doing it after. Then close the file after the loop.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">your indentation is off. those last 3 lines need to be indented. As it's written, you're only writing one line to the file- only the last value of <code>arns</code>.</span>
