<p>My shell script contains below code:</p>

<p>How to convert this into python.</p>
<p>I tried using subprocess, os module . it does not works.</p>
<p>If i  I am getting "<strong>repo command not found"</strong></p>
<p>I need some help to solve this. </p>

<p>What you're trying to do doesn't make sense. You explicitly set it with <code>RUN_MODE = ""</code>, so that's the value it's going to have. If you want to check the environment variable <code>RUN_MODE</code>, you do that using <code>os.environ</code>, exactly the same way you're already doing to set the same environment variable.</p>
<p>So, how do you check that an environment variable either doesn't exist, or does exist but is an empty string? The same way you do for any dict, or any other mapping, in Python: with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict.get" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>get</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>if os.environ.get("RUN_MODE", "") == "":
   os.environ["RUN_MODE"] = "DEV"
</code></pre>
<p>Also, in a comment, you were trying to test for <code>" "</code>. But <code>""</code> and <code>" "</code> are not the same string—one is empty, the other has a space in it.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">If you want to check the environment variable instead of checking a constant empty string, why don’t you just check the environment variable? You clearly already know how to use <code>os.environ</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">if os.environ['RUN_MODE'] = " " :         os.environ['RUN_MODE'] = "DEV"                   i tried like this    but i am getting keyvalue error</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That's the same as any normal dict in Python: a key that doesn't exist doesn't have the value <code>" "</code>, it doesn't have any value at all.</span>
