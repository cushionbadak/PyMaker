<p>I'm sure python has a built in way to create an x size list where the contents are 0 through x-1, but I don't know how to do it. I've searched on Google as well as on here, I'm sure that I must've not been using the correct wording to find what I needed. Please help.</p>
<p>Ex: <code>len([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]) = 10</code></p>
