<p>I have the following code in Python and I am an unsure about how the for loop here is working.</p>
<pre><code>cur.execute("SELECT CUST_ID, COMPANY, LASTNAME, CITY, STATE FROM 
mytable")                            

colnames = [desc[0] for desc in cur.description]      
</code></pre>
<p>How does this for work ?</p>
<pre><code>[desc[0] for desc in cur.description]   
</code></pre>
<p>What is <code>desc[0</code>]?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Based on the code you've given us it seems like <code>desc</code> is an array itself and thus <code>colnames</code> is an array of all the <code>desc[0]</code> you get from each <code>desc</code> in <code>cur.description</code></p>
<p><code>desc[0]</code> is the first item in desc as arrays in Python are zero-indexed.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>It use iterable objects especially <strong>next</strong> methode it will consume the value inside the objects till get stop iteration, it works like a generator objects....</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>When in doubt of something, try to recreate the thing. Althought, it could be anything iterable, we could assume it's just a list, then:</p>
<pre><code>description = [['first'], ['second', 'third'], [x, y, z], [...], ...]
colnames = [desc[0] for desc in description]
</code></pre>
<p>in the output you'll have:
<code>['first', 'second', x, ... ]</code></p>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>desc[0]</code> is the first element in <code>desc</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">the structure containing <code>desc[0]</code> is called a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">list comprehension</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">conn = db2.connect()                                                    cur = conn.cursor()                                                                                                                             cur.execute("SELECT CUST_ID, COMPANY, LASTNAME, CITY, STATE FROM  \         zendphp7.sp_cust WHERE COUNTRY = 'US'")                                                                  colnames = [desc[0] for desc in cur.description]</span>
<span class="comment-copy">cur.description is a LIST , and looks like Colnames is also list</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You should put code edits in the main post. Regardless, your question has been answered.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, and I have explained why it's a list above.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">its not exactly clear to those unfamiliar with python where <code>next()</code> comes into play</span>
<span class="comment-copy">why are we not getting "third" ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@AJAY, <code>second</code> and <code>third</code> is in the same list, since we doing <code>desc[0]</code>, we getting <code>second</code>, that is, the first element. Notice that it is lists inside a list. <code>[ ['first'], ['second', 'third'], [...], ... ]</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Got it thanks, where can i find a good explanation on list in python</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@AJAY, that's hard to tell, but typing python lists in google search will give you a huge number of websites that you can dig in. Here's some: Python Documentation for data structure =&gt; <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html</a> and here's a random =&gt;  <a href="https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/list" rel="nofollow noreferrer">programiz.com/python-programming/list</a> Try them.</span>
