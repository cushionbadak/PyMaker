<p>I have to type in a terminal a user password. googling arround lead to  <code>getpass</code> as the most recommended way to do it.</p>
<p>But, somehow- using this function did not hide the characters as expected.
First I thought it has somthing to do with the platform ( Pycharm ), but testing is on IDLE yield the same.</p>
<p>any ideas why ? (code below was on Mac using Python shell)</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; import getpass
&gt;&gt;&gt; a=getpass.getpass(prompt='Password')
Warning: Password input may be echoed.
PasswordTHISISPASSWORD
</code></pre>

<p>if you will launch it from IDE it will cause echo will be seen. You can try it in command line terminal it works fine as can be seen in the attached screenshot.</p>
<p><p>hope this helps</p>

<p>I tried your code with a terminal and with PyCharm too, it works better in terminal but i found a checkbox in the run configurations of PyCharm that avoid the echoing of the password and set it correctly to the variable as you could see with the debugger, but i noticed that  if you try to print the variable in some cases it prints something strange.</p>
<p>Click on <em>Edit Configurations...</em> on the left of the run button and check <em>Emulate terminal in output console</em>, it worked with the last version of PyCharm</p>
<p>EDIT: I read just now that you are using a Mac, I tried this with linux, so I'm not sure it will work on mac</p>

<span class="comment-copy">For what it's worth, the password is not echoed when I use <code>getpass</code> in python run from the command line on Linux. So I say it is a platform issue.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>If echo free input is unavailable getpass() falls back to printing a warning message to stream and reading from sys.stdin and issuing a GetPassWarning</code> - Did you get a warning message?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What happens if you run the code directly from the shell prompt: <code>python myprog.py</code>. Do you get the same warning and have the same issue then?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ArndtJonasson since I need it to work both on Linux and Mac - you are correct that for example above was on Mac. following your comment- I check on Linux- and it hides characters as expected.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@JohanL I updated my question - it happens using shell ( or any other ) under Mac.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">as mentioned above - it happens on Mac, same code on Linux works. why the difference ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">"If echo free input is unavailable getpass() falls back to printing a warning message to stream and reading from sys.stdin and issuing a GetPassWarning." from <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/getpass.html#getpass.GetPassWarning" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/getpass.html#getpass.GetPassWarning</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">I updated my post after a comment about Linux and Mac.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you find the reason for that in Mac- itâ€™ll great</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This "Emulate terminal in output console," worked on Mac.</span>
