<p>I would like to use a function that would skip the loop for one iteration. I found out that continue works in Java,  but it doesn't seem to work in Python. Is there an equivalent of continue in Python, and if so, what is it?</p>

<p>Refer to the official python <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#break-and-continue-statements-and-else-clauses-on-loops" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation</a> for information on continue in python.</p>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>continue</code> works fine in Python. You did something wrong.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.6/tutorial/controlflow.html#break-and-continue-statements-and-else-clauses-on-loops" rel="nofollow noreferrer">official documentation</a> says there is a <code>continue</code> in 2.7 and 3.6. Maybe this is why nobody ever uses your 3.0.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Can we see your code, <code>continue</code> should work.</span>
