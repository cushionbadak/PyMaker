<p>I have been trying to calculate Python's execution time with this code, I've got the time but I don't know which number is being used from the list to be measured any help with how to print it would be helpful and much appreciated</p>
<pre><code>import time
import random

def algorithm(c):
    b = []
    for i in c:
        b.append(i*2)

def data():
    c=[]
    for x in range(10000000):
        c.append(random.randint(1,100000))
timer(c)

def timer(c):
    time_start = time.time()
    algorithm(c)
    time_end = time.time()
    time_taken = time_end - time_start
    print(time_taken)
data()

<p>I believe your code is fine you just need to restructure the code a bit.</p>

<p>This will execute the given function number times and print your time in seconds for it. You can use the setup to provide "data" or "imports" to your test that only has to be executed once and not on each run.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">need to fix your indentation</span>
<span class="comment-copy">do you know about the <code>timeit</code> module?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I've seen it but never used it before</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm very thankful for the help, however not to sound ungrateful but I don't know which number is being used from the list to measure the execution time. would there be any way to print it? I apologise for being ungrateful</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I have added comments to explain it a bit, you can always ask if it is still not clear.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">sorry if I am not being clear. for example, I get the execution time which could be 17.623674392700195 what I need is the number that is used to calculate the 17.623674392700195. a number that isn't a float so that I get an output like                                17.623674392700195, 45878269(random number)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">you want to know the generation time of each random number, or the time it took to generate each random number?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">no the random number by itself. sorry for the confusion</span>
