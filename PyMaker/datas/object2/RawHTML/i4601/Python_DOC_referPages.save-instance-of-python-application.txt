<p>I wrote a Python application where the user can create projects, kind of like Word, Photoshop, Solidworks etc. Like for those applications, I need the user to save his work in a file thats specific to the program so that when he opens it, he continue to work on his project.</p>
<p>How can I do this ?
 Are there any existing libraries that can let me do this ?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>The main tools that is suitable for you approach is <code>pickle</code>. It is native in Python and is a serialization method for all Python objects. See <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs</a>. The main problem with <code>pickle</code> is if you use it to save objects that holds a large amount of data. It will save the whole object and hence large files.</p>
<p>Alternative approaches are also very welcome and preferred when planning and implementing using a design pattern that is suitable for the job.</p>
<p>For instance, you can build <em>configuration objects</em> that tracks the work and save it into <code>JSON</code> formats.<br/>
Another language that is good for preferences and state capturing is <code>XML</code>.</p>
<p>However, in all the designed approaches you'll need to modify the code such that it can save and resume based on the defined settings, state and preferences.</p>
<p>All the above languages have libraries to support it, <code>JSON</code> is native.</p>

<p>You need to save those to the file</p>
<pre><code>with open('Failed.py', 'w') as file:
    file.write('whatever')
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">What you are describing is a data file, not an application</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Read up on data serialization for Python, there are plenty of options, like <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>pickle</code></a>/<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/shelve.html#module-shelve" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>shelve</code></a> (potentially unsafe), <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">JSON</a>, <a href="http://pyyaml.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">YAML</a>, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">XML</a>, <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Protocol Buffers</a> (more intended for network maybe but still), ...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Worth noting that <code>pickle</code> can be unsafe and you shouldn't load untrusted data with it as it may run malicious code.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@jdehesa Correct, you might want to encrypt it after saving.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">While <code>pickle</code> is used to store variables and objects in Python, I doubt this is what the OP wants or needs. It is rather a question about storing data to a file, using <code>open</code> (maybe formatted as json or XML or something) however badly worded.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@mr_mo Ok, I am saving large amounts of data and I think I would be better off using XML but how could I do it so that when the user clicks on the project file icon, it opens in my application, rather than in notepad ?</span>
