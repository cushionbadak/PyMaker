<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have searched and searched but have have hit a dead end my normal policy is to try looking and only when I've hit a wall ask question I am learning python for school and I have an assignment I need to finish but I can't figure out how now I'm not asking anyone to do my home work for me but maybe someone can explain what coding I'm missing or what in not understanding</p>
<p>I am taking a local saved html file and I'm trying to get python to read it and display and print the text in the python shell only in a simular format as it appers if you open the html in txtpad however it must use only the tools and libraries that come standard with python any help that can be offered I would greatly appreciate it</p>
<p>Here is the code I have </p>
<pre><code>    Import re
    html = open("index.html").read()
    text = re.sub("&lt;.*?&gt;", "\n", html)
    print(text)
</code></pre>
<p>so this causes the text to look like this</p>
<pre><code>    "title


     body

     body

     body

     body


     end"
</code></pre>
<p>i would like it to look like this </p>
<pre><code>    "title
     body
     body
     body
     body
     end"
</code></pre>
<p>but if i remove the "\n" it looks like </p>
<pre><code>    "title      body     body     body
     body      end"
</code></pre>
<p>so that is why i am stuck</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Try this :</p>
<pre><code>with open('index.html', 'r') as f:
    f=f.read()
    print(f)
</code></pre>
