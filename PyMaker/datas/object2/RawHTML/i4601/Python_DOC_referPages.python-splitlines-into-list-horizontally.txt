<span class="comment-copy">Please show some sample input, and the actual and expected output. It's too hard to figure out what your problem is from just a vague description. If it isn't obvious how to do that, please read the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve">Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example</a> help.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">edited, shows output</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I don't understand what you want. Do you just want to print the two elements of each <code>tag2</code> on separate lines? All of <code>for subtag in tag2: print(subtag)</code> or <code>print(*tag2, sep='\n')</code> or <code>print('\n'.join(tag2))</code> do that, if that's what you want.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">if you change print(tag2) to print(tag2[0]) it prints out the row of dates on the left, instead of the date and name straight across.. which is what im trying to do, if that helps</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I keep getting syntax errors on the "print([*zip(*the_tags)])" when i try to run it  nevermind, fixed it</span>
<span class="comment-copy">So, i ran it and its giving me the same thing i was trying to fix.. if u run "print(result[0])" it will give you a list of all the dates, instead of the first date alone.. and "print(result[1])" gives you all the names</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I am guessing you are using Python 2.  When you <i>fixed</i> it I am also guessing, that the change you made was not what you were expecting.  I have made an edit which should work on both Python 2 and Python 3</span>
<span class="comment-copy">all i did to fix it was run it on python 3, which gave me the result above</span>
<span class="comment-copy">So if the result above it not what you want then I do not understand what you want...</span>
