<p>Let's say we have a list: x = [5, 5, 2, 5, 5, 3, 3, 4, 4]. How can I return the number which happens only once in this list, i.e. 2?</p>
<p>This question was asked while trying to solve the <a href="https://www.codewars.com/kata/54da5a58ea159efa38000836" rel="nofollow noreferrer">"Find the odd int"</a> problem on Codewars. Initially I did not understand correctly the task, but could have solved it much easier, so read it carefully before solving :)</p>
<p>Finally following code was used to solve it (it's <strong>not entire solution</strong>, but the part of it, which is used after creating the dictionary out of the input):</p>
<pre><code>return [int(k) for k,v in d.items() if v%2==1][0]
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; x = [5, 5, 2, 5, 5, 3, 3, 4, 4, 8]
&gt;&gt;&gt; from collections import Counter
&gt;&gt;&gt; c = Counter(x)
&gt;&gt;&gt; [item[0] for item in c.items() if item[1]==1]
[2, 8]
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You may use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.Counter" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><strong><code>collections.Counter</code></strong></a> to achieve this. Below <em>list comprehension</em> will return list of all elements which occurred once in your list:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from collections import Counter
&gt;&gt;&gt; x = [5, 5, 2, 5, 5, 3, 3, 4, 4]

&gt;&gt;&gt; [k for k, v in Counter(x).items() if v==1]
[2]
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">@the.salman.a: Not really - that's for when you already know which item you want to count. As the top answer states, performance becomes terrible if you count all the items in the list.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">what have you  tried so far to solve your problem.Stack overflow is not a free coding service. You have to show your effort too.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@TimPietzcker: counting all the items in a list can trivially be done in O(N) time, using the right approach.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It was just a part of another task. I tried, but could not find the same  question.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@VikasDamodar, I did not know about the Counter collection and tried to solve this with standard for loop and if... else procedure</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It's not safe to assume they know there will be only one item that has one occurrence.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Alex: Yes, better make the solution more general.</span>
