<p>I have to implement a class called <code>Marathon</code>. In the creator a have to declare a dictionary with key 'runner' and value 'time'. I declare the dictionary in the creator. Then when I try to use that dictionary in the register method an error appear <code>NameError: name 'my_marathon' is not defined</code>. Can someone tell me how I access to that dictionary from my register method?</p>
<pre><code>class Marathon:

    def __init__(self):
        """Set up this marathon without any runners."""
        my_marathon = {'runner', 'time'}


    def register(self, runner):
        """Register the runner. Return nothing."""

        my_marathon['runner'] = runner
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>class Runner:
    def __init__(self):
        self.time = -1

    def set_time(self, time):
        self.time = time


class Marathon:

    def __init__(self):
        """Set up this marathon without any runners."""
        self.runners = []


    def register(self, runner):
        """Register the runner. Return nothing."""

        self.runners.append(runner)
</code></pre>
<p>Use <code>self</code> to reference instance variables.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">As written, you can't - it's a local in <code>__init__</code>, it gets dereferenced as soon as the method ends. You should read up on basic Python OOP - what you want is an <i>attribute</i>. See e.g. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#a-first-look-at-classes" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#a-first-look-at-classes</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for your answer. I've fixed that but now another error appears:                                                                                                   AttributeError: 'Marathon' object has no attribute 'my_marathon'</span>
