<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have an infinity loop, where I send some request, and I wanna send an element of list from the first to the last and over and over again.
Example:</p>
<pre><code>my_list = ['a', 'b', 'c']
while True:
    myfunc(my_list)
    '''
    first iterate: 'a',
    second iterate: 'b', third iterate: 'c',
    fourth iterate: 'a', and so on.
    '''
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.cycle" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>itertools.cycle</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>from itertools import cycle

my_list = ['a', 'b', 'c']
for element in cycle(my_list):
    print(element)

# output: a b c a b c a b c ...
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Use the % operator</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You could shift/rotate the list and always use the first element. See: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2150108/efficient-way-to-shift-a-list-in-python" title="efficient way to shift a list in python">stackoverflow.com/questions/2150108/…</a></span>

<span class="comment-copy">How can I use it in an infinity loop? Something like:  <code>while True: send_request(list)</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@JoeDoe This <i>is</i> an infinite loop. I'm not sure I understand the problem.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I start an infinity loop, where I get some news, and comment that article with each one element (from the first to the last)</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>cycle(my_list)</code> is an infinite source of values; you don't necessarily need an infinite <i>loop</i> to use it. Let <code>x = cycle(my_list)</code>. Each time you call <code>next(x)</code>, you'll get a value: <code>a</code>, then <code>b</code>, then <code>c</code>, then <code>a</code>, then <code>b</code>, etc.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@JoeDoe Ok? I really can't see the problem. Which part of my code is preventing you from doing all of that? If you have any additional requirements that my code doesn't fulfill, please explain those requirements in detail - and not in the comments here, but in your question.</span>
