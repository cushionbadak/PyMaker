<p>I have been using <code>ls = f.mlsd()</code> to get list of files and timestamp from ftp but it gives me</p>
<pre><code>ftplib.error_perm: 500 Unknown command
</code></pre>
<p>Is there any problem with ftp server? do i need to install anything on the server to get this command working</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>In the fact, MLSD is nothing but a protocol extension introduced in RFC 3659 that may be not supported by some FTP servers. If you care about portability, it's better to use <code>f.nlst()</code> instead.</p>
<p>If changing something on server is acceptable for you, then I suggest you switching to proftpd which has MLSD support as a part of it's mod_facts extension.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>MLSD</code> command was not a part of an original FTP standard. It was added only later in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3659" rel="nofollow noreferrer">RFC 3659</a>, in 2007. While that's still quite some time ago, even now some major FTP servers do not support it. Particularly IIS and vsftpd.</p>
<p>If you need timestamps and yet you need to talk to a server that does not support <code>MLSD</code> command, you have two options:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ftplib.html#ftplib.FTP.dir" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>FTP.dir</code></a> (<code>LIST</code> command). And parse proprietary format of file listing to retrieve the timestamps. </p></li>
<li><p>Use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ftplib.html#ftplib.FTP.nlst" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>FTP.nlst</code></a> to retrieve a list of files (and folders). Then, use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ftplib.html#ftplib.FTP.voidcmd" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>FTP.voidcmd</code></a> to send <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3659#section-3" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>MDTM</code> command</a> for each of the listed files. <code>MDTM</code> returns a file timestamp in a standardized format.</p>
<p>Obviously this is a way less effective than the previous approach, but you won't have to deal with a proprietary formats of directory listings.</p>
<p>Note that <code>MDTM</code> is not supported by all FTP servers either, but it is more widely supported than <code>MLSD</code>, although both commands come from the same RFC (3659). Particularly one of common Linux FTP servers, vsftpd, supports <code>MDTM</code>, but not <code>MLSD</code>.</p></li>

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for your remark, I updated my answer accordingly.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">nlst does not gives the timestamp</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks i have switched to proftpd with mod_facts extension and MLSD command works fine now</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I have tried MDTM but each file name has to be sent to the ftp server Let me try with LIST</span>
<span class="comment-copy">In know, I wrote that in my answer.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Can u please give me a example for 1st method can i use ftp.dir()</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That's quite broad. What particular problem are you having? There's no generic example. As my answer says, the format of response of <code>LIST</code> command is proprietary. We do not know anything about your server.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I have tried LIST and nlst but its not working but for some other servers its working</span>
