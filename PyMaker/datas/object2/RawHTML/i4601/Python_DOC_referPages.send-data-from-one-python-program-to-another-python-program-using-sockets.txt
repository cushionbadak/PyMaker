<p>Hello fellow programmers! I'm trying to send a string from one python 3 program on my laptop to another python 3 program on my other laptop.</p>
<p>I think I have searched the whole web for tutorials on using sockets but they don't seem to solve my problem what so ever. I found helpful answers here on stackoverflow, but unfortunately didn't do trick.</p>
<p>How would I send a message like this: "Test message 123" to my other laptop?</p>
<p>I tried this </p>
<pre><code># Save as server.py
# Message Receiver
import os
from socket import *
host = ""
port = 13000
buf = 1024
addr = (host, port)
UDPSock = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM)
UDPSock.bind(addr)
print "Waiting to receive messages..."
while True:
    (data, addr) = UDPSock.recvfrom(buf)
    print "Received message: " + data
    if data == "exit":
        break
UDPSock.close()
os._exit(0)


# Save as client.py
# Message Sender
import os
from socket import *
host = "192.168.2.118" # set to IP address of target computer
port = 13000
addr = (host, port)
UDPSock = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM)
while True:
    data = input("Enter message to send or type 'exit': ")
    UDPSock.sendto(data, addr)
    if data == "exit":
        break
UDPSock.close()
os._exit(0)
</code></pre>

<p>Start server on your machine 1
Start client on your machine 2</p>
<p>Make sure they are connected to the same network and you can ping one machine from the other.</p>
<p>Be sure you use the port which is open for such connectivity purpose.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">How don't Sockets solve your problem? What have you tried?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm sure that sockets will solve my problem, just seems don't know how to set it up probably.  I treid making a server.py and client.py</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You'll need to narrow your question down, as using Sockets is quite broad. Post your attempt here as an <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve">Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example</a>, and explain what specifically you need help with.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you when client.py treis to send the message I get an error saying: "TypeError: a bytes-like object is required, not 'str'"</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MaltheHaveMusaeus you'll have to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.encode" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>encode</code></a> to bytes</span>
