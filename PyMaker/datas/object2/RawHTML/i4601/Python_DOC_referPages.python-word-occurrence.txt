<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I'm trying to open and read a text file and count the number of types a word occurs for example if the word better is in the text it would have a frequency of 8. I have attached the code below. I got the following error</p>
<blockquote>
<p>UnicodeDecodeError:  'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0x97 in position 861: invalid start byte</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>file=open('IntroductoryCS.txt')

wordcount={}

for word in file.read().split():
        if word not in wordcount:
           wordcount[word] = 1
        else:
           wordcount[word] += 1

for k,v in wordcount.items():
      print k, v

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>It seems that you IntroductoryCS.txt is not in UTF-8.</p>
<p>You should change encoding in open() function.</p>
<p>Something like this:</p>
<pre><code>file=open('IntroductoryCS.txt', encoding='&lt;your_encoding_here&gt;')
</code></pre>
<p>See documentation <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<p>I don't know what encoding is your file but try this:</p>
<pre><code>file=open('IntroductoryCS.txt', encoding='latin-1')
</code></pre>
<p>Here are avalaible <a href="https://docs.python.org/2.4/lib/standard-encodings.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">encodings</a>.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Your code is working fine.</p>
<p>Try to save the txt file as <code>UTF-8</code>. Open the file on notepad, then save as, and choose encoding <code>UTF-8</code>.</p>
