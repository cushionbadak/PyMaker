<p>Is there a way for opencv function of <code>cv2.VideoCapture()</code> to work with raspiCam. I currently own a raspberry pi 3 model B and it has opencv version 2.4.9.1 installed on it. I did recently come across a post on stack overflow that mentioned that <code>cv2.VideoCapture()</code> only works for USB plugged in cameras but is it possible for it work with <code>raspiCam(Camera Module V2)</code>? </p>

<p>If I understand correctly, you can use <code>picamera</code>.</p>
<p>Check out <a href="https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/03/30/accessing-the-raspberry-pi-camera-with-opencv-and-python/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this guide</a>, it should do the trick. You can probably skip the virtualenv stuff but it's good practice.</p>
