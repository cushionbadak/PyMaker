<p>What is special about <code>[]</code>? I would expect this to raise a <code>SyntaxError</code> too. Why doesn't it? I've observed this behavior in Python2 and Python3.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-del-statement"><code>del</code> statement syntax</a> allows for a <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#grammar-token-target_list"><code>target_list</code></a>, and that includes a list or tuple of variable names.</p>
<p>It is intended for deleting several names at once:</p>
<pre><code>del [a, b, c]
</code></pre>
<p>which is the equivalent of:</p>
<pre><code>del (a, b, c)
</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code>del a, b, c
</code></pre>
<p>But python does not enforce the list to actually have <em>any</em> elements.</p>
<p>The expression</p>
<pre><code>del ()
</code></pre>
<p>on the other hand <em>is</em> a syntax error; <code>()</code> is seen as a literal empty tuple in that case.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">In the same fashion: <code>[] = ()</code> works, but <code>"" = ""</code> doesn't</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you for the explanation, something interesting to note though is that <code>del ()</code> gives us <code>SyntaxError: can't delete ()</code> instead of <code>SyntaxError: can't delete literal</code>, which might mean it is checked separately. For some reason it does not check that for lists. :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">But in the docs, neither <code>target</code> nor <code>target_list</code> can be empty. Seems quite odd the Syntax error for <code>()</code> but not for <code>[]</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Maybe this is an implementation thing?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@frb: it's the parser that gives those errors; and I am 90% certain that's because parenthesis also can group expressions together, not just create tuples.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Probably the docs are wrong: <code>target</code> can contain starred expressions, but yet you can't do <code>del a, *b</code>. Also <code>target_list</code> must contain at least one <code>target</code> and <code>[]</code> is not a valid target just the way <code>()</code> isn't also</span>
