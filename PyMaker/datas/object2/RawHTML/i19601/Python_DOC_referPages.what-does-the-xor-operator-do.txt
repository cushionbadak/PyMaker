<p>What mathematical operation does XOR perform?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>XOR is a binary operation, it stands for "exclusive or", that is to say the resulting bit evaluates to one if only exactly <em>one</em> of the bits is set.</p>
<p>This is its function table:</p>
<pre><code>a | b | a ^ b
--|---|------
0 | 0 | 0
0 | 1 | 1
1 | 0 | 1
1 | 1 | 0
</code></pre>
<p>This operation is performed between every two corresponding bits of a number.</p>
<p>Example: <code>7 ^ 10</code><br/>
In binary: <code>0111 ^ 1010</code></p>
<pre><code>  0111
^ 1010
======
  1101 = 13
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Properties:</strong> The operation is commutative, associative and self-inverse.</p>
<p>It is also the same as addition modulo 2.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>^</code> <em>is</em> the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#binary-bitwise-operations" rel="noreferrer">Python bitwise XOR operator</a>. It is how you spell <code>XOR</code> in python:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; 0 ^ 0
0
&gt;&gt;&gt; 0 ^ 1
1
&gt;&gt;&gt; 1 ^ 0
1
&gt;&gt;&gt; 1 ^ 1
0
</code></pre>
<p>XOR stands for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or" rel="noreferrer">exclusive OR</a>. It is used in cryptography because it let's you 'flip' the bits using a mask in a reversable operation:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; 10 ^ 5
15
&gt;&gt;&gt; 15 ^ 5
10
</code></pre>
<p>where <code>5</code> is the mask; <em>(input XOR mask) XOR mask</em> gives you the input again.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">THANK YOU!! I wish I had asked earlier - nearly drove myself mad this morning. Thank you for ensuring me a much more pleasant afternoon!!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Man, that is really so very simple! I'm working through understanding hash algorithms more and this is a very constant operation among many of them.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The truth table speaks the truth - and in conversation I usually describe XOR (eXclusive-OR, sometimes also known as EOR) as 'either A or B, but not both or neither'.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you!!! You and the other respondent have surely saved my sanity for the day --- I simply could NOT figure it out and it was so un-google-able.</span>
