<p>I'm trying learn TDD in python. Unfortunately I have not found any PEPs about unittest.</p>
<ol>
<li>Does one subclass of unittest.TestCase should contain all tests about one tested function?</li>
<li>What are the recommendations for naming classes, methods or test-files?</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I usually make one class that handles the setup and tearing down for a particular test topic and subclass it for every single test. That is, one class for every test, with a name that conveys what is being tested. Nothing fancy.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">The documentation has <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#organizing-test-code" rel="nofollow noreferrer">a bit</a> about that. And I guess the <a href="http://hg.python.org/cpython/file/default/Lib/test" rel="nofollow noreferrer">source</a> has some good example for unittests.</span>
