<p>How do I run the following in Python?</p>
<pre><code>/some/path/and/exec arg &gt; /dev/null
</code></pre>
<p>I got this:</p>
<pre><code>call(["/some/path/and/exec","arg"])
</code></pre>
<p>How do I insert the output of the <code>exec</code> process to <code>/dev/null</code> and keep the print output of my python process as usual? As in, don't redirect everything to stdout?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>For Python 3.3 and later, just use <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.DEVNULL" rel="nofollow"><code>subprocess.DEVNULL</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>call(["/some/path/and/exec","arg"], stdout=DEVNULL, stderr=DEVNULL)
</code></pre>
<p>Note that this redirects both <code>stdout</code> and <code>stderr</code>. If you only wanted to redirect <code>stdout</code> (as your <code>sh</code> line implies you might), leave out the <code>stderr=DEVNULL</code> part.</p>
<p>If you need to be compatible with older versions, you can use <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/os.html#os.devnull" rel="nofollow"><code>os.devnull</code></a>. So, this works for everything from 2.6 on (including 3.3):</p>
<pre><code>with open(os.devnull, 'w') as devnull:
    call(["/some/path/and/exec","arg"], stdout=devnull, stderr=devnull)
</code></pre>
<p>Or, for 2.4 and later (still including 3.3):</p>
<pre><code>devnull = open(os.devnull, 'w')
try:
    call(["/some/path/and/exec","arg"], stdout=devnull, stderr=devnull)
finally:
    devnull.close()
</code></pre>
<p>Before 2.4, there was no <code>subprocess</code> module, so that's as far back as you can reasonably go.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You probably meant <code>&gt; /dev/null</code> in your <code>sh</code> equivalent, not <code>&lt; /dev/null</code>, which would redirect <code>stdin</code>, not <code>stdout</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Great thanks...but if I use the 2.7 solution will it still work with 3.x?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user1432779: Yes. I'll put full compatibility details in.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks..but I think I have a problem..I'm trying to write a script on the server that would start another server..however when I run it through the shell on the process I get after a few seconds :Exception AttributeError: "'Popen' object has no attribute '<i>child_created'" in &lt;bound method Popen.__del_</i> of &lt;subprocess.Popen object at 0xed9790&gt;&gt; ignored {ans:0}</span>
<span class="comment-copy">In other words it can't run the process :-( as it doesnt appear on ps -A ..</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user1432779: I don't understand what you're saying. What do you mean "when I run it through the shell on the process"? If you have a new problem that's too hard to explain in a comment, create a new question, or edit your existing one.</span>
