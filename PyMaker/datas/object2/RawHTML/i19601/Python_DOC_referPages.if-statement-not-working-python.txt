<p>This code asks user for choice of 1 or 2. If 1, then blahblah; if 2 then blahblah. If neither, then repeat until 1 or 2 is entered. Program does not accept 1 or 2, instead going straight to 'else' and repeating input question to enter 1 or 2.</p>
<pre><code>def optionType ():         # pick option

#pdb.set_trace()

    option = ''
    print ('Which slice option do you want, even slice (1) or leftover(2)? ')
    input (option)

    if option == '1':
        evenSlice()        #includes decimal

<p>You need to store the return value of the <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input" rel="nofollow"><code>input()</code> function</a>:</p>
<pre><code>option = input('Which slice option do you want, even slice (1) or leftover(2)? ')
</code></pre>
<p>The function argument is the text you want to display, not the variable you want to receive the user input.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>you need to store the option</p>
<p><code>option = input('Which slice option do you want? even slice (1) or leftover(2)?')</code></p></li>
</ol>
<p>And if you are on Python2 ( but not Python3 ) :</p>
<ol>
<li><p>when you do that, if someone passes in 1, it will be an int, not a string.</p>
<p><code>if option == 1:</code></p></li>
<li><p>so <code>input</code> will cause an error if a letter is typed in [ <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#input" rel="nofollow">http://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#input</a> ] , you probably want <code>raw_input</code></p>

<span class="comment-copy">Step one: print <code>option</code>. Step two: look at what's printed (in this case, option wasn't assigned the input which becomes fairly obvious using this basic method of debugging). Posting on SO should be step 42 or something :p</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Are you using Python 2 or 3?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@BurhanKhalid: I would guess 3 based on the <code>print('Enter...</code> statement (though that doesn't guarantee anything)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yeah, because it would work just fine in 2.x as well.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@BurhanKhalid: judging by the other questions asked by this user so far, it's Python 3.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Well, that's step one, but the <code>if</code> still won't work because he'll end up comparing a string to an int.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@BurhanKhalid -- Not in python3.x (which based on the parens with print is a valid possibility)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@BurhanKhalid: Only in Python 2. In Python 3 it's a string..</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Is that so...darn, thought I had you there Maritjn :P</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>raw_input</code> is Python 2 only. The OP appears to be using Python 3, where <code>input()</code> returns a string, always.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">i didn't know that about python3. thanks!  impossible to tell what the OP is using though.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Well, looking at the other questions the OP asked, where a python version is given it's Python 3.</span>
