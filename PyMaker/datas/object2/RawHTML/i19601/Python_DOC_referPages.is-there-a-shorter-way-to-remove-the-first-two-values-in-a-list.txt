<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I want to find the sum of a list not including the first two values:</p>
<pre><code>values.remove(min(values))

values.remove(min(values))

avg = sum(values) / len(values)
</code></pre>
<p>Is there a simpler way to do this?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Yes, it can be. </p>
<pre><code>qAvg = sum(sorted(qList)[2:])/1
</code></pre>
<p><code>sorted</code> gives you a sorted list, and <code>[2:]</code> is a list <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#slice" rel="nofollow">slice</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>may be try this:</p>
<pre><code>qAvg=sum(sorted(qList)[2:])/(len(qList)-2)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Depending upon what you intended to achieve, you can also look forward to use heapq module</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; qList = [randint(1,100) for _ in range(10)]
&gt;&gt;&gt; import heapq
&gt;&gt;&gt; heapq.heapify(qList)
&gt;&gt;&gt; sum(heapq.nsmallest(len(qList) - 2, qList))/(len(qList) - 2)
50

<span class="comment-copy">What is that you intend to perform?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why do you divide by 1?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">And why would you divide by 1?</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>sum(qList)/1 == sum(qList)</code>?? Isn't it?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I think he meant <code>sum(qList)\len(qList)</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">thanks this will work</span>
<span class="comment-copy">and thanks for leaving the /1 lol</span>
<span class="comment-copy">+1 for looking at the variable name!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@downvoter care you explain your serial downvotes?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">He wanted less lines, not more.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@frb: Less line is not always Pythonic.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@frb That doesn't make it a good idea. The OP doesn't always know what is a good idea, and while I feel this answer could use more explanation and comparison as a method, it's valid.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Abhijit &amp; Lattyware â€” I'm well aware. That doesn't change that the question stills asks if it can be done in a shorter way.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@frb A -1 means, from the hover text itself, that "This answer was not <i>useful</i>." - something different to exactly what the OP asks for can be useful.</span>
