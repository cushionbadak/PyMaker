<p>Using Python, I'm reading lines from a Logfile produced by a Firefox extension. One of the inputs in the log is a number that represents the value returned by Event.keycode() that has been used on a keyup event.</p>
<p>While reading the loglines, I want to convert those keycode values to the char they're representing. </p>
<p>Example logfile line:</p>
<pre><code>1338899783924,keyup,[object HTMLInputElement],true,true,false,undefined,undefined,undefined,undefined,16,undefined,false,undefined,undefined,undefined,false
</code></pre>
<p>In this case the 16 is the value returned by Event.keycode</p>
<p>Solved this problem already in Java using a scriptengine and converting the value with javascript. Maybe that could be used for python, too?</p>
<p><em>Note:</em>
Python only, the data is already gathered and there is no changing the extension or w/e</p>

<p>What about this, assuming the keycode is a Unicode code point ?</p>
<pre><code>chr(int(line.split(",")[10]))
</code></pre>
