<p>I've encountered a problem, which I guess is some sort of bug in either Python, my computer/windows, or both.</p>
<p>So far it hasn't been a problem to me and I haven't even known it's not supposed to happen.</p>
<p>When slicing a list out of it's index, value of <code>[]</code> should be returned:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; l = [1, 2, 3]
&gt;&gt;&gt; l[5:]
[]
</code></pre>
<p>And this does indeed work on my mac and on my friend's computer as it's supposed to.</p>
<p>However, when I'm on my PC (Windows 7 Home Premium 64bit, Finnish), I get <code>IndexError: list index out of range</code></p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; l = [1, 2, 3]
&gt;&gt;&gt; l[5:]
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;pyshell#2&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
    l[5:]
IndexError: list index out of range
</code></pre>
<p>I've got both Python 3.3.0 and 2.7.3, it works fine on 2.7.3 but the error raises on 3.3.0. I already tried reinstalling both versions, no effect. Python documentation also says it shouldn't raise an error on Python 3: <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#IndexError" rel="nofollow">http://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#IndexError</a></p>
<p>I can easily work my way around it with a simple <code>if len(l) &gt;= 2</code>, but I'd rather not use something which should not be needed.</p>
<p>Didn't find much from google, was wondering if anyone else is encountering the same, and if there's a solution to this? Or should I perhaps contact the python developers?</p>

<p>No. I'm unable to reproduce this error on a Win7 64bit Python 3.3.0 installation. In the command shell as well as in IDLE, the behaviour I see is exactly as expected.</p>

<p>Please provide more details about any changes you might have made to your environment.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You tested this is IDLE I suspect (<code>pyshell</code> is part of IDLE). Can you try in the normal python prompt (open CMD, run python 3.3 from the command line, try again).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I tried this in IDLE 2.7 and 3.3, and neither showed this behavior.  We'll need more clues as to exactly what environment Mahi is using.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MartijnPieters Seems to work fine on cmd... Got <code>[]</code>, so the problem is within my IDLE?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Mahi: looks like it, but others with IDLE on 3.3 on Windows have not reproduced your problem, so it's not just IDLE itself.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That's weird. Your CPU model? and language locale? Try <code>dis.dis('l=[1,2,3];l[5:]')</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>pyshell</code> points to IDLE. It thus theoretically could be a bug in IDLE.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MartijnPieters: Ah, thanks. Well, I get the exact same result in IDLE on my Python 3.3.0 64bit Win7 installation.</span>
