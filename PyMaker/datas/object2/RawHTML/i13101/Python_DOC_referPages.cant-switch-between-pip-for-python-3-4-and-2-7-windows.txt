<p>I have python 3.4 installed on my windows for a while but now I need to get 2.7 to work another project. I downloaded the 2.7.10 package from the official python and installed it. Everything was fine until I tried to install packages using pip.</p>
<p>What I have read in different places is that pip-2.7 should work but the command is not recognized. If I get get-pip.py to try to install pip using py get-pip.py it tells me it's already installed.</p>
<p>So is there anyway to get this working?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>py -2   -m pip install SomePackage  # default Python 2</p>
<p>py -2.7 -m pip install SomePackage  # specifically Python 2.7</p>
<p>py -3   -m pip install SomePackage  # default Python 3</p>
<p>py -3.4 -m pip install SomePackage  # specifically Python 3.4</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So in your case you'll need either of the two:</p>
<pre><code>py -2   -m pip install SomePackage  # default Python 2
py -2.7 -m pip install SomePackage  # specifically Python 2.7
</code></pre>
