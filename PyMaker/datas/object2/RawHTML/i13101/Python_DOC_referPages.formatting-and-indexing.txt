<p>I need to create a  formatted table that tracks the value of the investment per year (year in one column and principal in another). I can't use graphics because i don't know how to. I just need them to line up under each category. plus i don't know how to loop to find the consecutive years and their amounts. Here's what I wrote:</p>
<pre><code>def main ():
    print ("This program calculates the future value")
    print ("of an investment over a period of time")

    principal = eval(input("Enter the initial principal: "))
    apr = eval(input("Enter the annual interest rate: "))
    years= eval(input("Enter the number of years to maturity: "))

    for i in range(years):
        principal = principal * (1+ apr/100)


    print("Initial principal is", principal)
    print("Initial interest rate is {0:.2f}%".format(apr /100))


    print("Year, " ", Principal")
    print("{0:2.2f}".format(principal))

main ()
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Would it be better to write this to a file instead?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I don't even know how to do that, we haven't learned that yet.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I didn't ask someone to do hwk for me, I was asking for help. There's a difference. it's not like I submitted a question with nothing. I showed what I had done so far and just need some help to show where I went wrong. and you're not compelled to answer.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm sure that's not how you meant it. We  are all still learning and I hope my code helped. Was it what you were looking for?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm going to run it and see</span>
<span class="comment-copy">yeah it was but why did u do print str(i) and putting the print statement before the loop creates the "table format"? versus putting it after like I did? and what does \t mean? Im just asking for clarification so i know what to do next time</span>
