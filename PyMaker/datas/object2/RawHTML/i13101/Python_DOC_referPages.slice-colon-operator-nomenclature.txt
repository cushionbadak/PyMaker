<p>Is the colon <code>:</code>, when used in slices in Python, called anything special? Other than, say, the slightly medicinal sounding <em>"colon operator"</em>?</p>
<pre><code>x = s[:5]
    # ^ this character
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">I'm not sure I've ever heard it referred to as anything in particular, and it's not named in <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/reference/expressions.html#slicings" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the language reference</a>. It's incorrect to call it an operator, though; it's just a delimiter for the bounds and stride.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It's normally just called a colon. I guess you could call it a "slice colon" if you want to be specific. It's not actually an operator, it's a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html?delimiters#delimiters" rel="nofollow noreferrer">delimiter</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Maybe <code>slice delimiter</code>.</span>
