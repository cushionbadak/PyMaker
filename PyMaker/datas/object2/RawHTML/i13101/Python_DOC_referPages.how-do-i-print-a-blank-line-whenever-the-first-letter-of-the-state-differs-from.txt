<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I am given a list of states as a <code>.txt</code> file. I was able to read each line, stripping off newline character and append data to <code>states_list</code>, but I also need to print a blank line whenever the first letter of the current state differs from the previous state's first letter. </p>
<p>Here is what I have tried:</p>
<pre><code>states_list = []
n = 0

with open('states.txt', 'r') as f:
    for line in f:
        state = line.strip('\n')
        states_list.append(state)

for each in states_list:
    if states_list[n][0] != states_list[n+1][0]:
        print("\n")
    print(each)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you need to compare with other members, don't use the for-each loop.</p>
<pre><code>for i in range(len(states_list)):
     if i &gt; 0:
         if states_list[i][0] != states_list[i-1][0]:
             print('\n')
     print(states_list[i])
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Another way of going about this is to use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#zip" rel="nofollow"><code>zip()</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>with open('states.txt', 'r') as f:
    states = [line.strip('\n') for line in f]

for a, b in zip(states, states[1:]):
    if a[0] != b[0]:
        print("\n")
    print(a)
print(states[-1])
</code></pre>
<p>In the end, it produces the same result as jeff carey's answer, but perhaps in a more Pythonic/elegant way.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">The OP signed up today and this is the OPs first post. WHY SO MANY DOWN-VOTES???</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why downvotes? Because it's a code dump with no actual question. Such "questions" show no research effort and are neither clear nor useful, which describes the criteria for a downvote.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">And the OP clearly did not read "<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask">How do I ask a good question?</a>" before asking his/her question.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Using this method, first element won't be printed.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Good catch, fixed now.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you! And I learned about zip( ) for the first time, as well!</span>
