<p>I'm just new to Python and I want to ask:</p>
<p>How can I process input values from command line with Python? For example:</p>
<p>./mathpy.py <em>--plus</em> <strong>2</strong> <strong>5</strong></p>
<p>result: <strong>7</strong></p>
<p>or </p>
<p>./mathpy.py --max <strong>2</strong> <strong>5</strong></p>
<p>result: <strong>5</strong></p>
<p>Some examples would be great.</p>
<p>Thanks a lot.</p>
