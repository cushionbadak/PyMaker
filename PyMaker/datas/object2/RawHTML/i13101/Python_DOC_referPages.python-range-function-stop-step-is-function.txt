<p>Simple question that likely due to keywords, lead to an explanation on the function itself rather than clarification on whether or not the following is the case:</p>
<p>When using the range function to loop, with a function as the stop step, 
e.g. </p>
<pre><code>for item in range(some_function()):
    #do something
</code></pre>
<p>is the result of the function call stored for use or evaluated at each step?</p>
<p>I'd imagine its the former but it agitates that I can't confirm.</p>

<p>There is nothing special about <code>range</code> here.  The behavior is defined in <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-for-statement" rel="nofollow">the language reference</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The expression list is evaluated once</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The "expression list" is the part after the <code>in</code> (i.e., <code>range(some_function())</code> in your example).  No matter what is there, it is only evaluated once.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I did spend some time doing exactly that, I was just looking in the wrong place. docs for the <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-for-statement" rel="nofollow noreferrer">for</a> statement should have been the place I looked as @BrenBarn illustrated.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">FWIW, you can easily test stuff like this. Eg, <code>def f(): print('in f'); return 5</code>. Now see what <code>for i in range(f()):</code> does.</span>
