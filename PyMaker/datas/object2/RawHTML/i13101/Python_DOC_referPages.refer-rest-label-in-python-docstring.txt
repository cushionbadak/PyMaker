<p>I want to refer to reST label in my python method docstring and am expecting Sphinx to generate appropriate links.</p>
<p>I tried the following which does not work for me.</p>
<h2>myown.rst</h2>
<pre><code>.. my-label:
   Some explanation ...
</code></pre>
<h2>mymodule.py</h2>
<pre><code>def somefunc():
    """ See :ref:`my-label`. """
    ... rest of the code ...
</code></pre>
<p></p>
<p>This produces "See my-label" as text in the generated html file while I am expecting it to create appropriate hyper-link.</p>
<p>I see this kind of references in python-docs (e.g. see <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#classmethod" rel="nofollow">https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#classmethod</a> ) and reference to Function definitions (which is generic explanation). However, this is not generated from docstrings (as can be seen from funcobject.c) .. so I am inclined to think that it is handcrafted rst !! </p>

<p>Based on comment from @mzjn - the section header was missing in the rst file. Adding that and regenerating fixes the issue. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">Try using single quotes <code>:ref:'my-label'</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Pynchia. No luck. single quote (" ' ") or back quote(" ' ") still generates a string.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Simple typo, it seems... The label is missing an underscore. It should be <code>.. _my-label:</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@mzjn. Thanks for pointing that out. My bad while adding the question. However, that does not help. Sphinx still generates a string and not a link.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Do you see any warnings from Sphinx? It looks like your label is not placed before a section title. See <a href="http://sphinx-doc.org/markup/inline.html#role-ref" rel="nofollow noreferrer">sphinx-doc.org/markup/inline.html#role-ref</a></span>
