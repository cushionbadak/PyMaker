<p>I am searching for an algorithm, which gets user input with a few numbers and then the result should be the sum of all those numbers printed on the console.<br/>
I know how to make the list and print it, but I can't select each number and add them together to get a final result. </p>
<pre><code>costs = input('Enter the exspenses: ')                                      
costlist = costs.split()                                                    
for each_number in costlist:                                                  
  total = (int(costlist.index(each_number))+1)+                                
  print()
</code></pre>
<p>I know that something doesn't need to be here and that the total string isn't finished, but I think I'm somewhere close to the solution.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>To calculate your total, just use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#sum" rel="nofollow"><code>sum()</code></a> built-in function like this:</p>
<pre><code>costs = input('Enter the exspenses: ')
costlist = costs.split()
costlist = [int(i) for i in costlist]
total = sum(costlist)
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Or <code>sum([int(i) for i in costs.split()])</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">You might as well want to check if <code>i</code> can be casted to an integer. Depending on the user's input, the program might fail.</span>
