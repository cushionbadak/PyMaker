<p>You are asking, "I have a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary has a key <code>"name"</code>. How do I get a list of values of all those keys?"</p>
<h2>Basics</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Access list elements using an index in brackets. <code>a[0]</code> is the first element of a list.</p></li>
<li><p>Access dictionary values using the key in brackets. <code>a["name"]</code> is <code>this_value</code> from <code>{"name":this_value}</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Aggregate values with a loop like so:</p>
<pre><code>aggregator = []
for item in a_list:
    aggregator.append(value_calculated_from(item))
</code></pre></li>
</ul>
<h2>Problems with question</h2>
<p><code>your_list</code> doesn't have the square brackets paired up. </p>
<p>I'll suppose </p>
<pre><code>outer_dictionary = your_list[0]
list_of_dictionaries = outer_dictionary['tr']
</code></pre>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>You can get the list of values of "name":</p>
<pre><code>names = []
for dictionary in list_of_dictionaries:
    if "name" in dictionary:
        names.append(dictionary["name"])
</code></pre>

<p>I see your data was not formatted completely(before editing)- so i would go for regex-Below code extracts all name from the supplied json <strong>STRING</strong>(just enclose """""")</p>
<pre><code>import re
data="""[{
  "tr": [{
      "name": "#For5Rs",
      "promoted_content": null,

<span class="comment-copy">So any problem?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Did you try anything or google anything?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Please edit your question and add what have you tried so far and the error that you got. Also we need more info about your question, is that just a list or json data?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Learn about <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Json module</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">can you give a code to get all value of name in tr list</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Did you tell OP about how to covert json data to Python object?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Kevin-Guan, I read his comment to mean he had done that already with loads(). Afzal, are you asking how to get this data into a Python variable or how to extract the "name" values once the JSON is in a variable?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, I think he knows about that. But if you're going to post a full answer, the full solution about the problem is needed.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">And I think you're doing right, OP wants extract some values by keys from the dict that in the list.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Did you really understand what's the OP wants? Please see the comments.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ah! OK all inside <code>tr</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I think that OP isn't trying to do this...I'll ask OP about what's his really wants.</span>
