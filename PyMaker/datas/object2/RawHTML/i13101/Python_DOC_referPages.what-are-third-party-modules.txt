<p>In researching the tool <code>distutils</code> I stumbled on the term <em>"third-party module"</em>. What does that mean?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>A third party module is any code that has been written by a third party (neither you nor the python writers (PSF)).</p>
<p>You can use them to add functionality to your code without having to write it yourself.</p>
<p>Examples include things like <a href="http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/" rel="nofollow"><code>requests</code></a> that simplifies http requests and <a href="https://nose.readthedocs.org/en/latest/" rel="nofollow"><code>nose</code></a> that helps with unit/integration testing.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy"><i>"Third-party"</i> means any module not written by you (first party) or included in the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">standard library</a> (second party). <i>[Or maybe 1st and 2nd are the other way around, but the point stands!]</i></span>
