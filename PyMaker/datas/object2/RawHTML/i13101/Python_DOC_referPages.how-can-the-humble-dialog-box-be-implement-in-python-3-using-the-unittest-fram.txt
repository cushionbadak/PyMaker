<p>I am sure that the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">official documentation about Unit tests in Python 3</a> is  pretty straightforward and the link you posted does not show anything that could not be done with another unit testing framework. </p>
<p>If you follow the tutorial, you can find your own way to write unit tests with pyunit. </p>
<p>In regards to the question about properties, there is a whole bunch of pages you might find useful: </p>
