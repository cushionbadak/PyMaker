<p>What is wrong? How do I improve? It keeps coming up with a syntax error and I don not know why.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You're missing closing parentheses on your question lines:</p>
<pre><code>question1 = str(input("Do you know what phone you want? ")
</code></pre>
<p>Should be:</p>
<pre><code>question1 = str(input("Do you know what phone you want? "))
</code></pre>
<p>You also don't need to convert the input to a string, because <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html?highlight=input#input" rel="nofollow"><code>input()</code></a> already does that for you:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>input([prompt])
</code></pre>
<p>If the <em>prompt</em> argument is present, it is written to standard output
  without a trailing newline. The function then reads a line from input,
  converts it to a string (stripping a trailing newline), and returns
  that.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">There are several missing parenthesis. You need <code>foo = str(bar)</code>, not <code>foo = str(bar</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Although the <code>str</code> is completely unnecessary anyway.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What does the syntax error tell you? Also, you should specify what version of Python, since syntax is slightly different between 2 and 3.</span>
