<p>I'm trying to make a calculator for something, but the formulas use a sigma, I have no idea how to do a sigma in python, is there an operator for it?
Ill put a link here with a page that has the formulas on it for illustration:<a href="http://fromthedepths.gamepedia.com/User:Evil4Zerggin/Advanced_cannon" rel="nofollow">http://fromthedepths.gamepedia.com/User:Evil4Zerggin/Advanced_cannon</a></p>

<p>A sigma (∑) is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summation" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Summation</a> operator. It evaluates a certain expression many times, with slightly different variables, and returns the <strong>sum</strong> of all those expressions.</p>
<p>For example, in the <a href="http://fromthedepths.gamepedia.com/User:Evil4Zerggin/Advanced_cannon#Ballistic_coefficient" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Ballistic coefficient</a> formula</p>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fPTfk.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img alt="enter image description here" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fPTfk.png"/></a></p>
<p>The Python implementation would look something like this:</p>
<pre><code># Just guessing some values. You have to search the actual values in the wiki.
ballistic_coefficients = [0.3, 0.5, 0.1, 0.9, 0.1]

total_numerator = 0
total_denominator = 0
for i, coefficient in enumerate(ballistic_coefficients):
    total_numerator += 2**(-i) * coefficient
    total_denominator += 2**(-i)
print('Total:', total_numerator / total_denominator)
</code></pre>
<p>You may want to look at the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#enumerate" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>enumerate</code> function</a>, and beware precision problems.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I am not familiar with that form of sigma notation. Isn't there supposed to be a little "i=&lt;number&gt;" under the Σ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Kevin I'm not sure which of the many formulas on that page the OP means, but if it's sigma notation, if no indices are provided, the sum is understood to be over some expected range inferred from context. OP: look at Python's <code>sum</code> command.</span>
