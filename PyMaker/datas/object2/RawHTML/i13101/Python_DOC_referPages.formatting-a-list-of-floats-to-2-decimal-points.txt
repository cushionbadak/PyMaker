<p>I am trying to search though text to find Money EG Â£12.30 take the numbers and then sum them.I have managed to get to the point where I have a list of floats but I can't seem to get them to 2 decimal points. However like in the code below if I specify an element in the list like [0] for example then it formats that element to 2 decimal points.</p>
<p>So my question would be:
 How can I format the whole list to 2 decimal places bearing in mind I will have no idea how long the list will be.    </p>
<pre><code>import re

num_regex = re.compile(r'\d\d.\d\d')
file_name = input("Enter File Name to open: ")

text_file = open(file_name, 'r')
search_text = text_file.read()
search = num_regex.findall(search_text)
print("Numbers found:", search,)
new_search =[]
for item in search:
    new_search.append(float(item))
new_search[0] = "%.2f" % new_search[0]
print(new_search[0])
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>You use a <code>for</code> loop, iterating over your list of numbers, perhaps inside a list comprehension. Consider each of these:</p>
<pre><code>formatted_list = []
for item in new_search:
    formatted_list.append("%.2f"%item)
print("Formatted List:", formatted_list)
</code></pre>
<p>Or, equivalently:</p>
<pre><code>formatted_list = ["%.2f"%item for item in new_search]
print("Formatted List:", formatted_list)
</code></pre>
<p>Here is your entire program, using list comprehensions:</p>
<pre><code>import re

num_regex = re.compile(r'\d\d.\d\d')
file_name = input("Enter File Name to open: ")

text_file = open(file_name, 'r')
search_text = text_file.read()
search = num_regex.findall(search_text)
print("Numbers found:", search,)
new_search =[float(item) for item in search]
print("Numbers found:", new_search,)
formatted_search =["%.2f"%item for item in new_search]
print("Numbers found:", formatted_search,)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">I have started reading it but it is much more complex I am very new to programming and it can be difficult to read such texts and actually take anything useful from them because of the jargon!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Money values are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-point_arithmetic" rel="nofollow noreferrer">fixed-point</a>, not floating-point. Using floating-point arithmetic on money is not wise because of the way computers represent floating-point values, which can lead to unexpected rounding.</span>
