<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I'm sure this is an easy question but I have searched for a while to no avail. I want to define a file path as a variable and use that variable elsewhere in my python code on Ubuntu. What I have so far is:</p>
<pre><code>filefolder = '/home/Desktop/Sample Loading'
</code></pre>
<p>and I call on it later in the code as:</p>
<pre><code>file = open('%f/EventLog.txt' % (filefolder), "a")
</code></pre>
<p>When I do this, I get an error saying that a float was expected and not a string. How can I get this to work?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>use <code>file = open('%s/EventLog.txt' % (filefolder), "a")</code> with %s instead of %f</p>
<p>But you are much better off using <code>os.path.join(filefolder, 'EventLog.txt')</code></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You passed a formatter that expected a float (%f) not a string (%s). </p>
<p>You can either replace this with <code>%s/Event log.txt</code> or just concatenate it directly like so, <code>filefolder + '/Event log.txt</code>.</p>
<p>Do note that you're  better off working with <code>os</code> module directly for essentially anything to do with paths :-) </p>
<p>Will edit answer if you require further explanation as II sent this from phone. </p>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>%f</code> is the format code for <code>float</code>. Just because it's the initial for <code>file</code> doesn't mean Python can redefine the standard format string syntax to accommodate that. Read the docs for <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#printf-style-string-formatting" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>printf</code>-style formatting</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Oh, I'm assuming it's because %f means float?</span>
