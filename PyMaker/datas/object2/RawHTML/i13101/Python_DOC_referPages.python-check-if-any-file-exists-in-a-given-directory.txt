<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Given a directory as a string, how can I find if ANY file exists in it?</p>
<pre><code>os.path.isFile()       # only accepts a specific file path
os.listdir(dir) == []  # accepts sub-directories
</code></pre>
<p>My objective is to check if a path is devoid of files only (not sub-directories too).</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>To only check one specific directory, a solution like this would suffice: </p>
<pre><code>from os import listdir
from os.path import isfile, join

def does_file_exist_in_dir(path):
    return any(isfile(join(path, i)) for i in listdir(path))
</code></pre>
<p>To dissect what is happening:</p>
<ul>
<li>The method <code>does_file_exist_in_dir</code> will take your path.</li>
<li>Using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#any" rel="noreferrer">any</a> it will return True if a file is found by iterating through the contents of your path by calling a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html?highlight=listdir#os.listdir" rel="noreferrer">listdir</a> on it. Note the use of <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html#os.path.join" rel="noreferrer">join</a> for the path in order to provide a qualified filepath name to properly check. </li>
</ul>
<p>As an option, if you want to traverse through all sub-directories of a given path and check for files, you can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/os.html#os.walk" rel="noreferrer">os.walk</a> and just check to see if the level you are in contains any files like this: </p>
<pre><code>for dir, sub_dirs, files in os.walk(path):
    if not files:
        print("no files at this level")
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">In practice something like this is seldom needed since a properly written loop to process all the files of interest in a directory will just iterate 0 times if there aren't any. You want you can count them in the loop and afterward if check see how many, if any, were processed.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">There is error <code>for file in files print "as"</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@idjaw: os.walk() will go through all sub-directories. I'm only looking for one given path</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@meestaman I was actually in the process of putting together a solution for exactly that. Hold up. :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@idjaw: Sweet! Thanks :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@meestaman Solution updated.</span>
