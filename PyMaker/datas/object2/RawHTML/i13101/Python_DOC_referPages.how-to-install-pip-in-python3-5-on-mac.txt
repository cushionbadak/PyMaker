<p>I followed a video online and tried to download pip using terminal, but it doesn't work. It showed a path of python2.7, but I am actually using python3.5, is it the problem?<br/>

<p>The most simple way is to use OS X package manager called <code>brew</code>.
Install brew from your console:</p>
<pre><code>ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
</code></pre>
<p>And after: </p>
<pre><code>brew install python3.5
</code></pre>
<p>or </p>
<pre><code>brew install python3
</code></pre>

<p>Well so the problem is the default Python version is 2.   </p>
<p>There is both Python 2 and Python 3 on your machine, if you want to run Python 3 the best way is use <code>python3</code> command.</p>
<hr/>
<p>And if you want to use <code>pip</code> install a package, I think the correct way is this:</p>
<pre><code>sudo pip install requests  # or maybe pip3
</code></pre>
<p>If that doesn't work, from <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/installing/#basic-usage" rel="nofollow">the document</a> here is another useage:</p>
<pre><code>sudo python3 -m pip install requests
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Try  run command <code>python3</code>, <code>python3.5</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">you may have conflicting python installations.. ensure python2.7 is completely uninstalled</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>python3.5 -mpip install pip --upgrade</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Kevin Guan Thank you for your response, when I used "python3", it showed"Requirement already up-to-date: pip in /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.5/lib/python3.5/site-packages", but when I try"sudo pip-install requests", it still showed"sudo: pip-install: command not found"</span>
