<p>Is there any way to have a function in Python that can walk a folder with a list of files &amp; separate the list into "partitions" (which will become folders) based on total size of the files in each partition/folder in megabytes? I'm not sure how to start with this or what to do first.</p>

<p>Assuming you want a starting point, not a solution in a can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.walk" rel="nofollow"><code>os.walk</code></a> to scan a whole directory tree. If you only need to scan one folder, not a whole tree, you can optimize a bit without sacrificing simplicity (particularly on Windows) on Python 3.5 with the new <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.scandir" rel="nofollow"><code>os.scandir</code></a> function that will give you <code>stat</code> info for free on Windows (and make it accessible as a lazily cached value on *NIX systems). On earlier versions of Python, a third party <code>scandir</code> module on PyPI provides the same interface.</li>
<li>If not using <code>os.scandir</code>, you'd use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.stat" rel="nofollow"><code>os.stat</code></a> to get file sizes</li>
<li>Use a <code>collections.defaultdict(set)</code> to map from file sizes in MB to a <code>set</code> of files that round to that size (or just process the files as you go instead of storing in a container at all). Alternatively, sort with <code>sorted</code> <code>key</code>-ed on the size and use <code>itertools.groupby</code> (with whatever MB granularity you like) to group the resulting files.</li>
</ul>

<span class="comment-copy">Yes! Start with <code>import os</code>. Give it a try and let us know if you run into problems.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">(●▽● ) !! Sweet! I'll give it a college try!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is exactly what I needed, thank you! :D You even gave me the info about which Python version to use, this is very helpful.</span>
