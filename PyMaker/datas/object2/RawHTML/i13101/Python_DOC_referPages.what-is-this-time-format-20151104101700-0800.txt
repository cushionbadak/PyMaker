<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I am parsing an xml file exported from iOS Health App. The records of start time has this format:</p>
<pre><code>@startDate:20151104101700-0800
@endDate:20151104111700-0800

...

@startDate:20151002151700-0800
@endDate:20151003151700-0800
</code></pre>
<p>I am just wondering what does the part '15170-0800' stand for. Can anyone help?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>20151002151700-0800</code> would be the format <code>CCYYMMDDHHMMSS-TZ</code>.</p>
<p>So, the <code>151700</code> portion of your question is the time, in Hours Minutes Seconds.
What follows after would be a + or -, and how many hours and minutes you're offset from UTC, so the <code>-0800</code> would be UTC-8 timezone.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>It doesn't look like a standard time format (such as <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339#section-5.8" rel="nofollow noreferrer">rfc 3339</a>) or a default time format for a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/DataFormatting/Articles/dfDateFormatting10_4.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Date Formatter</a> but it is easy to parse anyway.</p>
<p>The time format is <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#strftime-strptime-behavior" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>%Y%m%d%H%M%S%z</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from datetime import datetime
&gt;&gt;&gt; datetime.strptime("20151104101700-0800", "%Y%m%d%H%M%S%z")
datetime.datetime(2015, 11, 4, 10, 17, tzinfo=datetime.timezone(datetime.timedelta(-1, 57600)))
</code></pre>
<p>Note: it differs from <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/33604150/4279">@Christian Witts's answer</a> (<code>-</code> is a part of the numerical utc offset).</p>
<p>Don't use the label <code>UTC-8</code> in the programming context; <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/31078749/4279">it may be ambiguous</a>. If you don't know the timezone name such as <code>America/Los_Angeles</code>; just numeric offset (<code>-0800</code>) is less ambiguous.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I'm voting to close this question as off-topic because it is not about programming.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It looks to me like four-digit year, two-digit month, two-digit day, then hours (in 24-hour clock), minutes, seconds.  The -0800 is probably a timezone specification (meaning UTC-8).  But this question is off-topic because it's not really about programming at all.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@BrenBarn its about how to parse a date sting. Seems kinda programy to me.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@tdelaney: The question doesn't ask anything about how to parse it.  It just asks about what it is.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@BrenBarn the question starts "I am parsing an xml file...". I take that to mean that OP wants to parse the date within the xml file.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hi @sebastian, thanks for your answer.</span>
