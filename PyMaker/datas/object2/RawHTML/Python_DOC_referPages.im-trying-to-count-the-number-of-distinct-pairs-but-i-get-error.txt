<p>I have recently decided to start solving coding problems and I'm struggled with this 'Counting pairs' problem for two days now.</p>
<p>The problems says that two pais of integers (a,b) and (c,d) are considered distinct if at least one element of (a,b) is not in (c,d) (For example; givien a list (1,3,3,4), (1,3) is distinct from (1,4) and (3,4) but not from (1,3) with 2 chosen from a different index in the list. A pair is valid if a&lt;=b ! </p>
<p>So I have to write a function that returns the count of valid pairs in my list that have a specified difference X ( a + X = b ) </p>
<pre><code>def countPairs(liste, X):
    # Write your code here
    count = 0
    liste.sort()
    j=0
    d=0
    while d&lt;len(liste):
        if liste[d]-liste[j]==X:
            count=count+1
            j=j+1
            d=d+1
        elif liste[d]-liste[j]&gt;X:
            j=j+1
        else:
            d=d+1
    return count
</code></pre>
<p>Thank you ! </p>

<p>You do not check for <em>distinct</em> pairs in your solution. See what will happen when <code>liste = [1, 1, 3, 3]</code> and <code>X = 2</code>. You will count the two pairs, one with elements with indices (0,2) and other (1,3).</p>
<p>To omit the duplicates you may use a data structure that does not allow them: <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/sets.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">set</a>. You can convert between the data structures like that:</p>
<pre><code>set(liste)
list(set(liste))
</code></pre>
<p>I suppose the assumption is that <code>X &gt;= 0</code>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">What error did you get? Please don't just allude to an error. Say what it is, and in what line it occurs.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It doesn't work for all test cases.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What test case or cases doesn't it pass? What did you do to try and debug it? Please give a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve">Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">yes, u're correct! i'm lost how to check for distinct pairs tho</span>
