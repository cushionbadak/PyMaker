<p>Before doing: <code>os.read(fd,1024)</code> I would like to check that there will be output rather than it hanging until output it received. Since fd is an int object, I can't do:</p>
<pre><code>os.fstat(f.fileno()).st_size
</code></pre>
<p>If I could get the size, I could check it is not 0.</p>
<p>Sorry if this is really simple, I am new to python.</p>

<p>Use <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/select.html#select.select" rel="nofollow"><code>select.select</code></a>. (In windows, you can only it with socket):</p>
<pre><code>import select

...

r, _, _ = select.select([fd], [], [], 0)
if r:
    data = os.read(fd, 1024)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">should this work in pty environment? I am reading stdout of the python program (which is running: pty.spawn(/bin/sh)) from another process (not python) with proc_open. Still getting the hanging problem with the above code. If there is output it will read it, if there isn't, it will hang and way.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@OBV, <code>select.select</code> will return immediately with <code>timeout</code> (the fourth argument) as 0.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">is that meant as select.select([fd]... rather?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@OBV, You're right. Sorry, I fixed the typo.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@OBV: I distinctly remember answering a question about <code>pty.spawn()</code> and <code>proc_open()</code> very recently but I can't find it now. Was it your question? Here's the gist of the answer: <code>pty.spawn</code> accepts callbacks and when they are called, <code>os.read</code> won't block. See <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/pty.html#pty.spawn" rel="nofollow noreferrer">code example in the docs</a>. I also mentioned that it looked like <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/66377/what-is-the-xy-problem">XY Problem</a> meaning that you should update your question and provide more details about the context of your question.</span>
