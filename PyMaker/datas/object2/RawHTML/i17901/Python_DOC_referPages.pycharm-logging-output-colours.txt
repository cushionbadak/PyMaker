<p>I'm using PyCharm to develop a GAE app in Mac OS X. Is there any way to display colours in the run console of PyCharm?</p>
<p>I've set a <a href="http://xsnippet.org/359377/" rel="noreferrer">handler</a> to output colours in ansi format. Then, I've added the handler:</p>
<pre><code>LOG = logging.getLogger()
LOG.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
for handler in LOG.handlers:
    LOG.removeHandler(handler)

LOG.addHandler(ColorHandler())

LOG.info('hello!')
LOG.warning('hello!')
LOG.debug('hello!')
LOG.error('hello!')
</code></pre>
<p>But the colour is the same.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>A response from JetBrains <a href="http://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/PY-11543" rel="noreferrer">issue tracker</a>: Change line 55 of the snippet from sys.stderr to sys.stdout. stderr stream is always colored with red color while stdout not.</p>
<p>Now colours are properly displayed.</p>

<p>PyCharm doesn't support that feature natively, however you can download the <a href="http://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7125?pr=pycharm" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Grep Console plugin</a> and set the colors as you like.</p>
<p>Here's a screenshot:

<p>I hope it helps somewhat :) although it doesn't provide fully colorized console, but it's a step towards it.</p>

<p>As of at least PyCharm 2017.2 you can do this by enabling:</p>
<p>Run | Edit Configurations... | Configuration | Emulate terminal in output console </p>

<p>Late to the party, but anyone else with this issue, here's the solution that worked for me:</p>
<pre><code>import logging
import sys
logging.basicConfig(stream=sys.stdout, level=logging.DEBUG)
</code></pre>
<p>This came from <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14058453/making-python-loggers-output-all-messages-to-stdout-in-addition-to-log#28194953">this answer</a></p>

<p>What solved it for me (on PyCharm 2017.2) was going to <code>Preferences -&gt; Editor -&gt; Color Scheme -&gt; Console Colors</code> and changing the color of <code>Console -&gt; Error output</code>. Of course this also changes the error color but at least you don't see red all the time...</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I discovered the following solution. Apparently Pycharm redirects sys.stdout. From the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">sys module documentation</a>:</p>
<pre><code>sys.__stdin__
sys.__stdout__
sys.__stderr__
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>These objects contain the original values of stdin, stderr and stdout
  at the start of the program. They are used during finalization, and
  could be useful to print to the actual standard stream no matter if
  the sys.std* object has been redirected.</p>
<p>It can also be used to restore the actual files to known working file
  objects in case they have been overwritten with a broken object.
  However, the preferred way to do this is to explicitly save the
  previous stream before replacing it, and restore the saved object.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Therefore, to solve this issue you can redirect output to <code>sys.__stdout__</code>. Example configuration from my log_config.yml:</p>
<pre><code>console:
  class: logging.StreamHandler
  level: DEBUG
  stream: "ext://sys.__stdout__"
  formatter: colorFormatter
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">What kind of PyCharm and what version is it?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">PyCharm Pro v3.0.2 for Mac OS X</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The snippet referrenced went offline (as did <code>xsnippet.org</code> maybe?) - could you explain where you changed <code>sys.stderr</code> to <code>sys.stdout</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">In the handler definition of your logging conf you can also simply add <code>'stream': sys.stdout</code> to achieve this</span>

<span class="comment-copy">This plugin is great! Just what I was looking for. I really like the "Filter out" option as well.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Plugin IS awesome. Solved this for me.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This didn't work for me - strange?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I was using the <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/coloredlogs" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>coloredlogs</code></a> package in this screenshot.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks!! this is awesome.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Note that the indicated checkbox only shows if you have "Python" selected in the list view. Other run types do not have this option.</span>
