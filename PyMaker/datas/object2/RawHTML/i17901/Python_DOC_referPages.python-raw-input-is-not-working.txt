<p>Below is my code:</p>
<pre><code>randomOne = int(str(raw_input('Enter the first number.')))
randomTwo = int(str(raw_input('Enter the second number.')))
</code></pre>
<p>I always get this error message:</p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "C:/Users/*****/Desktop/Pythons/randomNumberGenerator.py", line 5, in &lt;module&gt;
randomOne = int(str(raw_input('Enter the first number.')))
NameError: name 'raw_input' is not defined
</code></pre>
<p>I do not understand at all what is going on, if i could have some help?</p>

<p>If you are using python 3, it doesn't have <code>raw_input</code>, use <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input" rel="noreferrer">input</a> instead.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">what version are you on? <code>raw_input</code> was removed in Python 3, and its behavior switched to <code>input</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">As a side note: Why are you trying to call <code>str</code> on the result of <code>raw_input</code>? What are you expecting that to do? (In every version of Python that had <code>raw_input</code>, from 0.x to 2.7, it returns a <code>str</code>, so calling <code>str</code> on it will just make a copy.)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Meanwhile, if you're using Python 3.x, but using examples written for Python 2.x, you may want to at least skim <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.0.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">What's New in Python 3.0</a>, and bookmark it to search it whenever you have a problem like this. For example, if you search the page for <code>raw_input</code>, you'l find "PEP 3111: <code>raw_input()</code> was renamed to <code>input()</code>â€¦"</span>
<span class="comment-copy">that was more simple of a problem then i thought...*facepalm*</span>
