<p>I have two date strings in a list (i.e dateList = ['2013-11-26 08:09:51', '2013-11-26 01:19:51'])</p>
<p>If their is possiblility to compare between date strings of specified format, please provide a solution by returning latest date from the list.</p>
<p>Thanks in Advance</p>

<pre><code>max(dateList)

<p>Because of the formatting of your strings (i.e. starting with the largest time unit and working step by step to the smallest, additional zeroes for single-digit values), they can be directly compared to one another.</p>

<p>You have asked for two different things Compare the dates and get the latest date:</p>
<p>To get the latest date use @jonrsharpe solution:</p>
<p>You can compare them as strings, by using <code>all()</code>, I'm using all so it can work with lots of dates and not just 2:   </p>
<pre><code>dateList = ['2013-11-26 08:09:51', '2013-11-26 08:09:51']

if all(dateList[0] == x for x in dateList):
    print "Equal"
else:
    print "Not equal"

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Use <a href="http://labix.org/python-dateutil" rel="nofollow">dateutil</a> library:</p>
<pre><code>from dateutil import parser
dateList = [parser.parse(date) for date in dateList]
latest_date = max(dateList)
</code></pre>
<p>It will give you latest date.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Your "question" looks like a school excercise, not like a qustion. Brute answer would then be "yes". But what have you tried so far? Did you have a look to <code>time</code>, and more precisely to <code>time.strptime</code> function?
