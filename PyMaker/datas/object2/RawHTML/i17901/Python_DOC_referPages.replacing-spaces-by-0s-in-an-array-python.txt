<p>I've been for the past two days trying to make a program that does a hill cipher. I only have only problem so far and it is that I can't find a way to replace the spaces to 0's. I have tried doing different conditions wich might (or in my case don't) work, I either get nothing shown on screen or the ascii value from space -96. This is what I got so far:</p>
<pre><code>import math
import sys
import string
import numpy as np
from numpy import matrix

msg = sys.argv[1]
key1 = sys.argv[2]
key2 = sys.argv[3]
key3 = sus.argv[4]
key4 = sys.argv[5]
base = sys.argv[6]

key_matrix = np.matrix([[int(key1), int(key3)], [int(key2), int(key4)]])
lettconv = [ord(lett) - 96 for lett in msg]
</code></pre>
<p>code might be a little nasty, sorry about that, I'm still a noob with python and programming in general.
Anything would be great, I would rather have an explanation on how to do it since it is stuff to do for my uni, I'm pretty lost and could use some guidance.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

<p>So if I am understanding this correctly, in the list comprehension you want to use the value <code>0</code> if the letter is a space, otherwise you want to use <code>ord(lett) - 96</code>.  You can use a <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#conditional-expressions" rel="nofollow">conditional expression</a> to express this logic as follows:</p>
<pre><code>0 if lett == ' ' else ord(lett) - 96
</code></pre>
<p>Putting this into the comprehension:</p>
<pre><code>lettconv = [0 if lett == ' ' else ord(lett) - 96 for lett in msg]
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Oh man, I never even thought about that, was trying to do the if condition outsite of the lettconv array I was doing, no wonder it never showed anything. Thanks a lot! it works now :)</span>
