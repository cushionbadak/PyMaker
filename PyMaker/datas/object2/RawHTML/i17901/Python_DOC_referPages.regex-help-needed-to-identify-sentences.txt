<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have a text like this:</p>
<p><strong>"Mark</strong></p>
<p><strong>Whatever sentence</strong><br/>
<strong>Whatever sentence 2</strong></p>
<p><strong>Matt</strong></p>
<p><strong>Whatever sentence 3</strong><br/>
<strong>Whatever sentence 4</strong></p>
<p><strong>Carol</strong></p>
<p><strong>Whatever sentence 5</strong><br/>
<strong>Whatever sentence 6"</strong></p>
<p>I want to be able to identify each sentence (and then make a list of each sentence). How can I do this in a easy way?</p>
<p>It doesn't matter if Mark, Matt and Carol are identified and later added to the list because those names are always the same but the sentences can differ.</p>
<p>I've tried a bit, but I can't figure out how to deal with the empty lines...</p>
<p>Any help would be much appreciated even if it's just a pointer to head me in the right direction..</p>

<p>In Python, you don't need a regex.</p>
<p>Just use <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.splitlines" rel="nofollow">splitlines</a>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; text = """Mark

Whatever sentence
Whatever sentence 2

Matt

Whatever sentence 3
Whatever sentence 4

Carol

Whatever sentence 5
Whatever sentence 6"""
&gt;&gt;&gt; sentences = text.splitlines()
&gt;&gt;&gt; sentences
['Mark', '', 'Whatever sentence', 'Whatever sentence 2', '', 'Matt', '', 'Whatever sentence 3', 'Whatever sentence 4', '', 'Carol', '', 'Whatever sentence 5', 'Whatever sentence 6']
</code></pre>
<p>Then <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#filter" rel="nofollow">filter</a> out all the blank lines:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; sentences = list(filter(None, sentences))
&gt;&gt;&gt; sentences
['Mark', 'Whatever sentence', 'Whatever sentence 2', 'Matt', 'Whatever sentence 3', 'Whatever sentence 4', 'Carol', 'Whatever sentence 5', 'Whatever sentence 6']
</code></pre>
<p>If by "make a list of each sentence", you mean split each sentence into words, you could do this:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; sentences = [sentence.split() for sentence in sentences]
&gt;&gt;&gt; sentences
[['Mark'], ['Whatever', 'sentence'], ['Whatever', 'sentence', '2'], ['Matt'], ['Whatever', 'sentence', '3'], ['Whatever', 'sentence', '4'], ['Carol'], ['Whatever', 'sentence', '5'], ['Whatever', 'sentence', '6']]
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If all sentences end with a newline, you can use this (very simple) regular expression:</p>
<pre><code>/([^\n]+)/
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">How do you differentiate between a sentence and a name? Can you give a more specific example and your expected output (matches)? What exactly have you tried already?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@slhck the OP doesn't (I think). "It doesn't matter if Mark, Matt and Carol are identified" ;)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I was expecting to get some kind of answer but not this fast and definitely not this kick-ass!  Thanks man, I'll try it out!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The answer I was on the point to post ! You should precise that, using <code>list(filter(...))</code> ,  the code is in Python 3, isn't it ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user3024863 Then you should click on the "bracket" that is under the 'upvote button - points - downvote button' series at the left of the answer of seeneyrod, to accept it</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@eyquem Yes, I tested with Python 3.3, but I don't think there's any difference between it and Python 2.7 in this case.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">In Python 2, <code>list(filter(...))</code> works but is redundant since <code>filter()</code> returns a list when the argument is a list</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, I'll use this if needed. Not sure which way I will go yet, but this might come handy later on.</span>
