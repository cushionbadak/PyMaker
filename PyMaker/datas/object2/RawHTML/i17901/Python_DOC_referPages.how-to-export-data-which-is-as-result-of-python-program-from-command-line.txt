<p>I am working on a Python program, and I have results on the command line.</p>
<p>Now I need to do analysis on the results, so I need all results as exported in any format like either SQL, or Excel or CSV format.</p>
<p>Can some tell me how can i do that ?</p>
<pre><code>import csv
x1=1 x2=2
while True:
    show = [ dict(x1=x1+1 , x2=x2+2)]
    print('Received', show )
    with open('large1.csv','w') as f1:
        writer=csv.writer(f1, delimiter=' ',lineterminator='\n\n',)
        writer.writerow(show)
    x1=x1+1
    x2=x2+1 
</code></pre>
<p>Here this is infinite loop and I want to have a csv file containing 2 column of x1 and x2. and with regularly updated all values of x1 and x2 row wise (1 row for 1 iteration) </p>
<p>But by this code I'm getting a csv file which is named as 'large1.csv' and containing only one row (last updated values of x1 and x2).</p>
<p>So how can I get my all values of x1 and x2 as row was in python.</p>

<p>Have a look at the <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#open" rel="nofollow">open() documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Mode <code>w</code> will <em>truncate</em> the file, which means it will replace the contents. Since you call that every loop iteration, you are continuously deleting the file and replacing it with a new one. Mode <code>a</code> appends to the file and is <em>maybe</em> what you want. You also might consider opening the file outside of the loop, in that case <code>w</code> might be the correct mode.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Just use the csv format it can easily imported into Excel and
the python standard library supports csv out of the box. @See <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/csv.html" rel="nofollow">python-csv</a></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>One way to handle this is to use the <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#module-csv" rel="nofollow">CSV module</a>, and specifically a <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#writer-objects" rel="nofollow">Writer object</a> to write the output to a CSV file (perhaps even instead of writing to <code>stdout</code>). The documentation has several examples, including this one:</p>
<pre><code>import csv
with open('some.csv', 'w', newline='') as f:
    writer = csv.writer(f)
    writer.writerows(someiterable)
</code></pre>
<p>You should then be able to import the CSV file easily in Excel if that is what you want.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">i added the code</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you Nicoretii. i m trying it now and let you know the results.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">i added my code. and i m using csv module but still couldnt get result as per required</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you Mark  I will try it now.</span>
