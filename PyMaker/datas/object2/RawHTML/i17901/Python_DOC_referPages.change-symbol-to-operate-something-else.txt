<p>How to change symbol + (button in keyboard) in python to operate your custom def rather than default addition ?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can implement one or more of the following methods on your class:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>__add__</code> - handles the case when you have <code>(your object) + (some other object)</code></li>
<li><code>__radd__</code> - handles the case when you have <code>(some other object) + (your object)</code> and the other object doesn't know how to do the addition.</li>
<li><code>__iadd__</code> - handles <code>(your object) += (some object)</code>. You don't necessarily need to implement this, as Python will call <code>__add__</code> if you don't.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are corresponding "magic" methods for other operations, mathematical and otherwise, <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html" rel="nofollow">see here</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Numeric operations on classes are delegated to <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/reference/datamodel.html#emulating-numeric-types" rel="nofollow">various methods</a>. Simply implement them on your class to perform the desired operation.</p>
<pre><code>class MyClass(object):
  def __add__(self, other):
     ...
</code></pre>
<p>Note that you cannot change the behavior of the standard operators when the operand or both operands are existing types.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Out of interest, what is it you intend for the + symbol to do?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">fuzzy arithmetics, ex. 5 + 2  &gt;&gt; 7 but in fuzzy arithemetics is 7 with a function following number 7.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">As no one seems to have mentioned it yet, what you want to do is called operator overloading <a href="http://rgruet.free.fr/PQR26/PQR2.6.html#SpecialMethods" rel="nofollow noreferrer">and this is a good reference</a> to know which operators you can overload.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">plz someone from the answers below indicate me, where my BUTTON + (pressing shift and +) can be changed to my custom def. I know it might my sound weird, but i just need to change a BUTTON keyboard to operate my custon def then i script in python (2.7.3).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@StavrosAnastasiadis: You're going to have to add more info. Where are you typing this?</span>
