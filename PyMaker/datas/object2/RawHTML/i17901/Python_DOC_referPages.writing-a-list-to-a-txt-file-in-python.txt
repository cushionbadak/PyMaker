<p>list consists of RANDOM strings inside it</p>

<p>so now how do I make the program produce the result that I want which is:</p>

<p>By the way, the list that you have in your post contains <code>int</code>s, not strings.<br/>
Also, please NEVER name your variables <code>list</code> or <code>dict</code> or any other type for that matter</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>writelines()</code> needs a <code>list</code> of strings with line separators appended to them but your code is only giving it a list of integers. To make it work you'd need to use something like this:</p>
<pre><code>some_list = [1,2,3,4]

filename = 'output.txt'
outfile = open(filename, 'w')
outfile.writelines([str(i)+'\n' for i in some_list])
outfile.close()
</code></pre>
<p>In Python file objects are <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#context-managers" rel="nofollow">context managers</a> which means they can be used with a <code>with</code> statement so you could do the same thing a little more succinctly with the following which will close the file automatically. It also uses a <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html?highlight=generator%20expression#generator-expressions" rel="nofollow">generator expression</a> (enclosed in parentheses instead of brackets) to do the string conversion since doing that avoids the need to build a temporary list just to pass to the function.</p>
<pre><code>with open(filename, 'w') as outfile:
    outfile.writelines((str(i)+'\n' for i in some_list))
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">What are these indentation for? list does not contain any string at all</span>
