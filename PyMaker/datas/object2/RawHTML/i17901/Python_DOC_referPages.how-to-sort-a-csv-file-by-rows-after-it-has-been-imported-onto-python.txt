<p>The csv file is 18 columns and 45000 rows. it is imported using these codes (it contains special characters)</p>
<pre><code>import csv

with open('airports.csv', newline='', encoding='utf-8') as file:
    for row in csv.reader(file):
        print(row)

<p>how would i sort this by columns?<br/>
any example code or references i can look at would be appreciated. </p>

<p>The <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/howto/sorting.html" rel="nofollow">Python Sorting HOW TO</a> has some good information.  If you get the contents of your CSV file into a list, you can use the techniques documented there.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Use <code>zip</code>:</p>
<pre><code>import csv

with open('airports.csv', newline='', encoding='utf-8') as file:
    rows = [r for r in csv.reader(file)]

columns = zip(*rows)
</code></pre>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>rows = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]</p>
<p>for row in rows: print(row)</p>
<p>columns = zip(*rows)</p>
<p>for column in columns: print(column)</p>
<p>Give it a shot</p>

<span class="comment-copy">does it make sense to have a table with 45,000 columns? Or do you mean 45,000 rows?</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#sorted" rel="nofollow noreferrer">sorted</a> built-in function</span>
<span class="comment-copy">it has 45, 000 verticle lines and 18 horizontal lines to be clear my mistake i corrected it</span>
<span class="comment-copy">How do you want to sort them?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">by columns which are the categories</span>
<span class="comment-copy">How does this sort them?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Give it a try, zip(*x) returns an iterator for the transpose of x.  So you can go column by column rather than row by row.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I know what zip does. Transposing x is not the same thing as sorting it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">ok, well then, more info needed on what "sort by column" means</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I think transpose means <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transpose" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this</a> although I suppose that abstractly it could be considered a kind of sequence-ordering/collating operation.</span>
