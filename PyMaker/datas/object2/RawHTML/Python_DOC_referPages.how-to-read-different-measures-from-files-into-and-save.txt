<p>I have few csv files that all of the has the following information:</p>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YBCji.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img alt="enter image description here" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YBCji.png"/></a></p>
<p>I need to take each row from every CSV files and add as a row in each different Label separately to be able to take the mean of all measures among all CSV files. I wrote the following lines, but I do not know how to write in an efficient and clean way. defining 6 different <code>numpy</code> arrays and then adding each row of <code>csv</code> to them separately does not seem a smart way of writing code. what do you suggest? Thanks</p>
<pre><code>for filename in csv_files:
     print 'reading CSV file '+ filename
     file_path=join(csv_dir, filename)
     csv = np.genfromtxt (file_path, delimiter=",")
</code></pre>

<p>As in the comment:
Read each file into a numpy.ndarray and store them into a list. Afterwards stack them together, e.g with np.hstack(arraylist).</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I'd prefer your data not to be displayed as an image. What you MIGHT want to do is read all files and add each numpy array to a list. Then stack the arrays from the list (e.g. np.hstack) and do operations on the big array.</span>
