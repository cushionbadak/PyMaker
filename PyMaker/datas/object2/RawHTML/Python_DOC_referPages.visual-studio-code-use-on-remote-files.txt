<p>Is there any way to use the python extension to edit files that reside on a remote server? I have tried NFS and remoteFS, but I do not see any way to get Intellisense working using the remote installation. I normally edit and test on a windows machine, while the target runs on Linux. 
I realise this is not limited to this extension, but is a more general issue. </p>

<p>Yes there are some. I used <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=liximomo.sftp" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this one</a>. It allows to synchronize code between local and remote server.
You will have to keep copy on local host and it can be configured to automatically update code on remote.</p>

<p>As a workaround, I'm using a Linux Hosted virtual machine which has a similar setup as the target. This works surprisingly well. It is a shame VMware 12 removed support for unity.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I don't understand your question. I do this (editing remote files from windows with visual studio code) and I have no problem. Can you explain more?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It very might well be my setup of Visual studio and /or Linux system or NFS. The general problem (I think not limited to Python), is dat VS Code does not know about the includes and libraries used remotely.</span>
