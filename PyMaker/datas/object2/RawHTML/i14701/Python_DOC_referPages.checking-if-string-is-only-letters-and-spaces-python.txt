<p>Trying to get python to return that a string contains ONLY alphabetic letters AND spaces</p>

<p>I've been trying <code>please</code> and it comes up as <code>Only alphabetical letters and spaces: no</code> I've used <code>or</code> instead of <code>and</code>, but that only satisfies one condition. I need both conditions satisfied. That is the sentence must contain <em>only letters</em> and <em>only spaces</em> but must have at least one of each kind. It must <em>not</em> contain any numerals.</p>
<p>What am I missing here for python to return both letters and spaces are only contained in the string?</p>

<p>The correct solution would use an <code>or</code>.</p>

<p>Although you have a string, you are iterating over the letters of that string, so you have one letter at a time. So, a char alone cannot be an alphabetical character AND a space at the time, but it will just need to be one of the two to satisfy your constraint.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I saw your comment in the other answer. <code>alphabet = string.isalpha()</code> return <code>True</code>, if and only if <em>all</em> characters in a string are alphabetical letters. This is not what you want, because you stated that you want your code to print <code>yes</code> when execute with the string <code>please</code>, which has a space. You need to check each letter on its own, not the whole string.</p>
<p>Just to convince you that the code is indeed correct (well, ok, you need to execute it yourself to be convinced, but anyway):</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; string = "please "
&gt;&gt;&gt; if all(x.isalpha() or x.isspace() for x in string):
    print("Only alphabetical letters and spaces: yes")
else:
    print("Only alphabetical letters and spaces: no")


Only alphabetical letters and spaces: yes
</code></pre>
<p><strong>EDIT 2:</strong> Judging from your new comments, you need something like this:</p>
<pre><code>def hasSpaceAndAlpha(string):
    return any(char.isalpha() for char in string) and any(char.isspace() for char in string) and all(char.isalpha() or char.isspace() for char in string)

&gt;&gt;&gt; hasSpaceAndAlpha("text# ")
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; hasSpaceAndAlpha("text")
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; hasSpaceAndAlpha("text ")
True
</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code>def hasSpaceAndAlpha(string):
    if any(char.isalpha() for char in string) and any(char.isspace() for char in string) and all(char.isalpha() or char.isspace() for char in string):
        print("Only alphabetical letters and spaces: yes")
    else:
        print("Only alphabetical letters and spaces: no")

&gt;&gt;&gt; hasSpaceAndAlpha("text# ")
Only alphabetical letters and spaces: no
&gt;&gt;&gt; hasSpaceAndAlpha("text")
Only alphabetical letters and spaces: no
&gt;&gt;&gt; hasSpaceAndAlpha("text ")
Only alphabetical letters and spaces: yes

<p>Actually, it is an pattern matching exercise, so why not use pattern matching? </p>
<pre><code>import re
r = re.compile("^[a-zA-Z ]*$")
def test(s):
    return not r.match(s) is None

<p>Or is there any requirement to use <code>any()</code> in the solution?</p>

<p>You need <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#any" rel="nofollow">any</a> if you want at least one of each in the string:</p>
<pre><code>if any(x.isalpha() for x in string) and any(x.isspace() for x in string):
</code></pre>
<p>If you want at least one of each  but no other characters you can combine <code>all</code>,<code>any</code> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.translate" rel="nofollow">str.translate</a> , the following will only return <code>True</code> if we have at least one space, one alpha and contain only those characters.</p>
<pre><code> from string import ascii_letters

 s = input("Enter a string: ")

 tbl = {ord(x):"" for x in ascii_letters + " "}

if all((any(x.isalpha() for x in s),
   any(x.isspace() for x in s),
   not s.translate(tbl))):
    print("all good")
</code></pre>
<p>Check if there is at least one of each with <code>any</code> then translate the string, if the string is empty there are only alpha characters and spaces. This will  work for upper and lowercase.</p>
<p>You can condense the code to a single <code>if/and</code>:</p>
<pre><code>from string import ascii_letters

s = input("Enter a string: ")
s_t = s.translate({ord(x):"" for x in ascii_letters})

if len(s_t) &lt; len(s) and s_t.isspace():
    print("all good")
</code></pre>
<p>If the length of the translated string is &lt;  original and all that is left are spaces we have met the requirement.</p>
<p>Or reverse the logic and translate the spaces and check if we have only alpha left:</p>
<pre><code>s_t = s.translate({ord(" "):"" })
if len(s_t) &lt; len(s) and s_t.isalpha():
    print("all good")
</code></pre>
<p>Presuming the string will always have more alphas than spaces, the last solution should be by far the most efficient.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">A string cannot be both a letter and a space</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Padraic Cunningham, then how do I get python to return that BOTH are true (there is ONLY letters and spaces? <code>please </code>Has only one space and all letters, but it doesn't return that both criteria are satisfied.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@sithlorddahlia I kinda get your question. You mean to say <code>hi there</code> is true as it has both letter and space, but <code>hi</code> or `    ` is false as they don't have both. Am I correct?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Bhargav Rao yes, that is correct.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Okay, then this method doesn't fit what I need. I need for BOTH to return True so that way it states <code>Only alphabetical letters and spaces: yes</code> with <code>please </code>  I just tried this: <code>alphabet = string.isalpha()  spaces = string.isspace()  if alphabet == True and spaces == True</code> but still no go. Any other suggestions?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I don't understand your comment. Please edit your original question to include your new requirements.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It's not a new requirement, it's the same requirement. Python needs to read that both only letters and spaces are in the string. Take <code>please </code>for example. It has both spaces and letters. <code>please</code> has only letters but no spaces. So both criteria aren't met.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Do you mean it needs to contain at least one letter and at least one space? Is it allowed to also contain non-letter non-space characters?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I've updated my answer on that assumption.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Is there a reason you use <code>return not r.match(s) is None</code> rather than <code>return bool(r.match(s))</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Maybe. I prefer coding variants that can be understood with the least possible thinking when coming back to the code after a year or so. Openly dealing with the return value of <code>r.match()</code> might support this. What I really should have done differently is the name of the function ;)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@BhargavRao, maybe i was looking for a scrap ;)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Add the link to the function <code>any</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Just give some description what you are writing.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">in the above code . remove all space and then check the string that is it alphabetical or not. if it is alphabetical then it is alphabetical string with white spaces</span>
