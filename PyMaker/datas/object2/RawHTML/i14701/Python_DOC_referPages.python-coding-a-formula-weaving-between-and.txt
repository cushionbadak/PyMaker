<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Apparently</p>
<pre><code>-1**2
</code></pre>
<p>returns a value of <code>-1</code> instead of <code>1</code></p>
<p>So I will always receive a negative value. How can I get python to return a positive value for every even exponent?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>-x has lower precedence than **</p>
<p>See for exemple:
<a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/operators_precedence_example.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/operators_precedence_example.htm</a>
Therefore:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; -1**2
-1
&gt;&gt;&gt; (-1)**2
1
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The exponent will be evaluated first and then multiplied by a coefficient of -1.</p>
<pre><code>P - Parenthesis
E - Exponents
M - Multiplication
D - and Division
A - Addition
S - and Substraction
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Try (-1)**2 instead</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Your question title makes me curious what you're going to do with this, since there are more efficient ways to generate alternating terms in a loop than by raising -1 to some power. And even if you want to do it in a list comprehension (or generator expression) you can do <code>[1-i%2*2 for i in range(5)]</code> instead of  <code>[(-1)**i for i in range(5)]</code>. OTOH, I guess <code>(-1)**i</code> is more readable than the technique using <code>%</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">PM 2Ring - I understand why this is the case. It takes the exponent and calculates that before factoring in the negative. Thank you Eric, your answer has solved a quarter of my project.</span>
