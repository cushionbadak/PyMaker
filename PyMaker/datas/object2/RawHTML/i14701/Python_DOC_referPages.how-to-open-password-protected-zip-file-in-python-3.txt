<p>I'm trying to open a password protected zip file in Python. However, I'm completely stuck!</p>
<p>I've gone through the python documentation on zip files, but I can't find anything for opening one that is password protected.</p>
<p>Could someone please point me in the right direction?</p>
<pre><code>path = "some_file.zip"
password = "example123"

# How do I add the password parameter?
ZipFile.extractall(path)
</code></pre>

<p>From <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/zipfile.html" rel="nofollow">https://docs.python.org/2/library/zipfile.html</a>:</p>
<pre><code>ZipFile.extractall([path[, members[, pwd]]])
</code></pre>
<p>Extract all members from the archive to the current working directory. <code>path</code> specifies a different directory to extract to. <code>members</code> is optional and must be a subset of the list returned by <code>namelist()</code>. <code>pwd</code> is the password used for encrypted files.</p>
<p>Works on Python 3 too: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html" rel="nofollow">https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html</a></p>
