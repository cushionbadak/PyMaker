<p>How can I compare two files in Python 2.4.4?  The files could be different lengths.</p>
<p>We have Python 2.4.4 on our servers.  I would like to use the <code>difflib.unified_diff()</code> function but I can't find examples that work with Python 2.4.4.</p>
<p>All the versions that I have seen on Stack Overflow contain the following:</p>
<pre><code>with open("filename1","r+") as f1:
  with open ("filename2","r+") as f2:
    difflib.unified_diff(..........)
</code></pre>
<p>The problem that I have is within version 2.4.4 the <code>with open ...</code> generates a SyntaxError.  I would like to stay away from using the system call to diff or sdiff is possible.  </p>

<p>The <code>with</code> statement was <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/2.5.html#pep-343-the-with-statement" rel="nofollow">introduced in Python 2.5</a>. It's straightforward to do what you want without it, though:</p>
<p><strong>a.txt</strong></p>
<pre><code>This is file 'a'.

Some lines are common,
some lines are unique,
I want a pony,
but my poetry is awful.
</code></pre>
<p><strong>b.txt</strong></p>
<pre><code>This is file 'b'.

Some lines are common,
I want a pony,
a nice one with a swishy tail,
but my poetry is awful.
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Python</strong></p>
<pre><code>import sys

from difflib import unified_diff

a = 'a.txt'
b = 'b.txt'

a_list = open(a).readlines()
b_list = open(b).readlines()

for line in unified_diff(a_list, b_list, fromfile=a, tofile=b):
    sys.stdout.write(line)
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Output</strong></p>

<span class="comment-copy">2.4.4 is really old ... that said you can do <code>f1,f2 = open("fname1.txt"),open("fname2.txt")</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Worked like a charm.  I actually messed around with the other difflib options and the format that you provided and found that the following gave a better output: for line in context_diff(a_list, b_list, fromfile=a, tofile=b):</span>
