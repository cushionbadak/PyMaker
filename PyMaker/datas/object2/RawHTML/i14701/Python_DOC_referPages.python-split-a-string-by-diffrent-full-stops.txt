<p>hey i want to be able to change my string being split at say the third full stop or the 2nd  here is my code</p>
<pre><code>file = "hey there. this is some demo code. will you nice people please help me."

<p>i want to split the string <strong>after</strong> the 2nd full stop so it will look like</p>
<pre><code>"hey there. this is some demo code."
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>".".join(file.split(".")[2:])
</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code>file.split(".",2)[2:]
</code></pre>
<p>These use <code>str.split()</code> (<a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#str.split" rel="nofollow">2</a>/<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.split" rel="nofollow">3</a>), <code>str.join()</code> (<a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#str.join" rel="nofollow">2</a>/<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.join" rel="nofollow">3</a>), and slices (<a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#sequence-types-str-unicode-list-tuple-bytearray-buffer-xrange" rel="nofollow">2</a>/<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#sequence-types-str-unicode-list-tuple-bytearray-buffer-xrange" rel="nofollow">3</a>). There's no reason to use loops or regex for this.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I would do something like this:</p>
<pre><code>readf = open("split.txt")

for line in readf:

  a=line.split(".")

readf.close()

print (a[:2])
</code></pre>
<p>Basically you store the line in a and split it on "." and then use a subsequence which you can use however you like.
e.g. a[2:3] gives u the secound and third line while a[:3] gives you all three.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>A rough way to do it would be to use a counter and loop through the string, adding every character until the stopping limit is reached.</p>
<pre><code>firstString = ""
secondString = ""
stopsAllowed = 1
stopsFound = 0
for i in range(0,len(file)):
  if file[i] == ".":
    stopsFound += 1
  if stopsFound &lt;= stopsAllowed:
    firstString += file[i]
  else:
    secondString += file[i]
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">i dont understand that documention</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>'.'.join(file.split('.')[:-2])</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@RobertStenhouse  - If you want to learn programming you HAVE to learn how to understand the docs. They are really simple and well documented. Moreover you have 1000s of questions on SO which could help you out with this trivial problem</span>
<span class="comment-copy">i can work java docs fine , the python hower i cant seem to understand probally as its all togather it makes it harder to read , thank you though for your orignal post</span>
<span class="comment-copy">awsome im putting that into a vraible to print and it saying its a list , is there a way of just taken out the bits before the 2nd full stop and putting that as a diffrent string</span>
<span class="comment-copy">just tried it and its not cuttong off after 2nd ful stop when i print it</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Note that this only splits on <code>'.'</code>, not all full stops.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">i just turned off my pc will try in morning thank you</span>
<span class="comment-copy">ok good luck tomorrow then :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Note that this only splits on <code>'.'</code>, not all full stops.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">what do u mean adam would u mind exslpain please</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@RobertStenhouse hmm I may be mistaken. I was under the impression that a full stop was any sentence-ending punctuation (e.g. <code>'.'</code>, <code>'!'</code>,<code>'?'</code>).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Very unnecessary and complex. Would down vote but that costs me rep.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm not sure I see how it is complex</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Maybe not complex, but big scary code</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I see, thanks for the feedback</span>
