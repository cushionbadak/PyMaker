<p>I have a list of numbers, all of which need to be divided by the same number. I can do this, no problem, but how do I create a new list featuring these new quotients?</p>
<p>I have tried:</p>
<pre><code>for n in numbers:
    newnumbers = []
    newnumbers.append(n/649.00)
</code></pre>
<p>but it only gives me one number, the quotient of the last number in the list, back.</p>

<p>Instead of a loop you can also use a list comprehension (see <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions" rel="nofollow">https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions</a>):</p>
<pre><code>newnumbers = [n/649.00 for n in numbers]
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>It's executing your code literally.</p>
<pre><code>for each element in numbers:
   set newnumbers equal to an empty list
   add a value to newnumbers
</code></pre>
<p>So yes, of course you'll end up with a list with only one value in it.  What you want to do is move the list initialization out of the loop.</p>
<pre><code>newnumbers = []
for n in numbers:    
    newnumbers.append(n/649.00)
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Look at where you are creating <code>newnumbers</code>. Think about what that means each loop iteration.</span>
