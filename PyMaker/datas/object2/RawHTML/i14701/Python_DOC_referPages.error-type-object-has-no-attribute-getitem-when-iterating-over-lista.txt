<p>I'm new to Python and I keep getting this error:</p>
<pre><code>TypeError: 'type' object has no attribute '__getitem__'

<p>when I try to run this code:</p>
<pre><code>import arcpy,os
from arcpy import env

env.workspace="F:\U of M\good good study\python\fl\fl"
inFeatures="foodpts.shp"
lst=list["ram","bak","cat","fas","far","fmk","sup","gro","ebt"]

    populationField=item
    cellsize=100
    searchRadius=805
    arcpy.CheckOutExtension("Spatial")

    outKernelDensity.save("F:\U of M\good good study\python\fl\fl\kernal")

<p>What am I doing wrong?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This line is your problem:</p>
<pre><code>lst=list["ram","bak","cat","fas","far","fmk","sup","gro","ebt"]
</code></pre>
<p>Python interprets what's in those square brackets as a key to get an item from what's just before themâ€”in this case, getting the item with key <code>"ram", "bak", ...</code> from <code>list</code>. And, of course, the <code>list</code> class isn't a container and doesn't have any items!</p>
<p>Remove the leading <code>list</code>, and you get a list literal, which is probably what you want.</p>
<pre><code>list_ = ["ram", "bak", "cat", "fas", "far", "fmk", "sup", "gro", "ebt"]
</code></pre>
<p>See <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#list" rel="nofollow">the documentation on <code>list</code>s</a> for more information on how to create them.</p>
<p>See also <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" rel="nofollow">the official Python style guide</a>, which states</p>
<ul>
<li><p>names that would otherwise collide with keywords or builtins (like <code>list</code>) should have single underscores appended rather than being mangled (<code>list_</code> instead of <code>lst</code> or <code>lizt</code>), except in the case of <code>cls</code></p></li>
<li><p>container literals and function calls should have spaces after the commas (<code>"ram", "bak"</code> instead of <code>"ram","bak"</code>)</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>To define a list,</p>
<pre><code>lst=["ram","bak","cat","fas","far","fmk","sup","gro","ebt"]
</code></pre>
<p>or </p>
<pre><code>lst=list(...)
</code></pre>
<p>but <code>list</code> is a type, which you can call with parenthesis but you can't get an item from <code>list</code> using the square brackets.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">And before you post another question, <code>"F:\U of M\"</code> is going to give you a <code>SyntaxError</code> about a <code>truncated \UXXXXXXXX escape</code>. Double your backslashes to escape them (<code>"F:\\U of M\\"</code>), or use a <i>raw string literal</i> (<code>r"F:\U of M\"</code>).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@BlacklightShining: A raw string won't do the job, since the final <code>"</code> will still be considered part of the string literal. (This behavior is necessary to allow people to put both kinds of quotes in the same raw string.)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I tweaked the title to be a bit more specific.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user2357112 Good point. The asker can still use a raw string, though, since theirs doesn't end with a backslash.</span>
