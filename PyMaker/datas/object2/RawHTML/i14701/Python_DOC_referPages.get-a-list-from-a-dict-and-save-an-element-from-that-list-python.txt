<p>The title is very explicit. i have a dict (very very big dict), and a it has this:</p>
<pre><code>'orderItems': {
    'entries': [{
        'links': {
             'order': {
                'href': 'https: //api-latest.wdpro.xxxxx.com/booking-servicx/xxxxx/154301425212-3420290-4070919-6588782'
            }
</code></pre>
<p>so, <code>orderItems</code> is a dict, inside it has <code>entries</code> that is a list and inside it has<code>links</code>, what i need to get is the <code>href</code> inside <code>order</code></p>
<p>i´m getting the list with: <code>orderlink = json_response["orderItems"]["entries"]</code></p>
<p>but i´m not very sure how to go through the list to find the <code>href</code>. Maybe with <code>in</code>.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>To access elements in a list, you have to use numeric indexes, or process all of them.</p>
<p>The best thing probaly is to use a for loop in there, that will guarantee you will iterate over  all entries on the list:</p>
<pre><code>hrefs  = []
for entry in orderlink:
   hrefs.append(entry["links"]["order"]["href"])
</code></pre>
<p>that will give you a list with only the desired URLs</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Supposing that you have that JSON structure I will use this code to solve your problem:</p>
<pre><code># Suppose that json_response is the whole dictionary
entry_list = json_response["orderItems"]["entries"]

# Now for each entry in the list, you need to get the "href" field
hrefs = []
for entry in entry_list:
    curr_href = entry["links"]["order"]["href"]
    hrefs.append(curr_href)
</code></pre>
<p>You need to pay attention to the dictionary structure in order to access to the field correctly. Before using this code, please pay read about dictionaries in the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries" rel="nofollow">Python3 documentation</a>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">What do you mean? Do you want to get any of the hrefs, or the first one? Are there other non-link entries?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@tobias_k inside 'links' there is only one 'order' and i need that 'href'</span>
<span class="comment-copy">is it not <code>entry['links']['order']['href']</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@gonkan - sure - but it looks like the O.P. found his way around it. Thanks,</span>
