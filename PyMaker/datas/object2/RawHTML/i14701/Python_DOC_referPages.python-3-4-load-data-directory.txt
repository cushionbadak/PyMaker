<p>Hello to divine people with knowledge about Python.
I'm currently studying Python 3.4 and have encountered a problem.
About the load function, even when I used this function with the correct txtfile name an error appears.</p>
<pre><code>results = []
with open('text.txt') as inputfile:
    for line in inputfile:
        results.append(line.strip().split(','))

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "F:/CSSE1001/Assignments/SunMum/030415.py", line 2, in &lt;module&gt;
    with open('stations.txt') as inputfile:
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'text.txt'
</code></pre>
<p>Looks like Python cannot find where the text.txt is..
Can someone please tell me how to set a directory of a function? Thank you.</p>

<p>You are probably looking for <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.chdir" rel="nofollow">os.chdir(path)</a>. Alternatively, you could use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html#os.path.join" rel="nofollow">os.path.join(path, *paths)</a> to dynamically build the absolute path to hand over to the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open" rel="nofollow">open(file, mode='r', buffering=-1, encoding=None, errors=None, newline=None, closefd=True, opener=None)</a> function. It could also be that your <code>text.txt</code> file is not in the same directory as your <code>030415.py</code> file (<code>F:/CSSE1001/Assignments/SunMum</code>).</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> There are several ways you can load an entire file.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you want to read all of a file as text, you can write <code>data = open('text.txt', 'rt').read()</code></li>
<li>If you want to get all of a file's binary data, you can use <code>data = open('text.txt', 'rb').read()</code></li>
<li>If you want the lines of a file, a simple way to get them would be with <code>lines = tuple(open('text.txt', 'rt'))</code></li>
<li>If you want the lines without the newlines, you could type <code>lines = open('text.txt', 'rt').read().split('\n')</code></li>
<li>If you want to process the lines efficiently while avoiding newlines, you could use <code>for line in (line.strip('\n') for line in open('text.txt', 'rt')):</code> to start a for loop.</li>
<li>If you are working with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values" rel="nofollow">comma-separated values</a>, you probably should look at the documentation for the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html" rel="nofollow">csv</a> module available with Python.</li>
</ul>

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for answering. But I have another quesiton. When I apply that code, I cannot obtain the whole content of the txt file. Is there a way to load the whole content of a txt file? Once again, Thank you for answering.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Charlie Several code examples have been added for working with your <code>txt</code> file.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you for your concern, and It seems to be loaded, but I can't have access to it. I know that I'm supposed to use a list, but I can't get a grip. Could you please provide a little tip/hint/guidance? Thank you very much.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Charlie Could you perhaps paste the contents of the file to <a href="http://pastebin.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Pastebin</a> and then describe what you are supposed to do with the file?</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><a href="http://pastebin.com/kpPmKwTE" rel="nofollow noreferrer">pastebin.com/kpPmKwTE</a>  This contains a list of words that I'm trying to load to python. I have used the open functions and used print function after, which gave me this &lt;_io.TextIOWrapper name='text.txt' mode='r' encoding='cp1252'&gt;  It seems that it is loaded, but I'm struggling to find its contents. Thank you for your concern again.</span>
