<p>This is what I've been working with... I've tried for ages to get this to work properly but I can only get an error saying:</p>
<pre><code>AttributeError: 'datetime.timedelta' object has no attribute 'strftime'
</code></pre>
<p>I'd appreciate help please. </p>

<p>The problem is exactly what it says: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.timedelta" rel="nofollow"><code>timedelta</code></a> objects don't have a <code>strftime</code> method. If you want to format a <code>timedelta</code>, you have to do it manually. (Or use a third-party library that provides more features.)</p>
<p>Also, note that the specific output you're looking for doesn't even really make sense. Time deltas don't do months and years, just days and secondsâ€”because months and years wouldn't make sense. 35 days is 35 days no matter when you start counting, but 1 month and 5 days may be anywhere from 33 days to 36, so it's not a consistent time delta.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use <code>dateutil.relativedelta</code>:</p>
<pre><code>from dateutil import relativedelta
diff = relativedelta.relativedelta(release, currentTime)

print("{} Months {} Days {} Years {} Hours {} Minutes {} Seconds".format(
            diff.months,diff.days,diff.years,
            diff.hours, diff.minutes,diff.seconds))

3 Months 2 Days 0 Years 10 Hours 37 Minutes 25 Seconds
</code></pre>
<p>If you don't have it installed you can install it with pip:</p>
<pre><code>  pip install python-dateutil
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>In case, you don't want to use <code>dateutil</code>, you need to write a custom <code>strftime</code> like <code>strftimedelta</code> and as @abarnet suggested with only (days, hours, seconds) ifro</p>
<pre><code>def strftimedelta(tdelta, fmt):
    d = {"days": tdelta.days}
    d["hours"], rem = divmod(tdelta.seconds, 3600)
    d["minutes"], d["seconds"] = divmod(rem, 60)
    return fmt.format(**d)

strftimedelta(diff, "{days} days {hours} hours {minutes} minutes {seconds} seconds")

'93 days 6 hours 19 minutes 3 seconds'
</code></pre>

<p><a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/time_strftime.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/time_strftime.htm</a>
<br/><br/>time.strftime(format[, t])
<br/><br/>time.strftime("%b %d %Y %H:%M:%S", diff)  (or try time.gmtime(diff) like shown on the link)
<br/><br/>You are using diff.strftime, and diff doesnt know strftime, the imported time does, so try time.strftime</p>
