<p>Maybe that's a stupid question and a stupid mistake by me but i can't get this control flow to work.
here is my simplified code:</p>
<pre><code>for x in range(1,10):
    print(x)
    if x==2:
        print("working")
        break
else:
    print("stop")
</code></pre>
<p>here is the result on shell:</p>
<pre><code>1
2
working
</code></pre>
<p>Anyone can help me?</p>

<p>Your program is working as expected and specified. From <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#for" rel="nofollow">the official Python 3 documentation</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A break statement executed in the first suite terminates the loop
  without executing the else clauseâ€™s suite.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">What output did you expect?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is doing exactly as it should, if you always want the stop to print remove the else and put the print outside the loop</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Looking at this question the output you got was expected. If you want the <code>for loop</code> to print 'Stop', then it needs to have not been <code>break</code>'d. The <code>else</code> clause in <code>for loops</code> is only executed when a <code>for loop</code> has been completely run.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">i was expecting the else clause to be executed when the break was used. My Bad, i did not understand the documentation well enough. Thank you for the help.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you for the help. I read the documentation wrong. Answer accepted and upvoted.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thanks, @elunaery, but I don't see the acceptance just yet :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">had to wait 5 min</span>
