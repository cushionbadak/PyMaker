<pre><code>import sys
print(sys.path)

'C:\\python32\\Lib\\site-packages\\django'
'C:\\Python32'
'C:\\Python32\\lib\\site-packages'
...
</code></pre>
<p>for some reason, my pythonpath got messy. I'd like to organize it. Is it correct that I don't need the first and the last one above? And how can I change it permanently? (Not like sys.path.remove or sys.path.append)</p>
<p>I'm using Python3.2. in windows8.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Path 'C:\Python32\lib\site-packages' is added to sys.path by the built-in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/site.html" rel="nofollow">site</a> module.</p>
<p>If you want to, you can start python with the -S flag to tell the site module "Don't add site-packages". </p>
<pre><code>python -S
</code></pre>
<p>Next, 'C:\python32\Lib\site-packages\django'.<br/>
Here's a wild guess: you installed django with pip/easy_install/msi-installer and there is a file 
C:\python32\Lib\site-packages\django.pth (or something like this ending with .pth)</p>
<p>Quoting the docs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A path configuration file is a file whose name has the form name.pth
  and exists in one of the four directories mentioned above; its
  contents are additional items (one per line) to be added to sys.path.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can remove django.pth file (not recommended, see below) to remove '..../django' from sys.path</p>
<p>So, short answer: don't mess with sys.path, what's in sys.path is probably for a good reason.
If you don't need django, then uninstall django using whatever tool you used to install it. Same for every package you don't need.</p>
