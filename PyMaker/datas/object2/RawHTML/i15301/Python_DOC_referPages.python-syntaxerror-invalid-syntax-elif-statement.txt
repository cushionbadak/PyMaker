<p>So I am pretty new to python, I am familiar with Java, C and Ruby.</p>
<p>I tried compiling a script for Kali to fix the RFkill issue for wifi devices since Kali does not have an RFKill.</p>

<p>I did not write this but I am trying to run it and I keep getting a SyntaxError: invalid syntax under elif(argv[1] == "block"):</p>
<p>I am assuming this has something to do with improper indentation, if anyone could be as kind to let me know what I am doing wrong and why that would be great! </p>

<p><strong>Indentation matters in Python</strong>. You have unindented lines between your <code>if</code> block and your <code>elif</code> block. These will cause a SyntaxError because you've effectively got an <code>elif</code> block <em>without an <code>if</code> block.</em></p>
<p>Either indent your lines so they match the <code>if</code> block, or use a second <code>if</code> statement rather than <code>elif</code>. Looking at your code, I'd imagine you'll want to indent them otherwise you would get NameErrors. In this case it becomes:</p>

<p>Here's a slightly cleaner version of that script. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">Generally, no parentheses are needed in an if-statement in Python (though they are allowed, hence they are not your error).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You should indeed indent the lines <code>x.seek and x.write</code> the same way <code>x = open...</code> is indented.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Please do <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#first-steps-towards-programming" rel="nofollow noreferrer">read the tutorial</a> first. It says, among others: "The body of the loop is indented: indentation is Pythonâ€™s way of grouping statements.".</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The only thing different between the 2 if branches is the write function. Why don't you move the two duplicate lines before the if-statement and only put the write function inside the if statement?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Evert: It's certainly a great idea to make the code <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself" rel="nofollow noreferrer">DRY</a>, but I guess its current structure is a rudimentary way of ensuring Bad Things don't happen if argv[1] is neither "block" or "unblock".</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This way, it will attempt to write to <code>x</code> twice if `argv[1] == "unblock". The indentation mismatch is somewhat ironic.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Evert yeah ironic indeed :P Thanks for the comment, edited.</span>
