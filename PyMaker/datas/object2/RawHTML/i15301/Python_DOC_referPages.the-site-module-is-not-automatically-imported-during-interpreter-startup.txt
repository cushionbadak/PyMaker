<p>The question is quite straight forward. As told by the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/site.html" rel="nofollow">Python doc</a>, the site package should be automatically imported during initilization. but this is not the case for me. I have to import it mannually to make it work using this:</p>
<pre><code>import site
site.main()
</code></pre>
<p>Also, I'm sure that the directory python\lib which contains site.py is in the search path. And I'm using windows 7. </p>
<p>I'm wondering what is wrong here if any one knows...</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>It's undeniably imported at startup, as you can easly verify:</p>
<pre><code>import sys
print sys.modules["site"].__file__
</code></pre>
<p>That doesn't mean any name has been imported into <em>your</em> namespace. To do that, you must use <code>import</code>. Since the module has already been imported once, you'll get a reference to that module:</p>
<pre><code>import site
assert site is sys.modules["site"]
</code></pre>
<p>In other words, it works like any other module that is imported in some module other than your own.</p>
<p>There's actually not any point in calling <code>site.main()</code>, as it's already been called during the import.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">The docs mean that it imports Python's own site module. Not yours.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I mean Python's own site module. I didn't create one of my own.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Then why are you trying to call main in it?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">How did you invoke the interpreter?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is suggested by the doc:"To explicitly trigger the usual site-specific additions, call the site.main() function."</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Do you mean I have to use import site and site.main() every time?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No. <code>site.main()</code> has already been called by the time your script does anything. That is, <code>site.py</code> contains a line that reads, in its entirety, <code>main()</code>. So when the interpreter imports it, <code>main()</code> is called.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">a little confused.... what should I do then to make it work?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It's already working, as i've explained. You don't need to do anything. What exactly do you want to have happen that isn't already happening?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, I think the problem is cleared now. I wrongly thought it should be in the namespace at first place. I was testing this by put a new folder in the site-packages folder to see if it works without re-import the site which I think is the reason it didn't work at second place. Now it works.</span>
