<p>I am making a set in Python to house all the symbols on my keyboard, but obviously a few pose some issues. Is there a way to get them all in there without encountering problems?</p>
<p>Here is my set:</p>
<pre><code>symbols = {`,~,!,@,#,$,%,^,&amp;,*,(,),_,-,+,=,{,[,},},|,\,:,;,",',&lt;,,,&gt;,.,?,/}
</code></pre>
<p>To get around commenting out most of it, since in Python <code>#</code> is to comment, I enclosed everything like so:</p>
<pre><code>symbols = {'`','~','!','@','#','$','%','^','&amp;','*','(',')','_','-','+','=','{','[','}','}','|','\',':',';','"',''','&lt;',',','&gt;','.','?','/'}
</code></pre>
<p>Which works for that character, but now I can already see an issue when I come across the <code>'</code> and <code>\</code>. Is there a better way to make this set?</p>
</div>

<p>You can fix the backslash by escaping it and <code>'</code> can be fixed by putting it in double quotes:</p>
<pre><code>symbols = {..., '\\', ... "'", ...}
</code></pre>
<p>But typing all this out is pretty tedious.  Why not just use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#string.punctuation" rel="noreferrer"><code>string.punctuation</code></a> instead:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from string import punctuation
&gt;&gt;&gt; set(punctuation)
{'~', ':', "'", '+', '[', '\\', '@', '^', '{', '%', '(', '-', '"', '*', '|', ',', '&amp;', '&lt;', '`', '}', '.', '_', '=', ']', '!', '&gt;', ';', '?', '#', '$', ')', '/'}
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">OK, so you need to store these characters as strings. Your first line doesn't fail because of the comment character, but because you can't just type a bunch of text that's not in a string and expect it to work. For the rest, you need to understand how to 'escape' special characters in a string, and maybe figure out whether you want a <b>list</b> or a <b>set</b> to store the strings in.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Note that I fixed your terminology.  What you have there is a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#types-set" rel="nofollow noreferrer">set</a>, not an array.  In fact, Python does not have a built-in array type (unless you are using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/array.html#array.array" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>array.array</code></a>).  Instead, we use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesseq-list" rel="nofollow noreferrer">lists</a>.</span>
