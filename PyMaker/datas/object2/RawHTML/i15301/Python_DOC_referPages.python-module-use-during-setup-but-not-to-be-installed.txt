<p>How can I specify to Setuptools that a module should be available during setup, but not installed for run-time?</p>
<p>I have made an extension command used by my Python distribution (in this case it auto-generates version metadata), and the module is included in the project tree.</p>
<pre><code>foo-project/
    setup.py
    MANIFEST.in
    foo/
        __init__.py
        bar.py
    version_info.py
</code></pre>
<p>To run Setuptools commands (such as <code>egg_info</code> or <code>develop</code>), the <code>version_info</code> module is imported by <code>setup</code>. So that file <code>version_info.py</code> needs to be part of the source distribution.</p>
<p>But putting that file in the source distribution also (by default?) automatically includes it in any binary distribution, such as <code>bdist_wheel</code> or <code>bdist_dumb</code>. That's wrong, because the file isn't needed at run-time and should not be installed.</p>
<p>How can I specify that the file is a Python module needed in the source distribution for setup commands, but not to be installed?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can include <em>source distribution files</em> in the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/distutils/sourcedist.html#specifying-the-files-to-distribute" rel="nofollow"><code>MANIFEST.in</code> file</a>; these files are included when building a source distribution that includes the <code>setup.py</code> file.</p>
<p>Do not include the file in <code>data_files</code> or <code>package_data</code> or <code>py_modules</code> and it won't be included in the binary distribution (just like <code>setup.py</code> won't be).</p>
