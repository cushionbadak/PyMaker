<p>Once I made my virtualenv, Python was already installed. How do I add the option <code>--enable-shared</code>? Do I delete it or start virtualenv over from fresh? If I do that, how do I add the Python option? I don't want to mess anything up.</p>

<p>When you create a virtual environment, the Python binaries will be copied, not compiled. Quoting from the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#creating-virtual-environments" rel="nofollow"><code>venv</code> documentation</a>,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It also creates a bin (or Scripts on Windows) subdirectory containing a copy of the python binary (or binaries, in the case of Windows)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But <code>--enable-shared</code> is an option for the <code>./configure</code> script, which is used during compilation of the Python from source code.</p>
<p>So, you first have to compile Python from the source code, with <code>--enable-shared</code> option, and then create virtual environment with the compiled python binary.</p>
<p>If you are using unix based OS, then by default, the installation will happen in <code>/usr/local</code> directory, so that you will not mess up with the current Python installation.</p>
<p>Moreover, instead of <code>sudo make install</code>, use <code>sudo make altinstall</code>. This will install the Python with the <code>major.minor</code> version format.</p>
