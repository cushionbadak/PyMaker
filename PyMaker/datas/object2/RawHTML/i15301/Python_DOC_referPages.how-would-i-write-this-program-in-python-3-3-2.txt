<p>This is Guess_The_Number program I wrote in Python:</p>
<pre><code>import random
print("Hello! Today we are going to play Guess The Number!")
number = int(input("Guess a number between 0 and 5"))
random_number = random.randint(0, 5)
if number == random_number:
    print("You won!")
    print("Your prize is...")
    print("Nothing!")
else:
    print("You lost!")
    print("The number was %s") % (random_number)
</code></pre>
<p>I tested it and it returned:</p>
<pre><code>print("The number was {0}").format(random_number)
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'format'
</code></pre>
<p>Then I tried:</p>
<pre><code>print("The number was {0}").format(random_number)
</code></pre>
<p>for the last print statement</p>
<p>It stated: </p>
<pre><code>print("The number was {0}").format(random_number) AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'format'
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>You have misplaced parenthesis</p>
<pre><code>print("The number was {0}".format(random_number))
</code></pre>
<p><strong>SMALL NOTE</strong> -  It works in Py2 </p>
<p>EDit - I meant your program works in Py2 that is <code>("The number was {0}").format(random_number)</code> works in Py2</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Thank you so much!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Additionally, <code>print("The number was %s" % random_number)</code>, works just fine in both 2.x and 3.x - although it is better to use <code>.format</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Scironic I guess you didn't get my usage of English ... :) ... Sorry</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@bhargavRao I did don't worry! I'm just showing that <code>%</code> based formatting, which OP initially used, also works fine.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Scironic Oh .. I didn't read your comment properly then. My bad :( ...</span>
