<p>I have a script stored in /etc/init.d that works ok when executed at boot time. Since I do not export USER, it should execute everything as root (if I'm not wrong).</p>
<p>Then, it executes python3 script.py
In this script, everything works fine until it reaches</p>
<pre><code>espeak_process = Popen(["espeak", "-ves", "-s100", msg, "--stdout"], stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
aplay_process = Popen(["aplay", "-D", "sysdefault"], stdin=espeak_process.stdout, stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
</code></pre>
<p>EDIT: changed for this code, but the created file is empty</p>
<pre><code>def log_uncaught_exceptions(ex_cls, ex, tb):
    f = open('/home/pi/debug_err.txt', 'w')
    f.write('hi ')
    f.write(ex_cls+' '+ex+' '+tb)
    f.close()

sys.excepthook = log_uncaught_exceptions
espeak_process = Popen(["espeak", "-ves", "-s100", msg, "--stdout"], stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE)
</code></pre>
<p>/EDIT</p>
<p>At which point it stops. I can tell that since it writes a debug file before and after this step, and the 2nd one is never written.</p>
<p>The thing though is that if I execute in a terminal</p>
<pre><code>sudo sh /etc/init.d/begin start
</code></pre>
<p>Then the "python3 script.py" is executed entirely ok, including the Popen part.</p>
<p>Why is that happening?
Thx</p>
<p>(init.d script)</p>
<pre><code>#! /bin/sh
# /etc/init.d/begin 

#USER=pi

#export USER HOME
export HOME

<p><code>Popen()</code> returns as soon as the child process is started. It does not wait for it to finish. It is very unlikely that your scripts blocks for long on <code>Popen()</code>.</p>
<p>A possible explanation is that your script raises an exception and terminates while trying to start <code>espeak</code> or <code>aplay</code> processes -- that is why you don't see the 2nd record in the log file. Catch and log all errors e.g., set <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.excepthook" rel="nofollow"><code>sys.excepthook</code></a>.</p>
<p>You don't see the error when running manually because the environment is different: disks are mounted, audio service is running, X is started, etc -- I don't know what <code>espeak</code>, <code>aplay</code> require to run.</p>
<p>As an alternative save all output to a file:</p>
<pre><code># python3 /home/pi/script.py &lt;/dev/null &gt;/home/pi/script.out 2&gt;/home/pi/script.err &amp;
</code></pre>

<p>I can see what's the problem, and it was to pass an argument with accentuated words (strange that it wasn't the case when I executed the script from the shell). I've eliminated the accents and now it works ok. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Try to specify a utf-8 locale. The default is C locale that uses ascii encoding that can't represent accentuated words directly:</p>
<pre><code># LANG=C.UTF-8 python3 ...
</code></pre>
<p>If there is no <code>C.UTF-8</code> locale in the output of <code>locale -a</code> command then choose any other utf-8 locale from the list.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Can you try reading <code>stderr</code> and perhaps log the output?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">How can I do it?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Read this answer: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/10683323/948550">stackoverflow.com/a/10683323/948550</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks. Based on your link I've tried to recover the error message with communicate() but the python script stops when it executes it, so it never reaches this code. Is there a way that I can handle this?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">[The python script exits before executing the "communicate()" command, so I cannot read any error message]</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I have added the code (see edited question), and the log file is written but it is empty, any idea?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Gerard: I see errors in  <code>log_uncaught_exceptions()</code>. You should test it first on a simple script that intentionally raises an exception. I've update the answer. You could redirect the output of the script as an alternative</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The problem is that when I execute the script (and I can see any message on the shell) everything runs ok (or at least I hear sound and the script does what he has to do).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">But when it runs from the init.d script, then it fails, and then I cannot see any error message</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Actually, I can see that it writes "hi" (see edited question), but it doesn't write anything else. How is that possible? How can I know why the script is stopping there?</span>
