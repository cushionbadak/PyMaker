<p>I had the impression that 2.7 was backwards compatible with 2.6?</p>
<p>I have a python program that I need to run on a server. I have developed it on a python version 2.7.6 and the server has python version 2.6.6.</p>
<p>What happens is that my program stops running when I run it on the server after a few minutes. I get the message: ' No handlers could be found for logger "sickle.app" ' and then it quits. However I get this message when I run the program locally to, but the program keeps running.</p>
<p>The way I run the program is that I send the program and its requirements to the server. Create a virtual environment and pip install -r requirements.txt and then run the program. So everything should be similar on the server as on the development computer.</p>
<p>Am I doing something wrong here?</p>

<p>That's not what backwards compatible means. You can run a 2.6 script on 2.7, but if you try it the other way round you're likely to run into problems with new features added in 2.7.</p>
<p>If it didn't work like that, it would be impossible ever to add new features.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">2.7 is backwards compatible with 2.6, but 2.6 is not necessarily forwards compatible with 2.7. You should probably try to target the issue that is causing the error.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Python 2.7 being backwards compatiple with 2.6 does not imply that 2.6 is forward compatible with 2.7.

<span class="comment-copy">You're in a virtualenv, why not install the Python version the code is developed for?

<span class="comment-copy">@dylrei Well, the server only has Python version 2.6.6, so that's not possible really.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ArashSaidi Look at the link I provided, it addresses the topic of how to set up a venv with a newer version of Python than what's installed.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I feel so stupid right now. It's late, I have a script I have to run before monday, and I'm really frustrated. I guess I just have to wait until the admin can upgrade python on the server... Thanks for answering!</span>
