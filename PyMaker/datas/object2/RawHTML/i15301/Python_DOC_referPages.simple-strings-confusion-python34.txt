<p>I am REALLY new to this and have been trying to figure this out for a day now. Having a bit of an issue with Python34. Here is my code:</p>
<pre><code>myName = input('What is your name? ')
myVar = input("Enter your age please! ")

if(myName == "Jerome" and myVar == 22):
    print("Welcome back Pilot!")
    print(myName, myVar)
elif(myName == "Steven"):
    print("Steve is cool!")
    print(myName, myVar)
else:
    print("Hello there", myName)
    print(myName, myVar)
</code></pre>
<p>When I input- Jerome <em>enter</em> 22 <em>enter</em> into the console it still goes to the condition by printing:</p>
<pre><code>Hello there Jerome
Jerome 22
</code></pre>
<p>Why is this happening? I also tried messing with the if statement by writing it like this: <code>if(myName == "Jerome") and (myVar == 22):</code> and I <em>still</em> got the same response.</p>

<p>In Python 3, the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>input()</code> function</a> returns a <em>string</em>, but you are trying to compare <code>myVar</code> to an integer. Convert one or the other first. You can use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>int()</code> function</a> to do this:</p>
<pre><code>myVar = int(input("Enter your age please! "))

if myName == "Jerome" and myVar == 22:
</code></pre>
<p>or use:</p>
<pre><code>myVar = input("Enter your age please! ")

if myName == "Jerome" and myVar == "22":
</code></pre>
<p>Converting the user input to an integer has the advantage that you can make other comparisons, like smaller then, or greater then, etc.</p>
<p>You may want to read up on asking for user input with proper error handling, in that context. See <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23294658/asking-the-user-for-input-until-they-give-a-valid-response">Asking the user for input until they give a valid response</a>.</p>

<p>This is the culprit</p>
<pre><code>myVar = input("Enter your age please! ")
</code></pre>
<p><code>input</code> always returns a string</p>
<p>type cast it to <code>int</code> like </p>
<pre><code>myVar = int(input("Enter your age please! "))
</code></pre>
<p><strong>OR</strong></p>
<p>Change your <code>if</code> condition as</p>
<pre><code>if(myName == "Jerome" and myVar == "22"):
</code></pre>
<p>But this is an inferior method, as if you want to use your age somewher else, then it will become a problem</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The method <code>input()</code> returns a string, which is a word or sentence, but you need to make it an integer, a whole number. To do that, just simply type instead of <code>input("Enter your age please")</code>, you need to type <code>int(input("Enter your age please"))</code>. That will turn it into an integer. <strong><em>Hope this helps!</em></strong></p>
