<p>First of all, I am extremely new with coding. </p>
<p>I got the assignment to "Simulate many normally distributed random numbers, then calculate mean and standard deviation." using Python. To begin with, I'm having some difficulties interpreting the question...</p>
<p>Anyway, I think I've figured out how to generate a wished number of random numbers from a standard normal distribution using a for loop (though I'm not sure this is what's asked for). What I'm struggling with is to use these numbers for calculations - since they are random I don't know how to use lists. </p>
<p>Thank You!</p>

<p>You can generate the random numbers using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.gauss" rel="nofollow"><code>random.gauss</code></a>. For example I'll create a list of 10 random numbers, with a mean of <code>10</code> and standard deviation of <code>1</code></p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import random
&gt;&gt;&gt; nums = [random.gauss(10, 1) for _ in range(10)]
&gt;&gt;&gt; nums
[11.959067391283675, 9.736968009359552, 9.034607376861388, 9.431664007796622, 11.522646114577977, 9.777134678502273, 10.954304068858296, 9.641278997034552, 10.671349950944085, 10.795117781051463]
</code></pre>
<p>Then you can use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html" rel="nofollow"><code>statistics</code></a> library to calculate mean and standard deviation.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import statistics as stats

&gt;&gt;&gt; avg = stats.mean(nums)
&gt;&gt;&gt; avg
10.352413837626989   # pretty close to 10

&gt;&gt;&gt; stddv = stats.stdev(nums)
&gt;&gt;&gt; stddv
0.9667002670583574   # pretty close to 1
</code></pre>
<p>You can see that if I generated a lot of random numbers, assuming the <code>random</code> library has a good implementation of sampling numbers from a desired distribution, you will get back approximately the mean and standard deviation you used to describe the original distribution.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Or are you confused with how to calculate mean and std.dev?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Exactly, sampling works fine, but I would like to for every run calculate the mean and std. dev for the sampled data.</span>
