<p>It appears that you are using Python 2, in which <a href="https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/functions.html#input" rel="nofollow"><code>input</code></a> attempts to evaluate what the user types as though it were a Python statement.  You should instead use <a href="https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/functions.html#raw_input" rel="nofollow"><code>raw_input</code></a>, which does not.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>When the script ask you "which option would you like?:" you have to type "D" or 'D' and not D cause the input function, I think you should use <a href="https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/functions.html#raw_input" rel="nofollow">raw_input</a></p>
<p>And you will have an other problem with the line:</p>
<pre><code>total=amount+balance
</code></pre>
<p>you have to add () for call function</p>
<pre><code>total=amount+balance()
</code></pre>
<p>And with this line:</p>
<pre><code>if option =="D":
</code></pre>
<p>Cause option is not define.</p>
<pre><code>option = option()

<p>You will need to indent your code <strong><em>correctly</em></strong> so it looks like this (look up):<br/>
<code>input</code> is only used in Python 3.x. The equivalent of the Python 3.x version is <code>raw_input</code>, the Python 2.x version. Using the same name for a variable and function is not recommended, due to the confusion to come. It is better to rename one of them. If you are using Python 3.x, then you need to fix your indention. Try the <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/" rel="nofollow">Python 2.7 Docs</a> or the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/" rel="nofollow">Python 3.x Docs</a></p>

<span class="comment-copy">Something horrible happened to your code's indentation. Please fix it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hi, and welcome to stackoverflow.  This code wonâ€™t work at all, as it is not indented correctly. Please provide a working code example and more detailed information about the error.
