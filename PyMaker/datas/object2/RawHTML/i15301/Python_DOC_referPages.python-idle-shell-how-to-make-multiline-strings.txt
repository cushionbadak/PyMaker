<p><strong>ANSWERED</strong> (But if for some reason you want to read it you can)</p>
<hr/>
<p>I am a beginner at Python and I know how to type the correct syntax but when I repeat it, it comes out with no extra lines, it just says "\n"</p>
<p>DETAILS ON EXAMPLE BELOW:</p>
<p>My variable is <code>fred</code> and I set it to what it says below, and then on the 3rd line I made it print the text.
Please tell me if I didn't describe it correctly, keep in mind I'm a beginner.</p>
<p>EXAMPLE:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; fred = '''How do dinosaurs pay their bills?
With tyrannosaurus checks!'''
&gt;&gt;&gt; fred
'How do dinosaurs pay their bills?\nWith tyrannosaurus checks!'
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The <code>\n</code> in that string represents the new line symbol. For pretty much all purposes, it <em>is</em> a new line.</p>
<p>What you're doing is correct.</p>
<p>To print the lines on separate lines:</p>
<pre><code>for line in jack.split("\n"):
    print(line)
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">It works for me. What os and python version you use?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Python 3.4.2 Shell, Windows 7 64-bit</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ok. Im on Linux. So cant check. Maybe OS differences are the reason?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm pretty sure the correct behavior is to show the actual newline (and without quotes).  Something is wrong with your interpreter or you're not showing us the entire code.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">When I enter <code>fred</code> directly into the REPL, I get back the <code>\n</code> delimited string, but when I call <code>print(fred)</code> it prints on separate lines, as expected.  <code>sys.version</code> returns <code>'2.7.6 (default, Mar 22 2014, 22:59:56) \n[GCC 4.8.2]'</code>.  As @Rufflewind said, something is wrong with either your installation or your example.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ok in that case, is there a way to make it actually be multi-lined? (Like &lt;br&gt; in HTML)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">put them into separate prints, like <code>map(print, jack.split("\n"))</code>. That's a little bit of a complicated way to do that actually, sorry, added info in answer.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">it's fine, I'm about to learn about maps anyway. Thanks!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Note the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#map" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>map</code></a> function has nothing to do with map data structures (called <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#mapping-types-dict" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>dict</code>s</a> in Python).</span>
