<p>I am working on a project of self driving car, using Raspberry Pi. I have collected the frames and I have the path to each image in a log, which is in csv format. Can I give this path (which is in string form) to keras, so that it can look at those images, while training. My data format looks like this - </p>

<p>Does keras have this feature that it can read files/images directly from the path(which is in string form). Or we have to process these paths so that it can be fed to keras. Thanks in advance for kind support.</p>

<p>Sure, take a look on flow_from_dataframe. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">Are all the images located in the same directory?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">you can use load_img from keras.preprocessing import image</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I was not allowed to insert the image of the data format, so I have given the link for it. Sorry for inconvenience.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes all the images are located in the same directory.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Raj in that case you can use the <a href="https://keras.io/preprocessing/image/#flow_from_directory" rel="nofollow noreferrer">flow_from_directory</a> or <a href="https://keras.io/preprocessing/image/#flow_from_dataframe" rel="nofollow noreferrer">flow_from_dataframe</a> judging from what I'm seeing in your question.</span>
