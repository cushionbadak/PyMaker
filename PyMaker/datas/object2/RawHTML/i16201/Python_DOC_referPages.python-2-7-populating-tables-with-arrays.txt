<p>I need to populate different rows of a table with the correct field, I am currently populating one column using an array, the results of which are gathered by parsing a file (network capture containing packet details).</p>
<p>self.payloads[] is one array for payload data.</p>
<p>self.frames[] is another for frame data.</p>
<p>to populate one column, I currently use:</p>
<pre><code>i=0
for data in self.payloads:
                self.ui.tableWidgetData.insertRow(i)
                self.ui.tableWidgetData.setItem(i, 5, QtGui.QTableWidgetItem(data))
                i+=1
</code></pre>
<p>How would I use 5 arrays to populate a table?</p>

<p>I think what you're looking for is <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#zip" rel="nofollow"><code>zip</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>i=0
for payload, frame, otherthing in zip(self.payloads, self.frames, self.otherthings):
    self.ui.tableWidgetData.insertRow(i)
        self.ui.tableWidgetData.setItem(i, 3, QtGui.QTableWidgetItem(frame))
        self.ui.tableWidgetData.setItem(i, 5, QtGui.QTableWidgetItem(payload))
        self.ui.tableWidgetData.setItem(i, 6, QtGui.QTableWidgetItem(other thing))
        i+=1
</code></pre>
<p><code>zip</code> takes a bunch of separate iterables (like your lists) and zips them together into a single iterable, where each element is a value from each input. This is how you iterate over a bunch of separate iterables in lock-step. For example:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = [0, 1, 2]
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = [3, 4, 5]
&gt;&gt;&gt; for i, j in zip(a, b):
...     print i, j
0 3
1 4
2 5
</code></pre>
<hr/>
<p>As a side note, you don't need to maintain a counter manually like you're doing with <code>i</code>. See the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#enumerate" rel="nofollow"><code>enumerate</code></a> function:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; for index, i in enumerate(['a', 'b', 'c']):
...     print index, i
0 a
1 b
2 c
</code></pre>

<p><code>map</code> is one option.</p>
<pre><code>a = [0, 1, 2, 3]

b = [0, 1, 2, 3]

for i,j in map(None,a,b):
    print i,j 
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">What does this have to do with packets? Just attaching random tags to a question is not going to get you more answers, it's going to get you downvotes from people who are experts in an area that's irrelevant to your question and not experts in what you're actually asking about.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Meanwhile, it's not very clear from your question, but I think what you may be looking for is <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#zip" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>zip</code></a>. That will let you iterate over all 5 arrays in the same loop.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sorry, thought i'd mentioned what I was parsing</span>
<span class="comment-copy">And do you think that's relevant to your problem? Is someone who knows everything about network packets but nothing about Python, Qt, etc. going to be useful in solving your problem?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">While you can (ab)use <code>map</code> for this, you really should use <code>zip</code> when what you want to do is zip together multiple iterables. It's not actually documented that <code>map</code> can take <code>None</code> as a function.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you, zip works, an is probably better.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@abarnert - the docs do describe None as a function argument for map and the resultant affect.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@wwii: I was sure that was removed from the docs in 2.7, butâ€¦ I guess not, only in 3.3.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@abarnert - using <code>None</code> as the function argument to <code>map</code> in v3.3 throws <code>TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not callable</code>.  Probably why it was removed from the docs.</span>
