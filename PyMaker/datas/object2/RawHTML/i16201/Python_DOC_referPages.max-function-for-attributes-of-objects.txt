<p>I wonder, what might be the most pythonic way to use <code>max</code> on a list of objects regarding a specific attribute. Assume there is this class:</p>
<pre><code>class Foo():
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
</code></pre>
<p>Now there is a list of <code>Foo</code>s:</p>
<pre><code>foos = [Foo(2), Foo(3), Foo(1)]
</code></pre>
<p>I want to have the maximum <i>value</i> of this list.</p>
<p>I could use <code>max</code> on a list:</p>
<pre><code>max_value = max([foo.value for foo in foos])
</code></pre>
<p>This would always construct a list first (might reduce performance on huge lists), so I thought of using the <code>key</code> argument:</p>
<pre><code>max_value = max(foos, key=lambda foo: foo.value).value
</code></pre>
<p>This looks a bit ugly to me, since I don’t get the attribute, but the object.</p>
<p>I could also define the <code>__eq__</code>, <code>__le__</code> functions inside <code>Foo</code>, but this would limit the use of <code>max</code> to a specific value, I could not use <code>max</code> for more than one attribute.</p>
<p>Is there another way, to get the maximum value in a nice pythonic way?</p>

<p>Slightly better with a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#generator-expressions">generator expression</a>:</p>
<pre><code>max_value = max(foo.value for foo in foos)
# instead of:
# max_value = max([foo.value for foo in foos])
</code></pre>
<p>This is plenty Pythonic, not sure if it can get any better than this.</p>
