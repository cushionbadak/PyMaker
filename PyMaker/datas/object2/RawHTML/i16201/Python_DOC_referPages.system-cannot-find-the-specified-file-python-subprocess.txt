<p>I am trying to run a simple command in python:</p>
<pre><code>from subprocess import *    
check_output("ls")
</code></pre>
<p>When I run this it raises </p>
<pre><code>Error:
WindowsError: [Error 2] The system cannot find the file specified
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>ls</code> doesn’t exist on Windows; <code>dir</code> does.  Furthermore, you may need to pass <code>shell=True</code>, since it’s built in to <code>cmd.exe</code>.</p>
<p>If it’s not a test and you just want to get the contents of a directory, use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.listdir" rel="nofollow"><code>os.listdir</code></a> instead.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Give the full path to the check_output and don't rely on the default</span>
<span class="comment-copy">hi, but how come the example showed in web always use "ls" as example? that mean I need to run the python in UNIX? why need to put the shell=True?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user37970: They probably used it because if it is a UNIX system, it’s going to be there. I’m not sure what else they’d have used that would be a whole lot more platform-independent except perhaps <code>echo</code>, but that’s even more likely to be a shell built-in. It needs <code>shell=True</code> because there’s no <code>dir.exe</code> (as far as I know); the functionality is built into <code>cmd.exe</code>, the shell.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">get it!!thanks,u clear all my cloud,um,have another question,do you know how to link html files with python file? or python file with perl files?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user37970: I’m not entirely sure what you’re asking. If you want to make some Python code that generates HTML web-accessible, you could use a CGI script. If you want to call a Perl script from Python, you could use the <code>subprocess</code> module as you were testing here. If you can express your problem more clearly, you can ask another question.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ocktoofay, sorry for the vague statement,I am newbie to python, let say, I have a perl scipt on UNIX: trial.pl print ("hello" world");  and python is on window: Python SCipt: subprocess.call("perl trial.pl",shell=True)  it print "1"</span>
