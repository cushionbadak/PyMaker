<p>I just found out it's not possible to write to a specific line in a csv file (only the end). </p>
<p>I have just come across another obstacle that I'm having trouble tackling, which is reading from a specific line in a csv file. 
One way I have found to accomplish this is:</p>
<pre><code>with open('file.csv',newline = '') as csvfile:
    spamreader = csv.reader(csvfile,delimiter=',',quotechar = '"')
    lines = []
    for row in spamreader:
        lines.append(row)

print('What line do you want to read from?')
line = lines[int(input())-1] #I think the -1 is right. since lists start at 0
</code></pre>
<p>However, I believe that this might be a slightly inefficient way to do this, since the more rows in the list "lines", the more RAM the program would be using. </p>
<p>Could someone tell me if this is actually an efficient way of doing this? Otherwise, I will just go with this. </p>
<p>Is there any way that I can do something like this?</p>
<pre><code>spamreader.readRow(5) #I just made this up, but is there a similar function?
</code></pre>
<p>This is the page that I've been using, it's possible I skipped over it. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html" rel="nofollow">https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html</a></p>
<p>Also, I'm not very advanced in programming, so if there is an advanced answer, can you try to keep the explanations fairly simple?</p>

<p>If you want to read starting from line 123:</p>
<pre><code>for _ in range(122): 
    spamreader.next()
for row in spamreader:
    ...
</code></pre>
<p>With Python 3 it seems to be</p>
<pre><code>    next(spamreader)
</code></pre>
<p>One can also navigate in the file by moving the cursor to a specific byte using <code>find</code> and <code>seek</code>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I looked at both of your solutions, and I tried every answer on each page, and none of them worked. Although this may cause for a long comment, I disagree that my question has already been answered in your links. (I can be wrong!) First: I tried using the enumerate method. I wasn't sure exactly how to get this to work. The top answer said "If i == line_number: #line_number -1"... Not really sure what to do with that.  Second: I tried using linecache, in the fashion of "line = linecache.getline('file.csv',int(input())", but this raised numerous errors.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Third: I tried using "selection = [row for row in header if row[2] == 'a']  I don't think that this will work because I would like to give a line number, and jump to that line. The reason this doesn't work is because I do not believe there is a way to extract the line number from the row. If you look at the example that the OP gave, he was creating a list of possible selected rows if a specific "cell" contained certain information.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This gives me the error: '_csv.reader' object has no attribute 'next'</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I did not try with Python 3, try this: <code>next(spamreader)</code> (<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.csvreader.__next__" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.csvreader.__next__</a>). For me (Python 2.7, csv 1.0), it works. What does <code>dir(spamreader)</code> return for you?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Darn, I can't believe I didn't catch that. Thank you very much, you have solved my problem :). The way I managed to get this to work was:  <code>for row in range(int(input()):     chosenRow = next(spamreader)</code> And then I can do whatever I want with chosenRow. Thank you very much.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Great. Then accept the answer :) especially since it is better than the ones in the posts advised above...</span>
