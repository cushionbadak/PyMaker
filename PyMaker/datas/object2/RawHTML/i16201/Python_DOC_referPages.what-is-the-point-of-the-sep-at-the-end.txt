<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>In python.org, What's New in Python 3? it gives this example of the print function:</p>
<pre><code>print("There are &lt;", 2**32, "&gt; possibilities!", sep="")
</code></pre>
<p>which produces:</p>
<pre><code>There are &lt;4294967296&gt; possibilities!
</code></pre>
<p>What is the point of the <code>sep=""</code> at the end of the print function? Surely the meaning is obvious without it.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The <em>default</em> value for <code>sep</code> is a space. By setting it to an <em>empty</em> value you print without spaces between the 3 inputs.</p>
<p>You could easily have tried this without the <code>sep</code> argument to see the difference:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print("There are &lt;", 2**32, "&gt; possibilities!", sep="")
There are &lt;4294967296&gt; possibilities!
&gt;&gt;&gt; print("There are &lt;", 2**32, "&gt; possibilities!")
There are &lt; 4294967296 &gt; possibilities!
</code></pre>
<p>Note the spaces between the <code>&lt;</code>, the outcome of the <code>2**32</code> expression and the <code>&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>The <em>point</em> then is to control how <code>print()</code> outputs the given arguments, something that was not possible in Python 2 where <code>print</code> is a statement.</p>
<p>Perhaps a different example would illustrate this better:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; sample = ['foo', 42, 'bar', 81.0]
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(*sample, sep='\n')
foo
42
bar
81.0
</code></pre>
<p>By setting the separator to a <em>newline character</em> I made <code>print()</code> write all arguments out on separate lines instead.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Just got stackoverflow confused with google temporarily!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You don't need Google if you read the documentation.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Am assuming the asterisk means 'contents of'.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@mistermarko: <code>*args</code> expands the <code>args</code> to become separate arguments to the <code>print()</code> call.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">There's a bug in the system. I upvoted it when I meant to accept it (which I have now done) so I then immediately downvoted it. The system should change so ups and downs from the same IP address cancel and are not counted. Sorry for the confusion.</span>
