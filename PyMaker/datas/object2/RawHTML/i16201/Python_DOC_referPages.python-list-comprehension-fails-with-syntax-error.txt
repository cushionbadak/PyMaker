<p>I was doing excercise no.3 from <a href="http://cscircles.cemc.uwaterloo.ca/15b-python-pushups/" rel="nofollow">http://cscircles.cemc.uwaterloo.ca/15b-python-pushups/</a>, I made the code work but was wondering if it was possible to do it in fewer lines? Here is my solution:</p>
<pre><code>los = [] # short for list of strings
while True:
   s = input()
   if s == '###': break
   los += s.lower().split() # making a list of lower case words from the input     sentences
test = []
for x in los:
   test += str(los.count(x)) # made a new list of the frequency of each word
a = test.index(max(test)) # variable a provides the location of them most frequent word
print (los[a]) # we know the position of the most frequent string, so find it in los.
# a is not needed but it looks neater
</code></pre>
<p>So this part in particular is what i'm not happy with:</p>
<pre><code>    for x in los:
       test += str(los.count(x))
</code></pre>
<p>I want to re write it like:</p>
<pre><code>test += str(list.count(x)) for x in los
</code></pre>
<p>but it tells me invalid syntax..any tips?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I think the syntax you want is:</p>
<pre><code>  # No need for test = []
  test = [str(list.count(x)) for x in los]
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Just put this after the while loop: <code>print(max(los, key=los.count))</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@grc thanks that worked but I don't understand how that line actually works (at all), could you please explain it?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@VimalKarsan the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#max" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>max</code></a> function takes a list (or other iterable) and returns the largest element. When a key is specified, it returns the element with the largest key. So in this case, <code>max</code> calls <code>los.count()</code> on each item in <code>los</code> and returns the item with the highest count.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@grc awesome, thanks.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yeah, that's what i was looking for, thanks a lot</span>
