<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I'm trying to save a list, only containing strings, so it can be accessed later. Someone told me to use pickling. I was hoping for an example and some understanding of what pickling is.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Pickling will serialize your list (convert it, and it's entries to a unique byte string), so you can save it to disk.  You can also use pickle to retrieve your original list, loading from the saved file.</p>
<p>So, first build a list, then use <code>pickle.dump</code> to send it to a file...</p>

<span class="comment-copy">The easiest method is <code>repr</code> with <code>eval</code> if you don't care about speed and security.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What does the list contain?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The list just contains strings</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Then <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>json</code></a> is the lighter-weight option.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It's a heavy story in that list of strings Mike... Thank you anyway !</span>
