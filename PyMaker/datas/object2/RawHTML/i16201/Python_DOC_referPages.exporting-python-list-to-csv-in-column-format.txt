<p>right now I have Python 3 code that takes a column of data within a CSV file and then delimits the phrases in each cell into individual words based on spaces.  </p>
<p>What I am trying to do now is export that data back into a CSV file in Column format so that it looks like this with each cell containing one word</p>
<pre><code>Keyword
Lions
Tigers
Bears
Dog
Cats
</code></pre>
<p>Right now, my code exports the data to a CSV file but instead of coming in as a column format, it comes through in rows.</p>
<pre><code>Keyword    Lions    Tigers     Bears     Dog    Cats
</code></pre>
<p>When I print my code in the interpreter, it comes through correctly in a column format but not when I export it!  Here is my code</p>
<pre><code>with open(b'C:\Users\j\Desktop\helloworld.csv', 'r') as datafile:
    data = []
    for row in datafile:
        data.extend(item.strip() for item in row.split())
with open('test.csv', 'w') as a_file:
    for result in data:
        result = ''.join(result)
        a_file.write(result + ',')
        print(result)
</code></pre>
<p>Does anyone have any ideas how to transpose the data?  Thank you!</p>

<p>You can use</p>
<pre><code>"\n"
</code></pre>
<p>to make it written in the next row.</p>
<pre><code>with open(b'C:\Users\j\Desktop\helloworld.csv', 'r') as datafile:
  data = []
  for row in datafile:
    data.extend(item.strip() for item in row.split())
with open('test.csv', 'w') as a_file:
  for result in data:
    result = ''.join(result)
    a_file.write(result + '\n')  &lt;--
    print(result)

<p>Since version 2.3, Python has had <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html" rel="nofollow">a builtin module for parsing csv data</a>.  Is there any reason you can't use that?</p>
<p>To give an answer, specifically on your code, though, here's what I notice:</p>
<pre><code>    a_file.write(result + ',')
    print(result)
</code></pre>
<p>You're writing the data to the file appended with a comma, and printing it to the command line separately. So it shows up on the command line with one output on each line, but it's getting printed to the file as:</p>
<pre><code>result1,result2,result3,result4...
</code></pre>
<p>All CSV files are slightly different, but commas generally delimit fields, while newlines delimit rows. You're getting exactly what you're outputting: one row with all of your values on it, in separate comma-delimited fields.  Try this instead:</p>
<pre><code>    a_file.write(result + '\n')
</code></pre>
<p>If you're in Python 3, then you can also use the print function:</p>
<pre><code>    print(result, file=a_file)
</code></pre>

<p>I don't know what <code>result</code>looks like, but I would say that you need to specify that you want to go to next line : </p>
<pre><code>with open('test.csv', 'w') as a_file:
    for result in data:
        result = ''.join(result)
        a_file.write(result + ',') # if you want to keep the coma, or replace ',' by '\n'
        a_file.write("\n")
        print(result)
</code></pre>
<p>However, it's weird you don't get coma in your output, hope this helps anyway.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">What is <code>data</code>? Could you add the output of <code>print(data)</code> to the post?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">fantastic -- simple and effective!</span>
