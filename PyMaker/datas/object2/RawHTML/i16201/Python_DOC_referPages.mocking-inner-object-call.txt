<p>Here is my code that is under test -</p>
<pre><code>client = Client('http://www.w3schools.com/webservices/tempconvert.asmx')
client.service.CelsiusToFahrenheit('1234')
</code></pre>
<p>Here is my test - </p>
<pre><code>@patch.object(Client.service, 'CelsiusToFahrenheit')
def test_method_call(self, mock):
    converted = convert('1234')
    mock.assert_called_once_with('1234')
</code></pre>
<p>I'm trying to mock using <code>patch.object</code> the <code>CelsiusToFahrenheit()</code> method call, however I keep getting exceptions that say <code>AttributeError: type object 'Client' has no attribute 'service'</code>. I've tried many variations and everything fails with similar exceptions.</p>
<p>My goal is to ensure <code>CelsiusToFahrenheit()</code> gets called with the appropriate parameter, 1234. How can I make this happen?</p>
<p>Alternatively, are there any other ways of achieving this? Would using <code>Mock</code> instead be more appropriate?</p>
</div>

<p>You're patching the wrong thing, it looks like you don't need <code>patch.object</code> but just the usual patch.  </p>
<pre><code>@patch('path.where.Client.imported.Client.service.CelsiusToFahrenheit')
def test_method_call(self, mock):
    converted = convert('1234')
    mock.assert_called_once_with('1234')
</code></pre>
<p>Additionally make sure the path through which the <code>CelsiusToFahrenheit</code> method is imported (via <code>convert</code> here) is where you're patching, as opposed to the path where the <code>CelsiusToFahrenheit</code> method is <em>defined</em> (see <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html#where-to-patch" rel="nofollow">where to patch</a>).</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I'm messing around with the paths, but can't seem to pinpoint it. Is there an easy way to determine exactly the path I need?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It's not easy.. I still get it wrong sometimes too.  Read through the link "where to patch"</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you. Unfortunately, I can't upvote you since I don't have enough rep.</span>
