<p>I have set up a Python Django projects. I have made a number of web services. But sometimes the data being logged is somewhat large and it takes like 3-4 seconds to log due to which response of service is delayed for few seconds which is a big factor in terms of performance. </p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> I was just wondering how can I make logging kind of asynchronous? Does Django provide like an option for this? OR do I have to take some other approach and handle it myself like open another thread and do logging in it? </p>

<p>You can use <code>QueueHandler</code> amd <code>QueueListener</code> which are available for Python 2.x through the <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/logutils" rel="nofollow"><code>logutils</code></a> package. <a href="http://plumberjack.blogspot.co.uk/2010/09/improved-queuehandler-queuelistener.html" rel="nofollow">This post</a> has more details, as do <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.handlers.html#queuehandler" rel="nofollow">the relevant Python 3.x docs</a>.</p>
