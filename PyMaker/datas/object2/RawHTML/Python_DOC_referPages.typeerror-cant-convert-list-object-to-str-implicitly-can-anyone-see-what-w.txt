<p>I am fairly new to python as my school teaches visual basic using the .NET framework and I recently got a Raspberry Pi 3B+.
I am trying to create a program that I was recently asked to create on Visual Basic. 
I have looked at other forms on this TypeError but cannot see a way to fix my code.</p>
<pre><code>Ending = ["ing","end","axe","gex","goh"]

while True:
    try:
        NameNumber_Input = input("Enter Number of Names To Be Created: ")
        NameNumber = int(NameNumber_Input)
        print(NameNumber_Input +" Users Will Be Created")
    except ValueError:
        print("Invalid Input, Please Try Again")
    else:
        break

Names=[]
for i in range (NameNumber):
    data=input("Enter Name: ")
    Names.append(data)

for i in range (NameNumber):
    print("Name: "+Names[0:NameNumber])
    import random
    for x in range(1):
        EndingNumber = random.randint(0,4)
        print("Username: "+str(Names[0][0:3])+str(Ending[EndingNumber]))
</code></pre>
<p>The Purpose is to have an inputted number of "Usernames" Created from the first 3 letters of the entered names and have one of the endings randomly selected to be put at the end of the three letters.</p>
<p><strong>These are the lines With Errors</strong>
print("Name: "+Names[0:NameNumber])
print("Username: "+str(Names[0][0:3])+str(Ending[EndingNumber]))
<strong>This is the Error</strong>
TypeError: Can't convert 'list' object to str implicitly</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>make two changes in your code <code>print("Name: "+Names[i])</code> instead <code>print("Name: "+Names[0:NameNumber])</code>
and <code>print("Username: "+str(Names[i][0:3])+str(Ending[EndingNumber]))</code> instead <code>print("Username: "+str(Names[0][0:3])+str(Ending[EndingNumber]))</code></p>

<ul>
<li>Cause:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>    Names = []
    print("Name: "+Names[0:NameNumber])
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>Names</code> here is a list type. You are add a string to a list. Python must make explicit type convertion and add operatoration between string and list is not allowed. So raise Type Error.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fix:
I guess you are tring to go throught the Names and print element out.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>    print("Name: "+Names[i])
</code></pre>
<p>But the program you write has some other logic/data structure problems so it cannot results corrcectly I think. I suggesut you read some python tutorials first to have a basic understanding of python data structure...</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>In your loop, you want the <em>i</em>th name (the name at index <em>i</em>).</p>
<p>Replace by:</p>
<pre><code>for i in range(NameNumber):
    print("Name: " + Names[i])
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>for x in range(1):</code> is a useless loop.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you, I have now removed this, I am still having an issue with my TypeError, I am not entirely confident in python and don't fully understand the error, would you be able to provide an explanation? "TypeError: Can't convert 'list' object to str implicitly" Error for print("Name: "+Names[0:NameNumber])</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You should use the <a href="https://pep8.org" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PEP8</a> naming convention: variables in lowercase (snake_case).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you, Do you know of any tutorials that include examples? I have been considering buying a book or two but I am not sure of any.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Frazzled  Python Official Documents is a good start: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/tutorial</a>, especially chapter 3-5 will help understand and resolve this program. Also you can search <code>python tutorials</code> on youtube to get  some video tutorials.</span>
