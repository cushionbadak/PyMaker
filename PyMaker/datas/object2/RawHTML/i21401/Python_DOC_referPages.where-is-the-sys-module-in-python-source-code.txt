<p>I have found most python modules in python source directory, under Python/Lib or Python/Modules ,but where is the sys (import sys) module ? I didn't find it .</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<h2>The Answer</h2>
<p>I find it here: <code>./Python/sysmodule.c</code></p>
<p>If you're on Linux or Mac OS X, and in doubt, just try <code>find . -name 'sysmodule.c'</code> in the Python directory.</p>
<h2>Other Stuff</h2>
<p>The way I found it was by searching for the string <code>"platform"</code> throughout the Python directory (using TextMate), as I've used e.g. <code>sys.platform</code> before from the <code>sys</code> module... something similar can be done with <code>grep</code> and <code>xargs</code>.</p>
<p>Another suggestion could be : <code>for i in ./**/*.c ; do grep -H platform $i ; done</code></p>
<p>This will loop through all <code>*.c</code> files present in anywhere up the file tree you're currently located at, and search the file for <code>"platform"</code>. The <code>-H</code> flag will ensure we get a filename path so we can trace the matches back to the files they are found in.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>It's in <code>Python/Python/sysmodule.c</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>import sys
help(sys)
</code></pre>
<p>Then you will see something like the following:</p>
<pre><code>Help on built-in module sys:

NAME
    sys

FILE
    (built-in)
</code></pre>
<p>In my working environment, <strong>sys</strong> is built into python itself.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">If you're using *nix, this command pattern is quite useful to find files with a portion of a string (such as "sys") in them: <code>find ./* | grep -i sys</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Mike Pennington thank you, It really works well</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Cool. Now, where are the pydocs source for this module, which I suppose is what I was really looking for.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MichaelScheper : are these the docs, perhaps?   <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is useful because it works for other modules, like <code>unittest</code> that I was looking for today.</span>
