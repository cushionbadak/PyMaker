<p>I have a script that requires Python 2.6. I will be adding a large-ish pickled database to the next version, and I want to use the fastest version of pickling. How can I tell which versions of pickling are available in <em>every</em> version of Python 2.6 and later?</p>

<p>Like so:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import pickle
&gt;&gt;&gt; pickle.compatible_formats
['1.0', '1.1', '1.2', '1.3', '2.0']
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>
<p>I think it's safe to rely on the latest documentation. For example the <a href="http://docs.python.org/release/3.2.1/library/pickle.html#data-stream-format" rel="noreferrer">pickle documentation for Python 3.2.1</a> states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are currently 4 different protocols which can be used for
  pickling.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Protocol version 0 is the original human-readable protocol and is    backwards compatible with earlier versions of Python.</p></li>
<li><p>Protocol version 1 is the old binary format which is also compatible    with earlier versions of Python.</p></li>
<li><p>Protocol version 2 was introduced in Python 2.3. It provides much    more efficient pickling of new-style classes.</p></li>
<li><p>Protocol version 3 was added in Python 3.0. It has explicit support    for bytes and cannot be unpickled by Python 2.x pickle modules. This<br/>
  is the current recommended protocol, use it whenever it is possible.</p></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I think that makes it easy to confirm!</p>
<p>To explicitly answer your question, this means Python 2.6-2.7 support Pickle versions &lt;= 2.0, and Python 3.0-3.2 support Pickle versions &lt;= 3.0.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">That tells me the versions of pickle in my current runtime. I want to know the version of pickle available to <i>anyone</i> running <i>any</i> version of 2.6 or later.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I updated my answer to be more explicit. :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Indeed, and that does answer it better, thanks!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">There are now 5 protocols, with version 4 added in Python 3.4. See <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html#data-stream-format" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html#data-stream-format</a></span>
