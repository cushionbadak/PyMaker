<p>I am creating a game and I have found out so far the most common save program, pickle, can only save/load while the program is on. The game I am making would take a long time to complete, and I don't think people would like to restart the game every time they quit. Is there a program I can import/download to save the variables elsewhere so they can be loaded again?</p>

<p>I don't know what you mean by this.</p>
<p>In the strictest sense, it's true -- a program can't do <em>anything</em> if it's not running!</p>
<p>But it seems like you meant that a file saved with pickle would vanish when the program quits, and that is certainly not true.</p>
<p>Pickle is a perfectly reasonable way to save the game progress between play sessions.  Save the file before quitting, load the file on the next startup, boom you're back where you left off.</p>

<span class="comment-copy"><i>"can only save/load while the program is on"</i> - This is equivalent to saying Word isn't good enough because you can't load or save a file when your computer is off. Like everything, pickle will save to a file. The file isn't going to disappear when you close the program.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">let me get a little more specific. When you setup up pickle on a program, and initiate the action of saving(temporarly in my case, pressing "s") it will save the variables requested as determined by the save code. when(in my case, the "l" key) you do the loading action, it will load the varibles right back up how you save them.  It works fine. Until the program is closed. If you try to load after launching the program agin, it wont. It will throw out an error bascically saying there is nothing to load, even though you saved it earlier. Im looking for a way around this so it can load up proprly</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Show us that code.  You have a mistake in it somewhere.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"># saving with open('savefile.dat', 'wb') as f:     pickle.dump([x1], f, protocol=2)  # loading with open('savefile.dat', 'rb') as f:     [x1] = pickle.load(f</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What error do you get?  Also why are you putting brackets around <code>[x1]</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">[x1] = pickle.load(f) ValueError: need more than 1 value to unpack</span>
