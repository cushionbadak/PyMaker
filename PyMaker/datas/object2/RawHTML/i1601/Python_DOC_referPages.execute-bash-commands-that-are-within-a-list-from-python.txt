<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>i got this list</p>
<pre><code>commands = ['cd var','cd www','cd html','sudo rm -r folder']
</code></pre>
<p>I'm trying to execute one by one all the elements inside as a bash script, with no success. Do i need a for loop here?</p>
<p>how to achieve that?, thanks all!!!! </p>

<pre><code>for command in commands:
    os.system(command)
</code></pre>
<p>is one way you could do it ... although just cd'ing into a bunch of directories isnt going to have much impact</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong> this will run each command in its own subshell ... so they would not remember their state (ie any directory changes or environmental variables)</p>
<p>if you need to run them all in one subshell than you need to chain them together with "&amp;&amp;"</p>
<pre><code>os.system(" &amp;&amp; ".join(commands)) # would run all of the commands in a single subshell
</code></pre>
<p>as noted in the comments, in general it is preferred to use subprocess module with <code>check_call</code> or one of the other variants. however in this specific instance i personally think that you are in a 6 to 1 half a dozen to the other, and <code>os.system</code> was less typing (and its gonna exist whether you are using python3.7 or python2.5 ... but in general use <code>subprocess</code> exactly which call probably depends on the version of python you are using ... there is a great description in the post linked in the comments by @triplee <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4256107/running-bash-commands-in-python/51950538#51950538">why you should use subprocess instead</a>)</p>
<p>really you should reformat your commands to simply</p>
<p><code>commands = ["sudo rm -rf var/www/html/folder"]</code> note that you will probably need to add your python file to your sudoers file </p>
<p>also Im not sure exactly what you are trying to accomplish here ... but i suspect this might not be the ideal way to go about it (although it should work...)</p>

<p>This is just a suggestion, but if your just wanting to change directories and delete folders, you could use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.chdir" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>os.chdir()</code></a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html#shutil.rmtree" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>shutil.rmtree()</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>from os import chdir
from os import getcwd
from shutil import rmtree

directories = ['var','www','html','folder']

print(getcwd())
# current working directory: $PWD

for directory in directories[:-1]:
    chdir(directory)

print(getcwd())
# current working directory: $PWD/var/www/html

rmtree(directories[-1])
</code></pre>
<p>Which will <code>cd</code> three directories deep into <code>html</code>, and delelte <code>folder</code>. The current working directory changes when you call <code>chdir()</code>, as seen when you call <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.getcwd" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>os.getcwd()</code></a>. </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>declare -a command=("cd var","cd www","cd html","sudo rm -r folder")

## now loop through the above array
for i in "${command[@]}"
do
echo "$i"
# or do whatever with individual element of the array
done

# You can access them using echo "${arr[0]}", "${arr[1]}" also

<span class="comment-copy">You could condense the <code>cd</code> commands into one command, then use Bash's <code>&amp;&amp;</code> (and) operator: <code>os.system("cd var/www/html/ &amp;&amp; sudo rm -r folder")</code></span>

<span class="comment-copy">This won't work because <code>cd var</code> will run in a subprocess, then the next command runs in the (unchanged) directory of the parent Python process.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">the condition that they all run in the same subshell was not stipulated ... but i can see how the OP would  potentially desire that behaviour</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No, it wasn't spelled out, and probably the OP doesn't even realize this; but this is a common enough bug with subprocesses.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Alao you should prefer <code>subprocess.run()</code> or <code>subprocess.check_call()</code> over <code>os.system()</code>; see the post I linked from another comment above.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">none of the <i>compelling</i> reasons to do that apply here imho .... its really 6 to 1 half a dozen to the other ... in fact he is using commands that would require <code>shell=True</code> so its pretty extra moot ... that said in general yes... this was just less typing</span>
<span class="comment-copy">this is awesome :) I think they were asking how to do it in python but this is great! thanks!</span>
