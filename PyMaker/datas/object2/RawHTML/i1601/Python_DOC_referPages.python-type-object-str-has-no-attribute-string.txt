<p>I've searched around and found similar questions, but cannot seem to figure out how to apply it to my issue. I'm creating a shape with a predefined size, but first I need to figure out how to add/multiply the "-" character by a certain number and print it within classes. Here's my code:</p>
<pre><code>def __str__(self):

    string = "-" * 4
    return string

def main():

    print(str.string)
    return
main()
</code></pre>
<p>end goal is to create a box like this:
<img alt="enter image description here" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Vz32Q.png"/></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Let me tell you one thing! creating function in the name of keywords is not preferred as the compiler may not behave expected! So calling str.Variable_name creates problem </p>
<p>Just make your code like this :</p>
<pre><code>def get_box():
    return '-'*3

print(get_box())
</code></pre>
<p>This should work! Let me know if not -</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong></p>
<pre><code>Class Box(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self.box = "-"

    def __str__(self):
        return self.box*3

#create an object
box = Box()
print(box)
</code></pre>
<p>Check and let me know whether this works...</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Add and multiply are 2 different things:</p>
<pre><code>In [2243]: '-' * 3
Out[2243]: '---'

In [2245]: '-' + str(3)
Out[2245]: '-3'
</code></pre>
<p>Choose which one you want.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">What is your expected results?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I added a picture. The first line would be just like this - - - -</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That definition of <code>__str__()</code> is useless -- it doesn't return anything.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I fixed it. That's what I meant to have put down, sorry.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/tutorial</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>print(get_box())</code> You forgot the <code>()</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I would do that, however I have to use the class <b>str</b> for the string portion of this project, as we are learning about classes in my programming class. He wrote out a bunch of pre-made classes and we have to fill in the missing portions.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You didnt mention that it is inside a class! Fine, now i have updated my answer accordingly, do check and let me Know if it helps! @JohnGordon thanks for finding it out! i edited!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You are a LIFESAVER THANK YOU!!! :):):)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Glad that it helped :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">First one. Just so I can get the top of the box printed off. I added a picture of the end result.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I just need help fixing the "Type object 'str' has no attribute 'string' error</span>
