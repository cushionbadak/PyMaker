<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/codecs.html#python-specific-encodings" rel="nofollow noreferrer">This link</a> lists out some python specific encodings.</p>
<p>One of the encoding is "unicode_escape".</p>
<p>I am just trying to figure out, is this special encoding really needed?</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; l = r'C:\Users\userx\toot'
&gt;&gt;&gt; l
'C:\\Users\\userx\\toot'
&gt;&gt;&gt; l.encode('unicode_escape').decode()
'C:\\\\Users\\\\userx\\\\toot'
</code></pre>
<p>If you could see above, 'l' which is a unicode object, has already taken care of escaping the backslashes. Converting it to "unicode_escape" encoding adds one more set of escaped backslashes which doesn't make any sense to me.</p>
<p>Questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is "unicode_escape" encoding really needed?</li>
<li>why did "unicode_escape" added one more sets of backslashes above?</li>
</ol>

<p>Quoting <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/codecs.html#python-specific-encodings" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the document you linked</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Encoding suitable as the contents of a Unicode literal in ASCII-encoded Python source code, except that quotes are not escaped. Decodes from Latin-1 source code. Beware that Python source code actually uses UTF-8 by default.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, <code>print(l.encode('unicode_escape').decode())</code> does something <em>almost exactly equivalent to</em> <code>print(repr(l))</code>, except that it doesn't add quotes on the outside and escape quotes on the inside of the string.</p>
<p>When you leave off the <code>print()</code>, the REPL does a default <code>repr()</code>, so you get backslashes escaped twice -- exactly the same thing as happens when you run <code>&gt;&gt;&gt; repr(l)</code>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">If you <code>print(l)</code> you'll see that in the actual content of the string, the backslashes are not escaped. The <code>repr</code> version of a string escapes backslashes in order to show it unambiguously to you, the developer.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why do you think <code>unicode_escape()</code> <i>is</i> or <i>would be</i> needed for your use case? Just because something exists doesn't mean it's meaningful or relevant to you.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@CharlesDuffy i am writing a python script which takes a windows style path as an argument. As such the script is working without any issues. i just wanted to make sure are there any cases where in i have to convert the arg input using "unicode_escape"?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The purpose of <code>unicode_escape()</code> is to generate content that can be substituted directly into a plain-ASCII Python source file. You aren't doing that, so you don't need it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@CharlesDuffy Could you give me an example where one has to "generate content that can be substituted directly into a plain-ASCII Python source file"?</span>
