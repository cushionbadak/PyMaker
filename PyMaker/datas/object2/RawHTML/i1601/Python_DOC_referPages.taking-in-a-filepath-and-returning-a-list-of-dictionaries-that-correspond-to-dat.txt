<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>input(s) to this function:
filepath: a string representation of the full path to a json file</p>
<p>This function will be taking in a filepath and returning a list of dictionaries that correspond to the tweet data that was in the .json file.</p>
<p>Take note here that the key of the dictionaries in the original JSON files is the tweet_id, which becomes a new field in the output JSON.</p>
<p>Above are the directions for a function that I am looking to create.</p>
<p>I am given 
def read_json_file(filepath)</p>
<p>Any suggestions on what to do would be much appreciated as I am struggling where to get started.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Check out the python JSON module: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html</a></p>
<p>It should be as simple as reading the file into <code>json.load()</code>. Try something like:</p>
<pre><code>import json
filename = "my_file.json"
with open(filename, 'r') as my_file:
    x = json.load(my_file)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">This is impossible to answer without a reproducible example sorry. Descriptions of code are not helpful.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Fair enough, updated to reflect that.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Looks great, exactly what OP needs. And +1 for documentation link.</span>
