<p>I have a list of lists as following:</p>
<pre><code>G = [[1,2,3],[2,3,5],[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[4,5,6]]
</code></pre>
<p>How can I find count of unique lists in G?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you want the count of each sublist, the easiest way is to convert them to tuples and feed them to a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.Counter" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>Counter</code></a>.</p>
<pre><code>from collections import Counter

G = [[1,2,3],[2,3,5],[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[4,5,6]]

print(Counter(map(tuple, G)))
# Counter({(1, 2, 3): 2, (4, 5, 6): 2, (2, 3, 5): 1})
</code></pre>
<p>You need the conversion to tuples because lists are not hashable, and <code>Counter</code> uses a dictionary internally, which requires the keys to be hashable.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">is the list always with three integers or this is a simple idea and in theory it can be of a random number of integers?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It is always have the same number of values.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This should help you <code>https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3724551/python-uniqueness-for-list-of-lists</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">This only give unique lists. How can I find number of times that each appeared in G?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Change lists to tuples and use collections.Counter ... but thats another questions. For both of wich you showed no code at all and no put no effort in it., What code <i>you</i> came up with?</span>
