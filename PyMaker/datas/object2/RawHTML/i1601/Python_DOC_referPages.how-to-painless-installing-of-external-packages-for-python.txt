<p>I have used Anaconda+Spyder and also Pycharm for python code developments. I am having difficulties with installing external packages, using either CONDA or PIP. It is very common for me to see error regarding conflict between the packages and versions. Is there a painless, hassle-free approach to install a set of compatible external libraries for python?</p>

<p>Using virtual environments is a convenient way to avoid version conflicts.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">One of Anacondas main pro's should be that it handles these dependencies between packages (by automatically installing them as well and/or up- or downgrading their versions). With PIP you need to handle this yourself...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, this is very useful.</span>
