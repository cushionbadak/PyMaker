<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have a text file which writes <code>Hello, how are you? \n\n\n</code>.</p>
<p>I would like to append <code>I am Sam.</code> with the last two <code>\n</code>s removed.</p>
<p>The resultant sentence should be <code>Hello, how are you? \nI am Sam.</code></p>
<p>How is this done in Python?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>You can check methods of <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#methods-of-file-objects" rel="nofollow noreferrer">file objects</a> and see the to insert elements from the end, we can use the second argument of the seek function and then get the output.</p>
<pre><code>with open("text.txt","w") as f:
    f.write("Hello, how are you? \n\n\n")
    f.seek(-2,2)
    f.write("I am Sam.")

with open("text.txt","r") as f:
    print(repr(f.read()))
</code></pre>
<p>OUTPUT</p>
<pre><code>'Hello, how are you? \nI am Sam.'
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Removing the two <code>\n</code>s can be dealt with as its own matter.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The file already contains <code>Hello, how are you? \n\n\n</code> and we should not write it to the file again.  Can we try something like <code>f = open('text.txt', 'a')</code> <code>f.seek(-2,2)</code> <code>f.write('I am Sam.')</code> ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">yes you can try</span>
