<p>So I am trying to make a small script for myself where I have one or multiply word/s and by that it is supposed to find all matching words in a randomized sentence.</p>
<p>etc:</p>
<pre><code>Sentence1 = "Hello, I am new here and I hope I will be able to help and get helped from Stackoverflow"

Sentence2 = "Is it beautiful weather"

Sentence3 = "I hope it wont be snowing here soon"

Sentence4 = "How is the weather"

Words = ['I+be', 'it+weather']
</code></pre>
<hr/>
<p><em>The output is supposed to say</em></p>
<pre><code>Hello, I am new here and I hope I will be able to help and get helped from Stackoverflow

Is it beautiful weather

I hope it wont be snowing here soon
</code></pre>
<p>and the reason why it doesn't print the first one and last one is that it does not contain <em>I</em> and <em>Be</em> and <em>it</em> and <em>weather</em></p>
<p>So my question is basically how to make every <em>+</em> or any other special characters like keyword1 + keyword2 + n (Can be up from 1 to n words) and compare if those word are in the sentence</p>
<p>So what I tried to code was something like</p>
<pre><code>Sentence = [
    "Hello, I am new here and I hope I will be able to help and get helped from Stackoverflow",
    "Is it beautiful weather", "I hope it wont be snowing here soon",
    "How is the weather"]

Words = ['I', 'it+weather']

for loop_word in Words:
    for loop_setence in Sentence:
        if loop_word in loop_setence:
            print(loop_setence)
            break
</code></pre>
<p>However for now it does only print out the first sentence since I changed the Words to I for now.</p>
<p>What I want to do is that words in that contains more than 1 word should be adding with a special character in between etc I+be so whenever there is a I and Be inside a sentence it should print that it found that sentence - Else do not print anything.</p>

<p>So my question for you is how can I continue from my point forward with me wish :) ?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You could do something like this:</p>
<pre><code>words = ['I+be', 'it+weather']
sentences = ["Hello, I am new here and I hope I will be able to help and get helped from Stackoverflow",
             "Is it beautiful weather", "I hope it wont be snowing here soon", "How is the weather"]

def check_all(sentence, ws):
    return all(w in sentence for w in ws)

for sentence in sentences:
    if any(check_all(sentence, word.split('+')) for word in words):
        print(sentence)
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Output</strong></p>
<pre><code>Hello, I am new here and I hope I will be able to help and get helped from Stackoverflow
Is it beautiful weather
I hope it wont be snowing here soon
</code></pre>
<p>The function <code>check_all</code> checks if all the words from a group of words (for example <code>'I+be'</code>) are in the sentence. Then if for any group of words are in the sentence you should print the sentence. Note that you must first split on <code>'+'</code> to find if a group matches.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>
<p>To match whole words only I suggest you use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">regex</a>, for example:</p>
<pre><code>import re

words = ['I+be', 'it+weather']
sentences = ["Hello, I am new here and I hope I will be able to help and get helped from Stackoverflow",
             "Is it beautiful weather", "I hope it wont be snowing here soon", "How is the weather", "With In be"]


def check_all(sentence, ws):
    """Returns True if all the words are present in the sentence"""
    return all(re.search(r'\b{}\b'.format(w), sentence) for w in ws)


for sentence in sentences:
    if any(check_all(sentence, word.split('+')) for word in words):
        print(sentence)
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Output</strong></p>
<pre><code>Hello, I am new here and I hope I will be able to help and get helped from Stackoverflow
Is it beautiful weather
I hope it wont be snowing here soon
</code></pre>
<p>Note that the second example does not contains <code>"With In be"</code> in the output.</p>

<p>Using <code>filter</code>, <code>any</code>, <code>all</code>, and <code>split</code></p>
<pre><code>In [22]: Sentence1 = "Hello, I am new here and I hope I will be able to help and get helped from Stackoverflow"
    ...:
    ...: Sentence2 = "Is it beautiful weather"
    ...:
    ...: Sentence3 = "I hope it wont be snowing here soon"
    ...:
    ...: Sentence4 = "How is the weather"
    ...:
    ...: Words = ['I+be', 'it+weather']
    ...:

In [23]: sentences = [Sentence1, Sentence2, Sentence3, Sentence4]

In [27]: list(filter(lambda s: any(all(w in s.split() for w in word.split('+')) for word in Words), sentences))

Out[27]:
['Hello, I am new here and I hope I will be able to help and get helped from Stackoverflow',
 'Is it beautiful weather',
 'I hope it wont be snowing here soon']
</code></pre>
<p>The comprehension returns a generator of <code>True</code> of <code>False</code> if one of the keywords are in one of the sentences. <code>all</code> will return <code>True</code> if all elements of the inner container are <code>True</code>. Conversely, <code>any</code> will return <code>True</code> if any elements of the inner container are <code>True</code>.</p>
<p>Checking the <code>'be'</code> doesn't return <code>Sentence2</code></p>
<pre><code>In [43]: Words = ['be']

In [44]: list(filter(lambda s: any(all(w in s.split() for w in word.split('+')) for word in Words), sentences))
Out[44]:
['Hello, I am new here and I hope I will be able to help and get helped from Stackoverflow',
 'I hope it wont be snowing here soon']
</code></pre>
<p>Note that this won't take into account punctuation. I.e. <code>'Hello' != 'Hello,'</code></p>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>'it+weather' in sentence</code> searches for exact this string: <code>'it+weather'</code> which isn't there.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The first sentence contains I and be, should it be in the output?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MichaelButscher Oh yeah that is correct, I think I need to make something that whenever there is a + in the words. it should regard it as two words I believe. but should not regard it as <code>it</code> and <code>weather</code> as two different seperated words like if I would do `['it', 'weather']</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@DanielMesejo Oh my bad! Yes it is supposed to be since there is a <code>I and Be</code> in that sentence.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If this is not a simple exercise, you should use proper NLP tools instead of hacking your way around a classical problem.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I did find a issue. if you leave just etc <code>words = ['I', 'it+weather']</code> with only one word - so whenever there is a capital I inside a word it will mark it as it is inside there. but not as a Word</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Hellosiroverthere Updated the answer!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That is weird, I just run with those sentences and only printed "Stackoverflow hello testing red"</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Oh thats strange. I must have forgot to do something. Let me take another look and see what mistake I did!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I just checked! You were right! It was me who did the mistake! Im truly sorry and I appreciate your answer! I think this was the correct one answer that I used atleast :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hello! I did find an issue in this program, so basically whenever if you change your Words into just one word in etc <code>i</code> it will take all i that contains in any words meaning like beatiful it will print it out since it contains <code>i</code> inside it</span>
<span class="comment-copy">so you are asking for whole word matches?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes exactly :) It might be confusion when it comes with the <code>+</code> but basically what it does is that it checks if there is etc I and be in the word which I assume the one you coded was similar but it looks only for anything that has a I and Be but what I wish is that it should work for the whole word matches and not just each characters :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Hellosiroverthere updated</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This might seem like this is the solution. However whenever I try to print out this function by doing <code>print(list(filter(lambda s: any(all(w in s.split() for w in word.split('+')) for word in Words), sentences)))</code> it gives me the answers within a list. Is it possible that it just prints out without inside a list <code>[Is it beaitful weather]</code> ?</span>
