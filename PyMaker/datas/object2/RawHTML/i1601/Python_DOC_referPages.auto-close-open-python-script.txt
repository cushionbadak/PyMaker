<p>I would like to know if there is a tool to auto open and close a python script.
For example, I would like my python script opens every 12 hours. In my script I have an infite loop. So after 12 hours, I need the script to be closed and reopened. Thank you.  </p>

<p>You can use the watch command to open your script every 12 hours.
More information on watch and an example: <a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/430382/repeat-a-command-every-x-interval-of-time-in-terminal">https://askubuntu.com/questions/430382/repeat-a-command-every-x-interval-of-time-in-terminal</a>.</p>
<p>Closing the script can be done from within your script. More information and an example: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14920384/stop-code-after-time-period">Stop code after time period</a></p>
