<p>I'm trying to read a file but for some reason it is not working and I have some trouble to diagnose the problem as I'm not used to python.</p>
<p>I use the following code to read the file</p>
<pre><code>with open(self.lineEdit_2.text(), 'r') as csvfile:
    reader = csv.reader(csvfile, delimiter=',')
    idList = []
    idExist = false
    for row in reader:
        print(row[1])
        for i in len(idList):
            if row[1] == idList[i]:
                idExist = true
                break
            else:
                idExist = false
    if not idExist:
        idList.append(row[1])
</code></pre>
<p>The file is called can_data.txt and <code>self.lineEdit_2.text()</code> return the destination to that file. The file has the following structure:</p>
<pre><code>1542208616,0x7DF,8,01 03 55 55 55 55 55 55 
1542208616,0x7E9,8,02 43 00 00 00 00 00 00 
1542208616,0x7E8,8,02 43 00 00 00 00 00 00 
1542208616,0x7DF,8,01 07 55 55 55 55 55 55 
1542208616,0x7E9,8,02 47 00 00 00 00 00 00 
1542208616,0x7E8,8,02 47 00 00 00 00 00 00 
</code></pre>
<p>The purpose is to list the different ids that is inside the file in column 1.</p>
<p>While trying to debug it exit when it reach for <code>row in reader:</code></p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Do you have a constraint on which package you use to read your files?
If not, why not try pandas?</p>
<p>From what I understand from your script, the second column contains ids, and you what a list of all different ids that appear in your data.</p>
<p>You can therefore try this (my guess is that it will be faaar more efficient):</p>
<pre><code>import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_table(self.lineEdit_2.text() , sep=',', names=['c0', 'id', 'c2', 'c3', 'c4', 'c5', 'c6'])
unique_ids = df['id'].unique()
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Ok, first of all: fix your indentation! After <code>with ...:</code> there should always be an indented block.</p>
<p>Secondly what does self.lineEdit_2.text() return? The <code>open()</code> method expects the path of the file as it's first argument, not the text you're trying to read... (<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open</a>)</p>
<p>My guess is that you don't need the first line at all but something like this might work:</p>
<pre><code>reader = csv.reader(self.lineEdit_2.text().split('\n'), delimiter=',')
for row in reader:
    ...
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">What exactly is your intention with this code?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I think the last two lines should be indented to be inside the main for loop.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">How do you know it is not working? (Do not reply to this comment; it is a suggestion to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/posts/53391709/edit">edit</a> your post.)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The inner for loop can be avoided by using a containment test (e.g. <code>if row[1] in idList</code>). Also, <code>True</code> and <code>False</code> must be capitalized in Python.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This one is really awesome and easy to use! Thanks for a nice suggestion.</span>
