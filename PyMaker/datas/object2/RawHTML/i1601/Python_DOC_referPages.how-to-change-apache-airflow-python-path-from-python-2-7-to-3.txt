<p>Initially, I had installed Apache Airflow and python 2.7 is set as default path. Now, I'm trying to change path from 2.7 to 3. Is it possible to do so or do I have re-install the airflow and set the python path? Any pointers would be helpful?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>There are a few ways to make sure that you are using the version of Python that you would like. Docker is one, take a look at <a href="https://github.com/puckel/docker-airflow" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://github.com/puckel/docker-airflow</a> for a good example.</p>
<p>Another is to use virtual environments. I've only used <a href="https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Virtualenv</a> with success. I like <a href="https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Pipenv</a>, but unfortunately I ran into some dependency-trouble using it with Airflow.</p>
<p>Anyways, here is an example of what should work with Virtualenv:</p>
<pre><code>cd your-project
virtualenv -p python3 .direnv
source .direnv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
</code></pre>
<p><code>python --version</code> should list python 3, and running <code>airflow webserver</code>, should run Airflow in python 3.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Are you using any python virtual environment like this <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html</a>? Unless, I would suspect that your default python is used, which often is 2.7</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No, I'm not using virtual environment for python3. Both are installed through Terminal, but not on virtual env.</span>
