<p>I am new to python and programming, any help would be much appreciated! I am having trouble with a piece of coding I am writing in Python. My task is to write a function to calculate the number of times a particular letter appears divided by the total number of letters in that sequence.<br/>
My function is supposed to return a list with the fraction of letters for each sequence.</p>
<pre><code>def calculate_let(sequences, letter):
    calculate_letNew = []
    for seq in sequences:
        len(seq)
        calculate_letNew = seq.count(letter)/len(seq)
    return calculate_letNew
</code></pre>
<p>This is my code so far. The output gives me a fraction for only <strong>one</strong> sequence even tough the list <code>sequenceA</code> has four sequences.</p>
<pre><code>Letter_A = calculate_let(sequenceA, 'A')
print(Letter_A)
</code></pre>
<p>output: <code>0.10273972602739725</code></p>
<p>I have been trying my hardest to try and solve this problem, but quite honestly don't know where to start.</p>

<p>I think you meant to make a list of them like this:</p>
<p>Notice the <code>list.append</code> method will add an element to the list.</p>
<pre><code>def count_lett(sequences, AminoAcid):
    count_lettNew = []
    for seq in sequences:
        count_lettNew.append(seq.count(AminoAcid)/len(seq))
    return count_lettNew
</code></pre>
<hr/>
<p>As random advice:</p>
<p>Python only uses the TitleCase for class names, so I would choose to write the code like this (keeping the <code>forloop</code> for simplicity):</p>
<pre><code>def count_lett(sequences, amino_acid):
    counts = [] # Although, you may consider something like fracs 
                # for "fractions" since these aren't actually counts
    for seq in sequences:
        counts.append(seq.count(amino_acid)/len(seq))
    return counts
</code></pre>

<p>You could do it in a very readable and concise way using a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">list comprehension</a>:</p>
<pre><code>def calc_freqs(sequences, letter):
    return [seq.count(letter)/len(seq) for seq in sequences]

sequenceA = 'ALABAMA', 'MISSISSIPPI', 'UTAH', 'IDAHO'
letterA = calc_freqs(sequenceA, 'A')
print(letterA)  # -&gt; [0.5714285714285714, 0.0, 0.25, 0.2]
</code></pre>
