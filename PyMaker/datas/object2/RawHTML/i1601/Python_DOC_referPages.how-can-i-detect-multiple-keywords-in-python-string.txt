<p>I am looking for a way to create several lists and for the keywords in those lists to be extracted and matched with a responce.</p>
<p>User Input: This is a <strong>good day</strong> I am heading out for <strong>a jog</strong>.</p>
<p>List 1 : Keywords : good day, great day, awesome day, best day.
List 2 : Keywords : a run, a swim, a game.</p>
<p>But for a huge database of words, can this be linked to just the lists? Or does it need to be especific words?</p>
<p>Also would you recommend Python for a huge database of keywords?</p>

<p>The first thing to do is to break the input string up into tokens. A token is just a piece of the string that you want to match. In your case, it looks like your token size is 2 words (but it doesn't have to be). You might also want to strip all punctuation from the input string as well. </p>
<p>Then for your input, your tokens are 
    ['This is', 'is a', 'a good', 'good day', 'day I', 'I am', 'am heading', 'heading out', 'out for', 'for a', 'a jog'] </p>
<p>Then you can iterate over the tokens and check to see if they're contained in each one of the lists. Might look like this:</p>
<pre><code>input = 'This is a good day I am heading out for a jog'
words = input.split(' ')
tokens = [' '.join(words[i:i+2]) for i in range(len(words) - 1)]
for token in tokens:
  if token in list1:
    print('{} is in list1'.format(token))
  if token in list2:
    print('{} is in list2'.format(token))
</code></pre>
<p>One thing you will likely want to do to optimize this is to use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=set#set" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>set</code></a>s for list1 and list2, instead of lists. </p>
<pre><code>set1 = set(list1)
</code></pre>
<p><code>set</code>s offer O(1) lookups, as opposed to O(n) for lists, which is critical if your keyword lists are large. </p>
