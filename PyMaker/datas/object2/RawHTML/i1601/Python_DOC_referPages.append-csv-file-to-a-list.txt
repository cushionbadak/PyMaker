<p>I have three different data files they are json, pkl and csv.</p>
<p>I am trying to combine them together before do data analysis. </p>
<p>Currently I am able to combine pkl and json file. But not sure how to do with CSV.</p>
<pre><code>import json
import csv
import pickle
import operator

objects = []
with (open("data.pkl", "rb")) as openfile:
    objects.append(pickle.load(openfile))
with(open('data.json','rb'))as openfile:
    objects.append(json.load(openfile))

with open('data.csv', 'rb') as f:
reader = csv.reader(f)
objects.append(reader)
</code></pre>
<p>Not sure how to append the csv file and I need to sort the unique value after combing them. </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you literally want the text appended to a list, you don't need the CSV module. This is equivalent to you're appending of a pickled or JSON object. </p>
<pre><code>with open('data.csv', 'rb') as f:
    objects.append(f.read())
</code></pre>
<p>If you want each line separately</p>
<pre><code>with open('data.csv', 'rb') as f:
    for line in f:
        objects.append(line.rstrip())
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Well, have you read the CSV module documentation and tried something? Are there any errors you'd like to point out when you do?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Note: you're appending single objects, not lists of data. If you print <code>len(objects)</code> here, it'll only be 2, not the sum of the lengths of the two lists (?) that you loaded</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, I try to append the reader method, but when I check it did not append the result.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Because you're never actually reading the lines, only creating the reader <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#examples" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#examples</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">What exactly should the format of the csv object in the <code>objects</code> list be? Python has no native "csv" type. Its <code>csv</code> module will let you convert one to <b>sequence</b>  of <code>tuple</code>s or <code>dict</code>s (and <code>namedtuple</code>s I believe.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks Cricket,  Since I have three files and they are in three different format, what will be a simple way to combine them together?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Lists can hold any type of object. I'm not sure I understand the question, but I would personally try to use a custom class rather than a plain list</span>
