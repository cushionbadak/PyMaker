<p>I am having trouble adding up each row in a 2d list. </p>
<p>Here is the problem:We will pass in a 2 dimensional list of numbers. 
You should: 1 . add up all the numbers in each row and output that number and 2. output the grand total of all rows.  </p>
<p>Below is my code so far:</p>
<pre><code>    import sys
    numbers= sys.argv[1:]


    for i in range(0,len(numbers)): 
      numbers[i]= numbers[i].split(',')
    total = 0
    sum = 0
    for row in range(len(numbers)):
      sum += (row)
      total += (sum)
      print(sum)
    print(total)
</code></pre>
<p>Here is what my output and the expected output is:</p>
<p>Program Output</p>
<pre><code>Program Failed for Input: 1,1,-2 -1,-2,-3 1,1,1
Expected Output: 0
-6
3
-3

Your Program Output: 0
1
3
4
</code></pre>
<p>Your output was incorrect. Try again.</p>
<p>As you can see, I have everything correct except for the 2nd row which is adding all negative numbers which is then affecting the grand total at the end. Do I need add negative numbers differently?</p>
<p>Thanks for you input!</p>

<p>You first need to (after splitting your input by ',') change splitted values from strings to integers and then you could use python builtin function <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#sum" rel="nofollow noreferrer">sum</a> to add them all up.</p>
<pre><code>import sys

numbers= sys.argv[1:]

total = 0
for i in numbers:
    row_sum = sum([int(i) for i in i.split(',')])
    total += row_sum
    print(row_sum)
print(total)
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>0
-6
3
-3
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>for row in range(len(numbers)):</code> is not using the values of <code>numbers</code> (which need to be converted as integers since they're strings)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Don't name your variables sum, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#sum" rel="nofollow noreferrer">sum</a> is python builtin function which you override by naming your variables like that.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You forgot to calculate and output the rows total.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Right, updated!</span>
