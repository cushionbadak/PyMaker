<p>Hi guys a amateur at python here.
I've got the following code below that I have coded. </p>
<pre><code>for _ in range(10):
    x = random.random()
    print("Your x coordinates are",x)
    y = random.random()
    print("Your y coordinates are",y)
    distance = x**2 + y**2
    distance2 = math.sqrt(distance)
    print("The distance of your pair of points is",distance2)
</code></pre>
<p>It prints 10 randomly generated coordinates and calculates the distance of each pair using Pythagoras (monte carlo simulation). 
I've now created a counter named:</p>
<pre><code>inside = 0
</code></pre>
<p>This counter needs to increment by 1 everytime the distance of a pair of coordinates is between 0 and 1. If the distance is above one the counter will not increment. I've had a go at this using while loops and if statements but I can't get the hang of it. Can someone please help?</p>
<p>Kind regards.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>inside = 0

for _ in range(10):
  ...
  if distance2 &lt;= 1:
    inside += 1
</code></pre>
<p>That should sort ya out !</p>
<p>edit: I removed the <code>0 &lt;=</code> check since it's a square root it'll always be larger than 0 </p>

<p>You can use a similar approach as in <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/53354839/7505395">my answer</a> to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53354679/counting-the-number-of-floats-in-a-list-between-a-range-in-python">your last question</a>:</p>
<p>You simply sum up all things from your data that are True (== 1) via <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#sum" rel="nofollow noreferrer">sum()</a>:</p>
<pre><code>import random

data = [ (random.random(),random.random()) for _ in range(10)]

# sum up all points from data that are &lt;=1 (and hence `True`)    
c = sum(x**2+y**2 &lt;= 1 for x,y in data)
#       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#       if True then 1 else 0

print(data)
print(c)
print([x**2+y**2 for x,y in data])
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>

<p>I tried your way. If I understood correctly, you want to count the distance between 0 and 1.</p>
<pre><code>distance = []
for _ in range(10):
    x = random.random()
    y = random.random()
    distance1 = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    print(distance1)

<span class="comment-copy">I don't understand</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Sarah what part do you not understand, have you tried any of the answers offered below?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">it's not printing me anything :(</span>
<span class="comment-copy">yup cos I didn't add any printing in there :) - what do you want it to print ? the total ? then add <code>print("The total number inside was", inside)</code> or similar</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I did a print print(inside) but it didn't print anything.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">actually, it either prints 0 or 10</span>
<span class="comment-copy">that's the method I used first and my code was working but my teacher said I can't use this method strangely enough</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Sarah <i>sigh</i> ... at least remove the <code>sqrt</code> - its not needed. Any sum &gt; 1 will have sqrt-values also &gt; 1 - any sum thats &lt;1 will have parts that are also &lt; 1 ... no need to use a computationally heavy method at all...</span>
