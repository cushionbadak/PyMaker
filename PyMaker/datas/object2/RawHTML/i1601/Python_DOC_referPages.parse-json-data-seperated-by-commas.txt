<p>Lets say i have the following json:</p>
<pre><code>{"data":"DOG,CAT,BIRD,SEED,HEART,DRAGON,LINK,SUNSHINE","success":true}
</code></pre>
<p>How would I extract the 1st, 3rd, 6th item in "data"? So extract dog, bird, and dragon. These words will always be changing too. I know how to extract the entire thing by doing:</p>
<pre><code>set['data']
</code></pre>
<p>But i'm not sure how to extract individually.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>It is a string. You can use the split method. Assuming you have loaded it into python using json.load(), you can do this:</p>
<pre><code>words = set['data'].split(',')
print words
</code></pre>
<p>['DOG', 'CAT', 'BIRD', 'SEED', 'HEART', 'DRAGON', 'LINK', 'SUNSHINE']</p>

<p>Parse the JSON into an object then split a string into an array delimited by (,) comma    </p>
<pre><code>class Example(obj):
        def __init__(self, data):
            self.__dict__ = json.loads(data)

    myObject = Example(myJSONData)
    myList = myObject.data.split(",")
    dog = myList[0]
    bird = myList[2]
    dragon = myList[5]

<span class="comment-copy">You'll want to call split with a comma as the arg</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You need to be more specific as to what's your problem because as is, there are a million possible answers and 0 to give you at the same time. How will you know which word to extract for instance ? As they will be forever changing as you said. That being said, you might want to look at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.split" rel="nofollow noreferrer">split</a>.</span>
