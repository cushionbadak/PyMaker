<p>So if I create a program in python (3.7) that looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>import re
regx = re.compile("test")
print(regx.findall("testest"))
</code></pre>
<p>and run it, then I will get:</p>
<pre><code>["test"]
</code></pre>
<p>Even though there are two instances of "test" it's only showing me one which I think is because a letter from the first "test" is being used in the second "test". How can I make a program that will give me <code>["test", "test"]</code> as a result instead?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You will want to use a capturing group with a lookahead <code>(?=(regex_here))</code>:</p>
<pre><code>import re
regx = re.compile("(?=(test))")
print(regx.findall("testest"))

&gt;&gt;&gt; ['test', 'test']
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Regex expressions are greedy. They consume as much of the target string as possible. Once consumed, a character is not examined again, so overlapping patterns are not found. </p>
<p>To do this you need to use a feature of python regular expressions called a look ahead assertion. You will look for instances of the character <code>t</code> where it is followed by <code>est</code>. The look ahead does not consume parts of the string. </p>
<pre><code>    import re

    regx = re.compile('t(?=est)')

    print([m.start() for m in regx.finditer('testest')])
</code></pre>
<p><code>[0,3]</code></p>
