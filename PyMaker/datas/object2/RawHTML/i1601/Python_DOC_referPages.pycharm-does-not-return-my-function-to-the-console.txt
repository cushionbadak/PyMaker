<span class="comment-copy">Don't wanna do that. I googled it but I do not saw anything</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@CeylanBAÄžCI Excuse me, what do you not want to do? Display the results? What is the problem then?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">a func  should show string statements with return code on console. am I wrong</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Don't think to get functionalities like Jupyter on terminal if you will try to run file using python command. Jupyter has been implemented in such a way that it automatically displays the value contained in variables. So it is on us whether we'll use print() in jupyter notebook or not. It is for saving the time of user. @Ayxan is correct as I see.</span>
