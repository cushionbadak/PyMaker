<p>I'm creating a text based adventure game, and this is meant to be a small fight. The <code>int</code>s <code>userhits</code> or <code>deputyhits</code> should be set to <code>0</code> at some point, but the code is stuck in a loop that goes passed <code>0</code>.</p>

     userhits = 5

     print("He dodges it, the fight has begun")

        if loop:

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Currently your <code>while</code> loop will go on forever since you set it to <code>True</code> initially, then never alter the <code>loop</code> value you are using in the <code>while</code> to <code>False</code>. Inside your loop you will have to have some condition check like this:</p>
<pre><code>if deputyhits or userhits == 0:
    loop = False
    # alternatively you can just break here
</code></pre>
<p>If you set it to <code>False</code> like so, the next iteration of your <code>while</code> will check if <code>loop = True</code>, and since it's now <code>False</code>, the <code>while</code> will not execute again. A <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_break_statement.htm" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>break</code></a> can also be used, but keep in mind that once a <code>break</code> is executed, any remaining code that has not been executed in that iteration of the <code>while</code> will not be executed.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">where do you set your <code>loop</code> to <code>False</code> or <code>break</code>? seems it's an infinite loop</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Daniel: Python's own <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-break-statement" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation</a> also has a good explanation of what <code>break</code> does.</span>
