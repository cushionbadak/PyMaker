<p>If I want to read files named "ABCbook.txt" under directors A/B/C, which means the path A/B/C depends on the files' name and the folders A/B/C are hierarchical. How can I achieve it in Python?</p>

<p>We will use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">os.path.join</a> to make the file path in a platform-independent way, then open the file using the normal <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>with open...</code></a> technique.</p>
<pre><code>import os
my_file = os.path.join('A', 'B', 'C', 'ABCbook.txt')
with open(my_file) as f:
    # your code to work on the file goes here
    for line in f:
        print(line)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>import os

filename = "ABCbook.txt"
path = list(filename[:3]) + [filename]
syspath = os.path.join(*path)

print(syspath)
</code></pre>
<p>output (on windows):</p>
<pre><code>A\B\C\ABCbook.txt
</code></pre>
<p>on linux or mac it will return</p>
<pre><code>A/B/C/ABCbook.txt
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Thank you for your ans. The path is right however there is another issue pops out though I don't think it has something to do with the path name. It says that  [Errno 2] No such file or directory: though I put the file intended to open and my python file in the same path.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">your python file should be in the top folder, next to A. e.g. project/program.py, project/A/B/C/ABCbook.txt</span>
