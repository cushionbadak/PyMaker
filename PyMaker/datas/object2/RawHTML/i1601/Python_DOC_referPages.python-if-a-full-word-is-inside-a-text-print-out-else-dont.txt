<p>I am having issue where I want to compare a word inside a text - meaning if there is a word that contains inside a text it should print out.</p>
<p>The issue is that I am having let say I have a word that is "lo" - and my text is = "hello guys, my name is Stackoverflow" - it will print out that whole text there is a lo inside this text which are inside "hello" and "stackoverflow" </p>
<p>my question is how can I make whenever I want to search for a word such as "lo" it should take it as a word and not print out if it etc. contains inside a word such as "hello" or "stackoverflow" - Only print out if it has the word "lo"?</p>
<pre><code>keywords = ["Lo"]
for text in keywords:
   if text in text_roman():
      print("Yay found word")
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Split up the string into words then test for the substring in each of the words.</p>
<pre><code>For word in s.split():
  If q in word:
    Print word
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You could do this but there are like... 400 edge cases that will make this a problem.</p>
<pre><code>text = "This is my text"
keywords = ["Lo"]
if len(set(text.split()).intersection(set(keywords))) &gt; 0:
    print("Yes")
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>use <code>string.find()</code> . It returns the index of the substring you're looking for, and <code>-1</code> if not found. So you can apply <code>if</code> statement to check whether it is a substring or not.</p>
<pre><code>s='Hello there Stack!'
if (s.find('llo')!=-1):
    print('String found')
</code></pre>
<p>Hope this helped!</p>

<p>The most straightforward way is probably to use a regex. You can play around with regexes <a href="https://regex101.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a> and figure out how to implement them in python <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<pre><code>import re

target_strings = ["lo", "stack", "hell", "cow", "hello", "overf"]

for target in target_strings:
  re_target = re.compile(r"\b({})\b".format(target), flags=re.IGNORECASE)
  if re.search(re_target, "Hello stack overflow lo"):
    print(target)

&gt;&gt;&gt; lo
&gt;&gt;&gt; stack
&gt;&gt;&gt; hello
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">I tried this solution and it helped me to solve the problem :) Thanks! Im sure the other guys below also wrote good solutions!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">if loop?  a if isn't a loop you mean while or for loop here right? .. Besides the current code only find one match the topicstarter is looking for multple matches within a string.. "contains inside a word such as <b>"hello"</b> or <b>"stackoverflow"</b> - Only print out if it has the word <b>"lo"</b>?"</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@RaymondNijland We can use <code>count</code> function for that.. So alternatively, we can use <code>count</code> also to check for the substring.</span>
