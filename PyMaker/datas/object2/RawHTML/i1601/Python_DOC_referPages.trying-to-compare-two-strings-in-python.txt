<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I even used print statements to check if y.name and favourite were the same when checking this and they were yet it still wasn't entering the if statement when using </p>
<pre><code>if y.name == favourite 
</code></pre>
<p>or </p>
<pre><code>if favourite ==y.name
</code></pre>
<p>I'm super confused as to why that is since I thought this was just a standard equality check (The beginning of the code is mostly set up, just included it for context in the case that there was a problem there and not the if statement). Thank you in advance!</p>

<span class="comment-copy">They must be unequal in a way that's hard to see visually -- maybe one has a space at the end or something.  Try printing <code>repr(favourite)</code> and <code>repr(y.name)</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Also indent / format your code correctly and give <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve">Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example</a> please.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It would help us greatly if you properly indent your code. Would you please? 4 spaces per indentation level would be the norm.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Lines read from a file will have a newline character at the end of the line.

<span class="comment-copy">Sorry for the indentation issues I'm completely new to python and this is the first question I have ever asked myself on stack overflow... I think it is a "strip" issue.... In my program it is indented correctly, I was confused on how to post on stack overflow</span>
