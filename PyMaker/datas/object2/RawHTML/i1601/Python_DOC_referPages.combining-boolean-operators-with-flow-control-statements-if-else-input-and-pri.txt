<p>I'm completely new to programming. I started learning Python 3 using 'automatetheboringstuff'. I got to chapter 2, flow controls and Boolean operators. </p>
<p>I tried to let the script say 'That is incorrect.' when when anything other than 'yellow and blue' or 'blue and yellow' is filled in.
The problem was that when even filling in 'poop', it would say 'That is correct, good job!' even though it should be saying 'That is incorrect.'.</p>
<p>I asked a friend of mine who works in IT and his colleague looked at it and said it looked like itshould work. But it isn't working the way I expect it to work. Why not?</p>
<p>I hope someone can help. Thanks in advance and my sincere apologies if I made a massive rookie mistake!</p>
<pre><code>print('By combining which colours would you make the following colour?')
print('Green')
colourGreen = input()
if colourGreen == ('blue and yellow') or ('yellow and blue'):
    print('That is correct, good job!')
else:
    print('That is incorrect.')
</code></pre>

<p>You may want to read about <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#operator-precedence" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Operator Precedance</a>.
You have to make two separate boolean expressions:</p>
<pre><code>if colourGreen == 'b and y' or colourGreen == 'y and b':
    print('green')
else:
    print('not green')
</code></pre>
