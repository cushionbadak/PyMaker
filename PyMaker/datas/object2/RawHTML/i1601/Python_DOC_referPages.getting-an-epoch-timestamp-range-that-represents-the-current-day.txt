<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I'm trying to get the epoch range (two timestamps) that represent the current day, in the EST timezone. So, the epoch timestamp from 12:00 AM EST to 11:59 PM EST. I don't know much about the way epoch timestamps work. How can I achieve this?</p>

<p>I guess, you mean "seconds since epoch" -- a value that is normally used by unix systems internally. Advantage is that you just need one integer value to represent the time stamp.</p>
<p>You can use mktime to convert a time&amp;date value to an "seconds since epoch":</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.mktime" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.mktime</a></p>
<p>To get the range, just call mktime two times. For the first value, just call it with time set to 0:00:00. For the second value, you can either fill with 23:59:59 or (what I would prefer) with 0:00:00 on the next day (giving an half-open interval).</p>
<p>See here, how to fill the input parameter:

<p>Note that the result is a float value. The fractions are fractions of seconds, if needed. Just call <code>int(result_value)</code> when you just need the seconds as integer.</p>
