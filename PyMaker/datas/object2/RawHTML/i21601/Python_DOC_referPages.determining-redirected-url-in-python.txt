<p>I made a little parser using HTMLparser and I would like to know where a link is redirected. I don't know how to explain this, so please look this example:</p>
<p>On my page I have a link on the source: <code>http://www.myweb.com?out=147</code>, which redirects to <code>http://www.mylink.com</code>. I can parse <code>http://www.myweb.com?out=147</code> without any problems, but I don't know how to get <code>http://www.mylink.com</code>.</p>

<p>You can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/urllib2.html#module-urllib2" rel="noreferrer"><code>urllib2</code></a> (<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.request.html#module-urllib.request" rel="noreferrer"><code>urllib.request</code></a> in Python 3) and its <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/urllib2.html#httpredirecthandler-objects" rel="noreferrer"><code>HTTPRedirectHandler</code></a> in order to find out where a URL will redirect you. Here's a function that does that:</p>
<pre><code>import urllib2

def get_redirected_url(url):
    opener = urllib2.build_opener(urllib2.HTTPRedirectHandler)
    request = opener.open(url)
    return request.url

print get_redirected_url("http://google.com/")
# prints "http://www.google.com/"
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can not get hold of the redirection URL through parsing the HTML source code. 
Redirections are triggered by the server and NOT by the client. You need to perform a HTTP request to the related URL and check the HTTP response of the server - in particular for the HTTP status code 304 (Redirection) and the new URL.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">One slight gotcha with this is that if a redirect redirects to another redirect, you'll only get the last redirect. For example, say you have a t.co (Twitter's URL shortener) link, which actually refers to a bit.ly link, which refers to some real website, then you'll get the "real" website instead of the bit.ly link. This may or may not be what one wants.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">And in case someone else looking for the answer to that sees this question, the Requests library (<a href="http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/index.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/index.html</a>) makes this not only possible but also trivial.</span>
