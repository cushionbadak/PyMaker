<span class="comment-copy">Yeah I tried it without the lambda expression and I still got the same error.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@amanb: The <code>lambda</code> is correct. <code>command=removeQuestion(DeleteQuestion)</code> would not pass a function; it would attempt to call <code>removeQuestion</code> immediately and pass the return value as <code>command</code>.</span>
