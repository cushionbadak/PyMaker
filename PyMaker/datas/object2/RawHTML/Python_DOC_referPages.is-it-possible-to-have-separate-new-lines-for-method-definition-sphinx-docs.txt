<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Is it possible to have separate 
new lines for method definition 
input arguments sphinx docs
for example:</p>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/P7OA2.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img alt="enter image description here" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/P7OA2.png"/></a></p>
<p>So it would look like:</p>
<pre><code>lib.dashboards.post_all_dashboards(   # black line
         dashboards_location,         # blue line
         values,                      # ...
         values,                      # ...
         user,
         ...
)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can do this with custom CSS inserted into your theme's style sheet or by overriding it with the following:</p>
<pre><code>dt em:nth-child(n+2)::before {
    content: " ";
    display: block;
}
</code></pre>
<p>It gets close to what you want, but it does not indent the args.</p>
