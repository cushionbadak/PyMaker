<p>I am trying to count the copies in my dictionary.</p>
<p>My dictionary</p>
<pre><code>{0: 'once', 1: 'twice', 2: 'twice'}
</code></pre>
<p>My code:</p>
<pre><code>def count(self, item):
    """Return the number of copies of item in the bag.

    Return zero if the item doesn't occur in the bag.
    """

    counter = 0
    for key in self.bag:
        if item == item:
            counter = len(self.bag) - 1
    else:
        counter = 0
    print(counter)
    return counter
</code></pre>
<p>Should return 2 as there are 2 copies and 1 duplicate item.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Here is where <code>Counter</code>s come in <strong>real</strong> handy. You can make a <code>Counter</code> to keep track of all the values in your dict. It's as simple as: </p>
<pre><code>from collections import Counter
temp = {0: 'once', 1: 'twice', 2: 'twice'}
counter = Counter (temp.values())
</code></pre>
<p>This returns <code>Counter({'twice': 2, 'once': 1})</code>. </p>
<p>Now, to find how many copies, you simply take <code>len (counter)</code>, and all the duplicates are any entries (keys) with a count (value) of &gt; 1:</p>
<pre><code>duplicates = [key for key, count in counter.items() if count &gt; 1]
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Hmm ok I think I get it I will try it. Do you think there's away to accomplish the same with out using Counter ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Well counter is basically doing what you are behind the scenes, just with some slight improvements (y'know being in C and all), so there's really no reason <b>not</b> to use it. If there is tell me and I can help</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No real reason only that I thought my code was very nearly there but just couldn't quite finish it due to my lack of experience. I've also spent a very long time getting it to that point.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Well in that case, why do you have an <code>else</code> block? You don't have a <code>break</code> anywhere in your loop (which is what the <code>else</code> is for), so <code>counter</code> gets set to 0 at the end of the loop, no matter what the result. Other than that your code looks fine (except idk what <code>self.bag</code> is)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">ah! thank you. i have fixed it! with using a break after counter = len(self.bag) - 1 and changing my else statement.</span>
