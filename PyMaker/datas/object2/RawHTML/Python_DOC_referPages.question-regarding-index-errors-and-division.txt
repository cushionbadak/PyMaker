<p>I have two lists and I wanted to create generate the quotients using a for loop. Specifically, I would want to have .5 and .25 and .125 and in that order. Of course, I could just take these values and determine the quotients manually, but I am looking at this from the perspective of someone who is taking their first stab at learning Python. I have read some other articles on for loops, but do not see why the below produces :  index error: list index out of range. Thus, I am looking not only for the modification of this code but also a reasonable explanation as to why there is such an error.</p>
<pre><code>x=[2,4,16]
y=[4,16,128]
for i in y:
    y[i]/x
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>I believe what you need is to <code>zip</code> both lists then apply division over the given iteration values:</p>
<pre><code>x=[2,4,16]
y=[4,16,128]
for xi, yi in zip(x, y):
    print(xi/yi)
</code></pre>
<p>That yields:</p>
<p>0.5
0.25
0.125</p>
<p>In order to understand what <code>zip</code> is doing:

<p>Take a look at the following:</p>
<pre><code>x=[2,4,16]
y=[4,16,128]
for i in y:
    print(f"i: {i}")
    print(f"y: {y}")
</code></pre>
<p>This is the output:</p>
<pre><code>i: 4
y: [4, 16, 128]
i: 16
y: [4, 16, 128]
i: 128
y: [4, 16, 128]
</code></pre>
<p>You are looking for <code>y[4]</code> in the first loop, but it doesn't exist. If you want to loop through the list you can do this:</p>
<pre><code>x=[2,4,16]
y=[4,16,128]
for i in range(len(y)):
    print(f"i: {i}")
    print(y[i])
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>i: 0
4
i: 1
16
i: 2
128
</code></pre>

<p>You are not iterating over the index, you are iterating with the values</p>
<pre><code>for i in y:
   y/x[?]
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to iterate with indexes you could do that with enumerate</p>
<pre><code>for index, value in enumerate(y):
    y[index]/x[index]
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>for i in y</code> what do you think <code>i</code> contains? (ps. its not index numbers)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">By doing <code>for i in y:</code> you are <i>directly</i> iterating over the elements of y. You need <code>enumerate</code> for your purpose. Or even better <code>zip</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">This question has been previously marked as off-topic. I believe it's the same you in another name.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What is wrong directly iterating over the elements of y? I do not get that</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Jack nothing, until you type this. <code>y[i]</code>. Think what value <code>i</code> has. What does that resolve to?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">what is the meaning of f in print(f"i: {i}")</span>
<span class="comment-copy">also this is not dividing anything. this just re-lists everything in a different way</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>print(f"i: {i}")</code> is a f-string. It's a way to format print statements. And it's not dividing anything because I'm showing you how to correctly index through a list.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You should use <code>value/x[index]</code></span>
