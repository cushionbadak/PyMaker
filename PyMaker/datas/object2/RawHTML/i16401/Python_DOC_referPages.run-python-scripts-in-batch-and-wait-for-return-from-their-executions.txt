<p>How do I write a batch script in windows that starts 2 python scripts and waits for both of them to return? and also terminates both of them if I terminate the batch script?</p>
<p>Already asked this and got no answers...Also looked for solutions here, but the ones listed do not wait for a return from execution of the python scripts.</p>
<p>EDIT: yes terminate it using ctrl+C</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>To make sure that the other scripts wait for your proccess to be complete, call it using <code>start /wait</code> - this calls another batch or command line script:</p>
<pre><code>start /wait batchforpython.bat
</code></pre>
<p>so<code>batchforpython.bat</code> would contain</p>
<pre><code>C:\Python34\python.exe C:\Where\your\python\file\is.py
</code></pre>
<p>which is how you can call your python program from a batch script.</p>
<p>Finally, in Python, you can <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3429250/determining-running-programs-in-python">use this</a> to check if a program is running (for you, that would be <code>cmd</code> or <code>command.com</code>) and if it is not there then the batch script has been terminated, so you can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.exit" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>sys.exit()</code></a> to exit Python.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">For starting and waiting, you can see <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14747963/windows-batch-run-a-process-in-background-and-wait-for-it">here</a>.  Killing them off, however, I am not sure in batch.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">How would you terminate the batch ? Ctrl-C ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Do you want that the python scripts run one after the other, or in parallel, and do you need to do anything with their return code ?</span>
