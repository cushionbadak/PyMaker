<p>I need to perform a check for the existence of a file in a dir and all its subdirs.</p>
<p>Since this check, in turn, has to be performed a large number of times during program execution, I'd like to find a fast way to do it.</p>
<p>I know how to use os.walk(), but I believe that it will walk all the subtree each time. Since I want to use it as an existence test, there is a way to bail out from os.walk as soon as it finds the file I'm looking for?</p>

<p>How about using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-break-statement" rel="nofollow"><code>break</code> statement</a>?</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>for p, ds, fs in os.walk(directory):
    if 'wanted' in fs:
        print('found in %s' % p)
        break
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can simply <code>break</code> out of the loop.</p>
<p>If the filesystem is static or almost static however may be a better choice would be to build a dictionary in advance</p>
<pre><code>filename -&gt; list of paths where it is
</code></pre>
<p>If the filesystem is not static you can spawn another thread that computes a new version of the map while the main thread answers the questions using the map.</p>
<p>After all the question "Does this file exist?" is approximative and its real meaning is "Was this file listed when I asked to check?" because after either a negative or positive finding things may change immediately (even before the answer gets to the caller). It's very possible that someone asks if a file exists, gets a positive answer with a location but then gets an error when trying to open the file because it doesn't exist any more.</p>
<p>Using OS-specific extensions is also probably possible to just install a "watcher" that will be informed of every file creation/deletion thus allowing to keep the map updated without having to continuously rescan the full tree.</p>
