<p>Hey I am having some trouble figuring out what is being asked to import in this code</p>
<pre><code>#!/opt/local/bin/python

import sys
from formatter import Formatter

def main():
#do stuff
</code></pre>
<p>in my class formatter.py, do I have had to define a function with a name Formatter.  A little confused on this.  I have been testing my code by putting </p>
<pre><code>from formatter import *
</code></pre>
<p>Which takes all the definitions in my class(I believe).  </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>your line <code>from formatter import Formatter</code> will search through the module formatter for anything with the name <code>Formatter</code>. 
so if you had a function called <code>Formatter</code> in that module, it would be imported, meaning you could use it in your main section (anywhere below the import line will work)
It will import classes as well. </p>
<p><code>formatter.py</code> is a module. a class might look something like: </p>
<pre><code>class A:
    variable = 1
    def b():
        #do stuff
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>formatter.py</code> is a module, not a class, and by convention, <code>Formatter</code> would be a class, not a function. But yes, youâ€™d create something with that name.</span>
