<p>If I have a python script that calls a bash script, and that bash script downloads a file to create a file, how do I take the newly created file as the input of the bash script the next time I call it.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>os.system</code> allows for command-line redirection:</p>
<pre><code>os.system('download-file.sh /tmp/file')  # Creates /tmp/file
os.system('read-file.sh &lt; /tmp/file')    # reads from file
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Can you show what you have so far?  the answer probably depends on how you're issueing calls to bash -- e.g. are you using <code>subprocess</code>  (If not, you should be ;) or something else?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm using os.system. I can't release the code for various reasons, sorry :(</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Quoting the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.system" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs for os.system</a>: "The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#module-subprocess" rel="nofollow noreferrer">subprocess</a> module provides more powerful facilities for spawning new processes and retrieving their results; using that module is preferable to using this function."</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Never figured out how to use subprocess. Also, I'm an intern, and my supervisor suggested using os.system over subprocess. I'll link into subprocess though. How would I use subprocess to do what I wanted though?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Or you could just pipe it directly ... <code>os.system('download-file.sh | read-file.sh')</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@mgilson could you explain a bit more about that code?</span>
