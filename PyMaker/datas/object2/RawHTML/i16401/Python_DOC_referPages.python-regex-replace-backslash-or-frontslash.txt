<p>I'm trying to replace backslashes or front slashes in a string with double backslashes. I've tried a couple of things but it doesn't seem to work.Â¨</p>
<p>My work so far: </p>
<pre><code>string = 'C:\Users\Victor\Dropbox\Private\files\test.txt'

f = re.sub(r'[\\\/]', '\\\\', string)
</code></pre>
<p>This prints the string:</p>
<pre><code>'C:\Users\Victor\Dropbox\Privateiles   est.txt'
</code></pre>
<p>But what i really want is a string that looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>'C:\\Users\\Victor\\Dropbox\\Private\\files\\test.txt'
</code></pre>
<p>So that when i print the string it will look like the original</p>
<pre><code>'C:\Users\Victor\Dropbox\Private\files\test.txt'
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Just convert that string to a raw string:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; string = r'C:\Users\Victor\Dropbox\Private\files\test.txt'
&gt;&gt;&gt; string
'C:\\Users\\Victor\\Dropbox\\Private\\files\\test.txt'
&gt;&gt;&gt; print string
C:\Users\Victor\Dropbox\Private\files\test.txt
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If what you are really getting at is path manipulation, I'd just use the <code>os</code> module.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; s = r'C:\Users\Victor\Dropbox\Private\files\test.txt'
&gt;&gt;&gt; import os
&gt;&gt;&gt; os.path.normcase(s)
'C:\\Users\\Victor\\Dropbox\\Private\\files\\test.txt'
</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html#os.path.normcase" rel="nofollow"><code>os.path.normcase</code></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Normalize the case of a pathname. On <code>Unix</code> and <code>Mac OS X</code>, this returns the path unchanged; on case-insensitive filesystems, it converts the path to lowercase. <strong>On Windows, it also converts forward slashes to backward slashes</strong>. Raise a <code>TypeError</code> if the type of path is not <code>str</code> or <code>bytes</code>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">What about strings as variables?  string = raw_input('test: ')  How do i make it interpret the string as a raw string?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I don't know if the edit was supposed to answer my question, but it did not. I still can't interpret user input as a raw string</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I just figured it out, stupid mistake. Thanks for the help</span>
<span class="comment-copy">+1 for raw string. :) @VictorVH if the answer is correct please consider accepting it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This makes sure to treat the string as a path or?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Please read the description I just added for <code>normcase</code>, it is safe to use as a path after using that function. Note that it is still a <code>string</code> literal as far as python is concerned</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I just tried this. It returns an invalid string:  c:\users\victor\dropbox\private ilewatcher\main.py</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hmm that is strange, I copy-pasted that right out of my IDLE terminal. What IDE are you using, and on what OS?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">+1 for using <code>os</code>. Also, you may be interested in raw strings which don't interpret the backslash as an escape character. <code>r"C:\Users\Victor\Dropbox\Private\files\test.txt"</code>.</span>
