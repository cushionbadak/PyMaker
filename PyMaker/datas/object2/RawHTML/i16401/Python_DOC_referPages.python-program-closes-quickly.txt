<p>I wrote a simple code to print , "hello world" in Python.
As I execute it , the terminal window pops up and closes within a second , even before I can read the message.
<strong>Possibly , what is wrong</strong> ?</p>

<p>If you run the program in windows, as far as there are two workarounds:</p>
<ul>
<li>Run the program in command prompt (cmd.exe, powershell) instead of double clicking the script file.</li>
<li>Modify the script to include <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input" rel="nofollow"><code>input()</code></a> at the end of the script (to make the script wait for user input)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You could make it to ask you a question like :</p>
<pre><code>var = input("Please enter something: ")
</code></pre>
<p>So it won't immediately close.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you are on Windows and do not want to change your program, start it by double-clicking a batch file, called <code>RUNHELLO.BAT</code> containing this:</p>
<pre><code>python helloworld.py
PAUSE
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>first I think you should wirte "Hello world" in this section:</p>
<pre><code>if __name__ == '__main__':
   print("Hello World!");
</code></pre>
<p>then you should run this command "python helloworld.py" in terminal.</p>
<p>Hope help you.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">(Probably) nothing is wrong; the terminal window closes when the program finishes.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Please read some book about python, search before you ask a question. Nothing went wrong. It just printed your text and closed the terminal because it is finished.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">You haven't mentioned the operating system and how are you executing it. I'm not having this problem on Linux, so how do I reproduce it? :-D Also how about doing some research first. If I search "Python program closes quickly" with Google, some interesting results pop at the top e.g. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/3591807/12892">How can I stop python.exe from closing immediately after I get an output?</a> or <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/2322868/12892">How do I prevent my Python 2.6 application from automatically closing once reaching the end of code?</a>. Maybe you should create a canonical question.</span>
