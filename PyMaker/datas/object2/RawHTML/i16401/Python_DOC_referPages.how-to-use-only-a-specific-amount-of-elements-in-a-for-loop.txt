<p>I'm in my 101 level class and the instructions that I am operating under dictate that I have a parallel lists.  One list will be student name and the second will be student test scores.  The goal is to average four test scores per student and issue a letter grade.  I've seen numerous topics here regarding passing lists as arguments to functions but so far I haven't seen any that address how to have a function only use a set number of elements of a list per iteration.</p>
<p>Now my question, I am writing a function to average four test scores per student (5 total students).  The scores are stored in a list of 20 (one of the two parallel lists that I have to have with the other being the student names).  How, or can I, write the code to only look at four list elements per iteration (5 total iterations) and average those?  </p>

<p>I believe what is meant is the code below.. for example...</p>
<pre><code>Students = ["student1", "student2", "student3", "student4", "student5"]
Scores = [12,13,8,15,16,19,18,14,3,15,6,3,9,11,13,5,2,18,3,7]
</code></pre>
<p>how can we "for-loop" through the list Scores, and break each four elements and calculate the average of the corresponding student...</p>
<p>why not just loop through the student ????</p>
<pre><code>Students = ["student1", "student2", "student3", "student4", "student5"]
Scores = [12,13,8,15,16,19,18,14,3,15,6,3,9,11,13,5,2,18,3,7]

c = 0
Averages = []

for i in range(5):
    s = 0
    for j in range(4):
        s = s + Scores[c]
        c = c+1
    Averages.append(float (s)/4)

print Averages
</code></pre>
<p>Result would be:</p>
<pre><code>[12.0, 16.75, 6.75, 9.5, 7.5]
</code></pre>
<p>On the other hand, if you want to solve it with only one "for = loop", you can do below:</p>
<pre><code>Students = ["student1", "student2", "student3", "student4", "student5"]
Scores = [12,13,8,15,16,19,18,14,3,15,6,3,9,11,13,5,2,18,3,7]


Averages = []
s = 0
for i in range(20):
    if ((i) % 4 == 0 and i &gt; 0):
        Averages.append(float(s) / 4)
        s = 0
    s = s + Scores[i]

print Averages
</code></pre>

<p>I'm not sure of what you are asking.</p>
<p>There's many way to do something like this:</p>
<pre><code>for n in xrange(4):
    do_something_with(n)

for i, m in enumerate(list_of_elements):
    do_something_with(m)
    if i == 4:
        break
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">please add code of what you have tried so far.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Or if not the code you've tried, at least the code you've been given to work from. How do those scores/names lists look? Since you have 5 students, are polling 4 scores for each student, and there are 20 total scores....</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/312443/how-do-you-split-a-list-into-evenly-sized-chunks-in-python">chunk</a> the list into 4-sized bites, and iterate through those.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sorry I haven't added code but I am that lost!  This seems to be pretty dang close to what I need to be doing.  Unfortunately there are elements here that I am unfamiliar with.  The 'c', the 'i', the 'j', and the 's' clearly mean something.  Sorry, I'm not that advanced and I want to be on your level.  Would you please explain what is taking place here?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I think you need the "edit" I made to the code.. check it please... sorry for not making comments.. I thought they could be clear.. s is the sum of four consecutive scores, i is an integer counter , Averages is  a list holding the 5 averages of the 5 students..</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The light bulb just clicked on.  That makes sense now.  Unfortunately our book doesn't tell us how to use a range function within a list.  I assume you can use that function about anywhere right?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">range is very essential in python.. please check the python documentation online.. it is more complete than any book... Don't forget to upvote, or mark as answer in case you are satisfied !</span>
