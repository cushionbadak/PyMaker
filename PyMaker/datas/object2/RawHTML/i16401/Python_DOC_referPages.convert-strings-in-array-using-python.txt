<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have read a file in python. The data content of the file is in string format. What I want to do is:</p>
<ol>
<li>go through the file content line by line and save the lines in an array (size = line no.)</li>
<li>Then read line into an array.</li>
</ol>
<p>How should I do that using python? Any help will be appreciable. Thanks in advance.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>with open('myfile') as file:
    lines = list(file)
</code></pre>
<p>All the other stuff people are doing—creating a list in advance just to replace it it, writing a comprehension that just explicitly yields exactly what you gave it, etc.—is unnecessary.</p>
<p>A file object is an iterable of lines. The <code>list</code> function takes any iterable, and gives you a list with the same values. So, if you want a list of the lines, just pass the file object to the <code>list</code> function and you're done.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Use a <a href="http://www.pythonforbeginners.com/lists/list-comprehensions-in-python/" rel="nofollow">list comprehension</a></p>
<pre><code>lines = []
with open('myfile') as file:
    lines = [line for line in file]
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>lines = [line.strip() for line in open(path_to_file, 'r')]
</code></pre>
<p>Honestly I don't know what you mean with "Then read line into an array."</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Pretty easily:</p>
<pre><code>lines = open(filename).readlines()
</code></pre>
<p>Will give you a list of strings with each line in the appropriate index (<code>lines[2]</code> will give you the third line).</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Are you sure that you need to read the lines into an array?  File objects are iterable in Python.  What is wrong with <code>for line in file_object:</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">+1 for ducktyping</span>
<span class="comment-copy">what is <code>size = line no.</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Depending on your use case, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/linecache.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>linecache</code></a> (or maybe even <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/fileinput.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>fileinput</code></a>) might be helpful too.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">You're back. :-)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Wait, I thought I'm abarnert, you're undefined is not a function, back is back. :) Anyway, I don't have as much free time in front of a computer as I used to, but I have some again.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It's good to have you back, learned a lot from you.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">There's never any need to write <code>[line for line in file]</code>; you're just making it harder for novices to understand, harder to read, and slower for no reason.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@abarnert your answer is indeed faster and more readable, no need to bash the flaws of mine, just focus on yours</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thanks for help.. I already have my solution..</span>
