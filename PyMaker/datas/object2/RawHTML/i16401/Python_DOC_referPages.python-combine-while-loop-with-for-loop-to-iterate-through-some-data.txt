<p>I am new to python and in general to programming. I am trying to combine 'while loop' with 'for loop'  to iterate through some list but i am getting infinite loops.  here is the code</p>
<pre><code>l=[0,2,3,4]
lo=0
for i in range(len(l)):
     while (True):
          lo+=1
     if lo+l[i]&gt;40:
         break
     print(lo)
</code></pre>
<p>similarly with this code i got the same endless loop i want an output when the condition 'lo+ l[i] is greater than 40 stops looping and gives the final 'lo'output or result. I tried every method of indentation of the print line,but could not get what i wanted. please  comment on this code. thanks in advance.   </p>

<p>You get infinite loop because you <strong>wrote</strong> the infinite loop. You've probably thought that the <code>break</code> statement will somehow "magically" know that you don't want to end just the for loop, but also the while loop. But <code>break</code> will always break only one loop - the innermost one. So that means that your code actually does this:</p>
<pre><code>while (True):               # &lt;- infinite while loop
    lo += 1
    for i in range(len(l)): # &lt;- for loop
        if not l[i] &lt; 3:
            break           # &lt;- break the for loop
        print(lo)
    # while loop continues
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to end both loops, you have to do it explicitly - for example,
you can use a boolean variable:</p>
<pre><code>keep_running = True
while (keep_running):
    lo += 1
    for i in range(len(l)):
        if not l[i] &lt; 3:
            # this will effectively
            # stop the while loop:
            keep_running = False
            break
        print(lo)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Your break cancels the inner loop</p>
<p>this will work:</p>
<pre><code>l=[0,1,2,3,4] 
stop = False
lo=0 
while( not stop):
    lo+=1 
    for i in range(len(l)):
        if not l[i]&lt;3:
           stop = True
           break
        print(lo)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Try with this:</p>
<pre><code>l=[0,1,2,3,4]
lo=0

for i in l:
    lo+=1
    if not l[i]&lt;3:
        break
    print(lo)
</code></pre>

<p>You don't need the external infinite loop and you don't have to manage the index yourself (see <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#enumerate" rel="nofollow">enumerate</a> in the documentation).</p>
<pre><code>l = [0,1,2,3,4]
for index, value in enumerate(l):
    if value &gt;= 3:
         break
    print(index)
</code></pre>
<p>I changed the condition <code>if value not &lt; 3:</code> to <code>if value &gt;= 3:</code> for improved readability.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Try go trough in on paper, step by step and you will see what really happens, or add logs/prints to see what happens in each step.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It's not really clear what you are trying to achieve.  What output do you want?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You should always try and avoid breaks, they make code generally harder to understand.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">i am trying to get the lo output as the l[i]&gt;3 condition is not met.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">the code you provided works  fine thanks you</span>
