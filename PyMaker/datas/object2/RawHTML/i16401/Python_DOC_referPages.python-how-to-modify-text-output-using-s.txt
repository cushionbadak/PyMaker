<p>pretty straight forward to you guys but how do you modify the values output from the %s?</p>
<pre><code>print "Successfully created the file: %s" % iFile + '.txt'
</code></pre>
<p>I have tried using ()'s, {}'s, but nothing is working?</p>
<p>iFile is the name of the file and I want it to be displayed with .txt at the end when its displayed.</p>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p>I get the output <code>Successfully created the file: &lt;open file 'test', mode 'rb' at 0x14cef60&gt;.txt</code></p>

<p>Use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/stdtypes.html#str.format" rel="nofollow"><code>str.format(*args, **kwargs</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>"Successfully created the file: {0}.txt".format(iFile)
</code></pre>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>In [1]: iFile = "foo"

In [2]: "Successfully created the file: {0}.txt".format(iFile)
Out[2]: 'Successfully created the file: foo.txt'
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>
<p>Since you seem to have a file, not a file name, you could do this:</p>
<pre><code>In [4]: iFile = open("/tmp/foo.txt", "w")

In [5]: "Successfully created the file: {0}.txt".format(iFile)
Out[5]: "Successfully created the file: &lt;_io.TextIOWrapper name='/tmp/foo.txt' mode='w' encoding='UTF-8'&gt;.txt"

In [6]: "Successfully created the file: {0}.txt".format(iFile.name)
Out[6]: 'Successfully created the file: /tmp/foo.txt.txt'
</code></pre>
<p>Note that now the output is <code>foo.txt.txt</code> with a <em>double</em> extension. If you don't want this because the name of the file already is <code>foo.txt</code>, you don't should print the additional extension.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Using <code>%</code> is the old way to format strings. The current <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html" rel="nofollow">Python tutorial explains <code>format</code> in detail</a>.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The problem is that you're not passing it a string with the file name - you're passing it a file handle object, which is totally different. To get a name out of a file handle, use <code>iFile.name</code>.</p>
<pre><code>print "Successfully created the file: %s" % iFile.name + '.txt'
</code></pre>
<p>That will print what you're looking for.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>you can try the following code. I tried in in Python shell and it works. I think you were just missing the parentheses. </p>
<pre><code>print "Successfully created the file: %s.txt" % iFile
</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code>print "Successfully created the file: %s" % (iFile + '.txt')
</code></pre>
</div>
