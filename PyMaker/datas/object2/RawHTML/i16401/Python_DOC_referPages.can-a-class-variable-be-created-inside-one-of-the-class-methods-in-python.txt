<p>Touching on the following question posted on SO, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/475871/python-why-use-self-in-a-class?rq=1">Python - why use "self" in a class?</a>, I was wondering: </p>
<p>If I created a variable inside a method of a given class without using the "self.", will it be a class variable? And if this is not the case, why not? </p>
<p>So for instance if I have a class like so:</p>
<pre><code>class A:
    def somefunction(self):
        x=1
</code></pre>
<p>Will <em>x</em> be a class variable?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Actually no. Because of x is not class variable - it is local variable of method <code>somefunction</code>.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/classes.html#class-and-instance-variables" rel="nofollow">Class variable</a> should be defined exactly in the class body:</p>
<pre><code>class A:
    x = 1
    def somefunction(self):
        A.x += 1
        print A.x
</code></pre>
<p><strong>BTW:</strong> even if you had defined classvariable correct, you would anyway got output:</p>
<pre><code>2
2
</code></pre>
<p>because of in <code>somefunction</code> you're assigning <code>x=1</code>, so each time this function is run value of <code>x</code> is reset to <code>1</code> :)</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Whenever you assign a variable in a Python function, it's created in the innermost local namespace by default. You aren't referring to a variable in a different namespace (like the <code>A</code> class) unless you explicitly declare it. So in your code, you're creating <code>x</code> in a local namespace, which is specific to that function - not even specific to that instance of <code>A</code>, since you didn't declare it as <code>self.x</code>. I believe that is why you get <code>2,2</code> instead of <code>2,3</code>.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>No, your assumption is wrong. It is a local variable.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for your answer, makes total sense..</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I should actually rephrase my question to "can class variables be created in methods"</span>
<span class="comment-copy">yes, you can: <code>A.x = 1</code>. See link I have provided.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Possibly.., most likely yes. You actually shouldn't ask questions before searching it in Google.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No, of course I have searched it, but with the added information I got from your answer/comment, the question can be rephrased to be more succinct and meaningful.</span>
