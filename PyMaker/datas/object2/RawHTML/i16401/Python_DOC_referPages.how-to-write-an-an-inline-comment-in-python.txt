<p>Is there a method of ending single line comments in python?</p>
<p>Something like</p>
<pre><code>/*This is my comment*/ some more code here...
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>No, there are no inline comments in Python.  </p>
<p>From the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#comments">documentation</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A comment starts with a hash character (<code>#</code>) that is not part of a
  string literal, <strong>and ends at the end of the physical line</strong>. A comment
  signifies the end of the logical line unless the implicit line joining
  rules are invoked. Comments are ignored by the syntax; they are not
  tokens.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Whitespace in Python is too important to allow any other kind of comment besides the <code>#</code> comment that goes to the end of the line. Take this code:</p>
<pre><code>x = 1
for i in range(10):
             x = x + 1
/* Print. */ print x
</code></pre>
<p>Because indentation determines scope, the parser has no good way of knowing the control flow. It can't reasonably eliminate the comment and then execute the code after it. (It also makes the code less readable for humans.) So no inline comments.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm not sure there is any need to blame this on the parser's sensitivity to whitespace.  You could just say that the line starts where the comment starts if you wanted... I think it's more the philosophy that the middle of a line is no place for a comment. :-)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The parser isn't the only thing that reads the code... Personally, I would rather read python where lines start where the characters start.  It's not a huge deal, but it's the little things that make python easy and fun.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ABMagil that is true... a human parser is probably more error-prone than the actual parser :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I agree that comments inline before or after code are "ugly". But it can be very useful to comment out a specific part (inline) while debugging and I'd like to do the following (new lines after each '\'): <code>data_frame \     # .coalesce(1) \     .write \     .option('header', 'true') \     # Comment about csv file format \     .csv(file_name)</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">But what about line continuations? The sequence, <code>\#</code>, raises a SyntaxError because apparently <a href="https://youtu.be/Pa6fbOF3x8M" rel="nofollow noreferrer">they decided to make whitespace a part of the line continuation token</a>. I can't even move it to the next line because the comment <i>terminates</i> the line continuation. Why? This behavior is nonsensical. The sequence <code>\^J#</code> should just result in an implicit line continuation <i>continuation</i> after the comment terminates, or <code>\#</code> should be allowed, or there needs to be a dumb inline comment that interprets <code>[comment]  stuff</code> as just `  stuff`, all consequences included.</span>
