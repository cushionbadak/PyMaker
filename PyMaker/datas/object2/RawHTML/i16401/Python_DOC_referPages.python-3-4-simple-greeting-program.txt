<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Python amateur here again... I'm making a simple greeting program. In the following function the user is to enter their gender. I want it so that the user can enter M for Male or F for female, so it's simple. So I've used the following code:</p>
<pre><code>def genderFunction(firstName, fullName):
    print("%s, what is your gender?"%firstName)
    choice = input("Enter 'M' for Male or 'F' for Female\n")
</code></pre>
<p>What I want it to then do is from the M or F, create a new variable called 'gender' and either make it Male or Female. I'm unsure how to do this from the M/F input. Can anyone help? Please remember I'm new to this stuff. I tried it by doing this:</p>
<pre><code>def genderFunction(firstName, fullName):
    print("%s, what is your gender?"%firstName)
    choice = input("Enter 'M' for Male or 'F' for Female\n")
    if(choice.upper() == "M"):
      gender = Male
</code></pre>
<p>However it didn't like this, which I knew it wouldn't, but it was worth a try.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance! :)</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>There are two problems here:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><code>Male</code> needs to be enclosed with quotes so that it becomes a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#string-and-bytes-literals" rel="nofollow">string literal</a>:</p>
<pre><code>gender = "Male"
</code></pre>
<p>Otherwise, a <code>NameError</code> will be raised because <code>Male</code> is undefined.</p></li>
<li><p>The name <code>choice</code> is undefined because you named the input <code>genderInput</code>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Here is what your code should be:</p>
<pre><code>def genderFunction(firstName, fullName):
    print("%s, what is your gender?"%firstName)
    genderInput = input("Enter 'M' for Male or 'F' for Female\n").upper()
    if genderInput == "M":
        gender = "Male"
    elif genderInput == "F":
        gender= "Female"
</code></pre>
<p>You'll notice too that I called <code>str.upper</code> at the end of the line that gets the input.  This saves you from having to call it once per if-statement.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>instead of doing <code>choice = input("Enter 'M' for Male or 'F' for Female\n)</code> you can put it into gender right away, like so: <code>gender = input("Enter 'M' for Male or 'F' for Female\n)</code></p>
<p>then if you want to check if the user is, male for example, you might do something like: </p>
<pre><code>if gender == 'M':
    #do stuff here
</code></pre>
<p>it doesn't really matter what you call <code>gender</code>, you could leave it as <code>choice</code> if you wanted. it's just easier to read and understand if you have it as <code>gender</code>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Do you want separate <i>class</i> objects of type <b>Male</b> and <b>Female</b>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@KenHampson sorry for the slow response, a solution has already been found, but thank you for taking the time to read the post!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sure, no problem.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Just realised my silly mistake. I've already made one of those on here when asking a question. I probably shouldn't try coding at 12 am... Thanks very much for pointing out my error! Also, in relation to the genderInput, I had changed it to choice after I had realised what I had done from my draft, but instead of copying my updated version, I copied my draft version. :)</span>
