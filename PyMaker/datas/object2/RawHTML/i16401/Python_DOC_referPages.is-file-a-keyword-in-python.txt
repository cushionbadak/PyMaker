<p>Is <code>file</code> a keyword in python?</p>
<p>I've seen some code using the keyword <code>file</code> just fine, while others have suggested not to use it and my editor is color coding it as a keyword.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>No, <code>file</code> is a builtin, not a keyword:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import keyword
&gt;&gt;&gt; keyword.iskeyword('file')
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; import __builtin__
&gt;&gt;&gt; hasattr(__builtin__, 'file')
True
</code></pre>
<p>It can be seen as an alias for <code>open()</code>, but it has been removed from Python 3, as the new <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html" rel="noreferrer"><code>io</code> framework</a> replaced it. Technically, it is the <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#file-objects" rel="noreferrer">type of object returned by the <code>open()</code> function</a>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">-1 searching for a list of keywords of a language is both mandatory and natural when trying to learn that language.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Solkar To which language do you refer? Python2 or Python3? The confusion of OP is reasonable, imo.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">So is the use of file as a variable not recommended?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user3388884: Not if you also need to test for the <code>file</code> type, no.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">ahh, I see that you've edited in that <code>file</code> is the type of object returned by <code>open</code> rendering the comment I was typing useless... Are you looking over my shoulder?</span>
