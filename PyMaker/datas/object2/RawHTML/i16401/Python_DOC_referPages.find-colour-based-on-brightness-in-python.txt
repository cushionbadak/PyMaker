<p>Given a certain amount of brightness (from 0 to 255, for example) is there any algorithm in which one can derive an RGB colour from it?</p>
<p>This would work where 0 is black, 255 is white and all the other colours are placed between them.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>In Python there is the standard library module <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/colorsys.html#module-colorsys" rel="nofollow"><code>colorsys</code></a>. What you want is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV" rel="nofollow">HSL colour coordinates</a>; then your "brightness" is the luminance. The values used by the module are 0..1 for each component. [ Notice that whereas the standard order is HSL, in python it is H<b>LS</b>. ]</p>
<p>Thus to get fully saturated red colour for different luminances, you can do</p>
<pre><code>import colorsys
hue = 0.0        # 0 is red
saturation = 1.0 # fully saturated

for luminance in range(0, 10, 1):
   r, g, b = colorsys.hls_to_rgb(hue, luminance / 10.0, saturation)
   print('{:d}, {:d}, {:d}'.format(int(r * 255), int(g * 255), int(b * 255)))
</code></pre>
<p>Resulting in </p>
<pre><code>0, 0, 0
51, 0, 0
102, 0, 0
153, 0, 0
204, 0, 0
255, 0, 0
255, 50, 50
255, 101, 101
255, 153, 153
254, 204, 204
255, 255, 255
</code></pre>
<p>Likewise to get colours at a single brightness for the whole spectrum, keep the luminance and saturation constant, and vary hue from 0 to 1.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">please explain more clearly about your question ? what you want exactly ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I would like something of a spectrum, I guess- so that any given number between 0 and 255 is assigned a colour- with the darker colours as smaller numbers and the lighter as larger ones.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I apologise for the late comment.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is not really about python, please read about color spaces: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_space" rel="nofollow noreferrer">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_space</a>. What you want can be achieved by HSL color space: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV" rel="nofollow noreferrer">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV</a></span>
