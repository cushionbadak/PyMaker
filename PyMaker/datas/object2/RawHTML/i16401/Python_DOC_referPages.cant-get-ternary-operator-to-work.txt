<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>So I have a double problem. I have <code>selectedCards</code> list, which contains 2 elements - card rank and suit, in this format: <code>['6', 'c']</code> </p>
<p><code>club = u"\u2663" # Unicode codepoint for club</code></p>
<p><code>newList = [club for i in selectedCards if i == 'c' else i]</code></p>
<p>I want to change 'c' into graphical representation of club, but this expression not working. I tried searching a lot but couldn't find what's wrong. It says: <code>SyntaxError: invalid syntax</code></p>
<p>Second problem, If I remove else statement, then it works, but it does not output what I want, it looks like this: <code>[u'\u2663']</code>, even thought print(club) outputs â™£.</p>
<p>EDIT: <code>newList = [club if i == 'c' else i for i in selectedCards]</code> is the correct syntax, thanks to xtofl.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Probably you are better off with a dict:</p>
<pre><code>symbols = {
  'c': u"\u2663",
  'h': u"....hearts",
  ...
}

newList = [symbols[card] for card in selectedCards]
</code></pre>
<p>(or if you want to go functional:</p>
<pre><code>map( symbols.get, selectedCards )
</code></pre>
<p>)</p>
<p>As for the 1st problem: cfr <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/4260304/6610">https://stackoverflow.com/a/4260304/6610</a></p>
<p>For the 2nd, printing, problem: python just gives you 'a' list representation; if you want it in string form, this did the trick for me:</p>
<pre><code>print("".join(newList))
</code></pre>
<p>(hint: it would be wise to represent you card in a <code>Card</code> class containing all this logic, somewhat like</p>
<pre><code>class Card:
   def __init__(self, rank, suit):
      self.rank = rank
      self.suit = suit

   symbols = {'c': u"\u2663", ...}

   def __str__(self):
      return "".join([self.rank, Card.symbols[self.suit]])
</code></pre>
<p>)</p>

<span class="comment-copy">It's a good idea to split two questions into... two separate questions :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">is <code>selectedCards</code> then a list of two-element lists?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It's a list of 2 elements, like: <code>['A', 'h']</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">I know there are many options to achieve same task, I still wonder why that way does not work. Anyways, your implementation, gives me error <code>KeyError: 'Q'</code>, where Q changes depending on rank. I think I need to include condition here to check if it's rank or a suit.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">For an answer to the list comprehension question, do take a look at <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/4260304/6610">stackoverflow.com/a/4260304/6610</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">xtofl, yep this solved: <code>newList = [club if i == 'c' else i for i in selectedCards]</code>! But again I get it like this <code>['Q', u'\u2663']</code> which is my 2nd problem.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, got it now :) Thank you.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Wouldn't <code>__str__</code> be more appropriate than <code>__repr__</code> as this method gives a nice to print string rather than the actual values of the object attributes? see <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__repr__" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__repr__</a></span>
