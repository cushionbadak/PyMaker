<p>How can I log an exception object with its traceback in Python 3, using the standard <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html" rel="nofollow">logging</a> module?</p>
<p>Note that the exception in question isn't necessarily the one currently being handled.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Logger objects accept an <code>exc_info</code> argument to include exception information (including traceback), which is expected to be a tuple containing the exception's class, the exception itself and the exception's traceback. The trickiest part is to get hold of the traceback, but it turns out that since Python 3.0, <a href="http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3109/" rel="nofollow">exceptions have a <code>__traceback__</code> attribute</a>:</p>
<pre><code>logger = logging.getLogger()
exc_info = (type(exc), exc, exc.__traceback__)
logger.error('Exception occurred', exc_info=exc_info)
</code></pre>

<p>Honestly I don't know if I'm contributing in the slightest by doing this, but I did find this resource that I thought pertinent to your question and I hope useful. </p>

<p>The gist of it being, if you place logging.exception() inside of an except block, then you can log all of your errors.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">For Python 2.7 you can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/sys.html#sys.exc_info" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>sys.exc_info()</code></a> to get the traceback of the exception currently being handled.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@LukasGraf I know, but this question deals with general exception objects.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You can simply use: <code>logger.error('Exception occurred', exc_info=exc)</code>. Python itself will <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/v3.7.1rc2/Lib/logging/__init__.py#L1513" rel="nofollow noreferrer">extract exception type/traceback info</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The problem is it's not inside an exception handler.</span>
