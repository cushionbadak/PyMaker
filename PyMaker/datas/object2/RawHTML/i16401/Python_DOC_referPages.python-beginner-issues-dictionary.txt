<p>I've been trying to produce a program with an output:</p>
<pre><code>Enter line: which witch
Enter line: is which
Enter line: 
is 1
which 2
witch 1
</code></pre>
<p>How I want it to work is for you to enter a few lines, and when nothing is submitted it will count the number of each line. </p>
<p>Currently, I'm not able to count individual lines in a sentence, but only the whole sentence. My code:</p>
<pre><code>dic = {}

while True:
    line = input('Enter Line: ')
    line = line.lower()    
    if not line:
        break

    dic.setdefault(line, 0)
    dic[line] += 1
for line, n in sorted(dic.items()):
    print(line, n)
</code></pre>
<p>Which produces output:</p>
<pre><code>Enter line: which witch
Enter line: is which
Enter line: 
which witch 1
is which 1
</code></pre>
<p>Rather than the first one</p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated. Thanks</p>

<p>The code is using each line as a dictionary key, not word. Split lines using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.split" rel="nofollow"><code>str.split</code></a> and iterate words.</p>
<pre><code>dic = {}

while True:
    line = input('Enter Line: ')
    line = line.lower()    
    if not line:
        break
    for word in line.split():    # &lt;-----
        dic.setdefault(word, 0)  # &lt;-----
        dic[word] += 1           # &lt;-----
for line, n in sorted(dic.items()):
    print(line, n)
</code></pre>
<p>BTW, consider using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.Counter" rel="nofollow"><code>collections.Counter</code></a> for this kind of task (counting occurrences).</p>

<span class="comment-copy">...or use <code>dic[word] = dic.get(word, 0) + 1</code> instead of the two lines with <code>setdefault</code> (which itself calls <code>get()</code> anyway and returns a value that you're not using).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks. I was spending forever on this!</span>
