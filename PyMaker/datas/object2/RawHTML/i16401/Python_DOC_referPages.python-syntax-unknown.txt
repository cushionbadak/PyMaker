<p>I just came across an assignment like this in python. I checked everywhere to see what this was but couldn't find it. What does this mean in python? </p>
<pre><code> total_mask |= is_NA
</code></pre>
<p>The operator in the middle is confusing me. </p>
<p>Thanks</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>It's just an operator of logical OR.
If <code>total_mask</code> is</p>
<pre><code>0011101010101001110
</code></pre>
<p>and <code>is_NA</code> is</p>
<pre><code>0000000000000100000
</code></pre>
<p>then <code>total_mask</code> will become</p>
<pre><code>0011101010101101110
</code></pre>
<p>in this case it's just like addition.
<em>EDIT</em>: of course the numbers are here written in binary.
In Python you can convert a number to a binary string using the <code>bin</code> function, for example</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; bin(99)
'0b1100011'
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>It is the same as</p>
<pre><code>total_mask = total_mask|is_NA
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Generally speaking, <code>A ?= B</code> is the same as <code>A = A ? B</code>, for most any operator you care to replace the question mark with.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That operator (and many like it) were introduced in <a href="http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0203/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PEP 203</a>.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">not necessarily</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@wim care to explain?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">consider the case of sets, where this operator means in-place union.  the |= operator (which slots into <code>set.__ior__</code>) will preserve the identity of the set, whereas the method you have shown will create a new set.  this can have side effects for other references to the same set.</span>
