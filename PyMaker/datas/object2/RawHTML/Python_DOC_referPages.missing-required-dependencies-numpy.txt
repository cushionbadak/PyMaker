<p>I'm running a python script in a remote computer in a Venv. It worked just fine this friday but for some reason now it returns this error: </p>
<pre><code>File "D:\PATH\Venv\lib\site-packages\pandas\__init__.py", line 19, in &lt;module&gt;
    "Missing required dependencies {0}".format(missing_dependencies))
ImportError: Missing required dependencies ['numpy']
</code></pre>
<p>I check my versions and are up to date (numpy-1.16.2 and pandas-0.24.2) and I can only install dependencies from "pip". I tried to uninstall and then install pandas, numpy in several orders to no avail. I cannot use anaconda or similar and can't use ubuntu's shell either. Does anybody know how to fix this and how to prevent it from happening again? It made us lose a few working hours.</p>

<p>you don't have numpy in Venv (which pandas requires), you are probably calling something in pandas that suddenly requires numpy, try sourcing the virtualenv and running pip install numpy</p>
<p>Not sure about windows but in unix I would:</p>
<pre><code>source D:\PATH\Venv\bin\activate
pip install numpy
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Didn't work. The Venv recognizes and has numpy installed</span>
<span class="comment-copy">try source D:\PATH\Venv\bin\activate  AND THEN pip freeze    see what you get</span>
