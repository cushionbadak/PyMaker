<p>Is it possible to use XPath Query in Python while processing XML. I am using minidom which doesn't support that. Is there any other module for that?</p>

<p>etree supports XPath queries, just like lxml.</p>
<p>etree is included in the standard library, but lxml is faster.</p>

<p>My favorite XML processing library for Python is <a href="http://lxml.de" rel="nofollow noreferrer">lxml</a> which, because it is a wrapper around libxml2, also supports full XPath.</p>
<p>There is also <a href="http://4suite.org/index.xhtml" rel="nofollow noreferrer">4Suite</a> which is more of a pure Python solution.</p>

<p>ElementTree is included.  Under 2.6 and below its xpath is pretty weak, but in <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html#xpath-support" rel="nofollow">2.7 much improved</a>:</p>
<pre><code>import xml.etree.ElementTree as et
root = et.parse(filename)
result = ''

# How to make decisions based on attributes even in 2.6
for e in root.findall('.//child/grandchild'):
    if e.attrib.get('name') == 'foo':
        result = e.text
        break
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Support for XPath is limited in ElementTree though, as quoted in the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html#xpath-support" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python 3 docs</a>: "This module provides limited support for XPath expressions for locating elements in a tree. The goal is to support a small subset of the abbreviated syntax; a full XPath engine is outside the scope of the module."</span>
