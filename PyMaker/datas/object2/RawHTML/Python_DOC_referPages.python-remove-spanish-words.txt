<p>I have a list of tokens such as <code>["Adiós", "John", "Salud", "Love"]</code> and my task is to delete the word if it is recognized as Spanish.</p>
<p>I have tried <code>enchant</code> and <code>polyglot</code> but they just cannot connect to <code>aspell</code>.</p>
<p>Are there any other easier modules or methods to detect Spanish words and delete them?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>I found <a href="https://github.com/DanielJDufour/language-detector" rel="nofollow noreferrer">language-detector</a>. You could try that.</p>
<pre><code>from language_detector import detect_language

data = ["Adiós", "John", "Salud", "Love"]

not_spanish_data = [word for word in data if detect_language(word) != 'Spanish']

print(not_spanish_data)
#['John', "Salud" 'Love']
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Maybe delete if it is not English?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You could try <a href="https://github.com/detectlanguage/detectlanguage-python" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this</a>, it's a Python client from the <a href="https://detectlanguage.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Language Detection API</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>langdetect</code> is usually pretty good for sentences, but not individual words. For example, <code>langdetect.detect('John')</code> returns <code>de</code>, not <code>en</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@stark I have tried but it's too "strong" to keep words like "Obamacare."</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Let me try it and I will report how this works, thanks!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Tested, it does detect "Obamacare" as English, I'm not great with spanish, but it does detect "Salud" as French, so if that's what you want is just no Spanish then this should work</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I don't know why I was downvoted though, this seems like a perfectly viable answer although with a broader dataset you will need to test.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I didn't downgrade it and it works as you described. I just upgraded it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@tzu does this answer your question?</span>
