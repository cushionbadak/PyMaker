<p>I'm trying to play a random youtube video using pafy and vlc. But when I'm executing the script :</p>
<pre><code>        import vlc 
        import cv2            

        url = "Youtube_URL"            
        video = pafy.new(url)
        best = video.getbest()
        playurl = best.url
        ins = vlc.Instance()
        player = ins.media_player_new()
        Media = ins.media_new(playurl)
        Media.get_mrl()
        player.set_media(Media)
        player.play()
</code></pre>
<p>I'm getting below error :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'Instance'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've tried a lot but <strong>vlc.Instance()</strong> is not working, I don't know why. I will appreciate any help/inputs.</p>

<p>don't know if you have solved the problem already. I don't really know why this happens. I only figured out that it happens when you execute pip3 install python-vlc(or something like that).</p>
<p>I think they might have changed some methods and objects in more recent versions.However this works for me.
Here is the oficial link where I downloaded it from:</p>
<p><a href="https://pypi.org/project/python-vlc/1.1.2/#files" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://pypi.org/project/python-vlc/1.1.2/#files</a></p>
<p>Get the tar.gz file, extract the content and change directory, then run: 
sudo python3 install setup.py</p>
<p>You have to uninstall first the module that you installed previously:
 python3 uninstall vlc and python3 uninstall python-vlc. Install the one that you downloaded and then it might ask you to install again module vlc(not python-vlc). Hope this helps!</p>

<span class="comment-copy">"Instance = vlc.Instance()" won't work as you have to assign a variable and not a class name to a new object. Try to "instance = vlc.Instance()" instead.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">my bad :( I have modified the code, still the same error.</span>
