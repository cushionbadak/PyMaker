<p>Im very new to web programming. I made a small front end program and decided to use python to host it on my computer. When I ran the python script I got the following messages on my terminal:</p>
<pre><code>127.0.0.1 - - [16/Mar/2019 15:40:45] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 -
127.0.0.1 - - [16/Mar/2019 15:40:45] "GET /style.css HTTP/1.1" 200 -
127.0.0.1 - - [16/Mar/2019 15:40:45] "GET /btnEvent.js HTTP/1.1" 200 -
127.0.0.1 - - [16/Mar/2019 15:40:46] "GET /favicon.ico HTTP/1.1" 404 -
</code></pre>
<p>The first three files belong to my program so thats correct. However, theres a last file favicon.ico and the request apparently failed. Why did that happen?</p>

<p>A favicon.ico is the little icon that browsers display next to a page's title on a browser tab, or in the address bar next to its URL. In practical when you bookmark any page then it shows a logo of website which is nothing but <code>favicon.ico</code>. It is default lookup of browsers.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favicon" rel="nofollow noreferrer">favicon</a> is the little image on your browser's tab. </p>
<p>The request probably failed because the <code>favicon.ico</code> can't be found. You should create it in the same folder as your other files</p>
