<p>I process data and for some examples the data are problematic. Python raises a</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ValueError: Residuals are not finite in the initial point.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is there a possibility to catch Value errors only with the message <code>"Residuals are not finite in the initial point."</code>?
I tried:</p>
<pre><code>try:
    [code that could raise the error]
except Exception as e:
    if e=='ValueError(\'Residuals are not finite in the initial point.\')':
        [do stuff I want when the Residuals are not finite]
    else:
        raise e
</code></pre>
<p>But it still raised the error all the time. Is there a way to achieve what I imagined?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>You may have to check if <code>e.args[0]</code> exactly contains this string (provoke the error and print <code>e.args[0]</code>)</p>

<p>You can catch a ValueError Exception like this:</p>
<pre><code>try:

    #[code that could raise the error]

except ValueError as e:

    print("Residuals are not finite in the initial point. ...")
    #[do stuff I want when the Residuals are not finite]
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">For completeness sake, you may want to reference the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#handling-exceptions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs</a>, especially the paragraph that starts with "The except clause may". It might also be sane to check <code>if len(e.args)</code> first before trying to access <code>e.args[0]</code> in case the code raises more ValueErrors which have no inputs.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Reti43 I have enhanced the answer. Thank you.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This doesn't answer the question because a <code>ValueError</code> can be thrown for many reasons. MaxS is interested specifically for a ValueError with the described message in the question.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, but I would like to catch only those which show the message I mentioned.</span>
