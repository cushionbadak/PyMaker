<p>I am trying to use Turtle in Spyder and Jupyter but I am having trouble when I try to close the window.</p>
<p>I am using Python 3.7 on Spyder 3.3.1 and Jupyter 5.6.0, on Windows 10</p>
<p>This is what I have tried</p>
<pre><code>import turtle as trtl

trtl.forward(100)
trtl.left(90)
trtl.forward(100)
trtl.left(90)
trtl.forward(100)
trtl.left(90)
trtl.forward(100)
trtl.exitonclick()
</code></pre>
<p>I works fine, but if I close the window and try to run the same code again, I get the following error:</p>
<pre><code>---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Terminator                                Traceback (most recent call last)
&lt;ipython-input-9-ad2d84897daf&gt; in &lt;module&gt;()
      1 import turtle as trtl
      2 
----&gt; 3 trtl.forward(100)
      4 trtl.left(90)
      5 trtl.forward(100)

~\Anaconda3\lib\turtle.py in forward(distance)

Terminator: 
</code></pre>
<p>I have tried multiple combinations of <code>done()</code>,<code>bye()</code> and <code>exitonclick()</code> but I cannot make it work</p>

<p>Here is an excerpt from the turtle <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/turtle.html#turtle.exitonclick" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the value “using_IDLE” in the configuration dictionary is False (default value), also enter mainloop. Remark: If IDLE with the -n switch (no subprocess) is used, this value should be set to True in turtle.cfg. In this case IDLE’s own mainloop is active also for the client script.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, you can add <code>using_IDLE = True</code> to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#how-to-configure-screen-and-turtles" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>turtle.cfg</code></a> file to solve this issue. This will prevent <code>exitonclick()</code> to enter the mainloop.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Than you for the answer, but that did not fix the problem. Now I get a different error that I cannot post here for lack of space, but it's again an error about the terminator with no more information:          File ".../test.py", line 3, in &lt;module&gt;         trtl.forward(100)        File "&lt;string&gt;", line 5, in forward          Terminator</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hey @jrglez, you can try providing <code>-n</code> in the <i>Configure per file &gt;&gt; command line options</i> in spyder. But, I don't think it'll work either. If nothing works, you can always choose <i>Configure per file &gt;&gt; Execute in external system terminal</i>. But, again that doesn't solve the original problem. And, Feel free to add your own answer if you find one.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, the second option seems to work on Spyder. But is there any way to do something similar in Jupyter?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I don't think it's possible in jupyter as what the second option is doing is to simply call <code>python &lt;filename.py&gt;</code> from system terminal, which isn't possible in jupyter. As a turnaround, you can still save jupyter notebook as python file then execute it.</span>
