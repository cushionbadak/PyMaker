<p>I am trying to figure out how to list out all the standard library functions/methods (still learning the difference, I'm a noob). So I get how to import a module and use dir() and help(). These have been a great help and when I try to rewrite a program I learned to write and I get lost I try to use the dir() and help() to spark my memory.</p>
<p>However, for example, I was re-looking through some code and I had .replace() and I was scouring through my imported modules to find it and then found out it's in the standard library and a sub-part of the str() function. Is there something I can type into dir() that will spit out str()?</p>
<p>How can I print out all top level built in function/methods like I would when I do dir(re)?</p>
<p>I've tried re-wording this question in search engines several ways and I can't find anything and the results get muddied with "python list _____".</p>
<p>Thanks so much!</p>

<p><code>dir()</code> on a value of that type.</p>
<pre><code>dir('hello') # string methods
dir(5) # integer methods
dir([]) # list methods
</code></pre>

<p>Ah, I never tried typing just "dir()" that listed I could put in dir(__builtins__) and that is what I was looking for. I'll leave it here in case someone else is a noob too and knows where they can start. Just start with dir() and go down the rabbit hole!</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You had <code>.replace()</code> just hanging out on its own? Or was it used properly, as an attribute of a string, e.g. <code>mytext.replace(' ', '')</code>? That should be enough to tell you that it's an attribute of a string. If all you have is the word on its own, you can Google something like "python method replace" or simply go over the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">official Python documentation</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It was confusing because I was using one module to get a packet, another one to convert the packet and then I was setting an element of that packet as a variable and I wasn't sure if it was a method that was part of any of the 3 modules I imported. I didn't know if it was considered a string or a packet or a load. I'm learning as I go. Some of these modules have functions that are buried deep and can get confusing so I try to route my way from the top so I always know how to get back.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Awesome, I didn't know I could do that either, thank you!</span>
