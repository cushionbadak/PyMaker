<p>I have a project in Pythonlike with a structure like belwo:</p>
<pre><code>Mypkg
|___init__.py
|__module1
|  |__init__.py
|  |__module1.py
|__main.py
</code></pre>
<p>Actualy, I would like to dispatch the development of module1 to a seprate person and he can work it on Git repo, Can I use the module1 each time from a git repo, Shoud I write a requirements.txt in my project?</p>

<p>I believe @aws_apprentice's comment was suggesting that you could build module1 as a proper python package by writing a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/distutils/setupscript.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">setup.py</a> for it, then install that as a dependency of Mypkg.  But during early development you can just put one git repo in another and .gitignore it.</p>
<pre><code>cd mypkg
git clone &lt;https or ssh git thing&gt;/module1
echo 'module1' &gt;&gt; .gitignore
git commit -am 'add module1 to gitignore'
</code></pre>
<p>then to update module1 from changes the other person pushed to git,</p>
<pre><code>cd mypkg/module1
git pull
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">you need a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.7/distutils/setupscript.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">setup.py</a> file</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Can you give me an answer or more detailed explanations? I want to import them from a git repo..</span>
<span class="comment-copy">the link i provided shows you how to create the file that you need in order to distribute your product on github so others can easily install it in their environment</span>
