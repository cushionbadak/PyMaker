<p>I have created a dice game which displays the scores at the end of each round. I would like to know how to separately add up the scores of both players so it displays the total score of 5 rounds.</p>
<p>This is the code below:</p>
<pre><code>import random
import time

def bothDice():
    count=0  
    while count&lt;5:
        count=count+1
        score=0
        print("Round",count)
        print("Player One rolls first dice")
        time.sleep(1)
        dice1=(random.randint(1,6))
        print("you rolled a ",dice1)
        print("Player One rolls second dice")
        time.sleep(1)
        dice2=(random.randint(1,6))
        print("you rolled a ",dice2)

        score=dice1+dice2
        if score%2==0:
            score=score+10

        if dice1==dice2:
            print("You rolled a double- You get an extra roll")
            for x in range (1):
                print("You rolled a:")
                extraDice=(random.randint(1,6))
                print(extraDice)
                extraScore = score+extraDice
                score = extraScore

        else:
            score=score-5

        print("======","Your combined score is ", score,"======")

        score=0
        print("Player Two rolls first dice")
        time.sleep(1)
        dice1=(random.randint(1,6))
        print("you rolled a ",dice1)
        print("Player Two rolls second dice")
        time.sleep(1)
        dice2=(random.randint(1,6))
        print("you rolled a ",dice2)

        score=dice1+dice2
        if score%2==0:
            score=score+10

                extraScore = score+extraDice
                score = extraScore

        else:

<p>How would I make the scores of each round add together?
Thanks</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I'd suggest you to re-write your code -- For instance, you can use a <code>for</code> loop instead of a <code>while</code> loop to keep track of rounds. I think use of <code>dict</code> or <code>list</code> is useful. I added two dictionaries for both players, <code>result_p1</code> and <code>result_p2</code> that store scores per round. The score can be negative (not sure if intended). </p>
<p>Here is the code below:</p>
<pre><code>import random
import time

def bothDice():
    count=0

    # New dicts that store counts
    result_p1 = {}
    result_p2 = {}

    while count&lt;5:
        count=count+1
        score=0
        print("Round",count)
        print("Player One rolls first dice")
        time.sleep(1)
        dice1=(random.randint(1,6))
        print("you rolled a ",dice1)
        print("Player One rolls second dice")
        time.sleep(1)
        dice2=(random.randint(1,6))
        print("you rolled a ",dice2)

        score=dice1+dice2
        if score%2==0:
            score=score+10
        else:
            score=score-5

        if dice1==dice2:
            print("You rolled a double- You get an extra roll")
            for x in range (1):
                print("You rolled a:")
                extraDice=(random.randint(1,6))
                print(extraDice)
                extraScore = score+extraDice
                score = extraScore



        print("======","Your combined score is ", score,"======")

        # Store result of this round for player 1
        if score != 0:
            result_p1[count] = score
        else:
            result_p1[count] = 0

        score=0
        print("Player Two rolls first dice")
        time.sleep(1)
        dice1=(random.randint(1,6))
        print("you rolled a ",dice1)
        print("Player Two rolls second dice")
        time.sleep(1)
        dice2=(random.randint(1,6))
        print("you rolled a ",dice2)

        score=dice1+dice2
        if score%2==0:
            score=score+10
        else:
            score=score-5
        if dice1==dice2:
            print("You rolled a double- You get an extra roll")
            for x in range (1):
                print("You rolled a:")
                extraDice=(random.randint(1,6))
                print(extraDice)
                extraScore = score+extraDice
                score = extraScore

        print("======","Your combined score is ", score,"======")

        # Store result of this round for player 2
        if score != 0:
            result_p2[count] = score
        else:
            result_p2[count] = 0

    # Print sum of results using f-string in python 3.
    print(f"Player 1 scores: {result_p1}")
    print(f"Player 2 scores: {result_p2}")
    print(f"Sum of player 1 score: {sum(result_p1.values())}")

<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#f-strings" rel="nofollow noreferrer">This</a> might be useful if my print statement didn't make sense. </p>
<p>Here is an output of the new print statements.</p>
<pre><code>Player 1 scores: {1: 9, 2: 13, 3: 17, 4: 0, 5: 19}
Player 2 scores: {1: 17, 2: 13, 3: 13, 4: -2, 5: -2}
Sum of player 1 score: 58
Sum of player 2 score: 39

<p>Edit: Added <code>if</code> statements before adding score to player <code>dict</code> to check if <code>score</code> is negative. If negative -&gt; add <code>0</code> instead.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Why can't you define two scores? Something like <code>p1_score</code> and <code>p2_score</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Welcome to stackoverflow! Let's clarify some points: a) <code>def bothDice():</code> - there is something obviously wrong with indentation, can you correct subbmitted code ? b) what have you done so far?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What's not working though? Is the score not being displayed as you wanted?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">the code works perfectly fine on python. i just want to know how to make each players' score at the end of each round add to make a total score</span>
<span class="comment-copy">if a player scores an even number its supposed to add 10 points- it doesnt do this. also how would you make sure the points dont go below 0</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>Round 1 Player One rolls first dice you rolled a  2 Player One rolls second dice you rolled a  2 You rolled a double- You get an extra roll You rolled a: 2 ====== Your combined score is  16 ======</code> This was one of my runs. It seems to be doing it just fine. For your second question. It depends on what you're looking for. What's the logic if you do get a <code>negative</code> score?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">the scores are not supposed to go below 0</span>
<span class="comment-copy">when i ran the code i got this:   Player Two rolls first dice you rolled a  2 Player Two rolls second dice you rolled a  4 ====== Your combined score is  11 ======                                                          i think it only works for doubles</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Right it makes sense not to have scores go negative. But if the score IS negative, are you looking to basically turn it into 0? Or does the player get to go again somehow?</span>
