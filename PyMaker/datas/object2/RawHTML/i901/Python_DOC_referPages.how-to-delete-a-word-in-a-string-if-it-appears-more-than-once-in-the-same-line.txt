<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have a list of words in a txt file, each one in a line with its definition next to them. However, the definition sometimes gives a sentence using the word. I want to replace that word repeated in the example with the symbol ~. How could I do this with Python?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Ok, here is my example of replacing every instance of a word in a sentence with another character...</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; my_string = "the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog"
&gt;&gt;&gt; search_word = "the"
&gt;&gt;&gt; replacement_symbol = "~"
&gt;&gt;&gt; my_string.replace(search_word, replacement_symbol)
'~ quick brown fox jumped over ~ lazy dog'
</code></pre>
<p>Obviously this doesn't cover loading in the file, reading it line by line and omitting the first instance of the word... Lets extend it a little.</p>
<p>words.txt</p>
<pre><code>fox the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog
the the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog
jumped the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog
</code></pre>
<p>And to read this, strip the first word and then replace that word in the rest of the line...</p>
<pre><code>with open('words.txt') as f:
    for line in f.readlines():
        line = line.strip()
        search_term = line.split(' ')[0]
        sentence = ' '.join(line.split(' ')[1:])
        sentence = sentence.replace(search_term, '~')
        line = '%s %s' % (search_term, sentence)
        print(line)
</code></pre>
<p>and the output...</p>
<pre><code>fox the quick brown ~ jumped over the lazy dog
the ~ quick brown fox jumped over ~ lazy dog
jumped the quick brown fox ~ over the lazy dog
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Assuming the word and definition is separated by #:</p>
<pre><code>with open('file.txt','r') as f:
    for line in f:
        myword,mydefinition=line.split("#") 

        if myword in mydefinition
            mydefinition.replace(myword, "~")
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">What have you tried so far?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That is simple, in 4 steps: 1. read the file, line by line; 2. parse the line, i.e. extract the word and the definition; 3. detect the word in the definition and make a substitution; 4. write the modified lines into file. Which of these steps have you done so far, which one are you having problems with?</span>

<span class="comment-copy">I was not sure about what would be the best way to structure the program, but thanks zvone and sak, I could do it thanks to your advices.</span>
