<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I am trying to come up with a code that is able to take in a string and split it into messages with n number of characters. Each message cannot exceed n but can have less than n characters as words should not be split. For example 'This is an example message' and n=10. This code would return 
'This is an'
'example'
'message'</p>
<p>Any suggestions on how I can approach this?</p>
<pre><code>import math 

def solution(S, K):
    x = math.ceil(len(S)/K)
    y = S.split()

    lists = [[] for i in range(x)]

    for i in lists:
        while len(i) &lt;= K:
            i.append(y[b])
            b+=1
</code></pre>
<p>x is the number of messages that I think is needed. Can someone explain to me how I can complete my code? </p>

<p>This is what the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/textwrap.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">textwrap</a> library is for.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from textwrap import wrap
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(wrap('This is an example message', 10))
['This is an', 'example', 'message']
</code></pre>
