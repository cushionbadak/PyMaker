<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I am trying to find all the elements with more than some frequency in a counter list. But I couldn't find any solution.</p>
<p>a=['a','a','a','a','b','a','b','a','b','a','b','a','b','a','b','a','b','c','c','c','c','c','c','c','c','d','d','e']</p>
<p>b=Counter(a)</p>
<p>b Counter({'a': 10, 'c': 8, 'b': 7, 'd': 2, 'e': 1})</p>
<p>now I want element which have frequency more than 2.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you have a Counter dict <code>{'a': 5, 'b': 4, 'c': 4, 'd': 2, 'e': 1}</code> as variable <code>db</code> you can use dict comprehension to generate a dict of items with frequency greater than 2 with:</p>
<pre><code>{k: c for k, c in db.items() if c &gt; 2}
</code></pre>
