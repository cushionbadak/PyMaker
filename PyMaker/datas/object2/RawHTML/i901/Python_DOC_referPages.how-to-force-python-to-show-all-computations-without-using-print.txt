<p>I'm used to using <code>Matlab</code>. Matlab prints all calculi you write in a script unless you finish the command with semicolon.
Is there a way to make Python show all calculi matlab-like?
I'm building a 4D matrix and i want to check my code is not failing. I cant show a 4D matrix so I want to see only some elements.
It's an annoyance to write print(matrix[1,2,1,2]) and others if I want to check a matrix is correctly build.
In matlab i'd write in my following code       </p>
<pre><code>matrix(1,2,1,2)
</code></pre>
<p>and the result would appear in screen.</p>

<p>Consider the debugger <a href="https://birdseye.readthedocs.io/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">birdseye</a> to let you view the values of all expressions in your code as it runs. I'm the author.</p>

<p>A no-dependency solution is to add a utility function like:</p>
<pre><code>def prn(x):
    print(x)
    return x
</code></pre>
<p>Then you can use it like so:</p>
<pre><code>a = 2
b = 3
c = prn(prn(a) * prn(b))
</code></pre>
<p>And the output is:</p>
<pre><code>2
3
6
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">how are you running your script? via command line? or in jupyter?</span>
