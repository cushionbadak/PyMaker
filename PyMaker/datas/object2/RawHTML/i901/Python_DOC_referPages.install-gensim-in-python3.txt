<p>I have two versions of python: python2, python3. </p>
<p>When I install gensim it goes to python2
 I install it with the following comand</p>
<pre><code>sudo pip3 install --upgrade gensim
</code></pre>
<p>how can I install it in python3?
    Thanks</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can install it in python3 with the following command:</p>
<pre><code>sudo python3 -m pip install --upgrade gensim
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I suggest using a <code>virtualenv</code> with only python3 in it. You can create it using </p>
<p><code>virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3 myenv</code></p>
<p>then activate it using <code>source</code> command.</p>
<pre><code>source myenv/bin/activate
</code></pre>
<p>now you can install using <code>pip install gensim</code> that will install it to the python3 specific to that virtual environment.</p>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>pip3 install</code> will install to python3 not python2, unless you configured in the wrong way.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Vineeth. Getting it that wrong would actually be mildly impressive.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">yeah maybe it did install to python3 and op didn't check properly. or Might be running a different python3 interpreter.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What is your OS? What makes you think that <code>sudo pip3 install --upgrade gensim</code> didn't work? (How did you check if <code>gensim</code> was installed under your Python3 environment?) Also, it is generally best practice to use a "Python virtual environment" per project, installing libraries like <code>gensim</code>(and its many dependencies) into those, rather than into your system's Python(s). In that case, you'd create a virtual environment, activate it, install <code>gensim</code> there (without using <code>sudo</code>).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">python3.7: No module named pip</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You should then install <code>pip</code>, this differs per OS. Look here to see how to install it on your OS. <a href="https://www.tecmint.com/install-pip-in-linux/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">tecmint.com/install-pip-in-linux</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">In recent versions of Python 3, you shouldn't need to install <code>pip</code>: it's already there. See &lt;<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html</a>&gt;. (If your Python 3.7 doesn't show pip as installed, something else is very broken in its installation.)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">In recent versions of Python 3, <code>virtualenv</code> isn't necessary (as the <code>venv</code> tool is built in). See &lt;<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html</a>&gt;.</span>
