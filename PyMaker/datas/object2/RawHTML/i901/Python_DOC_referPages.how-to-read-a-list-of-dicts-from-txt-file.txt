<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I'm trying to get from a text file the dictionaries stored in a list</p>
<p>I searched for a <code>json</code> function, which can separate the string and save it in a list (a list of dictionaries), but I do not know if there is something like this.</p>
<p><strong>txt:</strong></p>
<pre><code>[{"Principal": ["Jhon","Anderson","40"]}, {"Secretary": ["Marie","Garcia","29"]},{"Councilor": ["Alan", "Smith","33"]}]
</code></pre>
<p><strong>py code:</strong></p>
<pre><code>stringvar=textfile.read()
</code></pre>
<p>// for or function below</p>
<pre><code>dictionaries=json.loads(textfile.read())
otherlist=dictionaries
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you wish to load the list of dictionaries from a <code>txt</code> file in Python, you can do it using the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html#ast.literal_eval" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>literal_eval</code></a> function from the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>ast</code></a> module, in order to evaluate the expression of the string in the file:</p>
<pre><code>import ast

data = []
with open("data.txt", "r") as inFile:
    data = ast.literal_eval(inFile.read())
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>First of all those kind of files are called json files.</p>
<p>You can open and read them as:</p>
<pre><code>import json
f = open("results/results.json")
data = json.load(f)
</code></pre>
<p>Square brackets in json file defines an array, while curl brackets an object. The former will be converted to a list in python, the latter to dictionary.</p>
<p>So in your case <code>data</code> will be a list of dictionaries.</p>
<p>You can get the values and keys with the methods of the dictionary class <code>keys()</code>, <code>values()</code> or to get both <code>items()</code>.</p>
<p>To be complete a the elements of your json should have the same structure, the fields only should change. For example considering one element:</p>
<pre><code>{"role"    : "Principal",
 "name:    : "Jhon",
 "surname. : "Anderson",
 "age":   40}
</code></pre>
<p>In this way you can iterate more easily through your json</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I think I was specific, the txt file looks just like it in a single line, what I want to achieve is to save it in several dictionaries that I will later put in a list,thanks</span>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>dictionaries=json.loads(textfile.read())</code> already is a list of dictionaries. What do you miss?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What's wrong with <code>json.loads</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@mkiever <code>json.loads</code> should be the way of loading a dict from a file, as presented by Francesco Boi in the answer below. I just presented an alternative, thinking that the OP could not achieve the desired result using <code>json.load</code> as mentioned in the question.</span>
