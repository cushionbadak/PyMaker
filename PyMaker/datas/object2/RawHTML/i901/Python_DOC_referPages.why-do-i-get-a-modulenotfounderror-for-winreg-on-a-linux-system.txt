<span class="comment-copy">Are you on windows? Are you sure you're using Python 3? It's named <code>_winreg</code> in Python 2. Can you give a full account of how you are calling it?

<span class="comment-copy">If you're on Linux, there is no Windows registry. So there is no <code>winreg</code> module because it couldn't do anything even if it were there. If the <code>winreg</code> import is coming from a third-party package, it probably should have an alternate mechanism for configuration on non-Windows systems. If it's your own code, you will just need to use a different configuration mechanism rather than <code>winreg</code> when on a non-Windows system.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Jaki: When you say "I am not facing this problem in Python 3.4": is the Python 3.4 distribution in question also installed on a Linux system, or is that a Windows system by any chance?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why are you trying to import <code>winreg</code> on Linux?</span>
