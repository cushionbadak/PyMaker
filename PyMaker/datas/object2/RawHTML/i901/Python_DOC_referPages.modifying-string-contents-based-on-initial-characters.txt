<p>I am trying to write a Python script that identifies the first two characters in a string and based on them makes specific changes to each string. </p>
<p>At work we have accounts on different systems. The account numbers change depending on which system you lookup the account. 
For example:
System 1 account number would be 23456
The same account in System 2 would be 24456</p>
<p>The initial 23 changes to 24 and the remainder stays the same. We have three different ways in which the first two characters can change. </p>
<p>I took a stab at writing a Python script that would identify the first two characters in each string and based on them make the appropriate change. </p>
<p>This is what I have so far:</p>
<pre><code>import csv
inputfile = csv.reader(open('/users/user/accounts.csv', 'r'))
outputfile = open('/users/user/converted_accounts.txt', 'w')

for row in inputfile:
    if row.startswith('23')
       row.replace('23', '24', 1)
       print row
       outputfile.write(row)
    elif row.startswith('26')
         row.replace('26', '27', 1)
         print row
         outputfile.write(row)
    elif row.startswith('3')
         row.replace('3', '0', 1)
         print row
         outputfile.write(row)
    else:
         print(row)
         outputfile.write(row)
</code></pre>
<p>I am getting a syntax error beginning with my first if statement. I don't have any experience with Python and have been researching on my own the past few days trying to make it work. </p>
<p>Thank you in advance!</p>

<p>You're missing a <code>:</code> at the end of the <code>if</code> and <code>elif</code> statements.
You'll also have issues w/ your <code>print</code> statements depending on whether you're using Python 2 or Python 3.</p>
<p>In Python 3 (since you're new to Python), your code should look like this:</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>import csv
inputfile = csv.reader(open('/users/user/accounts.csv', 'r'))
outputfile = open('/users/user/converted_accounts.txt', 'w')

for row in inputfile:
    if row.startswith('23'):
       row.replace('23', '24', 1)
       print(row)
       outputfile.write(row)
    elif row.startswith('26'):
         row.replace('26', '27', 1)
         print(row)
         outputfile.write(row)
    elif row.startswith('3'):
         row.replace('3', '0', 1)
         print(row)
         outputfile.write(row)
    else:
         print(row)
         outputfile.write(row)

</code></pre>
<p>Also, look into using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#with" rel="nofollow noreferrer">context managers</a> when opening files</p>

<p>Further to dhui's reply with the idea to make your code work, below are some suggestions on cleaner ways to open/close your files for reading and writing (in a single statement), and simpler ways to make the string replacement.  Hope it helps.</p>
<pre><code>inputfile = '/users/user/accounts.csv'
outputfile = '/users/user/converted_accounts.txt'

with open(inputfile, 'r') as ifile, \
     open(outputfile, 'w') as ofile:

    # create a loop to read the lines
    while True:
        line = ifile.readline()

        #exit the loop if there are no more lines
        if not line:
            break

        if line[0:2] == '23':
            line = '24' + line[2:]

        #elif... (write other conditions here)

        print(line)
        ofile.write(line)

print('finished!')
