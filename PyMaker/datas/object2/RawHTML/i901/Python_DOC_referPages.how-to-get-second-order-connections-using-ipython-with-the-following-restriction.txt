<p>I have a connection from region1 to region6 (1-&gt;6)
But I want to get second order connections.  In other words: connections from region1 to region2 then region2 to region6. (i.e. 1-&gt;2, 2-&gt;6)</p>
<p>I want to apply the following restriction: I don't want connections of the same region, such as region1 to region1  (i.e. <strong>1-&gt;1</strong>, 1-&gt;6) to be listed as a second-order connection. </p>
<p>Note: Region1 to region6 is the same as region6 to region1. In addition I want connections to be listed in descending order. Therefore, if there is a second order connection that goes from region1 to region0 and then from region0 to region6 (1-&gt;0, 0-&gt;6). I want it to instead be <strong>corrected</strong> to become region0 to region1 and then region0 to region6 (0-&gt;1, 0-&gt;6). </p>
<p>Also, once all second order connections are performed I want it to be multiplied to get connection of region0 to region1 and then region0 to region6 (ie. 0-&gt;1, 0-&gt;6). </p>
<p>Once that's done, I want to compare it to the first order connection at the beginning of this question (1-&gt;6).  And then I want the program to take the higher value.  and save it. </p>
<p>This is what I have so far: </p>
<pre><code>from itertools import combinations

a=print(list(combinations(range(7),2)))

print(list(product(a, repeat=2))
</code></pre>
<p>Output I get: [(0,1), (0,1)], [(0,1), (0,2)], [(0,1), (0,3)], etc. </p>
<p>This is not what I want</p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>

<p>You can start with itertools. The combinations module appears to be in sorted order, no repeated elements.</p>
<pre><code>from itertools import combinations

print(list(combinations(range(7),2)))
</code></pre>
<p>Itertools are part of included packages in Python, and are excellent in iteratable areas. Read <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html</a></p>
<p>Beyond combinations is product, which is cartesian product, and permutations,that gives all possible orderings, no repeated elements.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Thank you for the help. But I don't want to multiply all combinations.  I want to multiply all second order connections.  Meaning if I'm looking at region connecting region2 to region4 (a third region in between)... So, for example, the second order connection I want for (region2-&gt;4) is: (2-&gt;3,3-&gt;4) or (2-&gt;1, 1-&gt;4).  I hope that makes sense @Prayson W. Daniel</span>
