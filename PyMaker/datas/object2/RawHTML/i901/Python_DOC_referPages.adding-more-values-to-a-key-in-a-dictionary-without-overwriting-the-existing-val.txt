<p>I am creating a bingo game where the user is guessing on five numbers and the computer takes out ten random numbers between 1-26.</p>
<p>The part I am having trouble with is that when the user have guessed, the numbers have been compared and added to the dictionary. If I then play the "game" once more it overwrites the last rounds points (which I want to keep). </p>
<pre><code>def user_vs_cpu(cpu_random):

    global players
    for player in players:
        correct_guess = 0
        for guess in player["guess"]:
            for bingo_number in cpu_random:
                if guess == bingo_number:
                    correct_guess += 1
        player["points"] = {correct_guess}
    print(players)
</code></pre>
<p><code>players</code> is a list that contains the dictionaries.</p>
<p>cpu_random is the computer's randomly generated numbers.</p>
<p><code>player["points"]</code> is where the compared points is stored.</p>
<p>-edit-
I forgot to mention is that there is more dicts in the list players so that i can add more players to the game.</p>

<p>With <code>player["points"] = {correct_guess}</code> you're <strong>correct_guess</strong> variable turns into a <strong>set</strong> object due to the curly braces. You could then operate with this object according to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/stdtypes.html#set-types-set-frozenset" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PythonDocs Set Types</a>. That's not what you want. Like suggested try to work with a list with <strong>append</strong> or use an integer if only the current points are important, this would be for example:<br/>
<code>player["points"] += 1</code><br/></p>

<p>Suggestion: Try to get familiar with a good IDE like PyCharm, set a BreakPoint to <code>player["points"] = {correct_guess}</code> and see where you going wrong (you will be able to see the state of all variables/objects simultaneously.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">this is a program-logic problem - copy the total amount of points of player somewherre to keep it -f.e. <code>player_rounds["round1"] = player["points"]</code> ...your code is not a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve">Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example</a> so it is hard to advice.#</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Alternatviely, make <code>player["points"]</code> a <code>list</code> of values instead a single value, then, after each round, <i>append</i> another value to it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I do see what you are saying, I do have a hard time to create this into a smaller code due to my inexperience. My problem still remains, the add function that i use for other keys in the dictionary looks the same as player["points"] = {correct_guess}if that helps?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I have a hard time understanding how to make player["points"] into a list?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Initialize it to <code>[]</code> or <code>list()</code>. If you include more code in your question, I could be more specific...</span>
