<p>I often do this in python exception:</p>
<pre><code>try:
    &lt;some process&gt;
except Exception as e:
    print(e)
</code></pre>
<p>This is helping me when I want the script to keep going but still tell me that there is error. But, <code>print(e)</code> isn't as detail as if I let the exception raised. Is there any way to show the error more detail without raising the exception?</p>

<p>There are a number of ways to print traceback information.</p>
<p>As mentioned in the comments, you can use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/traceback.html#module-traceback" rel="nofollow noreferrer">traceback</a> module's <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/traceback.html#traceback.print_exc" rel="nofollow noreferrer">print_exc</a> function</p>
<pre><code>try:
    1 / 0
except Exception:
    traceback.print_exc()

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "exes.py", line 10, in &lt;module&gt;
    1 / 0
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
</code></pre>
<p>If you are using the logging module, the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/logging.html#logging.Logger.exception" rel="nofollow noreferrer">logging.exception</a> function will automatically log the traceback as part of an ERROR level log message. </p>
<pre><code>try:
    2 / 0 
except Exception:
    logging.exception('Something went wrong')

ERROR:root:Something went wrong
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "exes.py", line 15, in &lt;module&gt;
    2 / 0
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
</code></pre>
<p>If you prefer to log the traceback at a different log level, you can pass <code>exc_info=True</code> to the log function to have the traceback logged.</p>
<pre><code>try:
    3 / 0 
except Exception:
    logging.warning('Something went wrong.', exc_info=True)

WARNING:root:Something went wrong.
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "exes.py", line 20, in &lt;module&gt;
    3 / 0
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
</code></pre>
