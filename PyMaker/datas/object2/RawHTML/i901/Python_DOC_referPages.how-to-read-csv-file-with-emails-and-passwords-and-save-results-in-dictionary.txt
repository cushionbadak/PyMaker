<p>Maybe a simple one, but I cant get it to work by googling.
I have a csv file with Emails in Column A and Passwords in column b.
I want to save those in a dict {Email:Password}.</p>
<p>The code I have so far:</p>
<pre><code>f = open('email_list_test.csv', 'r')

with f:

    reader = csv.DictReader(f)

    for row in reader:
        print(row['Email'], row['Password'])
</code></pre>
<p>But it is not doing anything. Ideally I would just have a dict, that I can then iterate through later, as I want to pass those email password combinations on to a function.</p>
<p>My code now: </p>
<pre><code>dict = {}

f = open('email_list_test.csv', 'r')

with f:
    reader = csv.DictReader(f)
    for row in reader:
        dict[row['Email']] = row['Password']
print(dict)
</code></pre>
<p>Sadly the dict is empty, even though I have a few test records in my csv.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Try this:</p>
<pre><code>credentials = {}

with open('email_list_test.csv', 'r') as f:

    reader = csv.DictReader(f, delimiter=';') # replace the delimiter character with the one you're using.

    for row in reader:
        credentials.update(row)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Easy try this:</p>
<pre><code>my_dict = {}

with open('email_list_test.csv', 'r') as f:
    reader = csv.DictReader(f)
    for row in reader:
        my_dict[row['Email']] = row['Password']
print(my_dict )
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Please be more specific. What do you mean by "not doing anything"? What specifically happens when you run it?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The purpose of <code>with</code> is to <i>contain</i> the <code>open()</code> call. Don't call your variable <code>dict</code> or you will shadow the built-in type.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@tripleee My csv has the first row Email, Password and afterwards a few emails and passwords. When I run it the print returns {}, so an empty dict.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">please share a sample of your input file</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It might help to open the input file like this <code>open('email_list_test.csv', 'r', newline='')</code> as a footnote in the <code>csv</code> module's <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#id3" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation</a> suggests.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is kind of working, athough I am somehow getting my headers as the key for the dictionary.  {'Email;Password': 'meyer.tim1993@gmail.com;Mybuyin2018!'}</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I think my issue somehow comes from the csv file. That its not detecting the headers correctly</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What are you using as separator in your CSV?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This csv is created on a german pc, which uses ; not , I think. Could this be the issue?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, I've updated my answer according.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">of course if a email is in your csv twice with two different passwords only the last password will be saved.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for the quick reply I was hoping it would be this easy. I tried implementing, but my dict stays empty if I do the code as shown above</span>
<span class="comment-copy">ok can you post your current version so we can take a look</span>
<span class="comment-copy">not shure I just tested it and its working for me sorry.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I think the issue might be with the csv file that it is not detecting the headers properly. I dont know why though as they show up properly in the first row when opening the csv in excel</span>
