<p>I found the keyword <code>async</code> in some Python programs. It was being used just before <code>def</code> while defining a function . </p>
<p>I needed to know the grammatical term for <code>async</code> (and for <code>await</code> too) and other such keywords in its leagues. It seems like some "modifier" like <code>inline</code> in C++. So what is the pythonic term for that?</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0492/#why-async-def-and-not-def-async" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PEP</a> calls <code>async</code> a <em>"statement qualifier"</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>async</code> keyword is a <em>statement qualifier</em>. A good analogy to it are "static",
  "public", "unsafe" keywords from other languages.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">So the general  grammatical form for function definition in python is something like  : "qualifier" def "function name" ( argument list ) :</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@itpdusra as that's the only qualifier, they just break it out separately: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#coroutines" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#coroutines</a>. In the full grammar it's just <code>async_funcdef: 'async' funcdef</code>.</span>
