<p>I'm unable to determine an easy way to have a list with values assigned to each item in the list, where when an item is called the value will be printed.</p>
<p>I've tried to use tuples in a list, such as <code>foo = [('bar', 1), ('baz', 2)]</code>, and then calling <code>foo[1]</code>, but instead of doing <code>2</code>, it goes <code>('baz', 2)</code>.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; foo = [('bar', 1), ('baz', 2)]`
&gt;&gt;&gt; foo[1]
or
&gt;&gt;&gt; foo[1[1]]
</code></pre>
<p>Neither seems to work.  The former calling method emits <code>(baz, 2)</code> and the latter produces an error.</p>
<p>Is there a different way to do this?  Or is this correct, but I'm doing something wrong?</p>
</div>

<p>I think you're looking for this:</p>
<pre><code>foo[1][1]
</code></pre>
<p>This will give you second element of the list, and second element of your tuple.
Hope this helps!</p>

<span class="comment-copy">are you looking for a dictionary?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@aws_apprentice, I do not understand.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">it sounds like you need to use a dictionary instead of a list</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Dictionaries</a> are designed to associate keys to values, whereas lists simply store data in order.</span>
