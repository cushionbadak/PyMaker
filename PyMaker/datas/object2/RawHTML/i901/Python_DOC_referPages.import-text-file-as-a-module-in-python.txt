<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I want to import a plain text file, no matter the extension cause I want to use my own, as a module in python.</p>
<p>For example. I have the strings for my program in separated .py files, and, depending on what language is selected, I import one file or the other.</p>
<p>Everything works well with this, but, I want to make this file, apparently not readable for a common user, so, I want to give them a custom extension that any of the programs installed can't read.
But, due that <code>import</code> only work with .py files, I want to know if there is a way to do this with other file types.
Or if is it another way to do something like this.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>maybe read file sources and use eval method?</p>
<p>You may use it as</p>
<pre><code>def import_module(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        file_contents = file.read()
    module_object =  exec(file_contents)
    return module_object
</code></pre>
<p>But that variant are not secure!</p>
<p>And such question was in stackoverflow <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2601047/import-a-python-module-without-the-py-extension">read it</a></p>

<span class="comment-copy">Ok, this works as expected, but, why this isn't secure?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Because, maybe that file will be replaced with file with some code for getting remote access to computer wich execute your program</span>
<span class="comment-copy">And it's not a better way to use your code</span>
<span class="comment-copy">as another variant (such insecure), you may compile your code into some variable in code, and write it as pickled file in working directory</span>
