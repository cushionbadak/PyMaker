<p>I need to mensure time of code part. I'm using time.time() before and after specific code part. </p>
<pre><code>startBayes = time.time()

function()

endBayes = time.time()
timeBayes = endBayes-startBayes
</code></pre>
<p>But, I checked and sometimes that number is in seconds and other times in minutes. How can I define it?</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.time" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>time.time()</code></a> always returns seconds:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Return the time in seconds since the epoch as a floating point number.</p>

<p>Therefore, your time difference will always be in seconds as well.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">It's always in seconds, at least in Python 3. What behavior are you getting that suggests otherwise?</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>time.time()</code> is always a floating point number representing seconds since the UNIX epoch. It is never minutes. Or are you talking about the amount of time that has passed, so <code>timeBayes</code> is greater than 60? Either way, it isn't really clear what you are talking about here.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MartijnPieters you are correct! I mistaken with another results in other language ... sorry! In R, output can be with different scales ..</span>
