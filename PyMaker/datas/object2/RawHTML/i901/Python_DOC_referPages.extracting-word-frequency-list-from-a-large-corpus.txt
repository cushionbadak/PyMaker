<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have a large English corpus named <a href="http://ghpaetzold.github.io/subimdb/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">SubIMDB</a> and I want to make a list of all the words with their frequency. Meaning that how much they have appeared in the whole corpus. This frequency list should have some characteristics:</p>
<ol>
<li>The words like boy and boys or other grammatical features such as get and getting, the same word or lemma and if there are 3 boy and 2 boys it should list them as Boy 5. However, not for the cases like Go and Went which have irregular forms(or foot and feet)</li>
<li>I want to use this frequency list as a kind of dictionary so whenever I see a word in another part of the program I want to check its frequency in this list. So, better if it is searchable without looking up all the of it.</li>
</ol>
<p>My questions are:</p>
<ol>
<li>For the first problem, what should I do? Lemmatize? or Stemming? or how can I get that?</li>
<li>For second, what kind of variable type I should set it to? like dictionary or lists or what?</li>
<li>Is is the best to save it in csv?</li>
<li>Is there any prepared toolkit for python doing this all?</li>
</ol>
<p>Thank you so much.</p>

<p>As pointed above, question(s) is a opinion based and vague, but here's some directions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Both will work for your case. Stemming usually is simpler and faster. I suggest starting with <a href="http://www.nltk.org/howto/stem.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">nltk's <code>PorterStemmer</code></a>. If you need sophisticated lemmatization, take a look at <a href="https://spacy.io/api/lemmatizer" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>spaCy</code></a>, IMO that's industry standard.</li>
<li>You need dictionary, which gives you amortized O(1) lookup once you have your stem/lemma. Also <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.Counter" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>counter</code></a> may become useful.</li>
<li>Depends on your usecase. CSV is more "portable", <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>pickle</code></a> may be easier to use.</li>
<li>There's a lot of "building blocks" in nltk and spaCy, building your pipeline/models is up to you</li>
</ol>

<span class="comment-copy">Questions that ask "where do I start?" are typically too broad and are not a good fit for this site. People have their own method for approaching the problem and because of this there cannot be a <i>correct</i> answer. Give a good read over <a href="https://softwareengineering.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/6366/where-to-start/6367#6367">Where to Start</a> and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/posts/54171178/edit">edit</a> your post.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">asking for library recommendations is offtopic and asking multiple and/or unspecific questions in one question is also discoraged. What did you try, where did you research and what is your problem with the code you used to solve this? Googeling <code>python lemma stemmer</code> naturally leads to NLTK and to duplicates on this very site ... f.e. this one <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/771918/how-do-i-do-word-stemming-or-lemmatization">how-do-i-do-word-stemming-or-lemmatization</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@PatrickArtner well, I know where to start, I just have those questions and I want to know the opinion of others about it. I am a little confused about lemmetizing or stemming them. And also what is the best way to make that frequency list in their opinion. Where do you think I should ask this? the linguistics in stackexchange?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@PatrickArtner I know NLTK lemma and stemmer and I am able to work with them. I ask which one is better here considering that I just need to get rid of grammatical part. And also I searched well Github and the whole web but could not find a good python toolkit making frequency lists automatically of a .txt file. I wanted to ask people here if they know any.</span>
