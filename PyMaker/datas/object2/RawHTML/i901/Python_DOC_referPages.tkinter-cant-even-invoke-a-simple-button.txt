<p>Started with simple Tkinter lessons, I'm stuck in the case even that simple code doesn't work:</p>
<pre><code>import tkinter as tk
root = tk.Tk()
b = tk.Button(root, text='button'); b.pack()
</code></pre>
<p>...</p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):

<p>And can't find the reason why, considering that this code is from <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/idle.html?highlight=button#developing-tkinter-applications" rel="nofollow noreferrer">official documentation.</a></p>
<p>On the other hand, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html#a-simple-hello-world-program" rel="nofollow noreferrer">another code</a> works:</p>
<pre><code>import tkinter as tk

        super().__init__(master)
        self.master = master

    def create_widgets(self):

        self.hi_there["command"] = self.say_hi
        self.hi_there.pack(side="top")

        self.quit = tk.Button(self, text="QUIT", fg="red",
                              command=self.master.destroy)

app = Application(master=root)
app.mainloop()

<p>I have tried to update <code>tk</code> from conda: <code>conda install -c anaconda tk</code>, but nothing change. Can't figure out why.</p>

<p>The only way I was able to reproduce your error is by building the code directly in the IDLE Shell and closing the root window that pops up before creating the button.</p>

<p>That said it is very odd to write a GUI in the Shell like this. If you do not close the tkinter window the code works fine. However GUI development should be done in the editor in a <code>.py</code> file and ran all at once. Simple fix is to not close the root window before everything else in the GUI has been added.</p>
<p>Proper fix is to build you GUI in a <code>.py</code> file and then run it.</p>
<p>I am not sure why you are saying that the editor is not working for you. When I copy your exact code it works fine on my end:</p>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/r4D8o.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img alt="enter image description here" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/r4D8o.png"/></a></p>
<p>All that said you really do not need to build your code in the Python IDLE. It would be much better to use something like PyCharm or Eclipse/PyDev. Those are my Go to IDE tools.</p>
<p>One thing to note about Python's IDLE is it will not run code from the editor until you have saved the <code>.py</code> file.</p>
<p>Though not 100% required in the Python IDLE the <code>mainloop()</code> is a requirement for tkinter to work properly. Outside of Python's IDLE most other IDE environments requite the <code>mainloop()</code> so it is good practice to always include it.</p>
<pre><code>import tkinter as tk

root = tk.Tk()
b = tk.Button(root, text='button')
b.pack()
root.mainloop()
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I think you forgot to add <code>root.mainloop()</code> at the end.</p>
<pre><code>import tkinter as tk

root = tk.Tk()

b = tk.Button(root, text='button'); b.pack()

root.mainloop()
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Do not close the window before adding the button.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you are using Python's default IDLE then mainloop is not required to run tkinter application however it is good to explicitly define the mainloop as anywhere outside of the IDLE it wont work without it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I noticed you are using <code>anaconda</code>. There is a very good chance your problem is due to this fact. Anaconda is known to have issues with tkinter due to their custom libraries that fail from time to time.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Searge No, the issue can be replicated with any python interpreter and the exception would be raised anyway before the call to <code>mainloop</code> So neither anaconda nor <code>mainloop</code> are related to this.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Goyo I am not sure what you mean by closing the window before the button is added. That should not be possible with the presented code. All the code is ran at init so how can one close the window before the button is added? Even writing this code directly in the interpreter (something most would not do) it still works fine on my end.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thnx. If you please, also add, that <code>.mainloop()</code> is required after calling <code>.pack()</code> function. On this I stumbled when have replicate <a href="https://jasonrbriggs.com/python-for-kids/chapter12/clickable_button1.py.txt" rel="nofollow noreferrer">example</a> from book on editor.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Searge <code>mainloop()</code> is not requited in Python IDLE. The Python IDLE assumes the mainloop for you. This is not the case in most other IDE's though.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">yes. I mean I started to replicate <a href="https://jasonrbriggs.com/python-for-kids/chapter12/clickable_button1.py.txt" rel="nofollow noreferrer">that file</a> on IDE. And it doesn't work (because mainloop), so I go to the documentation and replicate it on python console, where close that empty window ツ</span>
<span class="comment-copy">no, that error apears before <code>mainloop()</code>.  <a href="https://imgur.com/i76ExgH" rel="nofollow noreferrer">imgur.com/i76ExgH</a>  Also, in examples from the book "Python for kids" (where I've start that lessons), there is no <code>.mainloop()</code> at all, only <code>.pack()</code> <a href="https://jasonrbriggs.com/python-for-kids/chapter12/clickable_button1.py.txt" rel="nofollow noreferrer">jasonrbriggs.com/python-for-kids/chapter12/…</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">yes, it works as script, but I can't even define a variable in IDLE, also, none of examples from Jason Briggs works.</span>
