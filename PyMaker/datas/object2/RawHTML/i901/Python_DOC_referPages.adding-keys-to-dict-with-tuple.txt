<p>I have a tuple as follows:</p>
<pre><code>tuple
{('A', 'B'), ('A', 'C'), ('B', 'C')}
</code></pre>
<p>I would like to create a dict and want to set its keys as the above tuple.
Dictionary should look like following:</p>
<pre><code>dict
{('A', 'B'): None,
 ('A', 'C'): None,
 ('B', 'C'): None}
</code></pre>
<p>How would I do it as easy as possible?</p>
<p>I tried this but does not work:</p>
<pre><code>dict = {(set(tuple(sorted(x)): None for x in lines_tuple)}
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>dict</code> has a <code>fromkeys</code> <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=fromkeys#dict.fromkeys" rel="nofollow noreferrer">method</a>, which defaults the values to <code>None</code> if you don't pass any in:</p>
<pre><code>original = {('A', 'B'), ('A', 'C'), ('B', 'C')}
new = dict.fromkeys(original)
</code></pre>
<p><code>new</code> should now look like <code>{('A', 'B'): None, ('B', 'C'): None, ('A', 'C'): None}</code></p>
