<p>I have two files: 'my_main.py' and 'my_functions.py'. I wrote two functions in 'my_functions.py', 'first_function' and 'second_function' and imported this module into 'my_main.py'. However, I then added a third function into 'my_functions.py' called 'third_function':</p>
<pre><code>def first_function():
    print("hello1")

def second_function():
    print("hello2")

def third_function():
    print("hello3")
</code></pre>
<p>I found that I could not import 'third_function' into 'my_main.py', getting an error - AttributeError: module 'my_functions' has no attribute 'third_function'. </p>
<p>To understand this, in 'my_main.py' I then ran:</p>
<pre><code>import my_functions
help(my_functions)
</code></pre>
<p>and had as my output:</p>
<pre><code>Help on module my_functions:

NAME
my_functions

FUNCTIONS
first_function()

second_function()
</code></pre>
<p>For some reason 'my_functions.py' would not recognise any more functions after the initial two, meaning I couldn't then import 'third_function' into 'my_main.py'. How can I fix this?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Make sure you have saved your file my_functions.py before running my_main.py. Unless the file is saved, the update (addition of third_function) won't be recognized. Have been doing this for years, and still make this mistake constantly. Editing not enough. Need to edit and save. </p>

<p>You need to explicitly reload the module if you've made changes since the last import. There is a built-in function for <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.reload" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this</a></p>
<p>You can reload your module as follows:</p>
<pre><code>import importlib
importlib.reload(my_functions)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Does your file with your functions actually look like that? Python requires you to indent. If it looks like that i'm surprised it runs at all.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Not sure if this is a similar case, but at least in Jupyter Notebook, updates to a module are not loaded unless I kill the kernel and start over (probably a cache issue)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I've just restarted the kernel and re-run the program and it seems to have fixed it. Thanks, thought it was a more complex issue than that!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Which ide you use btw ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, I've made sure to save both files.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@JordanBartlam use pycharm , u don't need to save file manually , it will handle this thing by yourself</span>
