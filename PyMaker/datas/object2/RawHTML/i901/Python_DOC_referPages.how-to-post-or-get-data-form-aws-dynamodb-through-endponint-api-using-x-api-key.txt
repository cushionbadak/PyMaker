<p>I'm new to using API endpoints in python. How can I access dynamodb table in aws using self created API endpoint (url)?</p>
<p>I have access key and security key of aws, and the x-api-key of the endpoint url.</p>
<p>I'm able to post the details to dynamodb with postman tool using above given details, but I want to run this in a Python script. Please answer with a sample example, if possible. Thank you.</p>

<p>If you want to access dynamodb VIA the rest endpoints you'll need to sign your requests with your credentials. </p>
<p>You're in luck because they have examples how to sign your requests with python</p>

<span class="comment-copy">If you're using python, my advice is to boto3 the AWS SDK, if for some reason you cannot or are a masochist reference the python urllib (<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.html</a>) and the AWS Dynamo REST API docs (<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Programming.LowLevelAPI.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/â€¦</a>)</span>
