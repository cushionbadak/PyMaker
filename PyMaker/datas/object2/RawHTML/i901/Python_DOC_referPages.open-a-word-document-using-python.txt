<p>I am trying to automatically open a Word Document in Python. I am very new to programming and I heard this site helped people who had trouble with it.</p>
<p>I have looked at various questions and have found this:</p>
<pre><code>DummyFile = path_to_docx
with open(DummyFile) as f:
    source_stream = io(f.read())
document = doc(source_stream)
source_stream.close()
</code></pre>
<p>But when I run it, I get:</p>
<pre><code> UnicodeDecodeError: 'charmap' codec can't decode byte 0x90 in position 74: character maps to &lt;undefined&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>It seems that this code is not what I want. I believe it is trying to read my document and put it into a variable. Not what I want. I want the command, that when executed, will open the word document <strong>in Microsoft Word</strong></p>
<p>Expected Result:</p>
<p>Word Document opens in Microsoft Word, as can be seen here:</p>

<p>The code you have posted in your question is reading the Word file into your Python code as an object you can work with rather than launching the Word application.</p>
<p>What you need to do is abuse the Windows' OS start command, this will launch a given file in whichever application the Windows shell has that extension registered too, for example...</p>
<pre><code>os.system('start mywordfile.docx')
</code></pre>
<p>I don't have Word installed but I tried it like this with a PNG image file...</p>
<pre><code>os.system('start mydiagram.png')
</code></pre>
<p>and it opened in the Photos app on Windows 10 just fine.</p>

<p>On Windows, you can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.startfile" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>os.startfile</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>import os
os.startfile('C:\\Path\\To\\file.docx')
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">This is a nice beginner question. You've clearly read the instructions on how to ask and done a pretty good job of carrying them out. It's surprisingly rare to see that. Welcome to SO!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You may want to take into account that OP has the file name in a variable. If it has spaces, it'll need quotes.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If the parameter comes from user input, this has a risk of shell command injection. (Attacker can execute arbitrary commands).</span>
