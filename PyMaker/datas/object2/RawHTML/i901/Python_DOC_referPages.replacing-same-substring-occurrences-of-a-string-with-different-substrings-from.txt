<p>I am new to python and I want to replace same substring occurrences of a particular string with different substrings by using python. I already tried the .replace() function of python, but it replaces all the occurrences with the new substring. Example for the question is below.</p>
<hr/>
<p>string = "I am a student <strong>as</strong> well <strong>as</strong> a teacher"
Here I want to replace the substring "<strong>as</strong>" with "<strong>xas</strong>" and "<strong>yas</strong>" by adding extra character to the substring. The final result should be "I am a student <strong>xas</strong> well <strong>yas</strong> a teacher"</p>
<hr/>
<p>Code that I have tried:</p>
<pre><code>string = "I am a student as well as a teacher"
 occurrences = re.findall("as", string)
 substr = ["xas","yas"]
 i = 0
 for occur in occurrences:
     string = string.replace(occur, substr[i])
     i = i + 1`
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can inform replace how many times it should replace following way</p>
<pre><code>s = "I am a student as well as a teacher"
s = s.replace("as","xxx",1)
print(s) #I am a student xxx well as a teacher
s = s.replace("as","yyy",1)
print(s) #I am a student xxx well yyy a teacher
</code></pre>
<p>EDIT: Replacing first <code>as</code> with <code>xas</code> and second <code>as</code> with <code>yas</code> requires different approach</p>
<pre><code>s = "I am a student as well as a teacher"
repl = ["xas","yas"]
s = s.split("as")
for i in repl:
    s = [i.join(s[:2])]+s[2:]
s = s[0]
print(s) #I am a student xas well yas a teacher
</code></pre>
<p>Note that this solution assumes number of elements of <code>repl</code> is exatcly equal to number of <code>as</code> in <code>s</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use regex as well:</p>
<pre><code>substr = ["xxx","yyy"]

def replace_with(_):
    """Returns first value of substr and removes it."""
    return substr.pop(0)

import re

string = "I am a student as well as a teacher"

print(re.sub("as",replace_with,string)) 
</code></pre>
<p>Output: </p>
<pre><code>I am a student xxx well yyy a teacher
</code></pre>
<p>But the solution using str.replace() with a limit of 1 <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/54275582/7505395">by Daweo</a> is more elegant.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">now you use regex to find something and string.replace to replace it ... you would need re.sub() to replace with regex - don't mix them.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@PatrickArtner I have edited the question. Sorry for the previous misleading one.</span>
