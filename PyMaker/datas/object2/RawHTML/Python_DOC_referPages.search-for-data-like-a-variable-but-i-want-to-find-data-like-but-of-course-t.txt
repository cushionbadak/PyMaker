<p>Im trying to search for data LIKE a variable but i want to find data like %?% but of course this doesn't work i can use LIKE ? but i need to also find all values with e.g D and comes up with Dog</p>
<pre><code>       search=self.text
    with sqlite3.connect('Data.db') as db:
        user_find = db.cursor()
        user_find.execute(
            'select * from "Animal Data" where Animal_ID LIKE ? or Animal_Name LIKE ? or Animal_Type LIKE ? or Animal_Gender LIKE ? or Animal_breed LIKE ? or Animal_breed LIKE ? or Animal_breed LIKE? or Animal_colour LIKE ? or Address LIKE ?'
            ,(search,search,search,search,search,search,search,search,search,))
        data = user_find.fetchall()
        print(data)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You should be binding to the <code>?</code> placeholder the entire expression you want to appear in the <code>LIKE</code> statement.  That is, if you wanted to search for any field having the letter <code>D</code>, you would bind the string <code>%D%</code> to your statement.</p>
<pre><code>search = '%' + search + '%'
user_find = db.cursor()
user_find.execute(
    'select * from "Animal Data" where Animal_ID LIKE ? or Animal_Name LIKE ? or Animal_Type LIKE ? or Animal_Gender LIKE ? or Animal_breed LIKE ? or Animal_breed LIKE ? or Animal_breed LIKE? or Animal_colour LIKE ? or Address LIKE ?',
    (search,search,search,search,search,search,search,search,search,)
)
data = user_find.fetchall()
print(data)
</code></pre>
