for file_name in list_of_files:
    FI = open(file_name, 'r', encoding="utf-8")

<p>And I have read that I should open this as a binary file. But I'm not sure how to do this. Here is my function:</p>
<pre><code>def readingAndAddToList():
    list_of_files = glob.glob('./*.txt') # create the list of files
    for file_name in list_of_files:
        FI = open(file_name, 'r', encoding="utf-8")
        stext = textProcessing(FI.read())# split returns a list of words delimited by sequences of whitespace (including tabs, newlines, etc, like re's \s)
        secondaryWord_list = stext.split()
        word_list.extend(secondaryWord_list) # Add words to main list
        print("Lungimea fisierului ",FI.name," este de", len(secondaryWord_list), "caractere")
        sortingAndNumberOfApparitions(secondaryWord_list)
        FI.close()
</code></pre>
<p>Just the beggining of my functions matter because I get the error at the reading part</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you are on windows,open the file in NotePad and save as desired encoding .
In Linux , DO the same in text editor. 
hope your program runs. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">Can you try with <code>open(file_name, 'r', errors = 'ignore')</code>? Does it give you required output?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Can you share problematic file? Or identify yourself problematic symbol(s) that causes exception?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Hello.World it worked in this way. Because those characters where something like " ' " which I don't need at all</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Adrian Yes I did think that was the issue. I didn't have sample for your file so told you to try! Anyways happy to help! :)</span>
