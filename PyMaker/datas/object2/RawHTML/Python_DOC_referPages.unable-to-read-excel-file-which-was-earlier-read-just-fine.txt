<p>I have been using python 3.7+ and pandas' read_excel() function to read different excel files into Spyder IDE. All was working fine for months. However, all of sudden and out of nowhere, I started getting file not found error messages. Codes that were previously working fine, have also started producing same error, even though the files are there. To debug, I created a simple test excel file with name temp.xlsx and tried reading it using following command, </p>
<pre><code>In: pd.read_excel('temp.xlsx')
</code></pre>
<p>However, I am getting this error even though file is there, </p>
