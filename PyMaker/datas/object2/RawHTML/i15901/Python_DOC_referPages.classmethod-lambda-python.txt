<p>I'm having a hard time understanding this piece of code.
I understand that we are using some mock instead of the API endpoint to save time on the tests.</p>
<p>What I don't understand is the classmethod(lambda cls: self.preapproval) structure.
What is the point of using a lambda cls if inside the code I don't use at all the cls.</p>
<p>I hope I'm clear enough, I'd be very happy if someone could shed some light on this one..</p>
<p>Thanks a lot.</p>
<pre><code>@patch("paypaladaptive.api.endpoints.UrlRequest",
       MockUrlRequestPreapproval)
def test_preapproval(self):
    # I don't understand this code, it is very confusing. Why do I need to use a lambda structure if in the code itself I don't use cls (self.preapproval)
    MockUrlRequestPreapproval.preapproval = (
        classmethod(lambda cls: self.preapproval))
    self.assertTrue(self.preapproval.process())
    self.preapproval = Preapproval.objects.get(pk=self.preapproval.pk)
    self.assertNotEqual(self.preapproval.preapproval_key, "")
    self.assertEqual(self.preapproval.status, "created")

<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#classmethod" rel="nofollow"><code>classmethod</code></a>'s first argument needs to be a function that takes one argument or more. Calling any of this will cause an error:</p>
<pre><code>classmethod(self.preapproval) # Not a function
classmethod(lambda: self.preapproval) # Needs one argument
</code></pre>
<p>This works, but it's too verbose:</p>
<pre><code>def get_preapproval(cls):
    return self.preapproval

classmethod(get_preapproval)
</code></pre>
<p>That's why that code uses lambda.</p>
<p>Probably it can be improved a little bit:</p>
<pre><code>classmethod(lambda _: self.preapproval)
</code></pre>
<p>This makes it obvious that the argument is not needed.</p>

<p><code>cls</code> is just a argument name for lambda ! and you don't use it at all ! <code>lambda cls: self.preapproval)</code> yields a function objec for <code>classmethod</code> ! , As lambda yields a function object you need to use it for pass <code>self.preapproval</code> because of <code>classmethod</code>s first argument needs to be a function object !</p>

<span class="comment-copy">@GP89 Ah, right, it can take &gt;= 1, because the class needs to be passed. Thanks!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That makes it MUCH clearer. But why do we need a classmethod in the firstplace therefore. Couldn't we put just the lambda? Or even better, why not do just: MockUrlRequestPreapproval.preapproval = self.preapproval</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I think it's because the rest of the code expects a classmethod. Doing anything else might change the behavior of the class. @cyberjoac</span>
<span class="comment-copy">How would you write this code to be more readable? Why should it be a classmethod and use a lambda in the first place?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">as lambda yields a function object you need to use it for pass <code>self.preapproval</code> because of <code>classmethod</code>s first argument needs to be a function object !</span>
