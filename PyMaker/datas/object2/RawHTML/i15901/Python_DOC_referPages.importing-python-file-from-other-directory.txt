<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have a following directory structure:</p>
<pre><code>                                parentDirectory
                                       |

                  |                                         |
                 Task                                    Configs
                   - pythonFile1.py                         - Config1.py
                                                            - Config2.py
</code></pre>
<p>The Configuration files have few configuration constants defined inside a class.</p>
<p>Now, I want to import the configuration files from Configs directory into the python file under Tasks directory and make use of constants defined inside the class in each config file.</p>
<p>I had tried with adding(after reading through few answers) -</p>
<pre><code>sys.path.insert(0,'/home/MyName/parentDirectory/Tasks')
</code></pre>
<p>inside the config files.</p>
<p>Since I am new to python, I don't know to what extent I am correct in adding the above lines.</p>
<p>Please help!</p>

<p>I think you got it backward: if you want your "Tasks" to be able to import your "Configs", you need to add code to the Tasks to insert the Configs path into <code>sys.path</code>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">It may be interesting to look at the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#packages" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><i>package</i> chapter</a> in Python tutorial</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Adding the line to "Tasks" throws an error saying-     Importerror: No module named Config1</span>
<span class="comment-copy">OK.  Now imagine what I am thinking when you say "it throws an error."  How can I help you?  What other information must I need?</span>
