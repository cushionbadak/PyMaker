<p>I understand that I should use <code>os.urandom()</code> or <code>SystemRandom</code> in Python for 'secure' pseudo-random numbers.</p>
<p>But how does Python generate these random numbers logically? </p>
<p>Also is there a way to generate a number in Python that is 'more random' than others?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>For "secure" random numbers, Python doesn't actually generate them:  it gets them from the operating system, which has a special driver that gathers entropy from various real-world sources, such as variations in timing between keystrokes and disk seeks.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">How can we be sure that these are truly random events? And would you happen to know what the driver is called?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It depends on the operating system.  For Linux, read about <code>/dev/random</code> and <code>/dev/urandom</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks! I'll come back to upvote once I get the rep - lol. What about Windows?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Can you predict exactly the time to the next key press, or which key that will be, or when the next disk seek will happen, or how long it will take - all of these are essentially unpredictable (even with physical access to the machine) so they can be used to generate a random number - so long as they are combined in a way that maintains their key characteristics - that is what things like /dev/random does.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@BillalBEGUERADJ, the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.urandom" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation for <code>os.urandom</code></a> explains exactly how it gets random data from the OS, and the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.SystemRandom" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation for <code>SystemRandom</code></a> says that it calls <code>os.urandom</code>.  As for how the OS gets the data, you can read about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki//dev/random" rel="nofollow noreferrer">how <code>/dev/random</code> and <code>/dev/urandom</code> work</a>.</span>
