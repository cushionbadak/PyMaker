<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>so I have the line:</p>
<pre><code>text="Temp :" + TempVar + "C CPUTemp: " + CPUTempVar + "C"

<p>How would I get that to work as a string on text?</p>

<p>You can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.format" rel="nofollow"><code>format</code></a> to create a string from your variables.</p>
<pre><code>TempVar = 100
CPUTempVar = 50
text = 'Temp : {}C CPUTemp: {}C'.format(TempVar,CPUTempVar)

&gt;&gt;&gt; text
'Temp : 100C CPUTemp: 50C'
</code></pre>

<p>I endorse @Cyber's answer (the <code>format</code> method) as the straightforward, modern Python way to format strings. </p>
<p>For completeness, however, the old way (common prior to Python 2.6) was a string interpolation operator:</p>
<pre><code>text = 'Temp : %dC CPUTemp: %dC' % (TempVar,CPUTempVar)
</code></pre>
<p>It still works in the latest Python 3 releases, and will commonly be seen in older code. </p>
<p>Or you could use my <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/say" rel="nofollow">say</a> package to do inline string substitution (or printing) similar to what you'd expect from Ruby, Perl, PHP, etc.:</p>
<pre><code>from say import *

text = fmt('Temp : {TempVar}C CPUTemp: {CPUTempVar}C')
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You need to cast as strings if you want to concat non strings to strings:</p>
<pre><code>TempVar = 100
CPUTempVar = 100
text="Temp: " + str(TempVar) + "C CPUTemp: " + str(CPUTempVar) + "C"

print(text)
Temp: 100C CPUTemp: 100C
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">In Python 2.6 and earlier, you'll need indexes in the format string: <code>'Temp : {0}C CPUTemp: {1}C'.format(TempVar,CPUTempVar)</code>. I know 2.6 is a bit long in the tooth now, and later versions don't need that much specification, but I still see a good deal of it in use, so any code I distribute widely, I put the indices in.</span>
