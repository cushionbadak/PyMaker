<p>I have a c# background and I am trying to pass a dictionary in method and some some I want to check if a specific key exists or not. If that key exists in dictionary and then I want to perform few other things.</p>
<p>Let suppose if have following dictionary:</p>
<pre><code>tel = {'jack': 4098, 'sape': 4139}
</code></pre>
<p>and I want to check whether key 'sape' exists or not? In method somehow, I do not know the type of argument. How can I cast to dictionary in order to  retrieve keys and values.</p>
<p>In method I want to check:</p>
<pre><code>keys = tel.keys () ;
keys.__contains__('sap')
do something
</code></pre>
<p>However, in method, I do not have information about the type of passed argument.</p>

<p>Few things to note about Python:</p>
<p>Python is not statically typed like C#. The function/method signature doesn't contain the data types of the parameters. So you do not need to cast the passed in value to a dictionary. Instead you assume that what is passed in is a dictionary and work on it. If you expect that something other than dictionary will be passed you can either use <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/errors.html" rel="nofollow">exception handling</a> to catch any issues or you can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#isinstance" rel="nofollow">isinstance</a> to check what is passed in is what you expect. Having said that casting does exist in python; for example you can convert an int 1 to a string by str(1).</p>
<p>Also note that if use the <code>in</code> keyword it will work for any iterable not just dictionary.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; 'jack' in 'lumberjack'
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; tel = {'jack': 4098, 'sape': 4139}
&gt;&gt;&gt; 'jack' in tel
True
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>If you really want to check if something is a dictionary you can do like this:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; isinstance(tel,dict)
True
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">What do you mean by 'cast to a dictionary'? If your function requires a dictionary, then just assume it <i>is</i> a dictionary and use <code>if 'sap' in tel:</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You should not use <code>__magic_methods__</code> directly here, nor call <code>.keys()</code>. Just use the <code>in</code> operator directly on the <code>tel</code> dictionary.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">As I mentioned that I am pretty new in python and could not find this kind of details.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I was going to recommend the Python tutorial, but you're probably already reading that -- that's where that example <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries" rel="nofollow noreferrer">comes from</a> originally.  It gives "'guido' in tel" as an example membership test, and says " To check whether a single key is in the dictionary, use the <code>in</code> keyword."</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@User1551892: then read through the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python tutorial</a> some more; it does cover details like these, including <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries" rel="nofollow noreferrer">membership testing in dictionaries</a>. Then again, it looks like you already are, as your example comes straight from that section.</span>
