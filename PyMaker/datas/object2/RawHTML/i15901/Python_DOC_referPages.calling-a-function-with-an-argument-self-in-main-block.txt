<p>How to call this function in main:</p>

<p>Since the function isn't a member of a class, there is no reason for it to take a <code>self</code> argument (which it doesn't use anyway):</p>
<pre><code>def multiples():
     for i in range(5):
        print 3*i

if __name__ == "__main__":
    multiples()

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you have a function definition that takes <code>self</code> as a parameter, <em>and that function definition is outside the scope of a class</em>, the <code>self</code> parameter has no special meaning -- it's just a normal argument. In your case, the function doesn't use the argument at all so it would be better to redefine your function rather than to pass in a value that won't be used:</p>
<pre><code>def multiples():
    for i in range(5):
        print 3*i

<span class="comment-copy">Is <code>multiples</code> a method of a class?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It looks like you need to review how classes work in python: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html?highlight=class" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html?highlight=class</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No its not part of a class. Its just an independent method.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">appreciate everyone's quick response here. Thaks</span>
