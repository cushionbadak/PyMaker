<p>In a sample code I am taking start IP and end IP as input . Out of which I will create a list of IP pool. I want to add a validation that start IP should be always lesser than end IP.</p>
<pre><code>start_ip = '100.71.9.98'
end_ip = '100.71.9.100'

start_ip &lt; end_ip 

False 
</code></pre>
<p>How can I validate that start_ip should be lesser than end_ip ? </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Convert the strings to a list of ints.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; start_ip = '100.71.9.98'
&gt;&gt;&gt; end_ip = '100.71.9.100'
&gt;&gt;&gt; map(int, start_ip.split('.'))  # list(map(int, ...))  in Python 3.x
[100, 71, 9, 98]
&gt;&gt;&gt; map(int, end_ip.split('.'))
[100, 71, 9, 100]
</code></pre>
<p>Then, it's possible to compare them as you want:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; '100.71.9.98' &lt; '100.71.9.100'
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; [100, 71, 9, 98] &lt; [100, 71, 9, 100]
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; map(int, start_ip.split('.')) &lt; map(int, end_ip.split('.'))
True
</code></pre>

<p>If you use Python 3.x then you can use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipaddress.html" rel="nofollow"><code>ipaddress</code></a> stdlib package which has objects designed for ip addresses. These objects support comparison in this way.</p>
<pre><code>import ipaddress

start = ipaddress.IPv4Address('100.71.9.98')
end = ipaddress.IPv4Address('100.71.9.100')

print(start &lt; end)
# True
</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/py2-ipaddress/" rel="nofollow">py2-ipaddress</a> can be used (with some reduced functionality) if you are using Python 2.7.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">one liner: print [int(n) for n in start_ip.split('.')] &lt; [int(n) for n in end_ip.split('.')]</span>
<span class="comment-copy">good comprehension but I don't know the complexity for this.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Perfect ! I had a different impression of string comparison.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Actually I was using netaddr library which takes care of this things. But I am writing my own method to implement that. Basically want to get rid of extra library. :) any how good to know about py2-address</span>
