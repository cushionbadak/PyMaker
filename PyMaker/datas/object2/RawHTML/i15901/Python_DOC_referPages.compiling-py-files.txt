<p>I'm trying to compile python source files without success. According to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.2/library/compileall.html" rel="nofollow">documentation</a>, <strong>compileall.compile_dir</strong> function has "<strong>ddir</strong>" parameter, which (I guess) specifies the destination folder for .pyc files. I try to compile it with this script:</p>
<pre><code>import compileall

compileall.compile_dir(".", force=1, ddir=".")
</code></pre>
<p>but it doesn't work. I see output from terminal (compiling, listing etc.) but pyc files are not generated. Anyone can help me understand where pyc files are stored and how to change that default behavior?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Check <code>__pycache__</code> directories. Since Python 3.2, the compiled files are collected in <code>__pycache__</code> directories.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.2.html?highlight=__pycache__#pep-3147-pyc-repository-directories" rel="nofollow">PEP 3147: PYC Repository Directories - Whatâ€™s New In Python 3.2</a>.</p>
<p>BTW, <code>ddir</code> is not destination directory. According to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/compileall.html#compileall.compile_dir" rel="nofollow">the documentation</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If <em>ddir</em> is given, it is prepended to the path to each file being
  compiled for use in compilation time tracebacks, and is also compiled
  in to the byte-code file, where it will be used in tracebacks and
  other messages in cases where the source file does not exist at the
  time the byte-code file is executed.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Did you check <code>__pycache__</code> directories?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks falsetru. Could you tell me where is that folder located on linux? Thanks</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Davita, They're located the same directory where the package/module exist. Try <code>find . -name __pycache__</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Wow, I lost 2 hours searching while it was in front of my nose :D thanks :)</span>
