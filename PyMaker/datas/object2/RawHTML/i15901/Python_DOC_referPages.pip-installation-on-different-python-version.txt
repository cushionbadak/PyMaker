<p>I encounter a problem with <code>pip</code> installation on linux. I've python 2.7 and 3.4, also Django in 1.7 installed. Currently I'm working on a project which uses different versions and I'm unable to install packages trough <code>pip</code> on python 2.7. Everything goes to directory of 3.4. 
Is there any way to "force" <code>pip</code> to install packages in concrete version of python?</p>

<p>The usual, and recommended by most users, way of working with Django is to use a separate, virtual environment per project.</p>
<p>Use <a href="http://virtualenv.readthedocs.org/en/latest/" rel="nofollow">virtualenv</a> to set up your Python 2.x environment and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html" rel="nofollow">venv</a> for Python 3.x. Both will install their own, local version of pip. <a href="https://www.google.de/search?q=Python%20Django&amp;gws_rd=ssl#q=Django%20Virtualenv" rel="nofollow">Google lists lots of tutorials</a> if you need help beyond the documentation.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">you should use virtual enviornment if you have multiple version of python.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Your system seems to be using python3 as the default python version. What os are you using? Are you on Gentoo or Arch?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">no it's mint and as default python 2.7 is used. If I want to use python 3.4 I need to force the system by <code>python3</code> command. But <code>pip install</code> uses python 3.4.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">check for packages in your distro for pip. There should be one for python2 and one for python3. Install the one for python2. You should then be able to run <code>pip-2.7</code> or <code>pip-python2</code> to install packages for python2.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you can't find it in your distro, install it by hand. Have a look at this question, particularly this comment: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11268501/how-to-use-pip-with-python-3-x-alongside-python-2-x#comment14822876_11272201" title="how to use pip with python 3 x alongside python 2 x%23comment14822876_11272201">stackoverflow.com/questions/11268501/â€¦</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">I didn't thought about <code>virtualenv</code> :). Thanks I'll try this.</span>
