<p>I have a challenge at school, but i am stuck with a small bit of my code.</p>
<p>Here's what I have; what I'm missing is how to finish the <code>answer =</code> line:</p>
<pre><code>while (questions &lt;= 9):
    randoms()
    print("What is: ", num1, symbol, num2,"?:")
    uanswer = int(input())
    answer = 
    if uanswer == answer:
        correct = correct + 1
    else:
        incorrect = incorrect + 1
    questions = questions + 1
</code></pre>
<p>The variables <code>num1</code>, <code>num2</code> and <code>symbol</code> are randomly generated, <code>num1</code> and <code>num2</code> are both integers, and <code>symbol</code> is either <code>'+'</code>, <code>'-'</code>, <code>'*'</code> or <code>'/'</code> I was wondering how to use these to get an answer to an equation. </p>
<p>For example, <code>num1</code> is <code>50</code>, <code>symbol</code> is <code>'-'</code>, and <code>num2</code> is <code>25</code>. How would I use the variables to get the answer <code>25</code>?</p>

<p>The clean way to do this is to create a mapping from symbols to functions.</p>
<p>The only question is, what is the function behind the <code>+</code> operator?</p>
<p>The answer is in the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/operator.html#mapping-operators-to-functions" rel="nofollow"><code>operator</code></a> module: <code>a + b</code> is <code>operator.add(a, b)</code>, and so on. So:</p>
<pre><code>import operator

symbols = {
    '+': operator.add,
    '-': operator.sub,
    '*': operator.mul,
    '/': operator.floordiv
}
</code></pre>
<p>I'm assuming here that you want <code>100 / 3</code> to be <code>33</code>, not <code>33.333333333333336</code>. If I'm wrong, use <code>truediv</code> instead of <code>floordiv</code> above. (See <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#numbers" rel="nofollow">Numbers</a> in the tutorial for an introduction to the difference, with links to more details.)</p>
<p>Anyway, now, you can do this:</p>
<pre><code>answer = symbols[symbol](num1, num2)
</code></pre>
<hr/>
<p>Even if you didn't have <code>operator</code>, you could always build a function for each operator:</p>
<pre><code>symbols = {
    '+': (lambda a, b: a + b),
    '-': (lambda a, b: a - b),
    '*': (lambda a, b: a * b),
    '/': (lambda a, b: a // b)
}
</code></pre>
<p>This may come in handy if you want to extend your language to a symbol that doesn't have a matching operator in Python.</p>
<hr/>
<p>If your maths language is a strict subset of Python's expression language (which it may not beâ€”notice that the symbol <code>'/'</code> maps to the Python operator <code>//</code> if you want integers), and you're sure that you're never going to extend it in a way that isn't (e.g., using <code>^</code> for exponentiation), and you're sure that you will never be using any numbers or symbols that you didn't generate yourself, it may be simpler to just build a Python expression and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#eval" rel="nofollow"><code>eval</code></a> it:</p>
<pre><code>expr = '{} {} {}'.format(num1, symbol, num2)
answer = eval(expr)
</code></pre>
<p>However, you should always be careful about using <code>eval</code>; if the clean thing to do is simple enough for you to write, and to read and understand later, it's almost always a better answer.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I think the best way is creating conditonals and check the symbol..</p>
<pre><code>if symbol=='-':
   res = num1 - num2
elif symbol=='+':
   res = num1 + num2
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Great comprehensive post, with eval as a last resort option... I like it very much.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Dude, thank you so much! Your a life saver, as you can probably tell im not that advanced in python yet :P but thanks dude :D</span>
