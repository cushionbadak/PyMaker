<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I'd like to create a function that will print the max value within a list of numbers.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I dont know python but the pseudocode would look something like this</p>
<pre><code>max = â€“2147483648

for each integer n in collection
   if n &gt; max
      max = n
</code></pre>
<p>It loops through every number in a collection. If the number (n) is bigger than the previous maximum, the maximum is set to be equal to n.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Are you familiar with the built-in <code>max</code> function?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I think you should do your homeworks on your own, if you ever want to learn something.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">doesn't work if all values &lt; 0</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@m.wasowski It does now ;)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">he should do this on his own. And general algorithm is: 1) if collection is empty, return None or raise error. 2) max := first element 3) ... then your code X)... return max</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Integers in Python <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#numeric-types-int-float-complex" rel="nofollow noreferrer">can be of arbitrary size</a> - any solution which assumes they're limited to 32 bits will fail for some valid inputs.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">... and in any case, the question specifies "numbers" rather than "integers". What happens with the list <code>[-1.0e10, -1.0e12, -1.0e11]</code>?</span>
