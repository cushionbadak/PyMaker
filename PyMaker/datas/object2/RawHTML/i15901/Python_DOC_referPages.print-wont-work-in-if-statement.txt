<p>When I run this script, it skips the print function in line 8. I cannot figure out why for the life of me. I have tried so many things to get this working but I just can't seem to figure out the problem here. I am very new to Python so excuse me if it's a very simple issue.</p>
<p>Edit: woops, forgot the actual code! <em>facepalm</em> here it is:</p>
<pre><code>import webbrowser
import sys
b = webbrowser.get('windows-default')
print('Type start')
line1 = sys.stdin.readline()
start = 'start'
if line1 == start:
    print('What website do you want to open?')
line2 = sys.stdin.readline()
b.open(line2)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>When you type <code>'start'</code> into stdin and then hit enter, the entire string <em>including the newline character</em> ends up being stored in <code>line1</code>. So in reality, <code>line1 == 'start\n'</code>. You need to remove that <code>\n</code> from the end of the string before you do your comparison. An easy way to do that is using <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#str.rstrip" rel="nofollow"><code>str.rstrip</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>if line1.rstrip() == start:
    print('What website do you want to open?')
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>
<p>As Ashwini Chaudhary pointed out in the comments, you should really just be using <code>raw_input</code> (or <code>input</code> if using Python 3.x) instead of <code>sys.stdin.readline</code>. It would make your code shorter, and remove the need to strip the trailing newline altogether:</p>
<pre><code>line1 = raw_input('Type start')
start = 'start'
if line1 == start:
    line2 = raw_input('What website do you want to open?')
    b.open(line2)
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Looks like you forgot to include the script...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Haha realized it as soon as I posted. Fixed now!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Are you aware of <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html#raw_input" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>raw_input</code></a>(or <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>input</code></a> in Python 3)? Clearly you're asking for user input here, so better use these methods instead of <code>sys.stdin.readline</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Well played sir.. good eye there..</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks a lot, it works now!</span>
