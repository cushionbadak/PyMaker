<p><br/> I'm trying to retrieve a Javascript variable using Python and I'm having some issues...
<br/><br/>Here is what the variable looks like :</p>
<pre><code>&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
var exampleVar = [
    {...},
    {...},
    {
        "key":"0000",
        "abo":
            {
                "param1":"1"
                "param2":"2"
                "param3":
                    [
                        {
                            "param3a1":"000"
                            "param3a2":"111"
                        },
                        {
                            "param3b1":"100"
                            "param3b2":"101"
                        }
                    ]
             }
]
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>After some research, I discovered that its content was in the JSON format, and I'm new to it...
<br/><br/>My problem now is that I would like to retrieve the value of "param3b1" (for example) to use it in my Python program.
<br/>How do I do this in Python ?
<br/> Thanks !</p>

<p>Step by step this is what you need to do.</p>
<ol>
<li>extract the json string from the file/html string. you need to get the string between the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags first, and then the variable definition</li>
<li>extract the parameter from the json string.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is a demo.</p>
<pre><code>from xml.etree import ElementTree

import json
tree = ElementTree.fromstring(js_String).getroot() #get the root
#use etree.find or whatever to find the text you need in your html file
script_text = tree.text.strip()

#extract json string
#you could use the re module if the string extraction is complex
json_string = script_text.split('var exampleVar =')[1]
#note that this will work only for the example you have given.
try:
    data = json.loads(json_string)
except ValueError:
    print "invalid json", json_string
else:
    value = data['abo']['param3']['param3b1']
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You need to use the JSON module.</p>
<pre><code>import json

myJson = json.loads(your_json_string)

param3b1 = myJson['abo']['param3'][1]['param3b1']
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy"><i>"After some research, I discovered that it was JSON,"</i> No, no, no! JavaScript <b>is not</b> JSON. JSON and JavaScript object literals have very similar syntax (after all, JSON was inspired by that syntax), but that doesn't make them one and the same thing. JavaScript is a <i>programming language</i>, JSON is <i>data format</i> (like XML).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hi, thanks for this great answer. Do you have a good link on how to use the re module, because I tried to undersand it but I couldn't... Thank you !</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Sek8 You need to understand regex before you can understand the re module. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression" rel="nofollow noreferrer">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression</a> . However, if the text you are parsing is simple enough, you should be able to extract the JSON object using split()</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks a lot ! My issue now is how to extract my JSON string from the whole <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> and from the <code>var myVar = my_json_string</code> ... Any idea about this ? I think I should use the <code>re</code> module but I'm not at all familiar with it.</span>
