<p>I am trying to make a simple calculator that calculates basic statistic functions. I am almost done but I cannot figure out how to make a user input a list of numerical values. This is where I am currently at:</p>
<pre><code>#inputList code?
inputList = []
numbers = input('Input your numbers: ').split(',')
for entry in numbers:
    inputList.append(entry)
</code></pre>
<p>This gives me the error: TypeError: can't convert type 'str' to numerator/denominator
Here is a link to all the code: <a href="http://pastebin.com/B7u5a6LA" rel="nofollow">http://pastebin.com/B7u5a6LA</a></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Change those to <code>int</code> with <code>int(some_string)</code>:</p>
<pre><code>for entry in numbers:
    inputList.append(int(entry))
</code></pre>
<p>EDIT: As suggested by @tobias_k and @DSM, you can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#map" rel="nofollow">map</a> fucntions:</p>
<pre><code>inputlist = list(map(int, numbers))
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Depending on how robust to bad input you want to be, you can do the following in one line to get it done:</p>
<pre><code>inputList = [float(num.strip()) for num in input("Enter a list of numbers: ").split(',')]
</code></pre>
<p>Note that the user entering something that wasn't a number, or something that wasn't a comma delimited list of numbers, will cause this to throw a <code>ValueError</code>. If that is something you're worried about. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">Aside from the fact that it's really just <code>inputList = input(...).split(',')</code>, the code you have provided works fine for me. Please provide a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve">minimal example</a> that <i>actually recreates the issue</i>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Aside: in your linked code you forgot a bunch of <code>return</code> statements.  Unlike some languages, Python doesn't automatically return the result of the last line executed in a function.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@DSM yes yes, now it works! I have forgotten to do that. Silly me. Thanks everybody for your answers.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@avi thank you, I used the     inputList.append(int(entry))     and now it works. Thank you very much!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@aruisdante thank you, for editing my text and providing the solution. ^-^</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Or shorter: <code>inputlist = map(int, numbers)</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">added to the answer. Thanks for suggesting!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Careful: the question is tagged <code>3.x</code>, and <code>map</code> doesn't return a list in 3.  You'd need <code>list(map(int, numbers))</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">oops, great catch. edited the answer. My mind still hung upon python 2.</span>
