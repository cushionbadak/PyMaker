<p>In Java, we can do something like:</p>
<pre><code>int i = 0;
while (i &lt; 10)
   System.out.println(i++);
</code></pre>
<p>where it iterates <code>i</code> and prints it. Can the same be done in python?</p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong><br/>
Specifically, I'd like to do something like:</p>
<pre><code>words = ["red","green","blue"]
current_state = 0
for word in words:
  for char in word:
     print(char,current_state,current_state+1)

Result
r 0 1
e 1 2
d 2 3
g 3 4
r 4 5
e 5 6
....
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>If you want the equivalent of the <code>++</code> operator in Java, the answer is no.  Python requires you to do:</p>
<pre><code>i += 1
</code></pre>
<p>on its own line.</p>
<p>However, you may be looking for <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#enumerate" rel="nofollow"><code>enumerate</code></a>, which allows you to keep track of what index you are at while iterating over a container:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; for i, j in enumerate(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']):
...     print(i, j)
...
0 a
1 b
2 c
3 d
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>i = 0
while i &lt; 10:
    i += 1
    print i
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">why not use <code>range</code> <code>for x in range(9):print x+1</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This won't work for my specific problem. But thanks</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You should add what you are trying to do as it does exactly what you are asking</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, I added a more specific example</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I think OP meant to do this at the same time, but this solution is better and more clear.</span>
