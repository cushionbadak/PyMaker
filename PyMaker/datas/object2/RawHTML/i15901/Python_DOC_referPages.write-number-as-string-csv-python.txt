<p>I'm trying to write a csv file from json data. During that, i want to write '001023472' but its writing as '1023472'. I have searched a lot. But dint find an answer.</p>
<p>The value is of type string before writing. The problem is during writing it into the file.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance. </p>

<p>Convert the number to string with formatting operator; in your case: <code>"%09d" % number</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#format" rel="nofollow"><code>format</code> builtin</a> or <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#formatstrings" rel="nofollow"><code>format</code> string method</a>.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; format(1023472, '09')
'001023472'
&gt;&gt;&gt; '{:09}'.format(1023472)
'001023472'
</code></pre>
<p>If your "number" is actually a string, you can also just left-pad it with <code>'0'</code>'s:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; format('1023472', '&gt;09')
'001023472'
</code></pre>
<p>The Python docs generally eschew <code>%</code> formatting, saying it may go away in the future and is also more finnicky; for new code there is no real reason to use it, especially in 2.7+.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">change the type to str like str(001023472)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You can use formatting</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Look at the chapter on Strings in the Python manual. Much of it is dedicated to formatting output. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/string.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3.5/library/string.html</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@AvinashGarg that is a SyntaxError in Python 3 (leading 0s are prohibited in numeric literals), and in Python 2 it will convert the number to octal (would be a SyntaxError if there were an 8 or 9).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@AvinashGarg plus it doesn't seem like the OP actually has a literal but something from a JSON.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">still i get the value as '1023472' in my csv file. i want '001023472'</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Is it a string from your CSV? You could cast it to int then use the format methods, or just pad the string with 0's.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">i'm writing in a csv file from json data. one of my json value is '001023472' which i want to write into one of columns in csv file. But there seems to be a problem while writing. the value is of type string but when i write it to csv it is changed as int.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What are you writing your CSV with? I don't think the standard library <code>csv</code> package converts strings to ints. I'm still a bit confused as to the <code>type()</code> of your "json value".</span>
