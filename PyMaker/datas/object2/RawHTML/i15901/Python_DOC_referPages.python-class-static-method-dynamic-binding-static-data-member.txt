<p>I really don't know how to describe this problem good enough. So i think an example is more expressive:</p>
<pre><code>class A:
    c=1
    @staticmethod
    def b(): return A.c

class B(A):
    c=2
</code></pre>
<p>I hope <code>B.b()</code> returns <code>2</code>. but the reality is it does not. in which way am i gonna achieve it? Thanks a lot.</p>

<p>The problem is that you're using a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#staticmethod" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>staticmethod</code></a>, and hardcoding the class <code>A</code>, instead of using a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#classmethod" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>classmethod</code></a>, and using the <code>cls</code> argument.</p>
<p>Try this:</p>
<pre><code>class A:
    c=1
    @classmethod
    def b(cls): return cls.c
</code></pre>
<p>The docs (linked above) explain the difference, but you may want to try looking at Stack Overflow questions like <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/136097/what-is-the-difference-between-staticmethod-and-classmethod-in-python">What is the difference between <code>@staticmethod</code> and <code>@classmethod</code> in Python</a> for a more in-depth discussion. Briefly: a <code>staticmethod</code> is basically just a global function inside the class's namespace, while a <code>classmethod</code> is a method on the class object; if you want to use any class attributes (or the class itself, as in the alternate constructor idiom), you want the latter.</p>

<p>You'd have to use a class method, so you could reference the class dynamically.  A static method like you are currently using is not bound to any class, so you have to statically explicitly reference the <code>A</code> class as you are.</p>
<pre><code>class A(object):
    c = 1
    @classmethod
    def b(cls):
        return cls.c

class B(A):
    c = 2
</code></pre>
