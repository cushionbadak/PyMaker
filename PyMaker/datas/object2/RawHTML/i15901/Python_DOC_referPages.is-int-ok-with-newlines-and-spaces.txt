<p>I try the following and it prints 1 with no exception. 
Is this an expected behaviour for all versions (&gt;2.7) of python?</p>
<pre><code>a='1 \r\n'
print int(a)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#int" rel="nofollow">documentation for <code>int()</code></a> explicitly states this is expected behaviour:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If <em>x</em> is not a number or if base is given, then I must be a string or Unicode object representing an integer literal in radix base. Optionally, the literal can be preceded by + or - (with no space in between) and <strong>surrounded by whitespace)</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Emphasis mine.</p>
<p>This is the expected behaviour for Python; the first version where you could pass string to the <code>int()</code> function was <a href="https://docs.python.org/release/1.5/lib/node26.html#1511" rel="nofollow">Python 1.5</a>, and the behaviour has remained unchanged in Python 2 and Python 3.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Why do you expect an exception?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, that's expected behaviour.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Check <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int</a> for the Python versions you are interested in (use the version picker at the top left of the page).</span>
