<p>I have been using jupyter as well as Atom with python for more than a year now. I'm currently using Python 3.7.2 on macOS 10.14. There is no problem running Python from the Terminal and here are the PATH I get after running <code>sys.path</code>:</p>

<p>I already uninstalled all the python installations on my computer including the anaconda version (except python 2.7 as my mac doesn't accept that I remove it)</p>

<p>ok what i did is that I uninstalled python and reinstalled everything with <code>Homebrew</code> and it worked</p>

<span class="comment-copy">It said : PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/lib/python3.7' Did you try to change the permission on that folder?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thank for your comment @J.K. I uninstalled everything and installed python3 and jupyter through homebrew. So far it works...</span>
