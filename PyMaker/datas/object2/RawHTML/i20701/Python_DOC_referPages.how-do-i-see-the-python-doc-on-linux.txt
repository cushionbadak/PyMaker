<p>In Windows, Python has a chm type document, and it is very convenient to read.
But in the Linux, is there any document let me to read?</p>

<h2>Online documentation</h2>
<p>The simplest way is to use Google to get to online documentation. There is no single point where you find all documentations of all modules. However, a few common ones are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.python.org/" rel="noreferrer">Python 3</a></li>
<li><a href="http://docs.scipy.org/doc/" rel="noreferrer">NumPy and SciPy</a></li>
<li><a href="http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/" rel="noreferrer">Theano</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you need offline documentation there are a few other possibilities:</p>
<h2>Download it</h2>
<p>You can download the documentation as HTML or a PDF: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/download.html" rel="noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/download.html</a></p>
<p>When you have a web server running, you can use the HTML version and access it as you are used to via a browser. The HTML site looks just like you are used to. Even the search works offline, because it is implemented with JavaScript.</p>

<h2>PyDoc</h2>
<p>Some distributions like Debian offer a <code>python-doc</code> package. You can access it via
<code>pydoc -p [some port number]</code> or via <code>pydoc -g</code>. This will create a local web server. Then you can open your browser and have a look at it:</p>

<h2>Console: help(...)</h2>
<p>The Python interactive console has a built-in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#help" rel="noreferrer"><code>help(...)</code></a> system. You can either invoke it without an argument:</p>
<pre><code>$ python
Python 2.7.5+ (default, Feb 27 2014, 19:37:08) 
[GCC 4.8.1] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt; help()

Welcome to Python 2.7!  This is the online help utility.

If this is your first time using Python, you should definitely check out
the tutorial on the Internet at http://docs.python.org/2.7/tutorial/.

Enter the name of any module, keyword, or topic to get help on writing
Python programs and using Python modules.  To quit this help utility and
return to the interpreter, just type "quit".

To get a list of available modules, keywords, or topics, type "modules",
"keywords", or "topics".  Each module also comes with a one-line summary
of what it does; to list the modules whose summaries contain a given word
such as "spam", type "modules spam".

help&gt; 
</code></pre>
<p>or you can call it with a paramter about which you want to know something. That can be anything (a module, a class, a function, an object, ...). It looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = {'b':'c'}
&gt;&gt;&gt; help(a)
Help on dict object:

class dict(object)
 |  dict() -&gt; new empty dictionary
 |  dict(mapping) -&gt; new dictionary initialized from a mapping object's
 |      (key, value) pairs
 |  dict(iterable) -&gt; new dictionary initialized as if via:
 |      d = {}
 |      for k, v in iterable:
 |          d[k] = v
 |  dict(**kwargs) -&gt; new dictionary initialized with the name=value pairs
 |      in the keyword argument list.  For example:  dict(one=1, two=2)

 |  Methods defined here:
 |

 |      x.__cmp__(y) &lt;==&gt; cmp(x,y)
 |  
 |  __contains__(...)
 |      D.__contains__(k) -&gt; True if D has a key k, else False
 |  
 |  __delitem__(...)
 |      x.__delitem__(y) &lt;==&gt; del x[y]
 |  
 |  __eq__(...)
 |      x.__eq__(y) &lt;==&gt; x==y
 |  
 |  __ge__(...)
 |      x.__ge__(y) &lt;==&gt; x&gt;=y
 |  
 |  __getattribute__(...)
 |      x.__getattribute__('name') &lt;==&gt; x.name

<p>You can also install the Ipython to inspect the modules/objects in the interactive mode.<br/>
For example, you can do this in ipython:</p>
<pre><code>import pygame  
pygame.draw.line?
</code></pre>
<p>then you get the result doc:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>pygame.draw.line(Surface, color, start_pos, end_pos, width=1): return Rect<br/>
      draw a straight line segment</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In ipython you can use tab complition, it's helpful for inspecting something.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Can't you just search the <a href="http://docs.python.org/index.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python documentation website</a>? Also, Google is quite good at finding the right documentation.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">to Joachim Pileborg.sorry, the net here is ever bad, so that is why I need the offline doc.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">One day I'd forgotten how to start the PyDoc localhost server thingy.  I started searching around the Python documentation website, but didn't get very far.  So I turned to Stack Exchange, and one of the answers here gave me what I was after.  So maybe we should keep the question.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>pydoc</code> can also be used with no flags in which case the output goes into <code>less</code> (similarly to <code>man</code>). For example try <code>pydoc os.path</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ditto debian/ubuntu: sudo apt-get install python-doc; firefox /usr/share/doc/python-doc/html/index.html</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@DeanSerenevy Thank you</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The difficulty with the built in help is that there is no help function (that I can find), which makes it difficult to browse the help if you don't know what you're looking for. R has a really nice <code>??topic</code> search method that looks though all available libraries. Is there anything similar for python?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">should be a comment</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Since this doesn't answer the question, and it's just a link, it should be a comment.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">of course it answers the question, he wants to read the docs on linux and there's the docs. you want me to spell out he needs to use a browser?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">sorry, it is my fault, I don't say it complete.I need a offline doc.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You are making an assumption that most of us are on-line.  There are many developers in secure facilities and other places which have zero Internet connectivity.    Ubiquitous, yes.  Everywhere, no.</span>
