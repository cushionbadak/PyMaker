<p>I want to wrap the colour input in quotes within python:</p>
<pre><code>def main():
    colour = input("please enter a colour")
</code></pre>
<p>So if I enter red into the input box it automatically makes it "red"</p>
<p>I'm not sure how to do this, would it be something along the lines of:</p>
<pre><code>def main():
    colour = """ + input("please enter a colour") + """
</code></pre>
<p>Kind regards</p>

<p>The issue is that this doesn't pass syntactically, as Python thinks the second <code>"</code> is the end of the string (the syntax highlighting in your post shows how it's being interpreted). The nicest to read solution is to use single quotes for the string: <code>'"'</code>.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can escape characters (if you wish to, for example, use both types of quote in a string) with a backslash: <code>"\""</code></p>
<p>A nice way of doing this kind of insertion of a value, rather than many concatenations of strings, is to use <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.format" rel="nofollow"><code>str.format</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>colour = '"{}"'.format(input("please enter a colour"))
</code></pre>
<p>This can do a lot of things, but here, we are simply using it to insert the value we pass in where we put <code>{}</code>. (Note that pre-2.7, you will need to give the number of the argument to insert e.g: <code>{0}</code> in this case. Past that version, if you don't give one, Python will just use the next value).</p>
<p>Do note that in Python 2.x, you will want <code>raw_input()</code> rather than <code>input()</code> as in 2.x, the latter evaluates the input as Python, which could lead to bad things. In 3.x, the behaviour was fixed so that <code>input()</code> behaves as <code>raw_input()</code> did in 2.x.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">+1 You explained better than I did</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@A.R.S. Cheers, I've added in the bit from your post about <code>raw_input()</code> in case the asker is using 2.x.</span>
