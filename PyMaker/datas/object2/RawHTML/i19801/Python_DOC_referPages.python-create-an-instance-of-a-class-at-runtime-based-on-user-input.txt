<p>I'm somewhat new to python, and have been searching for info on this all day. I want to be able to ask the user how many instances they want, and based on their input, create as many instances of a class as they requested. </p>
<p>I would also like to be able to have the name of each instance be based off of input such as asking the person's name or something.</p>
<pre><code>NumPlayers = input("How many people are playing? ")
for i in range(0, int(NumPlayers)-1):
    name = input("What is your name? ")
    name = Player() 
</code></pre>
<p>This would be similar to <code>John = Player()</code> but "John" would be whatever name the user gave us, and there would be however many players the user wants.</p>
<p>From my research today, it seems that allowing people to determine the name of their own instances isn't a good idea, so at this point I'm thinking something more along the lines of this:</p>
<pre><code>NumPlayers = input("How many people are playing? ")
for i in range(0, int(NumPlayers)-1):
    name = input("What is your name? ")
    Player+i = Player(name)
</code></pre>
<p>This would be the same as <code>Player1 = Player("John")</code> etc. for more players. Is this something that is possible? It's really stumping me. Just to clarify a few things, the class itself is already in the code, in the provided code Player is a class that has already been defined with methods and everything.</p>

<p>What you are looking for is a data structure, specifically, a <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesseq" rel="nofollow">list</a>.</p>
<pre><code>no_players = input("How many people are playing? ")
players = []
for _ in range(int(no_players)):
    name = input("What is your name? ")
    players.append(Player(name))
</code></pre>
<p>This will produce a list of <code>[Player(...), Player(...), ...]</code>. This can be indexed (<code>players[2]</code>) or iterated over (<code>for player in players:</code>) among other operations. I recommend you read <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesseq" rel="nofollow">the documentation</a> for more.</p>
<p>As a side note, some lists can be constructed even more nicely with a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pShL9DCSIUw" rel="nofollow">list comprehension</a>.</p>

<p>As Lattyware suggested you are looking for a list to put your players into.
May I suggest to modify slightly your procedure to accept as many players as you want as long as they put a new name?</p>
<pre><code>players = []
while True:
    playername = input("Insert a new player (empty to begin):")
    if playername:
        players.append(Player(playername))
    else:
        break
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Note that <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PEP-8</a> reserves <code>CapWords</code> for classes, so <code>NumPlayers</code> is a bad name for a local variable.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I had no idea there was a way to instantiate something besides a simple X = something(), Thanks a bunch. Append vs. Extend has always been a bit tricky for me, so this is super helpful.</span>
