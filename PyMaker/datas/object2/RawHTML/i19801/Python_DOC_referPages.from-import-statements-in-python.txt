<p>I'm a little confused by the from import statements in Python.  In particular, how I can import a class from a module that is within a package.  For example, if I have a package named my package that has two modules (module 1 and module 2), how can I import a specific class from module 1 within module 2?  </p>
<p>What I'm finding currently is that I need to (within module two) do the following...</p>
<pre><code>from package import module1
module1.class1()
</code></pre>
<p>While this works, I'd much rather be able to access class1() directly from module 2 as it is not very readable .  However, the following syntax doesn't work...</p>
<pre><code>from package import module1.class1
</code></pre>
<p>Also, it won't let me simply go...</p>
<pre><code>from module1 import class1
</code></pre>
<p>How does one import a class which is in a module within a package, directly within a separate module within that package? </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You were on the right track:</p>
<pre><code>from package.module1 import class1
</code></pre>
<p>If as you say you're importing from within the same package, you can also do</p>
<pre><code>from .module1 import class1
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>.</code> means "the  position in the package hierarchy of the module doing the importing".  See <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-import-statement">the documentation</a> for info.</p>
