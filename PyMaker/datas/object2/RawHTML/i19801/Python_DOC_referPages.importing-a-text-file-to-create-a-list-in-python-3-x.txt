<p>I can't seem to figure out how to use values given in a text file and import them into python to create a list. What I'm trying to accomplish here is to create a gameboard and then put numbers on it as a sample set. I have to use Quickdraw to accomplish this - I kind of know how to get the numbers on Quickdraw but I cannot seem to import the numbers from the text file. Previous assignments involved getting the user to input values or using an I/O redirection, this is a little different. Could anyone assist me on this?</p>

<p>Depends on the contents of the file you want to read and output in the list you want to get.</p>
<pre><code># assuming you have values each on separate line
values = []
for line in open('path-to-the-file'):
    values.append(line)
    # might want to implement stripping newlines and such in here
    # by using line.strip() or .rstrip()

# or perhaps more than one value in a line, with some separator
values = []
for line in open('path-to-the-file'):
    # e.g. ':' as a separator
    separator = ':'
    line = line.split(separator)
    for value in line:
        values.append(value)

# or all in one line with separators
values = open('path-to-the-file').read().split(separator)
# might want to use .strip() on this one too, before split method
</code></pre>
<p>It could be more accurate if we knew the input and output requirements.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Look at the builtin <a href="http://docs.python.org/3.2/library/functions.html#open" rel="nofollow noreferrer">open</a> for starters</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Show us what you've tried so that we can point out where you're going wrong</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Your question is hard to understand. What exactly have you tried, and which part are you having a problem with implementing?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is what I have so far then:       for i in range (0, Board_size):     	sys.stderr.write("Enter Game Values:")     	gamevalues = float(input()) # To get the values from the text file using I/O     	datalist = [gamevalues] # To define the values entered as a list     	print ("color 0 0 0")     	print (datalist)     	print ("fill text", x, y)  The quickdraw stuff I can work out, it is the list that is giving me nightmares.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You are allowed to edit your answer (there's a bit marked <code>edit</code> under the tags)- it makes it much easier for everyone to see your posted code, rather than in a comment</span>
