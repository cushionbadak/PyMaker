<p>I've been trying out the 'socket' module in Python but whenever I attempt to run this code :</p>
<pre><code>import socket
import sys

host = '192.168.1.1'
port = 23

try:
      s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
except:
      print "socket() failed"
      sys.exit(1)
</code></pre>
<p>Then it dies. Here is the error without the except and try :</p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:\Documents and Settings\a\Desktop\socket.py", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
    import socket
  File "C:\Documents and Settings\a\Desktop\socket.py", line 6, in &lt;module&gt;
    s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'AF_INET'
</code></pre>
<p>I've just started Python(Today) and am in need of help.</p>
<p>I saved it as socket.py but also sock.py ...</p>

<p><a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/sys.html#sys.path" rel="noreferrer">looks into the current directory before Python's standard library</a>. And since your file is called <code>socket.py</code>, it is itself imported instead of the <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html" rel="noreferrer">socket</a> standard library module. Rename (don't copy, since that would leave the original file) the file to something else, such as <code>my_socket.py</code>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Yes .. But it wont work as sock.py either.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Make sure you delete <code>socket.py</code>. If that continues to fail, please update the stacktrace to the one you get with <code>sock.py</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">haha thanks. now I feel stupid. I'm a python newbie though so lesson learned :) +1</span>
