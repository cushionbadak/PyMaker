<p>spython script to list all of the files and directories that have been created</p>

<p>Without giving you the entire answer, here are the parts you need:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.walk" rel="nofollow">walk</a>: <code>os.walk('.')</code> iterates over all of the files and directories in <code>.</code> and any of its subdirectories. You can wrap a <code>for</code> loop around that. Look at the examples to get the <code>os.path.join(dirpath, filename)</code> and other details right.</li>
<li><a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.stat" rel="nofollow">stat</a>: <code>os.stat(pathname)</code> returns a <code>stat</code> object with information about the file at <code>pathname</code>. Depending on your platform, either <code>st_ctime</code> or <code>st_birthtime</code> may be the creation time. (On some platforms, there is no way to get it.) The format is seconds since the epoch.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html" rel="nofollow">time</a> module: You've already been told about this. Get the current time at startup, using your favorite seconds-since-the-epoch function. Any file where <code>starttime - create time &lt;= X * 60</code> is new. (But make sure you get the timezone stuff right—use either GMT or local time for both file times and current times.)</li>
</ul>

<span class="comment-copy">"Note that the current directory is usually referred to as /" This is your homework. Do your own work.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">On what system is the current directory usually referred to as <code>/</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The system is unix</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user1675137 I think <code>.</code> represents the current directory in unix.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You tried it… and what happened? Who told you to type <code>dt.datetime.now()</code> instead of <code>datetime.datetime.now()</code>? And if someone told you to use the <code>time</code> module, why are you using the <code>datetime</code> module instead?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you a lot for helping that what i was looking for</span>
