<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I want to display only the diff between commits that have a tag added to them. Or the closest to this. In other words something like this:</p>
<pre><code>tag  "5 ..."
@@ -1,1 +1,3 @@
+ dfd
+ dfgd

tag "4.."
@@ -1,1 +1,3 @@
+ dfd
+ dfgd
</code></pre>
<p>And so on. I have tried but cannot get this specific format maybe someone can help me out there. Then once I have a text file with this format or as close as possible I do the following:</p>
<pre><code>with open('log_output_alex.txt', 'r') as f:
  read_data = f.read()
f.closed

tag_separation = read_data.split('tag: "')
</code></pre>
<p>After doing this I do not know how TO READ EACH OF THE LINES IN EACH OF THE STRINGS in the array tag_separation?</p>
<p>Once I can do this I can check if line in the string starts with a certain character (@, +, - or tag) and store different lines in data structures to manipulate later.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for the help!</p>

<p>You might want to use <a href="http://packages.python.org/GitPython/0.3.1/tutorial.html" rel="nofollow">the <code>GitPython</code>library</a>, which will give you an higher-level access to your <code>git</code> repository.</p>
<p>And even if you decide not to use it, you can probably have a look at how it's done there!</p>

<p>Git wonâ€™t be able to give you that format in a single command, so you need to create it yourself a bit. For that, here are some hints:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can get a list of tags using <code>git tag</code></li>
<li>You can get the commit SHA1 for a reference (i.e. tag) using <code>git rev-parse TAGNAME</code></li>
<li>You can get the diff between two commits using <code>git diff A..B</code>, for example <code>git diff tag1..tag2</code></li>
</ul>
<p>That way you also end up with already separated diffs for each tag, so you do not need to store it in a file first and split it again, you can just start with it.</p>

<p>You can iterate through the lines of a string by splitting it first, using <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.splitlines" rel="nofollow"><code>str.splitlines</code></a>.</p>
