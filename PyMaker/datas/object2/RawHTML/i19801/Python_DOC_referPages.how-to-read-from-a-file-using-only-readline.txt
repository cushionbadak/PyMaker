<p>The code i have right now is this </p>
<pre><code>f = open(SINGLE_FILENAME)
lines = [i for i in f.readlines()]
</code></pre>
<p>but my proffessor demands that</p>
<p>You may use readline(). You may not use read(), readlines() or iterate over the open file using for.</p>
<p>any suggestions? 
thanks </p>

<p>You could use a <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#iter" rel="nofollow">two-argument <code>iter()</code> version</a>:</p>
<pre><code>lines = iter(f.readline, "")
</code></pre>
<p>If you need a list of lines:</p>
<pre><code>lines = list(lines)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>First draft:</p>
<pre><code>lines = []
with open(SINGLE_FILENAME) as f:
    while True:
        line = f.readline()
        if line:
            lines.append(line)
        else:
            break
</code></pre>
<p>I feel fairly certain there is a better way to do it, but that does avoid iterating with for, using read, or using readlines.</p>
<p>You could write a generator function to keep calling <code>readline()</code> until the file was empty, but that doesn't really seem like a large improvement here.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">note: <code>lines = f.readlines()</code> does the same (produces a list of lines). A lazy version: <code>lines = f</code> (file is an iterator over lines by itself). Where have you learned <code>lines = [i for i in f.readlines()]</code> (it doesn't make sense to use it)? I've seen such code several times and I'm interested what is the origin or the logic behind it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">+1 - That's very nice.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thanks that worked really well</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is, based on my experience, almost certainly what the professor wants; and coincidentally this situation is one of the best simple demonstrations you will find of the professor's incompetence.</span>
