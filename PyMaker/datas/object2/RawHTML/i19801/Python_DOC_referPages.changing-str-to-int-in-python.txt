<p>I am new to python. I am trying to make a small elavator program.</p>
<p>The code: </p>
<pre><code>import time
elavator = True
# 0 is B floor // basement
elavatorFloors = [0,1,2,3,4,5]

while elavator == True:
    getLevel = input ("Which floor would you like to visit? ( 1 - 5) ")
    time.sleep(2)
    print "you're now at floor, " +int.getLevel
</code></pre>
<p>I get this error: AttributeError: type object 'int' has no attribute 'getLevel'
Aside from changing the str to int, am I using any bad technique? I really want to improve my programming thinking and code writing. Thank you :)</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>int()</code> is a type, so to instantiate it, you need to do <code>int(getLevel)</code>, not <code>int.getLevel</code>.</p>
<p>Check <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int">the docs</a> for examples and more.</p>
<p>Also note that <code>getLevel</code> is an odd name for the variable, as it implies it is a function that gives the level. A better name would be just <code>level</code>.</p>
<p>It's also worth noting that <code>input()</code> evaluates the input as Python code (In Python 2.x, in 3.x it acts as <code>raw_input()</code> does in older versions), so <code>getLevel</code> will already be a number, although I would recommend using <code>raw_input()</code> instead, and keeping your conversion from a string to an integer, as it won't allow arbitrary execution of code, which is much better.</p>

<p>Here is the sample code modified:</p>
<pre><code>import time
elevator = "false"
# 0 is B floor // basement
elavatorFloors = [0,1,2,3,4,5]
getLevel = input("Which floor would you like to visit? ( 1 - 5) ")
for x in elavatorFloors:
    if x == getLevel:
        time.sleep(getLevel)
        print "you're now at floor, " + str(getLevel)
        elevator = "true"
        pass
    else:
        pass
if (elevator == "false"):
    print "There is no floor: " +  str(getLevel)
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Use <code>int(getLevel)</code>. And why are you not asking for level 0?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You're using <code>input</code>, so getLevel will already be an integer. That said, you should probably use <code>raw_input</code> and cast to an integer explicitly.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Xymostech While the OP is using 2.x, it's worth noting that what you said only applies to older versions of Python. In 3.x, <code>input()</code> does not evaluate the string.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you. it works, but more importantly I get it with your explanation. I have to practice to become fluent. I appreciate the advice also regarding level vs getLevel :)</span>
