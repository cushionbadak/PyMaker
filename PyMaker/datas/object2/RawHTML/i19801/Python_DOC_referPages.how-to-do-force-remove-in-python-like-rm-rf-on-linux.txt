<p>I want to remove some log files of my App server without shutting down my server. What command can I use to do this using Python, like <code>rm -rf</code> in Linux systems?</p>
<p>Please help.</p>

<p>Above function will delete any directory recursively...</p>

<p>shutil is your friend in this instance.</p>

<p>Is your server running Linux, or is that just an example?</p>
<p>On python, <code>shutil.rmtree()</code> is the equivalent to <code>rm -r</code> (as @Alex already answered). All python removal commands (<code>os.unlink(), os.rmdir()</code>) work without checks, so they're always equivalent to <code>rm -f</code>.</p>
<p>But if you're on Windows, the OS <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/os.html#os.remove" rel="nofollow noreferrer">will not let you</a> delete a file that's still open; you'll get an exception. AFAIK there's nothing an unprivileged process can do about it.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use the <code>subprocess</code> module:</p>
<pre><code>from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, STDOUT

cmd = 'rm -frv /path/to/dir'
p   = Popen(cmd, shell=True, stdin=PIPE, stdout=PIPE, stderr=STDOUT, close_fds=True)
out = p.stdout.read()
print out
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">HI i want to Delete log files using WLST</span>
<span class="comment-copy">HI thanks for the Reply but the problem is i want to delete the Weblogic log file by using WLST with Pythan.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This seems like it should work for directories, but it isn't equivalent to <code>rm -rf</code>: it errors out if you try to remove a single file. Also, it's best to use the well-tested code from Python's standard library when possible, rather than writing your own. See my four-line <code>rm -rf</code> function here: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/9559881/260491">stackoverflow.com/a/9559881/260491</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">you don't need to write your own.  Python's standard library already has shutil.rmtree() which recursively deletes</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Does anyone else see the irony in this smug response when the top result in the Google reference is this very question?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">While useful, <code>rmtree</code> isn't equivalent: it errors out if you try to remove a single file. See my answer here: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/9559881/260491">stackoverflow.com/a/9559881/260491</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">HI alexis,My server is running on the linux machine. The Problem is i dont have permission to log in as Weblogic user. So I used to log in as the user who don't have the permission to delete the Weblogic log File. I am Using WLST with Pythan. IS there a way to delete Files BY using WLST.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No idea what WLST or Weblogic is. To delete a file, you must be able to run <i>some</i> program under a process that has permission to delete it. If python's <code>os.unlink()</code> can't do it, there's nothing you can do in <i>any</i> programming language: The OS won't let you.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">I'm reviewing some code and the developer used subprocess rm vs unlink. They were using unlink at first and then switched to <code>subprocess.call(['rm', '-f', file_path])</code>. I'm just trying to understand why they would do that, and if there is an increase in performance?</span>
