<p>I'm new to Python and coming from a PHP background.. I'm impressed.  Is there a way of getting a list of numbers from this sequence:</p>
<pre><code>i^2, i^2 + i, i^2 + 2i, ..., n
</code></pre>
<p>i.e. if <code>i=2</code> and <code>n=30</code>:</p>
<p><code>4, 6, 8, ..., 30</code></p>
<p>Okay, this is a really simple sequence but is what's a more general way to do this sort of thing functionally?</p>
<p>Maybe there's some nice functional programming way of doing this?  In PHP I think I would make some function some variables and interaction but Python might be able to do it more elegantly?</p>
<p>Many thanks.</p>

<p>You can do this with <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#range" rel="noreferrer">range</a>:</p>
<pre><code>In [186]: i = 2; n = 30; range(i**2, n+1, i)
Out[186]: [4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30]
</code></pre>

<p>Python has a cool feature called <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0202/" rel="nofollow">List Comprehension</a>. You can use it to do something like this:</p>
<pre><code>[i*i+2*n for n in range(30) if (i*i+2*n)&lt;=30]
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">@BlaXpirit: In Python2 it returns a list. In Python3 it returns an iterator.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That's not exactly true. But anyway, you should specify that you're using an outdated version of Python.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@unutbu: it's not an iterator but a <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesseq" rel="nofollow noreferrer">dedicated sequence type</a>, it supports subscription, for example.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@BlaXpirit: is Python 2 outdated?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The Python 2 series has finished at version 2.7. There will be an extended period of maintenance, but no version 2.8. The future is the Python 3 series, currently at version 3.3.</span>
