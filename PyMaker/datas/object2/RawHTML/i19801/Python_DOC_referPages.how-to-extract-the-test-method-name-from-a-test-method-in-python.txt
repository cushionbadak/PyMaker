<p>I have various python unitttest methods packed as a TestSuite, and one particular test method looks like e.g.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;input.MyTest testMethod=test_simple&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>It looks like this is a class (the type of this thing is <code>input.MyTest</code>) but with an additional attribute(?) testMethod. </p>
<p>How can I extract the name <code>test_simple</code> from the attribute <code>testMethod</code> (or whatever this is)?</p>
<p>Test code (MyTest.py)</p>
<pre><code>class MyTest(unittest.TestCase):
   def test_simple(self):
       pass
</code></pre>
<p>Suite code</p>
<pre><code>from input import MyTest
suite = test.TestSuite()
suite.addTest(MyTest("test_simple"))
print suite._tests[0]
</code></pre>

<p>From a quick perusal of the documentation, you probably want to start with <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestCase.id" rel="nofollow"><code>test.id()</code></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>id()</p>
<p>Return a string identifying the specific test case. 
  This is usually the full name of the test method, including the module and
  class name.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Show your code, by not showing it, you are making this a lot less easy to answer.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm also wondering about that MyTest and MyClass stuff.  Please elaborate!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, that's it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Alex Next time, take a look though the documentation first, you'll probably solve your own issue.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This was much faster ;-)</span>
