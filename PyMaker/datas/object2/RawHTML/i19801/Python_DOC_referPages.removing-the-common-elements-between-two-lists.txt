<p>I want to remove the common elements between two lists. I mean something like this</p>
<hr/>
<pre><code>a=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
b=[2,4,1]
# I want the result to be like
res=[3,5,6,7,8]
</code></pre>
<hr/>
<p>Is there any simple pythonic way to do this ?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>use sets :</p>
<pre><code>res = list(set(a)^set(b))
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Set have a methods:
<a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#set" rel="nofollow">http://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#set</a></p>
<p>print(set(a).difference(b))</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">What have you got till now?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You should note that this loses ordering and any duplicates in either list. If OP doesn't mind that, though, it's the sexiest solution.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>list(set(a).difference(b))</code> make ordered list. What if i donot want ordered list and want same as list a, just removed common elements</span>
<span class="comment-copy">may be <code>x = [i for i in x if i not in y] </code> good choice.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This doesn't quite answer the OP as stated... but this DOES answer the question I was actually looking for, and is a useful answer. This returns only the elements of a that are not in b (OP asked for non-dupe elements in both a and b)</span>
