<p>I have allocated a memory using a function call, which returned the 64bit Physical Address.
I have mapped that address using a function call, which returned the 64bit Virtual Address.</p>
<p>Now, I need a pointer to access this memory for which I have the virtual address a long type value in Python, I tried using ctypes module pointer() casting but end up in accessing some unbelievable memory</p>
<p>I am accessing like this:</p>
<pre><code>VA = Virtual address I got
VA = ctypes.c_uint64(VA)
pVA = pointer(VA)

for i in range(size):
    print pVA[i]
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The code below builds an unsigned 64-bit integer array of <em>size</em> elements from a specified address:</p>
<pre><code>arr = (ctypes.c_uint64*size).from_address(VA)
for i in arr:
    print i
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">I wish I could get a peek at that <i>unbelievable</i> memory! :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Could you give a sample of code??</span>
<span class="comment-copy">How are you allocating this memory? Are you saying you want to access it as an array of uint64s?</span>
