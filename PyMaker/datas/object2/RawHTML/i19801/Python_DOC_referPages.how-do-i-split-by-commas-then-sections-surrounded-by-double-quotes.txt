<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have a file "data.txt" with lines such as</p>
<pre><code>4, "124 Sesame, Street Lane", Chicago, IL
5, 2342 Main Street, Denver, CO
6, 124 Some Street, Los Angelos, CA
</code></pre>
<p>I have a python script that reads this file line by line and splits it up into a tuple of data in the form <code>(id, street address, city, state)</code>. The script splits each line up by commas:</p>
<pre><code>line = file.readline()
line_tuple = line.split(',')
</code></pre>
<p>This method clearly breaks down because I have some lines that have chunks of text surrounded by double quotes that I want to consider as a whole entity in the tuple as opposed to two distinct pieces of data.</p>
<p>How do I tell python to treat blocks of double quotes a single entity when splitting by commas?</p>
<p>I have tried splitting by quotes first and then commas and vice versa, but these methods don't seem to get at what I am trying to do.</p>

<p>That is called a "comma separated values" or short "csv". Python has a library for reading it.</p>
