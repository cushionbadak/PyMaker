<p>I use the brown corpus "brown.words()" which gives me a list of 1161192 words.</p>
<p>Now I want to find any occurrence of the word "have", so whenever in the corpus there is an "has", "had", "haven't" ect. I want to do something (could be pushing them into an array, could be a counter, could be something else.</p>
<p><strong>Edit</strong>: Note that this question is about <strong>finding a matching word</strong>. If I <strong>search "have" I want a way to match it to "haven't" or "had", thus the .count() would not solve this problem</strong> as it dosen't help matching anything.</p>
<p>Example code I would use in case stemming/lemmatization would work:</p>
<pre><code>def findWordFamily(findWord):
    wordFamily = []

    lmtzr = WordNetLemmatizer()

    findWord = lmtzr.lemmatize(findWord)
    for word in brown.words():
        lemma = lmtzr.lemmatize(word)
        if lemma == findWord:
            wordFamily.append(word)

    return wordFamily
print(findWordFamily("have"))
# ["have", "have", "had", "having","haven't", "having"]
</code></pre>
<p>But the problem is that: </p>
<pre><code>for word in brown.words():
    lemma = lmtzr.lemmatize(word)
    # if word is "having" lemma also is "having" instead of "have"
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Before trying to match the words, you might want to do a little of pre-processing. So "has" or "haven't" end up "transformed" to "have". </p>
<p>I recommend you take a look at both stemming or lemmatizing: </p>
<p>NLTK's Wordnet Lemmatizer (one of my favorites): <a href="http://www.nltk.org/_modules/nltk/stem/wordnet.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.nltk.org/_modules/nltk/stem/wordnet.html</a></p>
<p>NLTK's stemmers: <a href="http://www.nltk.org/howto/stem.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.nltk.org/howto/stem.html</a></p>
<p>Note: for the lemmatizer to work well with verbs, you have to specify that they are in fact verbs. </p>
<pre><code>nltk.stem.WordNetLemmatizer().lemmatize('having', 'v')
</code></pre>
<p>Hope this helps! </p>

<span class="comment-copy">did you even bother to read the question? .count() is useless because I don't want to count it, I want a way of matching it</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hi @MichaelBaumgarn what have you tried so far?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I updated the question</span>
