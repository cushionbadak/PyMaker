<p>What does a "\" in a string mean?</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; "\033"
</code></pre>
<p>The output is:</p>
<pre><code>'\x1b'
</code></pre>
<p>If you try to print the string, the result is an odd-looking square</p>
<p>Most weridly, if you enter this into your shell:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; "\033" == "\x1b"
</code></pre>
<p>The output is:</p>
<pre><code>True
</code></pre>
<p>Obviously, Python thinks of the "\" as a special character, but how does it work?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>It is a character represented by the octal number <code>033</code>.<br/>
In decimal, that number is <code>27</code>.<br/>
In hex, that number is <code>0x1b</code>.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>It's most likely that your platform uses ASCII encoding. In ASCII encoding, the number 27 represents the <code>ESC</code> character. It is not a printable character. Your terminal prints a small square for it. Other terminals are likely to print a different symbol for it.</p>

<p>That is a string escape.  They have quite a few uses, and they are detailed <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#string-and-bytes-literals" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>.  In particular you are seeing Octal and Hexadecimal representation of byte values.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>\ooo  Character with octal value ooo  (1,3)</p>
<p>\xhh  Character with hex value hh (2,3)</p>

<pre><code>\033

<p>is the octal code for <kbd>esc</kbd> and </p>

<p>Check <code>man ascii</code></p>

<p>The backslash is an escape character. For example, if you want to print a string with quotes in it, you would need to escape the quotes inside the string so that they don't end the string. </p>
<p>for example:  </p>
<pre><code>print('the \'single quotes\' in this string are escaped!')
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">A string in source code is called a literal string (or string literal). If it was in a string value, it would just be data.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">But if you print it, you get a small square. Any explanations?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">the explanation is that the value does not represent a printable character</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ohh... if you enter "\400" into the shell, you get an 'A' with a line on it. Does that mean it's a printable character? I googled for the Unicode number of the werid "A". The code for it is "0100", or in Python, "\u0100". Are these two numbers somehow related?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ohh... I see. Thanks for your help</span>
