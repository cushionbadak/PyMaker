<p>I have been trying to get pip with python3 on WSL ubuntu 16.04 and have had no success. I have been running <code>sudo apt install --reinstall python3-pip</code>, but still have issues getting pip to work properly.</p>
<pre><code>$ pip3
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/bin/pip3", line 9, in &lt;module&gt;
    from pip import main
  File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/pip/__init__.py", line 14, in

&lt;module&gt;
from distutils import sysconfig
ImportError: No module named 'distutils'
</code></pre>
<p>Similar with <code>sudo</code></p>
<pre><code>$ sudo pip3

    from distutils import sysconfig
ImportError: No module named 'distutils'
</code></pre>
<p>Also I noticed that I seem to have two versions of python3 installed:</p>
<pre><code>$ ls /usr/lib | grep python
python2.7
python3
python3.5
</code></pre>

<p>According to Python 3 documentation, distutils apparently is not deprecated, BUT, my install of 2.7 has disutils, but 3.6 does not.
When I read:
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/installing/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/installing/</a>
It seemed to say that distutils was being deprecated, but it was not worded clearly if they were talking about distutils or something else.</p>
<p>If anyone knows the definitive answer, please let us know.</p>

<p>So after a lot of pain, I finally gave in. I had made things worse and corrupted my entire python3 installation. I had corrupted too many files trying to fix everything. I ended up uninstalling WSL/ubuntu and reinstalling clean. I made of backup a few things first.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this seems to be the best option if you have really messed this up, like I did. Being more careful now, python3 is working just fine, with pip. Make sure you follow official docs when you install.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You can always use <code>python3 -m pip</code> or <code>python3.5 -m pip</code>, where <code>-m</code> means "use module". It's great when you have multiple Python versions installed, in fact, I never use the naked <code>pip</code> or <code>pip3</code> commands anymore. It lets you specify the exact interpeter you want. If that interpreter does not have <code>distuils</code>, you may be in more trouble,  but typically this fixes the issues right up.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">you could try <code>sudo apt-get install python-distutils</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">It's the same version of python3 check python3 --version and python3.5 --version</span>
