<p>I have a form in an HTML page that reads input from a user (string x), and I have my python script that uses this variable.</p>
<p>What is the easiest way to fetch this variable from the HTML page by the python script (.py) and return the result - which should also be a string -  to show it in the HTML page again?</p>

<p>You can use either a modern WSGI environment like <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Flask</a> or <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Django</a>, or if the utility is very small, you can take a look at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/cgi.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Common Gateway Interface (CGI)</a>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, CGI is what I'm looking for, I try to use Django before but a lot of time needed to fix installation issues while I need it for a small utility.</span>
