<p>I am making a 'Hangman' game and would like to have python select a random word from a website. But it keeps printing as <code>b'word'</code>  and would like to know how to fix this so that it is just word.</p>
<p>My code:</p>
<pre><code>import random
import urllib.request
with urllib.request.urlopen('https://svnweb.freebsd.org/csrg/share/dict/words?view=co&amp;content-type=text/plain') as response:
   html = response.read()

word_list = html.split()
word_chocie = random.choice(word_list)
word = word_chocie.strip("b")
print(word)
</code></pre>
<p>I keep getting this error and not sure how to fix it:</p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "H:/hangman.py", line 23, in &lt;module&gt;
    word = word_chocie.strip("b")
TypeError: a bytes-like object is required, not 'str'
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>A correct version of you code - the problem was that you were having a <code>bytes</code> object instead of the <code>str</code> you probably expected.<br/>
I added a <code>.decode('utf-8')</code> to the content read from the website, and now the html is an <code>str</code> object.<br/>
You recieved the error because you were working on a <code>bytes</code> object (the <code>word_chocie</code>), as <code>str</code>.<br/></p>
<p>Note that the <code>b</code> prefix you had in <code>word_chocie</code> (<code>b'hello'</code>) is python's mark that this object is of type <code>bytes</code>.</p>
<pre><code>import random
import urllib.request
with urllib.request.urlopen('https://svnweb.freebsd.org/csrg/share/dict/words?view=co&amp;content-type=text/plain') as response:
    html = response.read().decode('utf-8')

word_list = html.split()
word_chocie = random.choice(word_list)
print(word_chocie)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Have changed now. Thanks for letting me know :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It looks better now. You need to wait that people with enough reputation will review your edit in order to re-open the question for accepting answers.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Instead of <code>html = response.read()</code>, do <code>html = response.read().decode('utf-8')</code>. You do not need to remove <code>'b'</code>, it is not actually part of the string.
