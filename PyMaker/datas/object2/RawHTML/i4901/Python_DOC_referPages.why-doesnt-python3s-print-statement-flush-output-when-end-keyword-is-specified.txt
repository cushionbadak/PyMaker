<p>When I specified end and sleep, I noticed that output wasn't flushed until next  print where it was by default flushed.    </p>
<p>Why does this happen? I had to manually flush the output.</p>

<p>In fact this is the default behavior of the underlying <code>stdio</code> functions. </p>
<p>When the output is to console, the stream will be automatically flushed when a newline is encountered, but not other characters.</p>
<p>If the output is not a console, then even newline won't trigger a flush. </p>
<p>If you want to make sure about flush, you can tell the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>print()</code></a> explicitly:</p>
<pre><code>print("Rewinding.......",end = '',flush=True)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">"When the output is to console, the stream will be automatically flushed when a newline is encountered, but not other characters."  This I didn't know. Is this behaviour Python specific or any programming language specific.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I mean to say <code>std::endl</code> also flushes output but '\n' doesn't in C++ which I know. Does it mean it's the feature of the software/feature [The underlying system] which is on the receiving end of stdout?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is the feature of C language <code>stdio.h</code> functions. Whether it is a console is checked by <code>unistd.h</code> function <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/isatty.3.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>isatty(3)</code></a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, language/library specific.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">They use <code>stdio</code> you can read their source code. But those are indeed implementation details, not documented. The only way to know details at this level is to read the source code. Of course Python can add some additional stuff, you can't simply assume they are <i>exactly</i> the same.</span>
