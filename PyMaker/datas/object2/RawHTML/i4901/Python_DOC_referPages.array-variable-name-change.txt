<p>I want to have a variable number of variables with the variables equal to an array of numbers. I know similar questions have been asked but none provided the answer I was seeking.I have tried having the variables top and bottom either tuples or numpy arrays but neither worked. I don't care what the type of numbers are because I can convert them later, I just need the variable names changed with each iteration.</p>
<pre><code>i=[0] 
for x in i:
     top= (1,1,1)
     bottom= (1,1)

     top[i]=top
     bottom[i]=bottom
     i.append(x+1)          
</code></pre>
<p>Thanks for the help. </p>
<p>EDIT: Here is an example that probably better explains what I'm trying to do.</p>
<pre><code>for x in range(1,4):
       top = (1,1,1)
       bottom = (1,1)

       if x == 1:
             top1 = top
             bottom1 = bottom
       if x == 2:
             top2 = top
             bottom2 = bottom
       if x == 3:
             top3 = top
             bottom3 = bottom
</code></pre>
<p>In the bottom code I'm creating a new variable with each iteration, but I'm only doing it for a set amount of iterations. How can I do it for an infinite amount of iterations?   </p>

<p>For the first example you provided, its behavior will most likely not be what you expected because you modify the list <code>i</code> while <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/6260097">simultaneously iterating across it</a>.</p>
<p>As for your second example, what you're asking is <strong>not advisable</strong> and almost certainly not what you actually want to do. See <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/5036700/">this question</a> and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/8028708/">this other one</a> for more information.</p>
<p>Finally, I doubt this is actually the best approach for solving your problem, but you can accomplish (approximately) what you were trying to do in your question using a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries" rel="nofollow noreferrer">dictionary</a>.</p>
<pre><code>d = {}
v1 = (1,1,1)
v2 = (1,1)

for x in range(4):
    key1 = 'top' + str(x)
    d[key1] = v1
    key2 = 'bottom' + str(x)
    d[key2] = v2
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">You are using tuples, and not list. Try with [1,1,1]. Do you realize you are trying to make a recursive list?  BTW what is the question?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Indexing a list with a list isn't going to work either.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@GiacomoCatenazzi  I tried [1,1,1] and I got " TypeError: list indices must be integers or slices, not lists " . The question is how do I assign top to top1, top2, top3 as the iterations go by. The same for bottom.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">"I want to have a variable number of variables" What are you asking here? "I have tried having the variables top and bottom ..." And what is this even supposed to mean? I can't understand your question as written.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I know that the value of top and bottom do not change, so top1 is going to equal to top2 , top3 and so on. But I still want to learn how to name change through iteration.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for your answers and effort. I thought it was more elegant to have an infinite loop with an eventual break, but it seems the non-infinite method is safer and easier to handle. Thanks again.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@faiz that depends entirely on what condition you'd like to break on. What did you have in mind?</span>
