<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I'm trying to pass parameters between python scripts where one is a GUI collecting information for a login screen and the other is the database adding and searching for the information.</p>
<p><img alt="Code without Syntax error" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gxKoh.png"/></p>
<p>then in the database code I have:
<img alt="Database code" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZWHCF.png"/></p>
<p>and when i add the parameters into the function this happens:
<img alt="Syntax Error?" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VfNKO.png"/></p>
<p>i'm not sure how else I'm supposed to call this function.</p>
<p>Any ideas thanks.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You only need to import the function, then you can call the function.</p>
<pre><code>from Database import DBRegister
</code></pre>
<p>Then you can call the function as normal.</p>
<pre><code>DBRegister(username, FirstName, Surname, EmployeeNumber, password)
</code></pre>
<p>or assign it to a variable:</p>
<pre><code>dbregister = DBRegister(username, FirstName, Surname, EmployeeNumber, password)
</code></pre>
<p>It is also standard practice to include imports at the top of the file but it is not necessary..  It just stops imports getting lost inside the codebase.</p>
<p>UPDATE:</p>
<p>If you also need the cursor to insert data into the database then you will need to either import the whole file:</p>
<p>Note: This will run any functions that are executed in the file.</p>
<pre><code>import Database
</code></pre>
<p>or you will have to create a new cursor inside the file you are importing into..</p>
<p>Please have a read of the python documentation on importing..</p>

<span class="comment-copy">just import DBRegister</span>
<span class="comment-copy">please can you copy and paste the code into your answer. pictures really really dont help..</span>
<span class="comment-copy">But because of the function parameters being within a function already, when i call the function in the second script it runs but no data is inputted into the database?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I have updated my answer..</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you, managed to get it to work using your information and that of the python documentation.</span>
