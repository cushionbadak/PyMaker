<p>I want to convert a string to a Python statement.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Taking string input from a text file e.g. <code>'dataframe['Column_name'].sum()'</code></p></li>
<li><p>Executing the string as a Python statement e.g. <code>dataframe['Column_name'].sum()</code></p></li>
<li><p>Storing the result in some variable </p></li>

<p>It's possible to do this, but not recommended. You do not have any control over what the string contains if it comes from the user. There is probably a better way to achieve what you <em>really</em> want.</p>
<p>If you really, absolutely, unavoidably have to, you can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#eval" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>eval</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>x = eval('dataframe["Column_name"].sum()')
</code></pre>
<p>But it is probably easier to only take, for example, the column name from the user and use that in a function call:</p>
<pre><code>column_name = "Column_name"  # or read it from the file
x = dataframe[column_name].sum()
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>#previous code
with open("file.txt","r") as f:
    x = eval(f.readline())
    #the rest of the code, using x however you want
</code></pre>
<p>I wouldn't do it if other users are supposed to be able to use the script however they want. If this is for learning purposes of for your own use, it's up to you.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">What are you actually trying to <i>achieve</i>? Where do those strings come from? Do you really need to store the whole statement?</span>
