<p>I need to create a virtual file in memory to trick the system and to let it think that it exists.</p>
<p>I have some scientific program and I heed to provide in some function file for output as argument.</p>
<p>I want to create some file in memory and provide this file to this function.</p>
<p>I do not want to use some temp folders and so on.
How do you think, is it possible to create this trick?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>io</code></a> library can create in-memory file like objects that act like file handles opened with the typical <code>f = open(filename, mode)</code>. If you would have opened in normal text mode, a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#text-i-o" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>StringIO</code></a> should do the trick, or if you would have opened the file in binary mode, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#binary-i-o" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>BytesIO</code></a> is the way to go.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Also <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/tempfile.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">tempfile</a> library provides (as it's name suggests) a temporary file-like object.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">unfortunately that does not help. I already tried this before opening a question. It returns empty string. Also for test I tried output.write('test') and getvalue() returned me a result. But when I provide output as an argument to this function outpus is still empty.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@BeliaevMaksim what is this function you need to provide a file for? Given the description in your comment, you must have a problem elsewhere then.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Aaron, I need to provide a file with path as argument.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@BeliaevMaksim then the function itself is taking care of opening the file and writing to it. You either need to edit the function itself, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAM_drive" rel="nofollow noreferrer">mount a section of system ram</a> as a logical volume to create the file on.</span>
