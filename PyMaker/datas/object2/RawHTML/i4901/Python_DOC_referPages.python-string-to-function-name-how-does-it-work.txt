<span class="comment-copy">It's not a function name, it's an object property.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">There are multiple ways to do this.  Are you asking about pandas in particular?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Barmar what makes you think it's a property?  Properties are implemented with descriptors: if it were a property, then <code>DataFrame.name</code> would resolve.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@wim My point was that it's used like a property, not a function, it's not <code>df.name()</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ah, then the correct term to use would be "attribute" in this context.  Properties have a specific meaning.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, wim. You mentioned in comments that there are multiple ways of doing it. What are the other ways to do it? I am asking for any python class and not specific to pandas.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">There is also <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__getattribute__" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>__getattribute__</code></a>, which has first dibs but can be tricky to implement correctly.  However, the much more common and popular way to "own the dot" in attribute access is by using descriptors.  Read up on the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/descriptor.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">descriptor protocol</a> in the docs.</span>
