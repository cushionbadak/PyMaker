<p>I'm working on a dungeon styled game, and I made a file called places.py to store the places. I am using a class, then adding attributes to the class. I received an error, and here is the error message:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>E0001:invalid syntax (, line 8)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here would be my code for places.py:</p>
<pre><code>class place(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self.name=''
        self.nearplaces=[]
        self.ground=[]
        self.monsters=[]
1 = place
1.name='Ruby City'
1.nearplaces=[2,3]
1.ground=[1]
1.monsters=[]
</code></pre>
<p>It is confusing how, after declaration, I receive an error when trying to change the attributes. This may be a very simple question, but I wish to know why it does not work, and how to make it work. Thank you.</p>

<p>Firstly you cannot use integer literals, like <code>1</code>, as variable names. This is to avoid ambiguity, so the interpreter knows whether it is looking at a variable or a number (see <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#identifiers" rel="nofollow noreferrer">rules for Python identifiers</a>).</p>
<p>Secondly, to properly instantiate your class you need to use <code>()</code>.</p>
<p>Try:</p>
<pre><code>level_1 = place()
level_1.name='Ruby City'
level_1.nearplaces=[2,3]
level_1.ground=[1]
level_1.monsters=[]
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Variable names cannot begin with an integer. Apart from that you are not creating an instance, you assign the class.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">They cannot? Why can't they? Can you please give me a link?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">They just... can't (@Phydeaux's answer below links the documentation stating that they can't.). This is intuitive if you consider how a parser actually works - consider the example print(3e2). Is that trying to print the number 30.0 or the variable <code>3e2</code>?</span>
