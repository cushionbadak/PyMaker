<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I was wondering, if I want to listen to each socket that wants to join,
what do I need to write inside the 
sock.listen(?) 
What number goes there and tells python "I want to listen to everyone" and not to a limited number of sockets.
I thought about just putting a large number, but I feel it's not the right answer.</p>
<p>Thanks for the helpers!!</p>

<p>See <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/2444483/364696">this answer</a> where John la Rooy says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The doc say this</p>
<blockquote>
<p>socket.listen(backlog) Listen for connections made to the socket. The
    backlog argument specifies the maximum number of queued connections
    and should be at least 1; the maximum value is system-dependent
    (usually 5).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Obviously the system value is more than 5 on your system. I don't see
  why setting it to a larger number would be a problem. Perhaps some
  memory is reserved for each queued connection.</p>
<p>My linux man page has this to say</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the backlog argument is greater than the value in
    /proc/sys/net/core/somaxconn, then it is silently truncated to that
    value; the default value in this file is 128. In kernels before
    2.4.25, this limit was a hard coded value, SOMAXCONN, with the value 128.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">But I'm working on a project and I need to listen to whoever connects, if I put just 5, I will only be able to listen to maximum 5 people. (Or I'm getting this totally wrong)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The socket is not concurrent. You can handle one request at a time, and the number you place inside socket.listen() is the backlog. The backlog is essentially a queue of unaccepted connections to respond to. If a request arrives once this queue is full it will be declined.
