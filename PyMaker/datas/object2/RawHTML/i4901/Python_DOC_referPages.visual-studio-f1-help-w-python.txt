<p>Coming from a C++ background, I often made good use of Visual Studio's F1 help functionality to instantly take me to a help page of a function for examples or more explanation. This saved me from having to google the function. Are there similar help pages for Python, as I am just starting to learn it. If nothing official, is there a extension that could serve the same purpose of easily getting help information from the press of one button(s)?</p>
<p>I am running Visual Studio 2017.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>No. <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/python/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Visual Studio doesn't ship with Python documentation</a>, and you cannot rebind <kbd>F1</kbd> to do arbitrary things.</p>
<p>Instead, you can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the online documentation</a>, or <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/download.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">download it</a> in PDF, HTML or CHM form then open it when you need it.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Type "Python documentation" into Google. It's all there.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I guess my problem is then that its not completely obvious how to link that documentation available on that website into Visual Studio's f1 button</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You don't need to link it into Visual Studio's F1 button. It's a trivial alteration to your workflow. Sorry, not seeing any actual "problem" here.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I am not here to discuss whether or not you think pushing one button vs having to alt tab, search and click is trivial to my workflow or not. I am wondering how to link the documentation into a one button press within visual studio. Thanks</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Then, with those constraints, I'm afraid there is only one possible answer.</span>
