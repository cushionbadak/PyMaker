<p>I am writing a test console program-phonebook with Python. My IDE is JetBrains PyCharm. I have 5 functions - Search contact, Enter contact, Delete contact, All phones and Exit. My question is how can I make the program to save information in text file and when I compile it, the information will be saved in this text file ? </p>

<p>You could write the data to a csv file. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html</a></p>

<p>This should help : <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/inputoutput.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/inputoutput.html</a></p>
<p>I think for your case the easiest would be to write data to a <strong><em>python file</em></strong> as follows:</p>
<pre><code>with open('PathToAFile/MyFile.py', 'w') as f:
    f.write('contact_names =[' + contact_name1 + ',' + contact_name2... + ']\n')
</code></pre>
<p>This will make it extremely easy to load data later without having to parse (as in a csv).</p>
<p>In the example code i provide, im saving your contact names to a list called 'contact_names' in a python file named 'MyFile.py'. When you execute 'MyFile.py
 you will have access to the 'contact_names' variable</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Is this homework? And where is your code?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I would google something like "file input/output in python tutorial"</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, something like that</span>
