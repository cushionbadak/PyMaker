<p>I'm basically trying to run '(./format3 | attackString) | grep searchString' in my python script,
but i can't access the pipe of the format3 process (baby in the code), since it's closed after the communicate call.</p>
<p>And i need the communciate call to supply my attackString to the binary.
I know i could write the stdout of baby into a file and then use that file as stdin for grep, but I feel like there has to be another way to solve this.</p>

<p>Consider using <code>sh</code> library as it addresses piping issues with function composition:

<p>It is a very neat library that seems to solely solve you problem.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for the tip! This looks promising, but I can't find a way to pipe a string into my binary.</span>

It could have looked this way: <code>subprocess.getoutput('echo "Attack" | python format3 | grep "searchPattern"')</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">That totally does the trick, thanks so much!</span>
