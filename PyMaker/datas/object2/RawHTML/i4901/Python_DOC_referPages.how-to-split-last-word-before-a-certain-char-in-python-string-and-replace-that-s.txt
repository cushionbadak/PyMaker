<p>I am currently trying to repeatedly replace a word in a line but there are two current issues with my code. I can successfully locate the lines I want to replace, but with my current code i fail to 1. store the specific value in the strings that i want and then replace the word on that same line.</p>
<p>The text I want to replace appears to two times and looks like this in the textfile:</p>
<pre><code>One_Number_ = "0"
if [ One_Number_ == "0" ]
</code></pre>
<p>I wish to change "One" here to something else each time I run the program. What I've tried to do is the following:</p>
<pre><code>with open(os.path.join('file.txt'), 'r') as file:
lines = file.readlines()


with open(os.path.join('file.txt'), 'w') as file:
    for line in lines:
        if (line.__contains__('_Number_')):

            replaceline = line.rsplit('_', 1)[0]
            line.replace (replaceline, "NewWord")
        file.write(line)
</code></pre>
<p>The if-statement runs but the line does not replace "One". </p>
<p>The strings also do not get separated correctly meaning that <code>replaceline</code>does not contain just the "One".</p>
<p>How can I adjust my code so it successfully locates the two lines in the textfile that needs to replaced with the new string ("NewWord", as I have just used as an example just now)?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You will need to do the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.replace" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>.replace()</code></a> like:</p>
<pre><code>line = line.replace (replaceline, "NewWord")
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>replace</code> method returns a new string is does not modify the existing string.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Alright! 1/2 things works now. Now its just the part where the string does not store "One" correctly.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I am not sure I understand this comment.  You have more than one question here, and you expect them all to be answered?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">well 2 different ones but they kinda belong together. also they r small things so i included both</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@CarlosRodrigez, You are trying to find <code>One</code>?  Why are you splitting on the <code>_</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Because i want to use it repeatadly, so the new value ("NewValue") will always change each time</span>
