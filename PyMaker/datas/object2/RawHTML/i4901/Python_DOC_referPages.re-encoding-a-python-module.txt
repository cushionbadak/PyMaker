<p>I have a file <code>english.py</code> which was created by reformatting the information <a href="http://norvig.com/ngrams/count_2w.txt" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a> so the it is represented as a Python dictionary named <code>bigrams</code>. </p>
<p>When I go to import the module using:</p>
<pre><code>from english import bigrams
</code></pre>
<p>I get the following error:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0xe9 in position 5436: invalid continuation byte</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would like to avoid removing as much information as possible, but with that in mind what can I do to <code>english.py</code> so that it can be imported?</p>

<p>You probably chose a non-UTF-8 encoding for the .txt file (and the resulting .py file). A decent text editor can re-encode the file to UTF-8. Or you can prepend a line to the  file specifying the actual encoding:</p>
<pre><code># -*- coding: XXX -*-
</code></pre>
<p>where <code>XXX</code> is replaced by <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/codecs.html#standard-encodings" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the encoding's name</a>. My guess is that <code>cp1252</code> might work (which is the standard Windows encoding where <code>Ã©</code> is represented by <code>0xe9</code>).</p>
