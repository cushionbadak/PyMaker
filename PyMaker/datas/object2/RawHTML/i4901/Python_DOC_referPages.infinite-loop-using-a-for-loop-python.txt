<p>So I'm trying to make a infinite loop that uses a for loop instead of a while loop. This is my current code. If this code works it should produce x infinitely.
Current code:</p>
<pre><code>z=1
for x in range(0,z):
    print(x)
    z=z+1
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>That doesn't work because the first time you enter the for loop the <code>range</code> function generates a range from zero to the value of <code>z</code> at that point, and later changes to <code>z</code> does not affect it. You can do something like what you want using, for example, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.count" rel="noreferrer"><code>itertools.count</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>from itertools import count

for x in count():
    print(x)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>range</code> returns an iterator. The iterator is already generated and evaluated before the loop iteration. (It's the returned iterator on which the loop is iterating). </p>
<p>The value of <code>z</code> is not used after the iterator is returned hence incrementing or changing its value is no-op. </p>
<p>If you really want an infinite loop using <code>for</code> you will have to write your custom generator.</p>
<p>For eg: </p>
<pre><code>def InfiniteLoop():
   yield  1
</code></pre>
<p>To be used as :</p>
<p><code>for i in InfiniteLoop()</code></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Update list after each iteration make infinite loop</p>
<pre><code>list=[0] 
for x in list:
    list.append(x+1)
    print (x)
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">And <i>does</i> it "produce x infinitely"? You <i>did</i> try it?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Is there any question ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for telling us that you are trying to make an infinite loop.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You can use any of the infinite Iterators in 'itertools'. More here: <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/itertools.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/2/library/itertools.html</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes I have tested it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I upvoted, but I also invite you to elaborate a little more. I think that some explaination may help the OP to understand the concept behind your solution, and why its use of range is not working.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Even though this works as intended, it is generally considered bad practice to add/remove elements to/from an array you are iterating over.</span>
