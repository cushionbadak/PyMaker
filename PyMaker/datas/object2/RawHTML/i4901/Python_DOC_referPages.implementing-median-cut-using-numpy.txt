<p>So I'm trying to implement a basic median cut algorithm in python using python and numpy so far i got some simple code to calculate which medians i need to calculate </p>
<pre><code>img = ...
per = [100.0/(cuts+2)*i for i in range(1,cuts+1)]
med = np.percentile(img,per)
</code></pre>
<p>however I now want to convert the image to values between 0 and <code>cuts</code> where 0 is the would represent the lowest median and <code>cuts-1</code> the highest.</p>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p><code>img</code> is a grayscale image represented as a matrix</p>

<p>at the risk of sounding like a smartass ... you have looked at?:
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html</a></p>
<p>I would assume you can load the image as a data-grid (pandas) or an array with numpy.  And then pass the iterable into a desired stat function ...</p>
