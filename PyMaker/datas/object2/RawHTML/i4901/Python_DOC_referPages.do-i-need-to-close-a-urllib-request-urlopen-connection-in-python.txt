<p>I'm working with the <code>urllib.request</code> module in Python 3.</p>
<p>My question is:</p>
<p>Do we need to close the connection if I open it using  <code>urllib.request.ulropen</code>?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>From looking at the documentation for <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.request.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">urllib.request.urlopen</a></p>
<p>It states that </p>
<blockquote>
<p>urllib.request module uses HTTP/1.1 and includes Connection:close
  header in its HTTP requests.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and when we check this against Request for Comments for the HTTP protocol:</p>
<p><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-14.10" rel="nofollow noreferrer">From RFC 2616, Section 14.10</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>HTTP/1.1 defines the "close" connection option for the sender to
  signal that the connection will be closed after completion of the
  response. For example,</p>
<p><code>Connection: close</code> </p>
<p>in either the request or the response header
  fields indicates that the connection SHOULD NOT be considered
  `persistent' (section 8.1) after the current request/response is
  complete.</p>
<p>HTTP/1.1 applications that do not support persistent connections MUST
  include the "close" connection option in every message.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So you don't need to close the connection. The connection is closed as soon as you receive your response</p>
