<p>so earlier I am learning c/c++ and use for loops intensively</p>
<pre><code>for ( init; condition; increment ) {
   statement(s);
}
</code></pre>
<p>but now I am learning python and I came across python implementation of
for loop which is</p>
<pre><code>for num in range(5):
 print(num)
</code></pre>
<p>My question is how for loop works in python</p>
<p>1.) Where is initialization?</p>
<p>2.) Where is testing conditions?</p>
<p>3.) Where is the increment?</p>
<p>or else python does not work like c/c++ please explain how the for loop works
in python</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I think you need to understand that <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-range" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>range</code></a> is not part of the for loop but is an immutable sequence type. </p>
<p>Range definition:</p>
<pre><code>range(start, stop[, step])
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>start</strong> The value of the start parameter (or 0 if the parameter was not
  supplied)</p>
<p><strong>stop</strong> The value of the stop parameter</p>
<p><strong>step</strong> The value of the step parameter (or 1 if the parameter was not
  supplied)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pythonâ€™s for statement iterates over the items of any sequence and hence since <code>range</code> is immutable sequence type what you supply to the for loop is actually a sequence of numbers.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; range(5)
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]

&gt;&gt;&gt; range(3, 7)
[3, 4, 5, 6]

&gt;&gt;&gt; range(5, 0, -1)
[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
</code></pre>
<p>So <code>range</code> creates a list of numbers that then the for loop is using to loop over.</p>
<p>You could also have:</p>
<pre><code>for i in [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]:
    pass
</code></pre>
<p>and you have the same result.</p>
<p>Now how the for iterates over the sequence is another question. In short, it uses iterators to do this. Your best friend is to read the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs</a> of the language you are learning. </p>
<p>Have a look <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesseq-range" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a> as well there are some more examples.</p>
