<p>Basically, I need to check the type of data of which a variable is storing before replacing the data stored in the variable with the new data. For example, how to check if the variable is storing a string data or an integer data?</p>
<p>Source Code:</p>
<pre><code>class Toy:

    #Toy Class Constructor
    def __init__(self):
        Name = "Train Engine";
        ID = "TE11";
        Price = 0.99;
        Minimum_Age = 4;

    #Return Name
    def Return_Name(self):
        print(Name)
        return Name

    #Set Name
    def Set_Name(self, Variable):
        #This is where I would need to check the type of data that the variable 'Variable' is currently storing.
        Name = Variable

    #Return ID
    def Return_ID(self):
        print(ID)
        return ID

    #Set ID
    def Set_ID(self, Variable):
        #This is where I would need to check the type of data that the variable 'Variable' is currently storing.
        ID = Variable

    #Return Price
    def Return_Price(self):
        print(Price)
        return Price

    #Set Price
    def Set_Price(self, Variable):
        #This is where I would need to check the type of data that the variable 'Variable' is currently storing.
        Price = Variable

    #Return Minimum_Age
    def print_Minimum_Age(self):
        print(Minimum_Age)
        return Minimum_Age

    #Set Minimum_Age
    def Set_Minimum_Age(self, Variable):
        #This is where I would need to check the type of data that the variable 'Variable' is currently storing.
        Minimum_Age = Variable
</code></pre>
<p>So basically, how should I, or are there any conventional way to check the type of data that the variable is storing?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Proper way to do this is <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#isinstance" rel="noreferrer"><code>isinstance</code></a></p>
<pre><code>if isinstance(variable, MyClass)
</code></pre>
<p>But think twice if you actually need this. Python uses duck-typing, so explicit checks for types is not always a good idea. If you still want to do so, consider using some <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.abc.html#module-collections.abc" rel="noreferrer">abstract base</a> or minimal valuable type for your checks.</p>
<p>As other people suggesting, just getting type of your variable can be done by <code>type(variable)</code>, but in most cases its better to use <code>isinstance</code>, because this will make your code polymorphic - you'll automatically support instances of subclasses of target type.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you really want the type of a variable, and don't want to support inheriting, use the built-in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#type" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>type</code></a> function:</p>
<pre><code>if type(variable) is MyClass:
    ...
</code></pre>
<p>I agree with <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/2161778/slam">@Slam</a>, that you should use this responsibly.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>type(variable_name)</code> returns the type of the variable</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>type(variable)</code></p>
<p>This command will return the type of the data stored by the variable.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">You can use <code>type</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>type(variable_name)</code> use it</span>

<span class="comment-copy">The only times where isinstance() is necessary is when checking inheritance of a given class compared to another, as you well said and referenced. type() shall be only used to check whether an instance is exactly of a given base type. thanks to @zmo here's the link <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21894575/isinstancefoo-bar-vs-typefoo-is-bar" title="isinstancefoo bar vs typefoo is bar">stackoverflow.com/questions/21894575/…</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">There is a subtle distinction here: variables don't have types, <i>values</i> do.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">So basically if I want to check the data type of a string, then I would use 'isinstance(Variable, str)' ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">In python3 - yes. In python2 - <code>isinstance(var, basesting)</code> in most cases — to operate with <code>str</code> as well as with <code>unicode</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, that did the deal</span>
