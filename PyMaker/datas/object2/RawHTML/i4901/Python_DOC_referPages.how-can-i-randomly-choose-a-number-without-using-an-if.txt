<p>Basically, I'm messing around in Python (3) and I'm trying to define some functions to do some common tasks in single lines, using as less memory as possible</p>
<p>For example, in video games, you might want a character to turn some degrees left/right, but not 0 degrees. So, given an integer <code>x</code>, how could you return a random integer between <code>-x</code> and +x` (inclusive) which isn't 0?</p>
<p>Note, I'm going for one-liners using minimum memory.</p>
<p>I'm posting an answer but I'd also like to know how other people would approach this.</p>
<p>EDIT: This isn' school homework or anything, I'm just designing a video game and defining a few functions which will come in handy. I said no 'If's because I was wondering if it was possible, and if so, how.</p>
<p>Thanks :-)</p>

<p>I would suggest:</p>
<pre><code>import random

def randint_between(x):
    return random.choice([-1, 1]) * random.randint(1, x)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I would use:</p>
<pre><code>import random

def between(x):
    return ((((random.randint(0, 1) * 2) - 1) * random.randint(1, x))
</code></pre>
</div>

<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.sample" rel="nofollow noreferrer">random.sample</a> works with ranges which are very small compared to the range of numbers they provide.</p>
<p>This create a positive number between 1 and x and multiplies it with 1 or -1. </p>
<pre><code>import random

def between(x):
    return random.sample(range(1, x+1),k=1)[0] * (-2*random.randint(0,1)+1)
</code></pre>
<p>After looking at <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/49084676/7505395">kch</a> answer, I would probably go his approach.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">by number do you mean integer?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">They're not supposed to turn '0'. For your first function, <code>between(1)</code> has a 50% chance of returning 0.</span>
