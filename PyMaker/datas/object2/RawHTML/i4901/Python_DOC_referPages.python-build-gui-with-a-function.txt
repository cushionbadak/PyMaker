<p>I want build a script that i give one input like a list (eg:<code>[["Name1",point,size],["Name2",point,size],etc]</code> and it create x labels with different names like label1,label2, etc</p>
<p>My problem is how Can i make the script build different labels?</p>
<p>Eg:</p>
<pre><code>label1 = Text(center, "name1")
label2 = Text(center, "name2")
</code></pre>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>

<p>Let's say you have a list:</p>
<pre><code>label_data = [["Name1",point,size],["Name2",point,size]]
</code></pre>
<p>What you need to do is just loop over it like:</p>
<pre><code>label_vars = {}
for i in label_data:
    label_vars[i[0]] = Text(center,i[whatever],further_arguments) #Arguments can be given by i[1] or *i[1:n] 
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I got the answer guys: <code>locals()</code></p>
<p>I just need write some like:</p>
<pre><code>data= [["Name1",point],["Name2",point]]
n=0
while n&lt;len(data):
    new_name="label"+str(n)  
    locals()[new_name]= Text(data[n][1], data[n][0])
    n+=1
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">What library are you using? in python there are many libraries to make a GUI</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You seem to know  how to make two. Why is that any different than creating 10?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@BryanOakley I think they want it in a loop</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Have you ever used <code>tkinter</code> for building GUIs?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What are point, size, and center? Does center contain point and size?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">what is "i" there?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">For every loop, <code>i</code> is a variable which will be assigned the value of current element. It changes to the next element in <code>label_data</code>, every time a loop completes a cycle</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Did you get it?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, it worked!! Thanks</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That is a horrible solution (the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#locals" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation</a> even explicitly states that you shouldn't modify the contents of <code>locals</code>) and most likely not what you should be doing. Why do you want to create new variables instead of using a list or dictionary?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I agree with @UnholySheep, It's the most horrible solution i've seen, this as worse as it can get.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Can you show me a better solution please?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I already told you: Create your own dictionary (something like <code>gui_elements = {}</code>) and put your elements in there - same as you are doing here, except you don't mess with the <code>locals</code> (e.g.: <code>gui_elements[new_name]= Text(data[n][1], data[n][0])</code>)</span>
