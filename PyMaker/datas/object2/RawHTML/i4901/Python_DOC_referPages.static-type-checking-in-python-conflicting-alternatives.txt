<p>Today I was introduced to multiple ways of using static type checking in Python (by the <a href="http://coconut.readthedocs.io/en/master/HELP.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the Coconut tutorial</a>). It lists <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">python 3.5 type hints</a>, <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0526/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">python 3.6 variable annotations</a>, and <a href="http://mypy-lang.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">MyPy</a>. I then found another, from Google, called <a href="https://github.com/google/pytype" rel="nofollow noreferrer">pytype</a>.</p>
<p>Do these alternatives conflict? Does any of them rely on any of the others? Does any (subset) of them render any of the others unnecessary?</p>

<p>The first three options you've mentioned are related. Type-hints introduced in Python 3.5 (as a consequence of <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PEP 484</a>) and supported by Python 2.7 (via stub-files) were inspired by the MyPy project. The whole system is now developed alongside MyPy. Variable type-hints introduced in Python 3.6 are a part of the process: they are perfectly consistent with never MyPy releases. pytype seems to be an alternative static analyser created for the same type-hint system. In other words, MyPy and pytype are designed for the same type-system.</p>
