<p>I am creating a code in Python to get the 10001st prime number, and I am looking for a way to stop printing numbers once I have printed 10001 numbers. Is this possible?</p>

<p>Yea, you can create a variable before your loop, and everytime that it gets a prime number, you add 1 to it, then check if it is the 10001st number already to break the loop. Or even something like that:</p>
<pre><code>currentPrime = 0
while currentPrime &lt; 10001:
    #Do your checks here to see if it's a prime, and if it is, do the following code:
    currentPrime = currentPrime + 1
</code></pre>
<p>There's many ways to do it so just find the one that suits you better.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can add a <code>break</code> inside your for loop which will exit the loop. You'll have to include an if/then statement to <code>break</code> after 10001</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>A while loop would work here:</p>
<pre><code>primes = []
while len(primes) &lt; 10001:
    #some code to find and print the next prime
    primes.append(next_prime)
</code></pre>
</div>
