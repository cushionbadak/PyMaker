<p>I am trying to add items to 9 lists that are already in 9 other lists.  I would like to have the first element of every list in the first list. And then the second element of each list into a second list.</p>
<p>So for example, I want my first output list using the three lists [1,2,3] and [3,2,1] to be [1,3].  I've come up with this but it keeps returning a KeyError:</p>
<pre><code>def sudokuSolver():
    row1,row2,row3,row4,row5,row6,row7,row8,row9=([] for i in range(9))
    for k in range(1,10):
        for l in range(9):
           globals()['row%s' % k].append(globals()['cell%s' % k][l])
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Your example code makes little sense. But your question does. Therefore, I will answer your question.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#zip" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>zip</code></a> is a convenient built-in function which iterates simultaneously through items of multiple iterables.</p>
<p>This is one application:</p>
<pre><code>lst = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]]

list(zip(*lst))[0]

# (1, 4, 7, 10)
</code></pre>
<p>Notice the unpacking operator <code>*</code>, the fact we need to wrap in <code>list</code> since <code>zip</code> is an interator, and indexer <code>[0]</code> which extracts the first element of each list.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Work on your question. Makes no sense.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Start with: <code>puzzle = [[''] * 9 for i in range(9)]</code>.  Also, if you think you need to use <code>globals()</code> you are almost certainly wrong.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Try reading it another time it probably doesn't make sense but I'm not sure how else to explain it. Do you know why that particular code is returning a KeyError? I'm new to python so if you could give me an explanation that would be awesome.</span>
