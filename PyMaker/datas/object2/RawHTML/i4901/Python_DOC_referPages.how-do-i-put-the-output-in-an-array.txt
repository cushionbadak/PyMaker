<p>How do I put the output generated in an array? I then want to subtract each element by its preceding element. For example: 6-0, 7-6, 10-7 etc to get the running length.</p>

<p>Python has ways to avoid indexing for common manipulations</p>
<p><code>zip</code> lets you pair lists and iterate over the paired values, pairing a list with a offset version of itself is common  </p>

seq
Out[28]: [7, 11, 15, 19, 23, 27]

out = []
for a, b in zip(seq, [0] + seq):  # '[0] + seq' puts a '0' in front, shifts rest over

<span class="comment-copy">What is the input?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">"Arrays" are called <i>lists</i> in Python. That is probably why you were unable to find <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the official documentation</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Input is a list of 0's and 1's, and in the code above I found the indices at which 1 is found. Now I need to find the run lengths. For example for 001000100011: Run length is 3441</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You should <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/posts/49079102/edit">edit</a> your question and put that information <b>in</b> it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">But how do I put this output which is not in a list, into an list first before doing all that</span>
<span class="comment-copy">same patteren of initing a empty list and appending the values inside your loop: <code>idxs = []</code>, put  <code>idxs.append(index)</code> inside your loop</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>seq = [*range(7, 30, 4)]</code> is invalid in Python 3.4 and lower.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@wjandrea OP didn't specify a version, but is using Python 3 per the print statement. If you're using 3, there's no reason you should still be on 3.4.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm running Python 3.6, could be a version difference, looks like 2.7 can just use <code>seq = range(7, 30, 4)</code></span>
