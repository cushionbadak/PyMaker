<p>I am trying to use a dictionary store byte strings.</p>
<pre><code>COMMANDS = { 'Serial': b'\x40'}
</code></pre>
<p>Calling 'Serial':</p>
<pre><code>print(COMMANDS['Serial'])
&gt;&gt; b'@'
</code></pre>
<p>I know this is the ASCII representation, however I later want to use this to calculate checksums and the conversion adds a layer of complexity. Is there a way to store the data without it being changed, or a way to call the data differently?</p>

<p>There is no "conversion", only <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#repr" rel="nofollow noreferrer">representation</a>.  <strong>Your data is not being changed</strong>.  So, simply, don't worry about it.</p>
<p>It is quite common for objects to have literal syntaxes which are non-unique, yet these are parsed and represented into a unique form.  Here's another example:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; 42.
42.0
&gt;&gt;&gt; 42.000
42.0
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>b'\x40' == b'@'</code>. It is still a byte string, and <code>ord('@') == 0x40</code>. Just use it the same way as you would before.</span>
