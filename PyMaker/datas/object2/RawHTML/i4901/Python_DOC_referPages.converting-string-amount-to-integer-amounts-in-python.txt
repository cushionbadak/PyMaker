<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>So I have the following string array : </p>
<pre><code>amount = ['60 million', '1 million', '', '1.15 million', '1 million', 
'','2.48 million', '', '', '75 million', '1.25 million', '3 million',    
'67,000', '4 million', '', '63 million', '5.9 million', '170,000', '5
million', '22 million', '15.75 million', '36.5 million', '', '', '', '19.9 
million', '1.4 billion']
</code></pre>
<p>I would like to convert this into integer amounts so I can use it for a database... I'm having trouble on figuring out whats the best approach...for instance, I have mixed amounts of millions, billions, and thousands...
So the goal is to get the following integer array:</p>
<pre><code>amount = [60000000, 1000000, 1150000....etc] 
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>ints = []
for x in amount:
    if 'million' in x:
        ints.append(int(float(x.split()[0]) * 10**6))
    elif ',' in x:
        ints.append(int(x.replace(',','')))
    else:
        ints.append(0)
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>[60000000, 1000000, 0, 1150000, 1000000, 0, 2480000, 0, 0, 75000000, 1250000, 3000000, 67000, 4000000, 0, 63000000, 5900000, 170000, 5000000, 22000000, 15750000, 36500000, 0, 0, 0, 19900000, 0]
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can define a dictionary of unit</p>
<pre><code>unit = { "million" = 1000000,
         "thousands" = 1000,
        ...
       } 
</code></pre>
<p>Then you can split amount list with space and apply multiplication from unit dict based on what unit you have in the split.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">BTW: These arrays are called <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#list" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>list</code></a> in python.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I was trying to understand this: re.match(r'[^ ]+', x).group())</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Sammy7 It means match (<code>re.match</code>) from start of the string any char that is not space <code>[^ ]</code> one and unlimited times <code>+</code>. Don't use <code>re</code> (regex) it is way slower. <a href="https://regex101.com/r/j8sxnw/1" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Regex demo</a> P.S. I updated my post using split and replace.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Many thanks for that !! I just started learning regex and its very confusing....</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ok, I was thinking of something along these lines...so</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ok, I was thinking of something along these lines...so if tried something like if string.contains (millions) , then replace millions with ' ', and trim all empty space, convert to integer, and then multiply by 1000000. And can repeat that with billion as well. And for the thousands, I just need to remove the commas. Cool !</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Sammy7 Hints: <code>replace()</code>, <code>split()</code>, <code>float()</code>, <code>lower()</code>, <code>append()</code>.</span>
