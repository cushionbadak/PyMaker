<p>I need to perform a loop in order to check during time if files having a given template are added into a directory.</p>
<p>In pseudo-code:</p>
<pre><code>template = "START_*_hello_*.pdf"
while true:
      while "file having template does not exist":
            time.sleep(1)

      found_file = get_existing_file
      file_processing(found_file)
</code></pre>
<p>The <strong>os.path.exists(file_path)</strong> function needs the entire filename. How could I used a filename containing the * jolly character?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Using the <code>glob</code> module you could write something like this:</p>
<pre><code>import glob

template = "START_*_hello_*.pdf"

while True:
    files = glob.glob(template)
    if not files:
        # no file matching template exists. Try again later.
        time.sleep(1)
        continue
    # Process all existing files
    for file in files:
        file_processing(file)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Sounds like you are looking for the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/glob.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>glob</code> module</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">It is the way I was looking for. I think you missed a while loop. First while means "forever", second while means "until you find a file"</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Fab Ah, so you want to continuously process all existing files (even the ones you have already processed)?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, several files having the same template could be pushed into the directory over time. Processed files will be deleted</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Fab There you go, no additional loop needed.</span>
