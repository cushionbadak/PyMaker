<p>I am having problems with my script. I want to find some terms in different files, defined in a searchlist. However - it won't find those terms, even if they are definitely included in those files. I checked it.</p>
<p>Am I missing something?</p>
<pre class="lang-html prettyprint-override"><code>path = '/mypath'

for filename in glob.glob(os.path.join(path, '*.txt')):
    with open(filename) as infp:
        mylist = infp.read().splitlines() 
        for word in mylist:
            searchlist = ["term1", "term2", "term3"]
            for i in searchlist:
                if i in word:
                    print ('found')
                else: 
                    print ('not found')

<span class="comment-copy"><code>mylist</code> is a list of your lines, not words. You need to <code>split</code> the line to get words and then apply the search.
