<p>I have a variable with some sort of review text. I want to create a new variable which has  the count of uppercase words in the text.</p>
<p><strong>For Example:</strong> </p>
<p>Review_1: "This was a great product"</p>
<p>Answer_1:Uppercase_word:0 </p>
<p>Review_2: "This was NOT AT ALL GOOD"</p>
<p>Answer_2: uppercase_word:4</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.isupper" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>str.isupper</code></a> returns a boolean (<code>True</code> or <code>False</code>) if a string is entirely uppercased.</p>
<p>In Python <code>1 == True</code> and <code>0 == False</code> so you can <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#sum" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>sum</code></a> booleans.</p>
<p>The only thing left is to split the original string into words using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.split" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>.split</code></a>.</p>
<pre><code>sum(map(str.isupper, "This was a great product".split()))  # 0
sum(map(str.isupper, "This was NOT AT ALL GOOD".split()))  # 4
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>word == word.upper()</code> will tell you if a word contains all uppercase letters.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sure Thanks. I will take that tour. :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I tried this but it gives error saying : isupper() takes no arguments (1 given)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@prasadvaidya If you literally just copy and paste into a Python3 shell, this works.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yeah it works Thanks , I guess I already had 'str' assigned as something else and so it was giving error. How can I use this over a variable which has  text reviews?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@prasadvaidya Just place the variable where the string is. You probably want to ask a new question if that doesn't make sense.</span>
