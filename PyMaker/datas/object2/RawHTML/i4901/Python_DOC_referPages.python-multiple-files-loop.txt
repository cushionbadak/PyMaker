<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I just created a loop to read through each line in multiple files in Python and my code looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>filenames = ["a.txt","b.txt","c.txt","d.txt"]
for file in filenames:  
lines = [line.rstrip('\n') for line in open(file)]
</code></pre>
<p>However, Python only returns the contents of the last file (d.txt).</p>
<p>Can anyone help me here?</p>
</div>

<p>The problem is that <code>lines</code> is being overwrite on each iteration with the content of the actual file. Rakesh solution is valid, but I'm giving you other approach, as you are trying to do it in 1 line:</p>
<pre><code>filenames = ["a.txt","b.txt","c.txt", "d.txt"]
lines = [line.rstrip('\n') for file in filenames for line in open(file)]
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">I have another loop in this read file loop to, your code does not allow me to use other loop.     lines = [line.rstrip('\n') for file in filenames for line in open(file)]    for r in range(11):   for c in range(5):</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You have to put that for loops inside the <code>[...]</code> section. You can't place them outside. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12920214/python-for-syntax-block-code-vs-single-line-generator-expressions">Here</a> you have a more detailed explanation about 1 line generator.  Your version for this loop would be something like this: <code>[print(r,c,file, line) for r in range(11) for c in range(5) for file in filenames for line in open(file)]</code></span>
