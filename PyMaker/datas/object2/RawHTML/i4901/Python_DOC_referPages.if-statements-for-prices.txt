<p>I have written a code where the person inputs the amount of money the have and what computer they want, how would I write a code to tell them if the have can afford it or not. (I am only 11 years old so I do not want it to be over complicated)</p>
<pre><code>Homebasic_price = 900
Office_price = 1200
Gamer_price = 1500
Studio_price = 2200

price = int(input("How much is the computer you would like?"))

money = int(input("How much money do you have to spend?"))

<p>@Ten-Coin already answered your specific question, but since it sounds like you're brand-new to programming, I wanted to offer some more general advice and encouragement.</p>
<p>When you're first starting out with a language--and with programming in general--it's often helpful to follow some tutorials that give you an idea of how the language works. There are <a href="https://www.techrocket.com/coding" rel="nofollow noreferrer">lots</a> <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python" rel="nofollow noreferrer">of</a> <a href="https://www.tynker.com/javascript/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">resources</a> to help you learn Python online that will gradually show you how to build simple at first, then more complicated, projects.</p>
<p>Programming is a lot of fun, so I hope you keep exploring and learning! Good luck!</p>

<pre><code>basic=100
office=200
game=300
studio=400
price=100
if price &lt; basic:
    print("you cant have any PC")
elif price &gt;= basic &amp; price &lt; office:
    print("you can have basic machine")
elif print &gt;= office &amp; price &lt; game:
    print("You can have office PC")

you can have basic machine

<p>This is as an example and you can extend your if-else to some other models. Read this for better idea : <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html</a></p>

<span class="comment-copy">You have to remove price assignment and assign int(input)) to it. So when ever user enters input price will have it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you wanna give more clarity to end user, you need this. Else you can skip.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes. See price is still getting value from normal assignment.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you for your help, I wasn't reading it properly But I found out what I was doing wrong. Thank you very much this helped me alot.</span>
