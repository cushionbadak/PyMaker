<p>I'm writing a script that loads the first youtube video that appears after entering a search query using <code>requests</code> and <code>bs4.BeautifulSoup</code>. It seems all youtube videos have an <code>a</code>tag with an id of <code>#video-title</code>. Therefore I would think the simplest solution is to use <code>soup.findAll("#video-title")</code> But the list of tags always come up empty. I'm not sure which tags to select in order to <code>href</code> that will ultimately load the video. </p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>video = soup.findAll('a',attrs={'class':'yt-uix-tile-link'})
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Are you sure content isn't dynamically loaded? Also share example url</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Videos most likely are loaded dynamically but I'm not sure how that affects whether or not you can parse it or not. An example url would simply be a search page after a query is entered such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Happy+Together" rel="nofollow noreferrer">link</a> @QHarr</span>
<span class="comment-copy"># is an id selector</span>
<span class="comment-copy">"video-title" is an id. Tried <code>soup.findAll('a',attrs={'id':'video-title'})</code> as well, returned an empty list.</span>
