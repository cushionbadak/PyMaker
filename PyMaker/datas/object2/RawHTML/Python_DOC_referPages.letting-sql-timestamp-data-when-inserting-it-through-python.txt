<p>I have a python script that reads logs and inserts the logs into a SQL DB(through python).  Is there a way that SQL can automatically timestamp the logs when they are inserted so I don't have to read the date and time from the logs in my script? </p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>you could put a column in your database , this</p>
<pre><code>date_registered TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
</code></pre>
<p>or you could add it in python like another value to the insert</p>
<pre><code>import datetime
datetime.datetime.now()
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Yeah, <code>TIMESTAMP</code>. Without knowing the specific SQL technology, it's not possible to say exactly how it is defined, though</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you let SQL do it automatically, it will be the time that the script was run, not the time from the log message. Is that really what you want?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The script runs continuously while the server is on for months at a time, so I don't think so? So timestamp wouldn't work?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Unless a significantly high amount of precision is needed in your timestamps, or there is a lot of latency between Python and SQL, I would let SQL do the timestamp, probably stored in UTC.</span>
