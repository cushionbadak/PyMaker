<p>I have a list of lists. Each list has the same number of elements. I'd like to delete an entire list if a new list supersedes the old one based on a numeric key in the nth element that all the lists have. This numeric key is an increment of 1 starting from 1. Highest key is desired. </p>
<pre><code>all = [[123, 1],[456, 1],[789, 1],[123,2],[456, 2],[789,1]]
</code></pre>
<p>The last element in each list is the key: 2 supersedes 1 etc... the output desired is:</p>
<pre><code>[[123,2],[456,2],[789,1]]
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>for x in list(all):
    for y in list(all):
        if y[0] == x[0] and y[1] &lt;= x[1] and y is not x:
            all.remove(y)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Would something like a dictionary work better here?</p>
<pre><code>all = [[123, 1],[456, 1],[789, 1],[123,2],[456, 2],[789,1]]

as_dict = {}
for item in all:
    if not (item[0] in as_dict and as_dict[item[0]] &gt; item[1]):
        as_dict[item[0]] = item[1]

print(as_dict)
# Returns {123: 2, 456: 2, 789: 1}
</code></pre>
<p>In fact, if you know that the second numbers in each pair will never decrease (e.g., you won't see something like <code>[123,0]</code> appear later in the list after <code>[123,2]</code>) then just converting the list to a dictionary with <code>dict()</code> should accomplish the same thing.  Then you could convert it back to a list if you want.</p>
<pre><code>d = dict(all)  # This is {123: 2, 456: 2, 789: 1}
newlist = [ [k,d[k]] for k in d] # This is [[123, 2], [456, 2], [789, 1]]
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks Zak! - this solution of dual looping is exactly what I needed and helps me scale up the production list which is in fact much larger and has multiple keys.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks @AndrewDunlop, mark it as best answer if it solved your problem! No problem double-beep I understand, will do so on my answers in the future!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Many thanks Bill!</span>
