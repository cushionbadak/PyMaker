<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have a dict as follows:</p>
<pre><code>A[1]
Out[351]: [0, 4, 5, 6]
A[2]
Out[352]: [1, 25, 8, 4]
</code></pre>
<p>upto:</p>
<pre><code>A[7]
Out[352]: [0, 3, 6, 9]
</code></pre>
<p>Given these, I have to populate another dict using the following condition:</p>
<pre><code>if A[1][0] &lt;= A[2][0]:
    l=1
else:
    l=A[2][0]-A[1][2]/((A[1][1]-A[1][2])-(A[2][1]-A[2][0]))
</code></pre>
<p>which gives:</p>
<pre><code>l
Out[354]: 1
</code></pre>
<p>Similarly:</p>
<pre><code>if A[1][0] &lt;= A[3][0]:
    l=1
else:
    l=A[3][0]-A[1][2]/((A[1][1]-A[1][2])-(A[3][1]-A[3][0]))
 if A[1][0] &lt;= A[4][0]:
    l=1
else:
    l=A[4][0]-A[1][2]/((A[1][1]-A[1][2])-(A[4][1]-A[4][0]))
</code></pre>
<p>upto:</p>
<pre><code>    if A[1][0] &lt;= A[7][0]:
        l=1
    else:
       l=A[7][0]-A[1][2]/((A[1][1]-A[1][2])-(A[7][1]-A[7][0]))
</code></pre>
<p>If I append these, I'm supposed to get:</p>
<pre><code>l
Out[360]: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
</code></pre>
<p>I want the l to be a dict:</p>
<pre><code>{1: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}
</code></pre>
<p>for A1 and</p>
<pre><code>{2: [some values]}
</code></pre>
<p>for A2..upto </p>
<pre><code>{7: [some values]}
</code></pre>
<p>for A7.</p>
<p>One problem is I have to compute this starting from A[1][0], A[2][0] to A[1][0],A[7][0] and then for A[2][0], A[1]A[0]...so on upto A[7][0],A[6][0]. The other problem is that I need to skip the computation wherever A[i][0] and A[i][0] are to be compared. I've initially tried a loop like this:</p>
<pre><code>i=[i for i in A.keys()]
k=[k for k in A.keys()]
while i != k:
        if A[i][0] &lt;= A[k][0]:
             B=1
        else:
             B=A[k][0]-A[i][2]/((A[i][1]-A[i][2])-(A[k][1]-A[k][0]))

k +=1
i +=1
</code></pre>
<p>I'm getting this error:</p>
<pre><code>  File "&lt;ipython-input-350-9d9e2d0e5d59&gt;", line 8, in &lt;module&gt;
    k +=1

TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable
</code></pre>
<p>Somebody kindly help me get the loop please. Please note that B has to be a dict.</p>

<p>Okay, I think I'm starting to understand your thing.</p>
<p>I would say the solution might look like something like this:</p>
<pre><code>A = [
    [0, 4, 5, 6],
    [1, 25, 8, 4],
    [0, 3, 6, 9],
]

D = {i: 1 if A[1][0] &lt;= A[i][0] else A[i][0]-A[1][2]/((A[1][1]-A[1][2])-(A[i][1]-A[i][0])) for i in range(len(A))}

print D
# {0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 0}

<p>I'll write a bit more details as to what I'm doing here. But first, I'm not 100% sure that's what you want as a result.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>k=[k for k in CA.keys()]</code> - <code>k</code> is a list - what do you think <code>k += 1</code> should do?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I don't think that these are <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>dict</code></a>s</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You are trying to increment <code>k</code> by one, but <code>k</code> is not an <code>int</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">first, k, i are lists, you can't +=1 to them. second what's CA? did you mean A? third, you should also check that you don't divide with 0</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I  need to make sure i is not equal to k at all instances. K+=1 was something i tried first</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Actually, you want your dict values to be lists... so I realized once more that I'm not getting the stuff right. You're saying at some point <code>l=1</code>, so you're assigning an int to <code>l</code>. You cannot expect it to become a <code>list</code> at some point. In the output, you have a matrix. What is the formula for M[i,j] (I'm speaking in terms of maths, not of python). Once we get that figured out, we can translate it into python fairly easily. So, please express M[i,j] = f(A, i, j). :-)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">is there a way for me to connect with you in a chat or something?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">you're right my output will be in matrix terms. As for M[i,j] i will be 1,2..7 for A[1], A[2]..A[7]. J will also be the same except, m(i,j) for i=j (the diagonal elements) will be null.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, I created a chatcrypt with groupname=SO48887198 and passwordname=SO48887198</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I know that 0&lt;=i&lt;=3 and 0&lt;=j&lt;=6. And because it's not a square matrix, it won't have diagonals per-se. But I don't know what is the value of M[i,j] in terms of i and j.</span>
