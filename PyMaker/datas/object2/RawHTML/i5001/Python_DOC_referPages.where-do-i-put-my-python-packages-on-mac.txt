<p>On my Manjaro Linux machine I put my custom packages to <code>~/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/</code> and Python finds them automatically making them available globally. I've tried doing exactly the same on a MacBook (running Mac OS X 10.9 "Mavericks" with both Python 3.6 and 2.7 installed) and it doesn't seem to work. What is the correct path or where am I to add this path to make it work?</p>

<p>This <a href="https://gist.github.com/patriciogonzalezvivo/77da993b14a48753efda" rel="nofollow noreferrer">GitHub Article</a> lists some steps that could be helpful. </p>
<p>When you install Python it says to <strong>Add PATH to</strong> <code>~/.bash_profile</code> and <code>~/.zshrc</code></p>
<p>This is accomplished by: </p>
<pre><code>export PATH=/usr/local/share/python:$PATH
</code></pre>
<p>I hope this solves the problem! </p>

<span class="comment-copy">@Maroun <code>['', '/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/lib/python36.zip', '/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/lib/python3.6', '/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/lib/python3.6/lib-dynload', '/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/lib/python3.6/site-packages']</code> How do I add a directory under the user home to this list correctly? Or am I actually meant to manually put my code into some one of these already in the list?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Then I guess it's <code>/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/lib/python3.6/site-packages</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Maroun It seems to be a directory where PIP puts installed packages. I don't think it's a perfect idea to put something there manually. Sure it won't be a serious problem yet I believe there is to be a dedicated directory for DIY libraries not managed by any package managers.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The link doesn't include the actual answer anyway though it gives a clue that setting the <code>$PYTHONPATH</code> environment variable may help. Following this idea I've googled upon <a href="https://support.enthought.com/hc/en-us/articles/204469160-How-do-I-set-PYTHONPATH-and-other-environment-variables-for-Canopy-" rel="nofollow noreferrer">support.enthought.com/hc/en-us/articles/â€¦</a> and added <code>setenv PYTHONPATH /Users/myname/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages</code> to <code>/etc/launchd.conf</code> as it suggests. This has solved the problem but this can hardly be considered a tidy solution as it affects both Python 3.6 and Python 2.7.</span>
