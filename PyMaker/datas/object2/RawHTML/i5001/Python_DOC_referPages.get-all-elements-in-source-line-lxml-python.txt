<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I'm extracting some html information and querying it using the <code>.xpath</code> method in python. For one particular application I would like to extract all elements belonging to a particular sourceline. For instance</p>
<pre><code>with open(self.file_path, 'r') as f:
    page = f.read()
tree = html.fromstring(page)
all = tree.xpath(r'/html/body//a')
print(all[5].sourceline)
</code></pre>
<p>The above yields sourceline number 14, which contains the following source html.</p>
<pre><code>26) &lt;a name="l26" style="background-color: #ffffff"&gt;        subroutine &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a style="background-color: #ffcccc"&gt;AdjustParticleDiscretisation()&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>How do I then extract all the contents of this html  using the sourceline rather than the conventional xpath query? Or does xpath have some syntax that is sourceline aware?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>If you're interested in getting the content visible on the page, you could use: <code>all[5].text</code>, as mentioned here: <a href="http://lxml.de/api/lxml.etree._Element-class.html#text" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://lxml.de/api/lxml.etree._Element-class.html#text</a></p>
<p>If you need the actual html of that element you can use ElementTree's <code>tosstring</code> method:
<code>
import xml.etree.ElementTree as etree
etree.tostring(all[5])
</code></p>
<p>Also, as CristFati mentioned, try to avoid using <code>all</code> as a variable since it's a python built-in function and you have overwritten it's reference.
