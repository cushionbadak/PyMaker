<p>I am currently starting out with Python 3.6 and using the IDLE development area. I have been looking online for a solution to the following problem:</p>
<p>I have two text files. The first is my input list, the second is my blacklist. I want to check for any instances where a line in my input list is also in my blacklist. The end goal will be to create a new list that contains all the intersections.</p>
<p>I am currently doing the following:</p>
<pre><code>input_list=set(line.strip() for line in open("input_list.txt",'r'))
black_list=set(line.strip() for line in open("black_list.txt",'r'))

print("Input List")
print(input_list)
print("Black List")
print(black_list)
print("Intersection")
print(input_list.intersection(black_list))
</code></pre>
<p>I will explain my reasoning so hopefully people can correct my logic with their answers, not just provide a solution.</p>
<pre><code>input_list=set(line.strip() for line in open("input_list.txt",'r'))
black_list=set(line.strip() for line in open("black_list.txt",'r'))
</code></pre>
<p>With the above two lines of code I am opening two sets. Each one strips out all of the \n values and leaves me with just the text from each line.</p>
<pre><code>print("Input List")
print(input_list)
print("Black List")
print(black_list)
</code></pre>
<p>This section is simply for me to check my text files have been opened, and all the values are present in the set. There is a header above each section for clarity.</p>
<pre><code>print("Intersection")
print(input_list.intersection(black_list))
</code></pre>
<p>In this piece of code I start with a header. I then try to print any intersection values that are found. Currently the result that I get in my shell looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>Input List
{'value1', 'value2', 'value3'}
Black List
{'valueA', 'valueB', 'valueC'}
Intersection
set()
</code></pre>
<p>I got my information about intersection from the following link:</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html</a></p>
<p>I got my file opening into sets from this article:</p>
<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/874017/python-load-words-from-file-into-a-set">Python: load words from file into a set</a></p>
<p>I have been reading The Python Manual, Volume 33 from the Black Dog i-Tech Series. I used this to learn the basics for Python. Whilst it covers basic open, reading, and writing - it does not cover more complex features.</p>
<p>I'm mostly designing this to create a tool for inputting domains, and checking against a blacklist of bad domains. This is to be used for SEO purposes and help me to quickly produce a disavow file. Aside from being practical for my work, this is also just a personal project to help me explore, learn, and develop my understanding of Python.</p>

<p>Indeed your code appears to accomplish your goal. The intersection between the set </p>
<pre><code>{'value1', 'value2', 'value3'}
</code></pre>
<p>and </p>
<pre><code>{'valueA', 'valueB', 'valueC'}
</code></pre>
<p>is indeed the empty set. Python represents an empty set with <code>set()</code>. If perhaps you were expecting <code>{}</code> to represent the empty set, this is actually an empty <em>dictionary</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I should have been more clear, value1, value2, value3, valueA, valueB, valueC are just example values. The list that I am using to test is significantly longer and posting it here would have been inappropriate.</p>
<p>In retrospect, I've realised I made a huge mistake in not double checking that there were indeed any duplicate values within the two. </p>
<p>After people have said that the code is correct, I've now realized my problem was my own stupidity for not double checking there were in fact any duplicate values.</p>
<p>This is now resolved, I'm an idiot.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I'm not sure what your question is. There is no intersection between <code>{'value1', 'value2', 'value3'}</code> and <code>{'valueA', 'valueB', 'valueC'}</code>, which your code correctly reports.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It looks like you get what's happening. Was there a specific question you had? The intersection of your Input List, and Black List is empty, because there are no overlapping values in the two.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It looks to me like you already have a working solution :) Is there an issue with it?</span>
