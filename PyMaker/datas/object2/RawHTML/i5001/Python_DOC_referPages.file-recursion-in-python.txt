<p>I have a Folder A, which has 100 subfolders, each of those has 3-6 subfolders one of which holds a bunch of txt files. I need to do file recursion to get those. Since I want to give something for people to build off of:</p>
<pre><code>import path

rootdir = path(*Folder A location*)
file_list = [f for f in rootdir.glob('**/*') if f.is_file()]

# For absolute paths instead of relative the current dir
file_list = [f for f in rootdir.resolve().glob('**/*') if f.is_file()]
</code></pre>
<p>My goal is to take these <code>.txt</code> files containing tables and gather the data from them.</p>

<p>Use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html?highlight=os%20walk#os.walk" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>os.walk()</code></a> to recursively find all files ending with <code>.txt</code>:</p>
<pre><code>import os

for dirpath, dirnames, filenames in os.walk('.'):

        if f.endswith('.txt'):
