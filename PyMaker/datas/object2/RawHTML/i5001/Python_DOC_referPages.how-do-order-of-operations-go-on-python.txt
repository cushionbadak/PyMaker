<p>My question looks like this:                                </p>
<pre><code>  10-7//2*3+1 
</code></pre>
<p>I am supposed to solve the equation.</p>
<p>And my answer seems to come out as 8 when using PEMDAS</p>
<pre><code>First its's 2*3 = 6; 10-7//6+1
second = 7//6= 1; 10-1+1
Third = 10-8 = 8;
</code></pre>
<p>But when putting it into python, I get a 2. Why?</p>
<p>It seems the programs order is as such:</p>
<pre><code>first: 7//2=3; 10-3*3+1
second: 3*3=9; 10-9+1
third:10-9+1= 2; 2
</code></pre>
<p>I don't get it</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>PEMDAS</code> is <code>P</code>, <code>E</code>, <code>MD</code>, <code>AS</code>; multiplication and division have the <em>same precedence</em>, and the same goes for addition and subtraction. When a division operator appears before multiplication, division goes first.</p>
<p>The order Python operators are executed in is governed by the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#operator-precedence" rel="nofollow noreferrer">operator precedence</a>, and follow the same rules. Operators with higher precedence are executed before those with lower precedence, but operators have <em>matching</em> precedence when they are in the same group.</p>
<p>For <code>10-7//2*3+1</code>, you have 2 classes of operators, from lowest to higest:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>+, -</code>  (correlating with <code>AS</code> == <em>addition and subtraction</em>)</li>
<li><code>*, @, /, //, %</code>  (correlating with <code>MD</code>, so <em>multiplicaton and division</em>).</li>
</ul>
<p>So <code>//</code> and <code>*</code> are executed first; multiplication and division fall in the same <em>group</em>, not a set order here (<code>MD</code> doesn't mean multiplication comes before division):</p>
<pre><code>10 - ((7 // 2) * 3) + 1
</code></pre>
<p>So <code>7 // 2</code> is executed first, followed by the multiplication by 3. You then get the subtraction from ten and adding one at the end.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>PEMDAS is better expressed as</p>
<pre><code>P   Parentheses, then
E   Exponents, then
MD  Multiplication and division, left to right, then
AS  Addition and subtraction, left to right
</code></pre>
<p>So in your expression, the division should be done before the multiplication, since it is to the left of the multiplication. After those are done, then do the subtraction then the addition.</p>

<p>This is documented <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#operator-precedence" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a> (Python Documentation / Expressions / Operator-Precedence):</p>
<ul>
<li>Multiplication and division, including integer division, happen on the same precedence level, so the order is determined by the direction in which operands are grouped:</li>
<li>Evaluation order of all the multiplications and divisions is left to right (like for most binary operations, except exponentiation).</li>
</ul>

<span class="comment-copy">You aren't using PEDMAS. Integer division is still division.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You evaluate it LEFT TO RIGHT so division comes first.</span>
