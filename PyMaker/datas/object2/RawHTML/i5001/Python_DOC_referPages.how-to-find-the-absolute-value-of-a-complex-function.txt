<p>I want to find the absolute value of something like 'i' but when I type 'abs(1)' it says 'i' is not defined. What do I do?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>In python to find the absolute value of a complex function you use j instead of i.</p>
<pre><code>abs(a+bj) # General Format
abs(0+1j)
&gt;&gt; 1
</code></pre>
<p>Or you could define i as the square root of -1 and use it instead</p>
<pre><code>i = (-1) ** 0.5
abs(i)
&gt;&gt; 1
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy"><i>"when I type 'abs(1)' it says 'i' is not defined"</i> &lt;- that seems unlikely. Do you mean when you type <code>abs(i)</code>? Because that's not a valid complex literal in Python, see e.g. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#imaginary-literals" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/reference/â€¦</a>, it's just trying to refer to the name <code>i</code>.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">@imaad, your second example should be <code>(-1)**0.5</code>, right now you're doing <code>-(1**0.5)</code> as can be seen checking the value of <code>i</code> itself rather than <code>abs(i)</code>, (it gives <code>-1</code> rather than <code>1j</code>)</span>
