<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>so I have a Class Number with two string attributes called roman and text (It is supposed to store the Roman value and text description of an Arabic number)</p>
<p>I use a dictionary to store this information, the keys are the Arabic numbers and the values are instances of the class Number.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to print the attributes but I cannot find the way to access them.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>number = Number("XX", "twenty")
dictionary {20:number}
</code></pre>
<p>So when I print the Arabic number and its roman value and tex description I want to get this output:</p>
<pre><code>20 XX twenty
</code></pre>
<p>I thought that in order to get this I would have to code:</p>
<pre><code>print("20 " + dictionary.get(20).roman + " " + dictionary.get(20).text)
</code></pre>
<p>But that is not the case, does someone know how to access the attributes of the object from a dictionary?  </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The proper way of accessing is storing the key and the value in temporary variables to be used in printing (or something else), <em>rather than manually typing in 20</em>.</p>
<pre><code>k = 20                         # key
v = dictionary[k]              # value
roman, text = v.roman, v.text
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to do this in a loop (to print all elements),</p>
<pre><code>for k in dictionary:
    v = dictionary[k]
    roman, text = v.roman, v.text
</code></pre>
<p>Or using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=items#dict.items" rel="nofollow noreferrer">dict.items()</a>,</p>
<pre><code>for k, v in dictionary.items():
    print(k, v.roman, v.text)
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">What is the problem? You got the object with <code>dictionary.get(20)</code> and accessed the attribute with <code>dictionary.get(20).roman</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why do you think "that is not the case"? Did you get an exception or something?</span>
