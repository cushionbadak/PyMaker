<p>I'm trying to follow and do an example of conditionals/branching with a problem that starts at the 32:00 mark. The video is over a decade old and is utilizing an outdated version of python. The example doesn't work for me using python 3 because the calculation is not using integer division so my program always states Even for any number I pick with the exception of floats. 
I'm new to the site so I hope I provided a correct hyperlink.
