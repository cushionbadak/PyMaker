<p>I am using python2.7 on ubuntu system. I am getting following errors while working with "os":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'fsencode'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On this line:</p>
<pre><code> directory=os.fsencode(indir)
</code></pre>
<p>I have checked other solutions but they are not relevant. </p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Python 2.7 has no <code>os.fsencode()</code> function, that's a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.fsencode" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><em>Python 3 only</em> function</a>. It was <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.2.html#os" rel="nofollow noreferrer">introduced in Python 3.2</a> and not backported.</p>
<p>If you need a backport, you'll have to first backport the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.getfilesystemencoding" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>sys.getfilesystemencoding()</code> function</a>, which is platform dependent, and you'd have to take into account changes to how different Python versions have handled filename encoding (for Windows, Python 3.6 and up changed to UTF-8, older versions use the <code>mbcs</code> codec, which is locale dependent).</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Okay. I didn't know that. Previously I had python3.6 so it was working fine. Thank you. @Martijn Pieters.</span>
