<p>I have a dictionary of various ID's I need to write to a file with the values under each key as their own row, tab separated.</p>
<p>In the end I want the file to look like this:</p>
<pre><code>    user1_id1 &lt;tab&gt; user1_id2 &lt;tab&gt; user1_id3 &lt;tab&gt;
    user2_id2&lt;tab&gt;...
</code></pre>
<p>I cannot use pandas since this library is too large for the application we are using. Currently I have my results in a list of dictionaries with each element as a user and their various ID's as key value pairs within each element</p>
<pre><code>[{id1: 230423, id2:sdfkjs}, {id1:1932, id2:sjsdf}...]
</code></pre>
<p>Is there a way to extract the values within the dictionaries within the list and then write those to a file with the id's contained in each element as their own row, tab separated?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Here is a simple example of using <code>csv.DictWriter</code></p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import csv
... 
... fieldnames = ('id1', 'id2')
... result = [
...     {'id1': 230423, 'id2': 'sdfkjs'},
...     {'id1': 1932, 'id2': 'sjsdf'}
... ]
... 
... with open('test.csv', 'w') as f:
...     writer = csv.DictWriter(f, fieldnames=fieldnames, delimiter='\t')
...     writer.writeheader()
...     writer.writerows(result)
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt; with open('test.csv', 'r') as f:
...     for line in f:
...         print(line.rstrip())
... 
id1 id2
230423  sdfkjs
1932    sjsdf
</code></pre>
<p>Reading it back in as dictionaries is easy as well using <code>csv.DictReader</code></p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; with open('test.csv', 'r') as f:
...     reader = csv.DictReader(f, delimiter='\t')
...     for line in reader:
...         print(dict(line))
... 
{'id1': '230423', 'id2': 'sdfkjs'}
{'id1': '1932', 'id2': 'sjsdf'}
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Of course there is a way to do that. What specifically are you having problems with? (please show your attempt)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@DeliriousLettuce that may work, I will look into that library. Thank you.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This worked perfectly, thank you!</span>
