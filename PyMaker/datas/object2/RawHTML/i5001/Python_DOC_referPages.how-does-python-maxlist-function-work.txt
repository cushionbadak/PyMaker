<p>I have the following code that doesn't work the way it should.</p>
<pre><code>n = int(input())
arr = map(int, input().split())

num=max(arr)
x=list(set(arr))
print (x)
</code></pre>
<p>This returns and empty list "[]".
However, if I remove the num=max[arr] line from the code, it works as expected.</p>
<pre><code>n = int(input())
arr = map(int, input().split())

x=list(set(arr))
print (x)
</code></pre>
<p>And the output is a list of all elements without duplicates.
I wanted to use the max() value somewhere else in the program, but it seems to break the list formation. Why does this happen? Is there a basic property of the max function that I'm missing?</p>
<p>Edit: Why are people downvoting this without any answers? I'm fairly new to python and any help would be appreciated. If I made a silly mistake please point that out.</p>

<pre><code>n = int(input())  # unused - why put it in your example?
arr = map(int, input().split())  # returns an iterator

num=max(arr)      # consumes the iterator
x=list(set(arr))  # nothing in the iterator anymore
print (x)         # prints nothing
</code></pre>
<p>Fix:</p>
<pre><code>n = int(input())  # unused - why put it in your example?
arr = set(map(int, input().split()))  # returns an set named arr

num=max(arr)      # get num as max from set 
print (arr)       # prints the set named arr
</code></pre>
<p>In python 2 map behaved differently - for 3 its an iterator. Once consumed, iterators are "empty". You can see for yourself if you <code>print(type(arr))</code> for the result of <em>your</em> map operation.</p>

<p>I'm not sure why you need to use map in this case. Another thing is that you will throw errors on your input if the user does not provide a single int since you are trying to convert it. You can take your input, like a string of '1 4 6 23 5', convert it to a list of ints, and then find the max. </p>
<pre><code>n = '1 4 6 23 5'
arr = [int(x) for x in n.split()]
max(arr)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">In Python 3.x, <code>map()</code> returns a lazy iterator (rather than an actual list as in earlier versions).  When you call <code>max()</code> on this iterator, all of its elements are consumed, making it appear empty for any further operations.  Putting <code>ar = list(ar)</code> as the third line in your code would make an actual list out of it, which can be iterated as many times as you want.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I was wondering wth was happening since I use mostly python 2.7. You learn something new every day</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@jasonharper That makes a lot of sense. Thank you!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Really like all the comment and explanations gives in this answer , like a good teacher</span>
<span class="comment-copy">how does your solution prevent throwing errors when someone provides a string with non-integers in it?</span>
