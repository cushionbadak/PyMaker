<p>I'd like to add some command line switches to my script, to which I use the argparse.</p>
<p>The related part of my script so far looks like:</p>
<pre><code>import argparse

parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(prog="Hola python",description="Hola")
parser.add_argument('-i', '--input', help="helpppping")
parser.print_help()
</code></pre>
<p>However this results in:</p>
<pre><code>usage: Hola python [-h] [-i INPUT]

Hola

optional arguments:
-h, --help            show this help message and exit
-i INPUT, --input INPUT
                    helpppping
</code></pre>
<p>My concerns is with this row</p>
<pre><code>-i INPUT, --input INPUT
</code></pre>
<p>This should looks like</p>
<pre><code> -i, --input         helppppping
</code></pre>
<p>I saw <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28638813/how-to-make-a-short-and-long-version-of-a-required-argument-using-python-argpars">this</a> question, and read <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/argparse.html#name-or-flags" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this</a> part of the manual, and all seems good but still not formatted well.</p>
<p>I obviously miss something just don't know what.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>try this</p>
<pre><code> parser.add_argument('-i', '--input', metavar='', help='helping')
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">So you basically want <code>-i</code> to work like a switch, and not take any argument after it?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Well it should be followed with string to the input file, I just saw in many scripts that there are a short and a long version of the switch and both do the same.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">And they do. Have you tried using this?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I believe you did correctly and it does what you want. You just misunderstand the help message. The helpppping text appears next line due to formatting, and the text says -i INPUT, --input INPUT rather than -i, --input INPUT, well, because that's the way it is. But functionaly, I think you're fine.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">But what does not work? Please show a failure test case.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Gosh, that was quick. It works now, so I forgot to include the rest of the params? :O</span>
<span class="comment-copy">ah, the metavar was the key I believe.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks yes there are some formatter_class that you can use checkout this <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">So @SecThor you're just bothered by the fact the help reads 'INPUT'?! This is just cosmetic. I don't think there's a point addressing this and if I were you I'd leave it the way it is because this is what people are used to see. It doesn't matter either way, though.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why did you add the <code>required=True</code> and <code>type=str</code> option?  Adding <code>required=True</code> changes the intent of the code that @SecThor presented, and <code>type=str</code> just adds noise because it is the default behavior.  The only thing that needed to be added was <code>metavar=''</code>.</span>
