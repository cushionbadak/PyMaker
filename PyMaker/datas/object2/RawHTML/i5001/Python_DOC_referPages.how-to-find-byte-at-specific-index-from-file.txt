<p>I need to print byte at specific position in file that i know path. So I open default file in "rb" mode and then I need to know what byte is on 15 position. It is posible ?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Here's how you can achieve this with <code>seek</code>:</p>
<pre><code>with open('my_file', 'rb') as f:
    f.seek(15)
    f.read(1)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Another way you could do this is to read the entire document and slice it:</p>
<p>First read the contense of the file:</p>
<pre><code>file = open('test.txt', 'rb')
a = file.read()
</code></pre>
<p>Then take the desired value:</p>
<pre><code>b = a[14]
</code></pre>
<p>Then don't forget to close the file afterwards:</p>
<pre><code>file.close()
</code></pre>
<p>Or so that is closes automatically:</p>
<pre><code>with open('test.txt', 'rb') as file:

    a = file.read()
    b = a[14] 
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">seek set up pointer at specific position it's used when I need to write to file from that pointer but not exactly when i want to read.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">no,seek sets the pointer  - both for reading and writing.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Walucas Let's assume that I have 20mb file and I need to know what byte is at position 16 and (size - 16) position dont think that good way is to print all 20kk bytes because it need to be fast</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Use a context manager so that the files is closed whatever happens. Also, I think the OP is thinking big files (see question comments) so loading the whole file might not be an option.</span>
