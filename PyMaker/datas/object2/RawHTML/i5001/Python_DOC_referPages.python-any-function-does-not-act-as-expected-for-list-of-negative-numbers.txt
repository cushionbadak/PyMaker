<p>I am trying to compare a list of numbers in an if statement with the any() function. I am using python 3.6 in Spyder. The code in question is:</p>
<pre><code>if any(lst) &gt;= 1:
    do_some_stuff
</code></pre>
<p>lst is actually generated by <code>list(map(my_func, other_lst))</code> but after diagnosing my problem I get two behaviors as shown below with my actual lst passed to the any() function:</p>
<pre><code>any([1.535, 1.535, 1.535]) &gt;= 1
&gt;&gt;True
</code></pre>
<p>Which is expected.</p>
<pre><code>any([-0.676, -0.676, -0.676]) &gt;= 1
&gt;&gt;True
</code></pre>
<p>Which is <strong>not</strong> expected.</p>
<p>I've delved deeper and found that any number I can put in lst that is less than 0 yields <code>True</code> in my if statement. Also, converting the 1 to a float doesn't help. After reading <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#truth-value-testing" rel="nofollow noreferrer">"truth value testing"</a>, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19389490/how-do-pythons-any-and-all-functions-work">this post</a>, and extensive time trying to learn the behavior within my program, I am at a loss. Please help, I am pretty new to python. Thanks!</p>

<p>You are comparing the wrong thing. You are comparing the <em>result of any</em> to 1. </p>
<p><code>any(mylist)</code> will return true if any element of the list is nonzero. True is greater than or equal to 1.</p>
<p>So this</p>
<pre><code>any(mylist)&gt;=1
</code></pre>
<p>is equivalent to just</p>
<pre><code>any(mylist)
</code></pre>
<p>What you mean is</p>
<pre><code>any(x&gt;=1 for x in mylist)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Please read the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#any" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>any(iterable) </p>
<p>Return True if any element of the iterable is true. If
  the iterable is empty, return False. Equivalent to:</p>
<pre><code>def any(iterable):
    for element in iterable:
        if element:
            return True
    return False
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>All your <code>any()</code> expression listed will return <code>True</code>, and you are comparing <code>True</code> with 1, that is <code>True</code>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I don't think <code>any([-0.676, -0.676, -0.676]) &gt;= 1</code> is doing what you think it's doing. Perhaps you meant: <code>any(x &gt;= 1 for x in [-0.676, -0.676, -0.676])</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why its <i>not expected</i>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You gave a link to the documentation for truth value testing, but it appears you didn't read it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Total newbie here. Sorry. I see now why everything I was doing is expected. Thank you for everyone's time and extremely fast responses.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, I just realized this pretty much 30 seconds after posting. Sorry, and thank you for your time. Total newbie here.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you, I had a different idea of what an iterable was. Though I just discovered the python glossary, so I will make my best effort to not let this happen again with other terms. Still working on my coding vocabulary. Thanks for your time.</span>
