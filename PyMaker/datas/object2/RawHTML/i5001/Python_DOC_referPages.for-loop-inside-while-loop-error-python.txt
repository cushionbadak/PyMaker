<p>The following Python code below gives a syntax error on the ':' in the for-loop inside the while-loop. Code works fine if for-loop is removed. Have searched this site and Googled around with no answer for this issue. I am learning Python. Want to understand where the issue lies here. Thanks.</p>
<pre><code>banana = True
orange = 0
print("Test1")
while(orange &lt; 10):
    print("Test Orange %s" % orange)
    for(banana == True):
        print("Test Banana")
        banana = False
    orange += 1
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The error is not because of the colon <code>:</code>. You are using for loop to check if <code>banana == True</code>, The structure of <code>for loop</code> is not used like this. Use while loop instead.</p>
<pre><code>while(orange &lt; 10):
    print("Test Orange %s" % orange)
    while(banana == True):
        print("Test Banana")
        banana = False
    orange += 1
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>for(banana == True):
</code></pre>
<p>This line is not correct. 
Do you want to use an if? like this. </p>
<pre><code>banana = True
orange = 0
print("Test1")
while(orange &lt; 10):
    print("Test Orange %s" % orange)
    if banana == True:
        print("Test Banana")
        banana = False
    orange += 1
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">What do you expect the for loop to do?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The for loop expects a loop condition/counter, not a conditional statement. That's the error in your code. Read the documentation here: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#for-statements" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#for-statements</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why do you believe <code>for(banana == True):</code> should <i>not</i> raise a syntax error?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You probably want to just do <code>if banana is True</code> instead of for.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you for link. I expected the for loop to perform like a while loop. Do whatever is in the for loop until that condition is no longer true. The end result of this initial test is to perform the action of the for loop x amount of times depending on a another variable. I just started it more basic and used that as a placeholder.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why not just an <code>if</code> though?</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>if</code> would work as well, It seemed like he wanted to use a loop. That is why I suggested <code>while</code>. @IşıkKaplan</span>
<span class="comment-copy">checking <code>bool</code> object for equality with <code>True</code> is not a good idea at all, just write <code>if banana</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, I know. But for the sake of simplicity to him, I put it that way.</span>
