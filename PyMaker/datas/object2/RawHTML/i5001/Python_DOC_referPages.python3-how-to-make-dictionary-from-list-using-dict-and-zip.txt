<p>I'm learning Python3. I can't solve a problem... Please help me.
I could <strong>input 2 different strings</strong>(One is consisted with <strong>string</strong> another is consisted with <strong>float</strong>).
I'd like to make a dictionary from 2 different lists.
I made first one for <strong>key</strong>, another is for <strong>value</strong>.</p>
<pre><code>input1 = list(map(str, input().split()))
input2 = list(map(float, input().split()))

# output = dict(zip(input1), (input2))
output = dict((input1, input2) for (input1[i], input2[i]) in range(0, len(input2)))
print(output)
</code></pre>

<p>You can make a <code>dict</code> from list of tuples:</p>
<pre><code>numbers = [1,2,3]
words = ['one', 'two', 'three']

dict(zip(numbers, words))
</code></pre>
<p>It's just a matter of switching places of <code>numbers</code> and <code>words</code> lists, and you have keys/values switched too.</p>
