<p>I am trying to push new values to the queues employeeName and employeeSalary()
However I am faced with this error. What am I doing wrong?</p>

<p>This is calls of <code>push</code> on methods. What is the idea? You have <code>push/pop</code> methods on your class, start with calling <code>s1.push</code></p>
<p>Btw, you should probably look into <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.deque" rel="nofollow noreferrer">deque</a></p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<blockquote>
<p>'function' object has no attribute 'push'<br/>
  ...<br/>
  What am I doing wrong?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><code>employeeName</code> and <code>employeeSalary</code> are not queues, the are instance methods (functions) of your class.  They do not have a (callable) <code>push</code> attribute.  They do not contain anything, they do something, so you cannot add to them.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>s1.push("Earl")</code> - push is a method on your class, not on its name which you get by employeeName(). your class is a datacontainer, not an employee - the methods of employeename and salary make no sense to me...</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>employeeName</code> is clearly a method of <code>Stack_2Queues</code> class. Same stands for <code>employeeSalary</code>. You even call those methods before you try to <code>push</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">s1.push didn't work. So the idea is I need to create a stack using 2 queues, is what I presented wrong?</span>
