<p>I have a directory with 1600 photos and I need to save the path to each foto to a list and then to .txt file.  </p>
<p>The photos are enumerated according to the position they should have in the list: <code>img(0), img(1)...</code> and I need this position to be kept.  </p>
<p>What I obtain is this order, so now in list index 2 I have img(10):  </p>
<p><code>img(0)</code> <code>img(1)</code> <code>img(10)</code> <code>img(100)</code> <code>img(1000)</code> <code>img(1001)</code>...<br/>
<code>img(2)</code> <code>img(2)</code> <code>img(20)</code> <code>img(200)</code> <code>img(2000)</code> <code>img(2001)</code>...</p>
<p>Apparently, I'm the only one having this issue because I didn't find any discussion about this problem. Thank you very much for helping me.   </p>

<p>As mentioned by others, the documentation does not guarantee any particular ordering. In your case it appears to be sorted alphabetically/lexicographically. "10" comes before "2" alphabetically. You'll have to prepend 0s to give every file the same number of digits to get the ordering you want <strong>if</strong> this behaviour appears to remain consistent on your machine.</p>
<p>For example, "002" will come before "010".</p>
<p>If you want to be safe (for example need to be able to port your code to other machines/OSes), you'll want to manually sort.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Is it not getting every image file or is it just getting them in a different order than you expected?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It <i>is</i> scanning sequentially; it is just doing so in lexicographic order which encompasses all characters, rather than doing so in numerical order for the numeric portion of the list.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The documentation of <code>os.scandir</code> says that it returns the files in arbitrary order, so you need to apply your desired sorting. You are probably looking for the so called "natural sorting".</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@chepner The documentation says it scans in arbitrary order so I don't think that is the case.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It is scanning sequentially, I think "arbitrary" means that the user doesn't know the ordering relation (could be the creation time? the <i>inode id</i>?). I expect that if no change occurs in a directory structure <code>os.scandir</code> to yield the same result every time it's called.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.scandir" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.scandir</a> According to the documentation, it scans in arbitrary order, not lexicographic. OP should resort after scanning.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@SamCraig you're right, but that's a duplicate</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@SamCraig in practice it does seem not to be arbitrary for the OP though, and I suspect my original answer was useful for his specific case. You're right though, updated my answer to be more correct</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Oh, I see, I think @DennisSoemers solution and the natural sort one (thanks @Jean-FrançoisFabre) can be fine. Thank you very much!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Just as update: natsorted (<a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/natsort" rel="nofollow noreferrer">pypi.python.org/pypi/natsort</a>) solved my problems. Thanks again everyone.</span>
