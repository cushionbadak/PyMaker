<p>Is there a way to inform python (3.6+) that my attribute is a dict of something?</p>
<p>What I'd like:</p>
<pre><code>def classify(self, sentenses: dict(Sentence)):  # &lt;-- dict of Sentence
  for s in sentences:
    a = s.attribute
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>In order to type as a Dict you have to import Dict from typing. The typing module also offers support for other typing kinds as well. Such as: Tuple, List, and Union. You can use these same types to indicate return values.</p>
<pre><code>from typing import Dict


class Sentence:

    def __init__(self):
        self.some_atr = ""
        self.another_atr = ""


def classify(sentences: Dict[str, Sentence]):  # &lt;-- dict of Sentence
  for k, v in sentences.items():
      print(v.some_atr)


s1 = Sentence()
s1.some_atr = "First"

s2 = Sentence()
s2.some_atr = "Second"

sen = {'first': s1, 'second': s2}
classify(sen)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">See <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#type-aliases" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the documentation</a>, e.g. <code>Dict[str, Sentence]</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">What are you mapping from and to?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">"a dict of something" is ambiguous. Do you mean <code>Sentence</code> as key (with something else concrete or generic as value) or as value?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">it worked fine Dave, thanks</span>
