<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I was searching for how to define an empty array and fill it using a text file and got stuck at one point and couldn't find the solution.</p>
<p>My Script is :</p>
<pre><code>array=[]
file=open("path\\file.txt","r")
array.append(file.readline())
array.append(file.readline()) #wanted to put only first 2 line just for learning.
incident_count=len(array)
print(incident_count)
print(array)
</code></pre>
<p>The first problem is that when I'm trying to put elements in array newline character is also attached("\n"). Also is append right function for putting elements in array.    </p>
<p>Second when I'm trying to print the count of array It's printing number of char.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use <code>file.readline()[:-1]</code> this will return all the line except the last character which is <code>\n</code></p>
<pre><code>array.append(file.readline()[:-1])
array.append(file.readline()[:-1])
</code></pre>
<p>You can add <code>[:-1]</code> to avoid the last character which is <code>\n</code> consider this example :</p>
<pre><code>hello\n
world\n
</code></pre>
<p>so when you read your file line by line the <code>\n</code> is include in each line, so to avoid <code>\n</code> you can read the line from index 0 to index <code>-1</code></p>
<pre><code>hello\n
^   ^_______index 4 or -1
|___________index 0
</code></pre>
<p>to understand more, take a look at this :</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/509211/understanding-pythons-slice-notation">Understanding Python's slice notation</a></li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<pre><code>2
['hello', 'world']
</code></pre>
<p>Or like <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48960118/define-an-empty-array-and-fill-from-file-in-python#comment84926799_48960171">Omar Einea</a> mention in his comment you can use :</p>
<pre><code>array.append(file.readline().rstrip())
array.append(file.readline().rstrip())
</code></pre>
<p>In case the last line not have a <code>\n</code></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You could also use: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.splitlines" rel="nofollow noreferrer">str.splitlines() method</a>.</p>
<p>You'll end up with something like this:</p>
<pre><code>array.append(file.readline().splitlines())
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If your trying to append lines from file to list it always comes with "\n" so to avoid this we need to split the content.</p>
<p>Solution 1:</p>
<p><strong>array=[ ]<br/>
with open(r<code>C:\Users\wasim akram\Desktop\was.txt</code>) as fp:<br/>
    array = fp.read().splitlines()<br/>
print(array)</strong></p>
<p>Solution 2 :</p>
<p><strong>myNames=[ ]<br/>
f = open(r"C:\Users\wasim akram\Desktop\was.txt",'r')<br/>
for line in f:<br/>
    myNames.append(line.strip())<br/>
print(myNames)</strong></p>

<span class="comment-copy">I would go for <code>.rstrip()</code> to avoid removing the last character of the last line (in case last line doesn't have <code>\n</code>)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">please can you tell me why we are adding [:-1] or what is it.......</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thank you @OmarEinea this is also true</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thanx for helping me....@YCF_L and @Omar Einea</span>
<span class="comment-copy">.rstrip() working as charm.......thnx again.Just a last question the append function I'm using to add elements to array is it the right way to add...?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thnx for  helping....</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thnx for the help.....could you pls tell me is line a reserved keyword (does it have some specific function) or we can write anything here.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The code samples provided need to be indented to work, since python uses spaces to denote blocks of code.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ronaldo "line" as in the sample above is just a variable.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@phil could you please tell me why we are using a variable and how it's getting just a single line at a time.cause in the above line we are reading the whole text file at once.</span>
