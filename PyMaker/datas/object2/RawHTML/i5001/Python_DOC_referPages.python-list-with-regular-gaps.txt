<p>I want to create a python list with regular gaps. I have a general idea of how I can do it, but is there a short way to do it or an inbuilt function to do this.</p>
<p>Suppose I want to create a list from 1 to 200, with gaps of 50. The list would be [1,..,50,101,..,150], i.e the sequence from 51 to 100 and 151 to 200 is not in the list.</p>
<pre><code>def create_list_step(start,end,step):
     result = []
     current = start
     while current &lt; end:
          smallinterval = current + step
          result = result + list(range(current, smallinterval))
          current = smallinterval + step
    return result
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>One way is to define a function which skips the gaps for you.</p>
<pre><code>from itertools import chain

def gappy(start, rng, n):
    return chain(*(list(range(2*i*rng+1, (2*i+1)*rng+1)) for i in range(n)))

list(gappy(1, 50, 3))

# [1, 2, 3, ..., 48, 49, 50, 101, 102, 103, ...,
#  148, 149, 150, 201, 202, 203, ..., 248, 249, 250]
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I don't think that there is a built in function for that, but this can be easily done using concatenation of <code>range</code>s:</p>
<pre><code>final = list(range(1, 51)) + list(range(101, 151))
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You could use list comprehensions:</p>
<pre><code>start = 5
stop = 17
gap = 3

a = [x for x in range(start, stop + 1) if ((x - start) // gap) % 2 == 0]
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This is one-liner that should do it:</p>
<pre><code>[i for i in range(200) if (i-1)/50%2==0] #Python 2.x
[i for i in range(200) if (i-1)//50%2==0] #Python 3.x
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">probably your are looking for <code>range</code>. For example: <code>list(range(1, 25, 2))</code> <i>(PS: Looks like your example in question is flawed as it doesn't contain equal interval)</i></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Take a look at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-range" rel="nofollow noreferrer">[Python]: range(start, stop[, step])</a> (you might have to combine).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">giving OP benefit of the doubt, he may looking for an extendible / generic function. this is not an unreasonable thing to desire.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MrT My bad, my question was badly phrased. I have updated my question. I was wondering if there was an in-built python function to do this. I tried to search online and the documentation, but I couldn't really find anything.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for replying. I'm sorry that my question was badly phrased and I didn't provide enough information.</span>
