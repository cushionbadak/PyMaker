<p>Can someone link me to an antlr parser already made for python2.
I need to parse python code for variables extraction in any python program.</p>

<p>Take a look at the python <code>parser</code> or <code>ast</code> modules <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/parser.html?highlight=parser#module-parser" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>
