<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I'm trying to select (if present) a month of the year in a dropdown list, where (month) can be any string from 'January' to 'December' (these are also the elements on the dropdown list)<br/>
 But not every month is necessarily on the list.</p>
<pre><code>Select(driver.find_element_by_id("selectMonth")).select_by_visible_text("%s" % (month))  
</code></pre>
<p>"selectMonth" is the id of the list, and the visible text is named according to the month. I have created a loop where I select each month from January to December, but I'm having problems when the month isn't on the list (NoSuchElementException).  </p>
<p>How do I check if the month is on the dropdown list before trying to select it?</p>
<p>There's some good information about NoSuchElementException in this other post (<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47993443">Selenium "selenium.common.exceptions.NoSuchElementException" when using Chrome</a>), but I couldn't use it to solve my problem. It's similar, but not the same.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I think this should do the trick for what you're trying. I am adding the text of each month available in the dropdown to a list, that it will check against before trying to select the current month in the loop.    </p>
<pre><code>MonthSelect = Select(driver.find_element_by_id("selectMonth"))
DropDownOptions = []
# seems like you have the string of each month in a list/array already so I will refer to that
for option in MonthSelect.options: DropDownOptions.append(option.text)
for month in MonthList:
    if month in DropDownOptions:
        MonthSelect.select_by_visible_text("%s" % (month)) 
</code></pre>
<hr/>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p>As @Bob pointed out, you could also catch the <code>Exception</code> as so:</p>
<pre><code>from selenium.common.exceptions import NoSuchElementException

try:
    Select(driver.find_element_by_id("selectMonth")).select_by_visible_text("%s" % (month))
except NoSuchElementException:
    pass
</code></pre>
<p>This way you can try every month, but just pass the months that are not present.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Instead of checking if the element is there you can also consider to assume it is <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-eafp" rel="nofollow noreferrer">easier to ask forgiveness than permission</a>. In other words just try to select the thing, and catch the <code>NoSuchElementException</code> if it fails.</p>
