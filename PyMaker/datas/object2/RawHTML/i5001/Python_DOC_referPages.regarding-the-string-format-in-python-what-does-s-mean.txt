<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I saw a line of code: </p>
<pre><code>re.compile('[%s]' % re.escape(string.punctuation))
</code></pre>
<p>But I have no idea about the function of <code>[%s]</code></p>
<p>Could anyone help me please?</p>
<p>Thank You!</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>It is a string formatting syntax (which it borrows from C).</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>name = input("What is your name? ")
print("Hello %s, nice to meet you!" % name)
</code></pre>
<p>And this is what the program will look like:</p>
<pre><code>What is your name? Johnny
Hello Johnny, nice to meet you!
</code></pre>
<p>You can also do this with string concentation...</p>
<pre><code>name = input("What is your name? ")
print("Hello + name + ", nice to meet you!")
</code></pre>
<p>...However, the formatting is usually easier.
You can also use this with <em>multiple</em> strings.</p>
<pre><code>name = input("What is your name? ")
age = input("How old are you? ")
gender = ("Are you a male or a female? ")
print("Is this correct?")
print("Your name is %s, you are %s years old, and you are %s." % name, age, gender)
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>What is your name? Johnny
How old are you? 37
Are you a male or a female? male
Is this correct?
Your name is Johnny, you are 37 years old, and you are male.
</code></pre>
<p>Now, please, before asking <strong>any more</strong> questions, <strong>see if they exist!</strong></p>
