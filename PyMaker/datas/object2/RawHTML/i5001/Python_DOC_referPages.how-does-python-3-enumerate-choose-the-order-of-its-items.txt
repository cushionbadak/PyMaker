<p>I have a folder with 1,199 CSV files. These files are all of the form 'BCx_mmyyPPO.csv' where <code>x.isin([6, 51, 55, 56, 57, 60, 200, 240, 269, 316, 340, 415])</code> and <code>mmyy</code> is 2-digit month followed by 2-digit year. </p>
<p>A snippet of the folder is below: </p>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4dt4O.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer">folder sample</a></p>
<p>I've written the following Python 3 code take all 1,199 files and jam them into one large CSV file:</p>
<pre><code>import glob
import os
import shutil

path = r'path/to/files'
allFiles = glob.glob(path + '/*.csv')
with open('PPO.csv', 'wb') as outfile:
    for i, fname in enumerate(allFiles):
        with open(fname, 'rb') as infile:
            if i != 0:
                infile.readline()
            shutil.copyfileobj(infile, outfile)
</code></pre>
<p>The print step is functionally unnecessary but is the meat of what I'm trying to figure out. What logic does <code>enumerate()</code> use to choose the order of the items. I can't figure out how/why it chooses 'BC56_0608PPO.csv' as element 0? There really seems to be no rhyme or reason to it but it's problematic. I need the first file to be any of 'BCx_mm16PPO.csv' or 'BCx_mm17PPO.csv'.</p>
<p>My searches for anyone else with this problem are coming up short. I'm probably not looking correctly. Thank you for your assistance.</p>

<p>Enumerate does not change the order of an iterable, it just gives each item an index. The order of <code>glob.glob</code> is dependent on <code>os.listdir</code>, whose order is <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.listdir" rel="nofollow noreferrer">arbitrary</a>.</p>
<p>You can sort it alphabetically by using <code>sorted</code>:</p>
<pre><code>sorted(glob.glob(path + "/*.csv"))
</code></pre>
<p>... or use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">os.path</a> to sort by size or last modification time:</p>
<pre><code>sorted(glob.glob(path + "/*.csv"), key=os.path.getmtime)
sorted(glob.glob(path + "/*.csv"), key=os.path.getsize)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">It's nothing to do with <code>enumerate</code> -it's to do with the order <code>glob</code> returns matching files... Also - please don't post code as images - copy and paste it as a code block so others can read it in your question itself</span>
<span class="comment-copy">please modify your question as requested by jon. When done you unlock the lock from the down-vote. If you do so that person can reconsider removing the downvote if the adjustments improved your question. Moved to editing, end of triage review. Welcome and enjoy SO ;-)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">modified. Thank you for the pointers. And thank you also for clarifying that I was looking in the wrong place. That really helped!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you very much! I was focused on the wrong snippet of the code.</span>
