<p>I have an XML document that has entries that contains URL, basically a Git / Bitbucket URL:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;value&gt;
https://git...com/projects/.../..._config.json?raw&amp;amp;at=dev
&lt;/value&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>So basically this URL points to the dev branch, and I want to replace it such that it points to master by removing the <code>"&amp;amp;at=dev"</code> string.</p>
<p>How do I trim this using regex using the suffix <code>"_config.json?raw"</code> as reference? Can you give both Python and bash script solution? How about when <code>"at=dev"</code> is to be replaced with <code>"at=release"</code>? (Please note that I cannot just replace all occurence of <code>"dev"</code> as the word is too common, so I still need to use <code>"_config.json?raw"</code> as regex reference)</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>with <code>sed</code></p>
<pre><code>sed -E 's/(config.json\?raw)&amp;amp;at=dev\b/\1/' file
</code></pre>
<p>note that you have to escape the question mark.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">What have you tried so far? This is a pretty simple <i>positive lookbehind</i> scenario.  <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Read more here</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">You can try <code>re.sub("(_config.json\?raw.*at=)dev","\\1release",t)</code> where t is your string</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What's the difference between <code>sed -e</code> and <code>sed -E</code>? I'm trying to use <code>sed -i</code> to modify the file but I get some error. Same error results from <code>sed -e</code>.   <code>invalid reference \1 on 's' command's RHS</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">they are different options. <code>-E</code> is to enable regex for <code>\1</code> substitution.  Perhaps try <code>-r</code> instead.</span>
