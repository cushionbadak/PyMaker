<p>I keep on getting this error and I have absolutely no idea why, I have 3 files importing information from each other however this main one only draws information from monster_01.py and its player.py. </p>

Player.battle()
</code></pre>
<p>I've been up and down this code a hundred times, any help would be much appreciated.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The problem is with your <code>get_player_attack</code> method:</p>
<pre><code>def get_player_attack(self):
    player_attack()
</code></pre>
<p>It calls <code>player_attack</code> as if it were a stand-alone function and not another method.  But <code>player_attack</code> <em>is</em> a method of the class <code>Player</code> and therefore may only be called on an instance of <code>Player</code>.</p>
<p>The function should be called like:</p>
<pre><code>self.player_attack()
</code></pre>
<hr/>
<p>Also, stuff like this:</p>
<pre><code>if self.roll == 2 or 4 or 6 :
</code></pre>
<p>is just a problem waiting to happen.  It should be written as:</p>
<pre><code>if self.roll in (2, 4, 6):
</code></pre>
<p>Otherwise, the condition of the if-statement will be interpreted as:</p>
<pre><code>if (self.roll == 2) or (4) or (6):
</code></pre>
<p>which will always evaluate to <code>True</code>.  For more information, see <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15112125/how-do-i-test-one-variable-against-multiple-values">How do I test one variable against multiple values?</a></p>
<hr/>
<p>Finally, you should not be putting all of your methods inside another function named <code>battle</code>.  I don't know what you are <em>trying</em> to do here, but method definitions should be just under the class header:</p>
<pre><code>class MyClass:          # Class header
    def method1(self):  # Definition of the first method
        ...

    def method2(self):  # Definition of the next method
        ...
    ...
</code></pre>
<p>I really think it would be good for you to read some tutorials on Python classes and OOP.  Here are some to get you started:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_classes_objects.htm" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_classes_objects.htm</a></p></li>
</ul>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>It's not clear what you're trying to do within battle().  You haven't defined a <code>self</code> parameter, but neither have you used the @static decorator to indicate you want it to be a static function.  You've defined player_attack within battle, so it can't be an instance method.  The syntax is incorrect.</p>
<p>If you meant battle() to be an instance method, add a self parameter and provide a method body or pass, then make player_attack de-indented.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>choice(choice)</code> is calling the class method with the class method as the parameter. Just do <code>choice()</code>. Self is an argument that is set behind the scenes</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I think there's a bigger problem here. None of these things are actually methods; they're all local functions defined inside <code>battle</code>. So, just adding <code>self.</code> is just going to get a different exception.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I didn't notice that until after I posted.  I really don't know what the OP is trying to do with <code>battle</code>, so I'll just point out the problem.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Well, your answer now covers the first problem the OP is running into and what look like the next two problems he's most likely to face, soâ€¦ hard to beat that.</span>
