<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>So I have a text file that reads something like:</p>
<pre><code>1, 2, 3, 4, 5

2, 3, 4, 5, 6

3, 4, 5, 6, 7

4, 5, 6, 7, 8

...
</code></pre>
<p>I want to read this file into a 2D array in python such that <code>matrix[]</code> array will hold arrays containing integers of each line.</p>
<p>For example, <code>matrix[2][3] == 6</code></p>
<p>I am not sure if my logic or programming is right in this (I am new to python) but here is what I have so far:</p>
<pre><code>matrix = []

i = 0
with open('matrix.txt', 'r') as openfile:
    for line in openfile:
        matrix.append([])
        matrix[i] = int(n) for n in line.split(',')
        i += 1

openfile.close()

print (matrix)
#print (matrix[2][3])
</code></pre>
<p>I get an invalid syntax error covering the nested <code>for</code> statement, as in <code>int (n) for n</code></p>

<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions" rel="nofollow">List comprehensions</a> must be enclosed in square brackets <code>[...]</code>:</p>
<pre><code>matrix[i] = [int(n) for n in line.split(',')]
#           ^                               ^
</code></pre>
<p>Also, there is no reason to do <code>openfile.close()</code> because the with-statement automatically closes the file for you when control leaves its code block (that is what it is for).</p>
