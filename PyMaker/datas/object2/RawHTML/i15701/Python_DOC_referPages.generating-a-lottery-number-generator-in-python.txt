<p>I am an amateur and I need some help in my making of a lottery number generator.
I have got going a while loop where I make a variable set that variable to 0 then I tell python that while that variable is less than 6 it needs to create a random number within a range of 1,49 and I then tell it to add 1 to my variable this then creates 6 numbers within the range of 1,49 although what I need is for these numbers to be in ascending order and with no doubles, so no repeating numbers.</p>

<p>Are you allowed to use Python's <code>random</code> library? If so, this is trivial.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.sample" rel="noreferrer"><code>random.sample</code></a> function takes a population (in your case the numbers 1 to 49), and number of samples to draw (in your case 6). Then you can use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#sorted" rel="noreferrer"><code>sorted</code></a> function to get the numbers in ascending order.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import random
&gt;&gt;&gt; sorted(random.sample(range(1,50), 6))
[2, 9, 20, 30, 33, 46]
</code></pre>
<p>A few more just to show that it is indeed random</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; sorted(random.sample(range(1,50), 6))
[12, 22, 24, 28, 34, 39]
&gt;&gt;&gt; sorted(random.sample(range(1,50), 6))
[1, 11, 20, 21, 24, 37]
&gt;&gt;&gt; sorted(random.sample(range(1,50), 6))
[2, 4, 7, 21, 32, 48]
&gt;&gt;&gt; sorted(random.sample(range(1,50), 6))
[10, 20, 26, 41, 44, 49]
&gt;&gt;&gt; sorted(random.sample(range(1,50), 6))
[4, 5, 6, 21, 33, 41]
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">What code have you tried to write already? Stack Overflow questions require code of your own, and examples make it a lot clearer to us what you're trying to accomplish.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Are you able to write the basic version (not dealing with ascending order and doubles)?  It sounds as if you are describing the steps quite logically so it is just a matter of writing each step.  Can you get a single random number?  If you can do any of the steps then let us know what you have done and what you are stuck with.</span>
