<p>What's the difference between a string literal and an identifier? I tried googling this and ended up being more confused</p>
<p>Specifically interested with the difference in Python, and difference in SQLite</p>
<p>From SQLite Documentation</p>
<pre><code>'keyword'       A keyword in single quotes is a string literal.
"keyword"       A keyword in double-quotes is an identifier.
</code></pre>

<p>An identifier is a variable name. In the following python line</p>
<pre><code>foo = "bar"
</code></pre>
<p><code>foo</code> is an identifier and "bar" is a string litteral. In Python, string litteral can be enclosed in simple (<code>'</code>') or double (<code>"</code>) quotes.</p>
<p>In SQLite (and more generally in SQL), string litterals are enclosed in single quotes. Double quotes are use to force a string containing otherwise special characters to be interpreted as identifiers.</p>
<p>Example assuming a table <code>foo</code> with column <code>bar</code> :</p>
<pre><code>SELECT bar as "Bar", 'zz' as OTHER from foo;
</code></pre>
<p>In this select, the first column will have name <code>Bar</code>. Without the <code>"</code>, the name would have been <code>bar</code> since SQL does not normally distinguishes case. The second column will the the constant <code>zz</code> and the column name will be <code>other</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>"</code> are also useful to have accented chars like <code>éè</code> for non english languages.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>In Python both 'keyword' and "keyword" are just string literals, no difference.</p>
<p>In SQLite, if you want to use a SQLite keyword (not a Python keyword) as a string literal (so a value of a string) you should use ''. If you want to use it as a SQLite identifier, e.g. a table name, you have to use "".</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Let's back up and figure out where you are on definitions. Do you know what a "string literal" is, in the general/theoretical/language-agnostic sense? Do you know what an identifier is?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">BTW, SQLite's behavior here follows that of SQL in general; there's nothing specific to the library.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I don't know the basics unfortunately. Trying to learn here</span>
<span class="comment-copy">SQLite does not have variables; please mention table/column names.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Good as far as it goes, but doesn't cover the cases exhaustively at present; should probably be extended to be explicit about unquoted words in both languages and to provide examples.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">So I can run query on a table without needing to put the table name in quotes. As I understand it a table name is an identifier, so sometimes identifiers don't require quotes?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@canyon289, correct; it's only if you want to preserve case, or use a name that otherwise wouldn't be valid, that quotes are needed for identifiers (such as table or column names) in SQL.</span>
