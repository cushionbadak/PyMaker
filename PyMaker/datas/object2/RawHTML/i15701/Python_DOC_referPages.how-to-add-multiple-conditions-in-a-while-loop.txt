<p>I'm creating a text based game with multiple stats you have to keep up, such as stamina, health, etc. and I am having trouble with what happens if they go below <code>0</code>. I know a while-loop would work I could do:</p>
<pre><code>life = 1
while(life &gt; 0):
    print("You are alive!")
    print("Oh no! You got shot! -1 Life")
    life-1
print("You are dead! Game Over!")
</code></pre>
<p>But I don't know how to do that with multiple conditions such as stamina, hunger, strength etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can combine them into a single test using <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#min" rel="nofollow"><code>min</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>while min(life, health, stamina) &gt; 0:
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Since <code>0</code> evaluates to <code>False</code> in Python, you can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#all" rel="nofollow"><code>all</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>while all((life, stamina, hunger, strength)):
</code></pre>
<p>This will test if all of the names are not equal to zero.</p>
<p>If however you need to test if all of the names are <em>greater</em> than zero (meaning, they could become negative), you can add in a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-generator_expression" rel="nofollow">generator expression</a>:</p>
<pre><code>while all(x &gt; 0 for x in (life, stamina, hunger, strength)):
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can always use <code>and</code> and <code>or</code>. For example:</p>
<pre><code>while (life &gt; 0) and (health &gt; 0) and (stamina &gt; 0):
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You could put <code>if</code> statements into the while loop that check those stats at the start of each iteration.  That way you can handle each event individually.</p>
<pre><code>life = 1
while(life &gt; 0):
    if stamina &lt; 1:
        print "out of stamina"
        break
    if hunger &lt; 1:
        print "You died of hunger"
        break
    print("You are alive!")
    print("Oh no! You got shot! -1 Life")
    life-1
print("You are dead! Game Over!")
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">what happens if you have life, strength and stamina but hunger reaches 0 or less?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">+1 for out of the box thinking</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This won't work if they can be negative.</span>
