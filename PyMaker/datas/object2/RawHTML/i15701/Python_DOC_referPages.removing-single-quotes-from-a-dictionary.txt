<p>I'm trying to remove single quotes from a dictionary, but I get an error when I try to replace them with nothing.
E.g I want <code>{'Zone 1' : '2345', 'Zone 2' : '5678'}</code> to be represented as:</p>
<pre><code>{'Zone 1' : 2345, 'Zone 2' : 5678}
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Simple dict comprehension.</p>
<pre><code>d = {'Zone 1':'2345', 'Zone 2':'5678'}
d = {k:int(v) for k, v in d.iteritems()}
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you are certain that the values will all be integers and are safe to cast, you can do something as simple as:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; for key, val in d.items():
...   d[key] = int(val)
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt; d
{'Zone 2': 5678, 'Zone 1': 2345}
</code></pre>
<p>Note that using <code>.items()</code> works in both Python2 and Python3, <code>.iteritems()</code> is python2 only, irrc.  Performance wise, <code>.items()</code> in Python2 will return a copy (inherent inefficiencies) and <code>.iteritems</code> is a bit better, but in Python3 .items returns a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict-views" rel="nofollow">view</a>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">For starters, what programming language is this?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">We need a lot more context than you have supplied. What language is the dictionary in? What development environment do you have? What tools do you have available for transformation?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Judging by your other question, this is <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python">python</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sorry! Its python and I'm using Pyscripter. Not sure about the development environment</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@bluesky75 Is this for Windows, or Linux, or perhaps Unix (inc. Mac OS)? This can matter. I've edited your question- please accept my edit.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Minor correction, it's <code>comprehension</code> rather than <code>compression</code> (it's too minor of an edit to make).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Oh yeah, early in the morning here, missed that. Somehow I always mispronounce that.</span>
