<p>I want to call a method in running python script from another script.</p>
<p>For eg:   </p>
<p><strong>script1.py</strong> is continuously running. In this script there are methods.</p>
<p>From another <strong>script2.py</strong> i want to call method of <strong>script1.py</strong></p>

<p>What you want is the multiprocessing module and a Manager object. Create a Manager object in script1.py, register the methods you want to call, and then start the server. </p>
<p>The module documentation has a good example of how to do all this. </p>

<p>You can import sript1.py and use function from it, because the script1.py is cached by interpreter. If I understand the question correctly.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">'method of script1.py': Do you want to call the method of the running instance or of a new instance?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@kums from running instance.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why can't you just import methods of script1.py in script2.py.?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Then I believe ans suggested by @Dunes will do the trick. OR can you elaborate more with code?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">So, if you import - <code>import script1</code>, you don't prevent to the running script1.py.</span>
