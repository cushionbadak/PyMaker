<p>Have a look at the strings <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.format" rel="nofollow">format</a> method and the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#formatstrings" rel="nofollow">Format String Syntax</a>.</p>
<pre><code>for i in range(1, 4):
    print('{0:0&gt;3}'.format(i))
</code></pre>
<p>Result:</p>
<pre><code>001
002
003
004
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>assuming your digits are initially in string format:</p>
<pre><code>x = "001, 002, 003, 004, 005"
y = x.split(", ")
total = 0 # total sum of all the numbers
count = 0 # number of values
for i in y:
    total += int(i)
    count += 1

print("Total = %d\nCount = %d" % (total, count))
</code></pre>
