<p>Hey I have a question concerning this </p>
<pre><code>print ("So, you're %r old, %r tall and %r heavy.") % (
    age, height, weight)
</code></pre>
<p>The line doesn't work in python 3.4 do anyone know how to fix this?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You need to apply your formatting to the string, not to the return value of the <code>print()</code> function:</p>
<pre><code>print("So, you're %r old, %r tall and %r heavy." % (
    age, height, weight))
</code></pre>
<p>Note the position of the <code>)</code> closing parentheses. If it helps you understand the difference, assign the result of the formatting operation to a variable first:</p>
<pre><code>output = "So, you're %r old, %r tall and %r heavy." % (age, height, weight)
print(output)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>you write:</p>
<pre><code>print ("So, you're %r old, %r tall and %r heavy.") % (age, height, weight)
</code></pre>
<p>when the correct is:</p>
<pre><code>print ("So, you're %r old, %r tall and %r heavy." % (age, height, weight))
</code></pre>
<p>besides that, you should think about switching to the "new" .format style which is more pythonic and doesn't requice type declaration. Started with Python 3.0 but is backported to 2.6+</p>
<pre><code>print("So, you're {} old, {} tall and {} heavy.".format(age, height, weight))
#or for pinning(to skip the variable expanding if you want something 
#specific to appear twice for example)
print("So, you're {0} old, {1} tall and {2} heavy and {1} tall again".format(age, height, weight))
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>In Python 3.6 f-strings are introduced.</p>
<p>You can write like this</p>
<pre><code>print (f"So, you're {age} old, {height} tall and {weight} heavy.")
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Even though I don't know which exception you get, you can maybe try to use the format function instead:</p>
<pre><code>print ("So, you're {0} old, {1} tall and {2} heavy.".format(age, height, weight))
</code></pre>
<p>And as mentioned within the other answers, you obviously had some issue with your parentheses.</p>
<p>I will still leave my solution as a reference if you want to use <code>format</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You have problem in your syntax, near  <code>...) % (
    age, height, weight)</code>.</p>
<p>You already close the <code>print</code> brfore <code>%</code> operator. that's why <code>print</code> function will not carry the argument you are passing in it.
just do like this in your code,</p>
<pre><code>print ("So, you're %r old, %r tall and %r heavy." % (
    age, height, weight))
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Easier way:</p>
<pre><code>print ("So, you're ",age,"r old, ", height, " tall and ",weight," heavy." )
</code></pre>
</div>
