<p>How to divide a text file that have multiple string to many text files. Like this</p>
<p>inside textfile.txt
string 1
string 2
string 3
string 4
string n+1</p>
<p>then divide to multiple textfile and name the txt file to the string inside textfile.txt</p>
<p>string 1.txt
string 2.txt
string 3.txt
string 4.txt</p>
<p>and so on until the the loop of the string stop until n+1</p>

<p>Something like this will write each line of the input file to a separate output file (if that's what you meant):</p>
<pre><code>with open('textfile.txt', 'rt') as inf:
    for linenum, line in enumerate(inf, start=1):
        filename = 'string {}.txt'.format(linenum)
        with open(filename, 'wt') as outf:
            outf.write(line)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>import csv

with open('inputTextFile.txt', 'rb') as csvfile:
    reader = csv.reader(csvfile, delimiter=' ')
    for fileName in reader:
        open(fileName, 'a').close()
</code></pre>
<p>'a' ensures that if the file already exists and it has some content then it is not overwritten.
This may or may not work depending on the format of your inputTextFile. This is assuming that the strings are delimited by spaces. You can read about csv here: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html" rel="nofollow">https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html</a> </p>

<span class="comment-copy">The format of your input file is unclear -- is each string on a separate line or are the all on one line? If they are all on one line, how are they delimited from one another?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks its working! And I want to ask. That is only print per line. How to print more? Example   in textfile.txt string 1 this is my pen this is my book  string 2 this is my phone this is my ...  and in string 1.txt will have this string this is my pen this is my book  string 2.txt this is my phone this is my ...</span>
