<p>I understand why, in Python, it's a bad idea to have a <em>try..except</em> block that doesn't try to handle specific exceptions.  I can't though, figure out where to find lists of the possible exceptions that can occur with any particular libraries, commands, or methods.</p>
<p>For example, I am currently working with the <em>decode</em> statement as follows:</p>
<pre><code>in_file = in_file.decode(encoding="ISO-8859-1")  # Turn data from unicode to ascii
</code></pre>
<p>How do I know what possible exceptions can be thrown?  In a broader sense, where should I look for this kind of information?</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<p>The built-in exceptions are listed in the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html" rel="nofollow"><em>Built-In Exceptions</em> section</a> of the library documentation. Decoding bytes to Unicode would throw the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#UnicodeDecodeError" rel="nofollow"><code>UnicodeDecodeError</code> exception</a>.</p>
<p>You'd also check the documentation for the method you are calling; you are calling <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes.decode" rel="nofollow"><code>bytes.decode()</code></a> here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The default for <em>errors</em> is <code>'strict'</code>, meaning that encoding errors raise a <code>UnicodeError</code>.</p>

<p>If you're looking for a list of all the builtin exceptions, you can find that in <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/exceptions.html" rel="nofollow">the documentation</a>.  The brief description of each kind gives you a basic idea of when they might be used.  (Note that third-party libraries can also define their own exceptions, for which you'd need to look at the documentation for those libraries.)</p>
<p>If you want to know what exceptions a particular function might throw, you need to look at the documentation for that function.  For instance, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/stdtypes.html#bytes.decode" rel="nofollow">the documentation</a> for <code>decode</code> indicates that it might throw a UnicodeError.</p>

<span class="comment-copy"><i>Built-In Exceptions</i> lists the exceptions that exist. I think OP wants to learn which of these can be thrown by a specific function.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@delnan: yes, I was adding that already :-)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Martijn Pieters Thanks!  I'm working through this and I see that decode might throw a UnicodeError.  Taking that to Built-In Exceptions section I see all the attributes available when the error is raised.</span>
