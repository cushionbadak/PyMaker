<p>I have been asked to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Write a function called <code>start_codon</code> which accepts a DNA sequence as its argument and returns the first codon as a string. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is what I have so far:</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/python

def start_codon(dna):

    codon1 = dna[0:3]
    codonstring = codon1.split(",");
    return codonstring

print (start_codon(“ATGGAACCAACGTCAGTGACTTCGTCAG”))
</code></pre>
<p>However, when I press enter to try and call the function, I get a syntax error:</p>
<pre><code>File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1
    print (start_codon(“ATGGAACCAACGTCAGTGACTTCGTCAG”))
                       ^
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Your <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#grammar-token-stringliteral" rel="nofollow">string literal</a> is malformed.  You must use either quotation marks <code>"..."</code> or apostrophes <code>'...'</code>:</p>
<pre><code>print (start_codon("ATGGAACCAACGTCAGTGACTTCGTCAG"))
# or
print (start_codon('ATGGAACCAACGTCAGTGACTTCGTCAG'))

<p><code>“</code> and <code>”</code> are special characters that are not recognized by Python.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">The sample you posted looks like it has "curly quotes".  You need plain "straight" double or single quote characters.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Note also that your <code>codonstring</code> will be a list, despite its name.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@jonrsharpe How would I make it into a comma separated list? I thought that's what the second argument was</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That's what you're already doing, but the spec says it should return a string.</span>
