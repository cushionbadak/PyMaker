<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I'm using <code>pyserial</code> to read some values from my Arduino.
Using <code>serial.readlines()</code> gives me an array with all the values,
but these values look like: </p>
<ul>
<li><code>b'l: steer left \n'</code></li>
<li><code>b'r: steer right \n'</code></li>
</ul>
<p>How can I get rid of these <code>b'</code> and <code>\n'</code>?
Replacing them didn't work…</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>b</code> is denoting the encoding the string is in – it isn't actually part of the string, so you can't replace it.  Similarly with each <code>'</code> – they denote that it <em>is</em> a string.  (<code>4</code> and <code>'4'</code> are two different things, but <code>print(…)</code> either of them and you'll get identical results.) The only thing you need to do is remove the last character (newline) with</p>
<pre><code>myvar[:-1]
</code></pre>
<p>To re-encode the string, this should be sufficient:</p>
<pre><code>b'string'.decode('ascii')
</code></pre>
<p>If you're using Unicode at all, use</p>
<pre><code>b'string'.decode('utf-8')
</code></pre>
<p>instead.  See the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.4/howto/unicode.html#converting-to-bytes" rel="nofollow">Python manual</a> for more information to this end.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I strongly suggest you become comfortable with Python as a language before starting applications with Arduino.  Hands-on experience/experimentation is A Good Thing (tm), but you should have a pure understanding of the fundamentals before you start.  The Python maintainers have an <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial" rel="nofollow noreferrer">excellent tutorial</a> designed for complete beginners – I suggest you start at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Chapter 3</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Did you try using "print" with the value you get from readlines?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@FredS I thought the same thing you are thinking, but the data is binary. <code>print</code> will act just like <code>repr</code> in this instance.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Seems to work for me when I do "print" in python 2.7.  Maybe it's different in python 3+?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Maybe ... I'm using python3+ and it didn't worked that way ...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks - but maybe I should have explained it better ... I know that I can remove the \n with your suggestion ... However I need a clean output with no " ' ", no 'b' at the beginning ...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">My answer stands as written; <code>b</code> is the <i>encoding</i> of the string; it isn't part of the string itself.</span>
