<p>I want to locate the mro method. So I did:</p>
<pre><code>class Foo():
   pass

class Bar(Foo):
    pass

x = Bar()
</code></pre>
<p>Then I started to poke around inside it by using <strong>dir</strong> eventually I wound up doing <code>dir(builtins)</code> which lists things alphabetically which is nice... but is there a better way to <strong>grep</strong> for stuff? Some way to do:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>dir(builtins)|grep 'mro'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and quickly locate the method</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions" rel="nofollow">list comprehension</a>, you can filter sequence (iterable):</p>
<pre><code>[x for x in dir(builtins) if 'mro' in x]
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">i meant a short way, that is quicker than reading</span>
<span class="comment-copy">... put that in a function?</span>
