<p>I'm wanting to convert a python 3.4.2 program into an executable file. I've tried using PyInstaller and Py2exe, But neither is being ported to the python 3.4.2 suite. </p>
<p>Do I have any alternative way to do this?</p>

<p>Got the solution from an online forum, <a href="http://cx-freeze.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">cx_Freeze</a> is cross-platform and does the same, as that of PyInstaller and it also supports Python 3.4</p>

<p>You can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#python-launcher-for-windows" rel="nofollow"><code>Python Launcher for Windows</code></a> (new in 3.3).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Python launcher for Windows is a utility which aids in the location and execution of different Python versions. It allows scripts (or the command-line) to indicate a preference for a specific Python version, and will locate and execute that version.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">It sounds like the OP wants a stand-alone executable, i.e., a way to distribute a Python script without requiring users to install Python. I don't believe this answers the question.</span>
