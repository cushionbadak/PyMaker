<p>There are functions: <code>assertSequenceEqual</code>, <code>assertListEqual</code> and <code>assertTupleEqual</code> in unittest module.</p>
<p>But how can I achive the opposite behavior? How can I assert that lists are unequal? </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Those functions are actually used by <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestCase.assertEqual" rel="nofollow"><code>TestCase.assertEqual()</code></a>, when both values are the same type and a type-specific method is present.</p>
<p>The inverse is simply to use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestCase.assertNotEqual" rel="nofollow"><code>TestCase.assertNotEqual()</code></a>.</p>
<p>There are no nice 'formatting' options in that case, but if the test fails, that'd means that both lists were equal, so there is no <em>point</em> in showing how they match exactly!</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You should use <code>assertNotEqual</code> to test that two sequences are unequal. The main feature of sequence related assertions is their ability to compute the difference between subjects upon failure.</p>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>assertNotEqual(a,b)</code>? Is that what you wanted? FYI, there are lots of other unittest methods mentioned here - <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/unittest.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/2/library/unittest.html</a>. As far as the doc. is concerned there is no <code>notEqual</code> equivalent for unittest module in Python. There is another unit testing module called PyUnit - but I am not sure if they have this <code>assertNotListEqual(..)</code> type of methods either.</span>
