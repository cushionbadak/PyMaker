<p>I found some Python code of a hangman game. I came accross the following line of code and I'm unable to make any sense of it. </p>
<pre><code># here's the initial values of the variables
guessWord = random.choice(listOfWords)
blanks = "-" * len(guessWord)
alreadyGuessed = set()

# This is the line I fail to understand:
blanks = "".join([char if char in alreadyGuessed else "-" for char in guessWord])
</code></pre>
<p>I would be glad if you explain it's use.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This is called the conditional expression.</p>
<p>It is a one liner, for example:</p>
<pre><code>l = [1,2,3,4]
j = [1,3]

res = []
for i in l:
  if i in j:
    res.append(i)
  else:
    res.append(None)
</code></pre>
<p>You can just write:</p>
<pre><code>res = [i if i in j else None for i in l]
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">read up on list comprehensions</span>
<span class="comment-copy">this <code>char if char in alreadyGuessed else "-"</code> is a ternary operator</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@njzk2: it is the conditional expression, to be precise.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">possible duplicate of <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/394809/does-python-have-a-ternary-conditional-operator">Does Python have a ternary conditional operator?</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Actually, it is called a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#conditional-expressions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">conditional expression</a>.  "Ternary operator" just means an operator that takes three operands.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It is one of several ternary operators. Python only has one at the moment, but the SQL <code>... BETWEEN ... AND ...</code> operator is another. This specific one is called a <i>conditional expression</i>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Just saw your comments, agreed. I was editing my answer, as it was really short.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Maybe there's an error. Shouldn't it rather be <code>res = [i if i in j else None for i in l]</code> ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No, not in this example, as I wanted to put None if i is not in j. There could be tons of other examples, I just created this one...</span>
