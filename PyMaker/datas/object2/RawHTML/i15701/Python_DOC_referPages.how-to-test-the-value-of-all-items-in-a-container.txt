<p>Let's say I have a container such as a dictionary or a list. What is the Python way to test if all of the values of the container are equal to a given value (such as <code>None</code>)?</p>
<p>My naive implementation is to just use a boolean flag like I was taught to do in C so the code could look something like.</p>
<pre><code>a_dict = {
    "k1" : None,
    "k2" : None,
    "k3" : None
}

carry_on = True
for value in a_dict.values():
    if value is not None:
        carry_on = False
        break

if carry_on:
    # action when all of the items are the same value
    pass

else:
    # action when at least one of the items is not the same as others
    pass
</code></pre>
<p>While this method works just fine, it just doesn't feel right given how wonderfully Python handles other common patterns. What is the proper way to do this? I thought perhaps that the builtin <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#all" rel="nofollow"><code>all()</code></a> function would do what I wanted but it only tests the values in a boolean context, I would like to compare against an arbitrary value.</p>

<p>You can still use <code>all</code> if you add in a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-generator_expression">generator expression</a>:</p>
<pre><code>if all(x is None for x in a_dict.values()):
</code></pre>
<p>Or, with an arbitrary value:</p>
<pre><code>if all(x == value for x in a_dict.values()):
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">shouldn't it be <code>x is not None</code> to be consistent with the <code>carry_on</code> in the example?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I think that the example is incorrect because the OP said: "What is the Python way to test if all of the values of the container are <b>equal</b> to a given value (such as None)?"</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Perfect, thanks!</span>
