<p>I created <code>registration/password_reset_subject.txt</code> to change the subject of my password reset email as suggested <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/8457769/9177173">here</a>. However, it does not take effect. </p>
<p>The email subject remains <code>Subject: Password reset on 127.0.0.1:8000</code></p>

<p>Found the answer myself.</p>
<p>I got it to work by placing <code>registration/password_reset_subject.txt</code> in a global template folder.</p>
<p>It is also possible to place <code>registration/password_reset_subject.txt</code> in the template folder of a submodule. 
However, for this to work the module must come before <code>'django.contrib.auth'</code> in the <code>INSTALLED_APPS</code>.</p>
