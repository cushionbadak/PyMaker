<p>I am new to coding and i wanted to make a code that could register people and log them back in. while working on my code i wanted to check if the user wanted to login or register so i made this code in python.</p>
<pre><code>login_or_register = None
while login_or_register != 'login' or login_or_register != 'register':

 login_register = input('Would you like to login or register?')
 login_or_register = login_register.lower()
 login_or_register = login_register
</code></pre>
<p>While loop doesn't stop even if variable meets the conditions. I tried to remove the second condition and it started to work for some reason. 
This is probably a dumb question but please be patient I'm a high school student.</p>
<pre><code>Would you like to login or register?login
Would you like to login or register?register
Would you like to login or register?keeps going :(
Would you like to login or register?
</code></pre>
<p>It is suppose to stop the loop when input is login or register. Output is suppose to be changing variable login_or_register = None to the answer. </p>
</div>

<p>The condition of your loop cannot possibly become true.</p>
<p><code>or</code> returns <code>True</code> if one or both of the two conditions becomes <code>True</code>.
If your input is <code>'login'</code>, the first condition is <code>False</code> and the second is <code>True</code>.</p>
<p>For <code>'register'</code> the first condition becomes <code>True</code> and the second <code>'False'</code>.</p>
<p>In all other cases both conditions are <code>True</code>. Therefore you have created an infinite loop.</p>
<p>A solution would be connecting the two conditions with an <code>and</code> or even better create a list with all allowed inputs and use an <code>in</code> to check if the user input is in that list. That will be more clear if you have more different options the user is allowed to enter.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>login_or_register = None
while login_or_register not in ['login', 'register']:
    login_register = input('Would you like to login or register?')
    login_or_register = login_register.lower()
</code></pre>
<p>You may also want to take a look at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#or" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the python docs for <code>or</code> and <code>and</code></a></p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>login_or_register != 'login' or login_or_register != 'register'</code> will always be True. You probably want to use a logical <code>and</code>:</p>
<pre><code>while login_or_register != 'login' and login_or_register != 'register':
    # ....
</code></pre>
