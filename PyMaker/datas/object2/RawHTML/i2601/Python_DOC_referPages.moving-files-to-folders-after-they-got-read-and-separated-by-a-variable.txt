<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have created a python script that reads a variable <code>FILTER</code> from files in a folder and puts the result on screen. However, there are 4 types of variables and I would like this script to separate them all to the corresponding folders. Like move all of the files to a folder named "V" if they have variable <code>FILTER = V</code>, if they have <code>FILTER = B</code>, then move all of the <code>B</code> ones to folder named "B" The script below works to see which files have which filter on screen.</p>
<pre><code>import glob
import pyfits
import shutil

myList = []
for fitsName in glob.glob('*.fits'):
    hdulist = pyfits.open(fitsName)
    b = hdulist[0].header['FILTER']
    c = b
    myList.append(c)
    hdulist.close()

for item in sorted(myList):
    print item
</code></pre>
<p>Result on screen:</p>
<pre><code>B
B
B
V
V
V
R
R
R
I
I
I
</code></pre>
<p>now with shutil the code i run;</p>
<pre><code>import os
import glob
import pyfits
import shutil

myList = []
for fitsName in glob.glob('*.fits'):
    hdulist = pyfits.open(fitsName)
    hdu = hdulist[0]
    prihdr = hdulist[0].header
    a = hdulist[0].header['FILTER']
    b = a
    if b == "B":
    shutil.move('/home/usr/Desktop/old/', '/home/usr/Desktop/new/B/')
    myList.append(b)
    hdulist.close()
</code></pre>
<p>Now this code works without problem but it moves all the files in Desktop/old/ to Desktop/new/B/ however, some files have b = V and other variables so what is the problem here? How can I specify the names of which files have the filters I desired so that it can automatically move?</p>
<p>so it is like from the code above, if c= FILTERNAME1 move to SOMEFOLDER1 if c = FILTERNAME2 move to SOMEFOLDER2 and so on.. I could not write a working code line for this so any help would be appreciated a lot.</p>
<p>Solution;</p>
<pre><code>import os
import glob
import pyfits
import shutil

for fitsName in glob.glob('*.fits'):
    hdulist = pyfits.open(fitsName)
    hdu = hdulist[0]
    a = hdulist[0].header['FILTER']
    if a == "B":
    shutil.move(fitsName, '/home/usr/Desktop/new/B/')
    if a == "V":
    shutil.move(fitsName, '/home/usr/Desktop/new/V/')
    if a == "R":
    shutil.move(fitsName, '/home/usr/Desktop/new/R/')
    if a == "I":
    shutil.move(fitsName, '/home/usr/Desktop/new/I/')
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use the shutil module to move files.</p>
<pre><code>shutil.move(source,destination)
</code></pre>
<p>Define the source file and the destination files as strings, then pass them to <code>shutil.move()</code> like so:</p>
<pre><code>import shutil
if c == "A":
    shutil.move(source, destA)
elif c == "B":
    shutil.move(source, destB)
</code></pre>
<p>I would also recommend that you learn how if statements work.

<span class="comment-copy">The problem with this is, when I use my print item code, I see B B B B V V V V R R R R I I I I listed downwards so when i put if c == B and shutil.move(source, dest) i get syntax error, same for c == "B" as well. My c is either B V R or I but whatever I give to c == , I get error...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@NapolyoN I don't understand anything that you just wrote. I would like you to edit your question to include the full errors you are getting and include ALL relevant code, input, and output.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">here I included the code fully. The one I use with the result and the one I need with the result.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@NapolyoN You're writing the <code>if</code> statements incorrectly. They need to end with <code>:</code>.  Please read the links I gave you. What you have also won't work because by the time you reach the if statements <code>c</code> no longer exists.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you, I finally understood them all and modified the code up there too. Here now everything works however, all files get moved regardless of what parameter introduce. I explained the final situation up there in details.</span>
