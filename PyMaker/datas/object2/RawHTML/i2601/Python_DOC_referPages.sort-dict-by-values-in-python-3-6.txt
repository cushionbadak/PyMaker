<p>I was looking for a method to sort a dictionary in Python with its values, after a few attempts, is what it comes:</p>
<pre><code>a = {&lt;populated dict...&gt;}
a = {v: k for k, v in a.items()}
a = {v: k for k, v in sorted(a.items())}
</code></pre>
<p>This code seems to work, but I think it's poor for performance, is there a better way?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You do not need to do the double key/value swap, you can do this:</p>
<pre><code>a = {k: v for k, v in sorted(a.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])}
</code></pre>
<p>(<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#sorted" rel="nofollow noreferrer">sorted DOCS</a>)</p>
<h3>Test Code:</h3>
<pre><code>data = dict(a=1, b=3, c=2)
print(data)
data_sorted = {k: v for k, v in sorted(data.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])}
print(data_sorted)
</code></pre>
<h3>Results:</h3>
<p>From CPython 3.6:</p>
<pre><code>{'a': 1, 'b': 3, 'c': 2}
{'a': 1, 'c': 2, 'b': 3}
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>from collections import OrderedDict
</code></pre>
<p>otherwise create a list of keys in the order you want.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">@newbie, not sure how a question that sorts by key is a dupe for one asking for sort by value?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">In what way will this sort the dictionary?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@PeterWood, In CPython 3.6 and Python 3.7+ Dicts are ordered.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I tried your code now and it doesn't sort</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I don't like it as an approach. Insertion sort is a feature since 3.6 but <code>The order-preserving aspect of this new implementation is considered an implementation detail and should not be relied upon</code> from the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.6.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@newbie, your are technically correct.  However, for 99% of the world, CPython is Python.  And for this feature at least, in 3.7 it is no longer an implementation detail.</span>
