<p>A gymnast can earn a score between 1 and 10 from each judge; nothing lower, nothing higher. All scores are integer values; there are no decimal scores from a single judge. Store the possible scores a gymnast can earn from one judge in a tuple. Print out the sentence:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The lowest possible score is ____, and the highest possible score is
  ____."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Use the values from your tuple. Print out a series of sentences, "A judge can give a gymnast _ points."</p>
<p>My Solution:</p>
<pre><code>scores = (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)

for num in scores:
    print('A judge can give a gymnast %d points.' % (num))
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>A judge can give a gymnast 1 points.  
A judge can give a gymnast 2 points.
A judge can give a gymnast 3 points.
A judge can give a gymnast 4 points.
A judge can give a gymnast 5 points.
A judge can give a gymnast 6 points.
A judge can give a gymnast 7 points.
A judge can give a gymnast 8 points.
A judge can give a gymnast 9 points.
A judge can give a gymnast 10 points.

<p>How can I change the first line so that it becomes grammatically correct "A judge can give a gymnast 1 point"?</p>

<p>You can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.6.html#pep-498-formatted-string-literals" rel="nofollow noreferrer">f-strings</a> from python 3.6:</p>
<pre><code>scores = (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)

for num in scores:
    print(f'A judge can give a gymnast {num} point{"s" if num &gt; 1 else ""}.')
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>A judge can give a gymnast 1 point.
A judge can give a gymnast 2 points.
A judge can give a gymnast 3 points.
A judge can give a gymnast 4 points.
A judge can give a gymnast 5 points.
A judge can give a gymnast 6 points.
A judge can give a gymnast 7 points.
A judge can give a gymnast 8 points.
A judge can give a gymnast 9 points.
A judge can give a gymnast 10 points.

<p>You can use a conditional expression to only add the <code>'s'</code> to <code>'point'</code> if the number is greater than <code>1</code>. Also note that using <code>range()</code> is neater than manually typing the scores and <code>.format</code> better than a <code>%</code> (especially when doing multiple formats).</p>
<pre><code>for num in range(1, 11):
    print('A judge can give a gymnast {} point{}.'.format(num, 's' if num &gt; 1 else ''))
</code></pre>
<p>which gives:</p>
<pre><code>A judge can give a gymnast 1 point.
A judge can give a gymnast 2 points.
A judge can give a gymnast 3 points.
A judge can give a gymnast 4 points.
A judge can give a gymnast 5 points.
A judge can give a gymnast 6 points.
A judge can give a gymnast 7 points.
A judge can give a gymnast 8 points.
A judge can give a gymnast 9 points.
A judge can give a gymnast 10 points.
