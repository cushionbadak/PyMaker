<p>I am learning python, and studying the dictionary concept.
Trying to make a new dictionary with key and values but not able to understand why is it giving error...</p>
<pre><code>adict = {}

{
“a” : “apple”
“b” : “balloon”
}

print(adict)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Here is how you would correctly initialize a dictionary with your given keys.</p>
<pre><code>adict = {'a': 'apple', 'b': 'balloon'}
</code></pre>
<p>Here is how you would initialize an empty dictionary.</p>
<pre><code>adict = {}
</code></pre>
<p>The code you have just produces an invalid syntax error. It's unclear from your post which one you want. Also, good to note that you can also use, double quotes <code>"</code> or single quotes <code>'</code>. As one of the comments pointed out, your non-ascii quotes could also cause an error.</p>
<pre><code>adict = {"a": "apple", "b": "balloon"}
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Firstly, some syntax errors,
try:</p>
<pre><code>adict = {
"a" : "apple",
"b": "balloon"
}
print(adict)
</code></pre>
<p>Note the commas, and also the single pair of curly braces.</p>
<p>Secondly, where did you get those quotes? Did you copy and paste them from some place like a website or pdf? They are non-ascii so python won't understand them. Try typing them yourself. Thanks to chepner for pointing that out in the comments.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The following code would work.    </p>
<pre><code>adict = {}

adict["a"] = "apple"
adict["b"] = "baloon"

print(adict)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>In the first line, you created an empty dictionary and assigned it to “adict”.</p>
<p>You need to separate each key-value pair with commas and make sure that your keys do not have quotation Mars. Only the values have quotation marks (if they are strings).</p>
<pre><code>adict = {
    “a”: “apple”, 
    “b”: “balloon”
}
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">What error are you getting? Is the problem the non-ASCII quotes you are using here?</span>

<span class="comment-copy">Please ignore the quotes, I typed the question with phone pad, and not computer, but I was practising on computer and hence had used correct quotes..</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I think this is being downvoted because it isn’t the simplest way to do this. It’s easier for a small dictionary like this to write it as shown in the other answers.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Are you sure it will execute?</span>
