<p>If I have <code>x</code> as the list of items, why does the <code>x[True]</code> or <code>x[False]</code> modifies the first or second elements of the list?</p>
<p>Please see code sample below:</p>
<pre><code>x = [1, 2]
x[True] = 'a'
x[False] = 'b'
print(x) # --&gt; ['a', 'b']
</code></pre>
<p>Please give explanation why this code works?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Since x is the <code>list</code> the passed index is being converted to the integer representation. The integer representation of the True and False are 1 and 0 respectively. As result it leads to the modification of the first and second elements in the list. From the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#the-standard-type-hierarchy" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python Data model documentation</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These represent the truth values False and True. The two objects
  representing the values False and True are the only Boolean objects.
  The Boolean type is a subtype of the integer type, and Boolean values
  behave like the values 0 and 1, respectively, in almost all contexts,
  the exception being that when converted to a string, the strings
  "False" or "True" are returned, respectively.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition to the sample with the list that causes interesting behaviour for the dictionary:</p>
<pre><code>x = {}
x[True] = 'a'
print(x) # --&gt; {True: 'a'}
x[1] = 'b' 
print(x) # --&gt; {True: 'b'} and not {True: 'a', 1: 'b'}
</code></pre>
