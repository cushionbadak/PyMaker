<p>I am very curious about the different result of two calculations in python.</p>
<pre><code>5^(4-4) + 9 = 12

(5^(4-4)) + 9 = 14
</code></pre>
<p>Please explain the difference.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This is a question of operator precedence.  </p>
<p><code>+</code> is more strongly binding than <code>^</code>.</p>
<p>The precedences are documented <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#operator-precedence" rel="noreferrer">here</a>. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">Take a look at operator precedence (order of operations) <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#operator-precedence" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/reference/â€¦</a>. Also note <code>^</code> is the "bitwise xor" operator. You might be looking for <code>**</code> which is for raising powers</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you for comment. I know exactly the bitwise XOR ^. But I am still confused about two different results.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you for the comment. I understand the problem. 5^(4-4) + 9 = 5^9 = 12.</span>
