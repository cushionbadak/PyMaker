<p>I have 1000 files, and the name of these are "numbers", for example, 2323.csv.
I have these name in a file called 1.txt. 
Now I want to open these files one by one in python, using 1.txt to open them.</p>
<p>How can I do this?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Why not this?</p>
<pre><code>with open('1.txt', 'r') as listFile:
    for line in listFile:
        with open(line.rstrip(), 'r') as individualFile:
            # do stuff
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Roughly and very basic but understandable code (no error handling).</p>
<pre><code>with open('1.txt', 'r') as f:
  for line in f.readlines():  # This assumes each line has a number
     with open('.'.join([line, 'csv']) as cf:
         file_content = cf.readlines()
         print(file_content)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">sample of 1.txt file:        2323   \n  2425   \n   2748.    So it has one column consists of names of files (without .csv, but it is very easy to add .csv at the end of them in the case of need)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I would add <code>with open(line.rstrip(), 'r') as individualFile:</code> if each filename is on a line</span>
<span class="comment-copy">how do we know that file has names in a single column ???</span>
<span class="comment-copy">how can I use  "data = pd.read_csv('line.csv')", where "line" is the lines of 1.txt?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Ares, the point is that with this method, I cannot put a name to the column.For example I usually use this: data = pd.read_csv('1.csv',names=["k0","k1","k2","k3","k4"]).   How can I add name to each column by with open(...) ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ReihanehKouhi I think what you're looking for in this case is a csvreader then: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">You don't need to read the file into a list with <code>f.readlines</code>, you can loop directly over <code>f</code>. But either way, you need to get rid of the <code>\n</code> at the end of each line.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@PM2Ring yes, you are right. Good catch, it's being too long I don't use python this way.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">how can I use "data = pd.read_csv('line.csv')", where "line" is the lines of 1.txt?</span>
