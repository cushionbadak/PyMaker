<p>I have a list of file like the following</p>
<pre><code>'TRIAL_20134_75690_TOTAL_2018-08-12-17-18.csv'
</code></pre>
<p>I want to rename them the parte after the last underscore, such as the file will be renamed like:</p>
<pre><code>'TRIAL_20134_75690_TOTAL.csv'
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Use <code>os.rename</code> from the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.rename" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>os</code></a> library to do the renaming.</p>
<p>To get the sting up to the last index of an underscore (<code>_</code>), use the <code>rindex</code> method of <code>string</code>.</p>
<p>You also need to concatenate the extension back on.</p>
<p>I.e.</p>
<pre><code>import os
f = 'TRIAL_20134_75690_TOTAL_2018-08-12-17-18.csv'
os.rename(f, f[:f.rindex('_'] + '.csv')
</code></pre>
