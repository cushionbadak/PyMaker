<p>I have url of a wav format audio file which is basically an audio of a call . I want to find the duration of the wav file, which means the duration of the call. I do not want to download the wav file, as I have to repeat this set for a large number of such records. Is there any way to do this in python ?</p>

<p>A little more information about where the audio file would be helpful.
Such as the URL or the location of the file. You might be able to use beautiful soup to scrape for the length if it's mentioned on a webpage, otherwise, you might be able to use some sort of an API call.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/quodlibet/mutagen" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://github.com/quodlibet/mutagen</a> would helpful to look at</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You will need to download <em>some</em> of the WAV files to be able to read the header and parse it with e.g. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/wave.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the builtin <code>wave</code> module</a>.</p>
<p>Alternately, if all of the files are uncompressed PCM, and have the same format, you can just look at the file size (which you can get with a HTTP HEAD request) and guess the approximate duration.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">The url is basically something like <a href="http://xxyyzz/..../filename.wav" rel="nofollow noreferrer">xxyyzz/..../filename.wav</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Do you have the length available on the webpage?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, on opening this url an audio player opens which has the duration as well.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I don't know if this would be helpful to you, but try reading the source code of the webpage and if you see the Audio length in anywhere then you can use this, <a href="https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc</a> to scrape the webpage and look for the length</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That data isn't available in source.</span>
