<p>I am using selenium to scrape an infinite scrolling page.</p>
<p>I am trying to use this code:</p>
<pre><code>import time
import pandas as np
import numpy as np

from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By

browser = webdriver.Chrome()
url = 'https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&amp;q=csubwaystats%20since%3A2018-05-28%20until%3A2018-08-28'

browser.get(url)
time.sleep(1)

SCROLL_PAUSE_TIME = 0.5

# Get scroll height
last_height = webdriver.execute_script("return document.body.scrollHeight")

while True:
    # Scroll down to bottom
    webdriver.execute_script("window.scrollTo(0,document.body.scrollHeight);")

    # Wait to load page
    time.sleep(SCROLL_PAUSE_TIME)

    # Calculate new scroll height and compare with last scroll height
    new_height = webdriver.execute_script("return document.body.scrollHeight")
    if new_height == last_height:
        break
    last_height = new_height
</code></pre>
<p>I obtained this code from multiple sources, the most recent being:</p>
<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20986631/how-can-i-scroll-a-web-page-using-selenium-webdriver-in-python/47202073#47202073">How can I scroll a web page using selenium webdriver in python?</a></p>
<p>I updated it to include "webdriver" instead of "driver" because I import selenium as webdriver. It doesn't work otherwise.</p>
<p>My issue is that when I run the code I get:</p>
<pre><code>AttributeError: module 'selenium.webdriver' has no attribute 'execute_script'
</code></pre>
<p>I don't really understand what this means and how to fix it? I haven't been able to find information on this.</p>
<p>I am new to python and so am probably missing something obvious but any advice would be appreciated.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>webdriver</code> is the name of the module, not your instance of it.  In fact, you assigned the instance you created to the name <code>browser</code> with this line: <code>browser = webdriver.Chrome()</code></p>
<p>so instead of calling <code>webdriver.execute_script()</code> (which will give you an <code>AttributeError</code>), you must call it using your instance, like this: <code>browser.execute_script()</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>To make it work you have to create an instance of webdriver, e.g.:</p>
<pre><code>from selenium import webdriver

driver = webdriver.Chrome() # webdriver.Ie(), webdriver.Firefox()...
last_height = driver.execute_script("return document.body.scrollHeight")
</code></pre>
<p>You can download Chromedriver from <a href="https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html?path=2.41/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a> </p>
<p>You also need to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17436598/getting-chrome-to-launch-via-selenium">add path to Chromedriver to your environment variable PATH</a> or just put downloaded file into the same folder as your Python executable...</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>AttributeError: module 'selenium.webdriver' has no attribute 'execute_script'
</code></pre>
<p>You are getting this error because 'execute_script' is not a <em>class attribute</em>, you just can not use it directly. Since it is an <em>instance attribute</em> you should create an instance of the class. Please check <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a> to learn more about <em>classes</em>.</p>
<p>This will work fine now since 'execute_script' is <em>running as an instance attribute</em>.</p>
<pre><code>last_height = browser.execute_script("return document.body.scrollHeight")
</code></pre>
<p>Your final code would have looked like this:</p>
<pre><code>import time
import pandas as np
import numpy as np

from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By

browser = webdriver.Chrome()
url = 'https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&amp;q=csubwaystats%20since%3A2018-05-28%20until%3A2018-08-28'

browser.get(url)
time.sleep(1)

SCROLL_PAUSE_TIME = 0.5

# Get scroll height
last_height = browser.execute_script("return document.body.scrollHeight")

while True:
    # Scroll down to bottom
    webdriver.execute_script("window.scrollTo(0,document.body.scrollHeight);")

    # Wait to load page
    time.sleep(SCROLL_PAUSE_TIME)

    # Calculate new scroll height and compare with last scroll height
    new_height = webdriver.execute_script("return document.body.scrollHeight")
    if new_height == last_height:
        break
    last_height = new_height
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">please update the question with the exact code you use</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Just did so. Thank you!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ahh, that's my bad. I didn't include the code where I did just this. I have     from selenium import webdriver driver = webdriver.Chrome('location of chromedriver')    ... and then I continued with what was above</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sorry I am not sure how to format comments properly</span>
<span class="comment-copy">update the question with proper code</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@agra94 , you should not just define <code>driver</code>, but use it in following lines (note that I used <code>driver.execute_script()</code>, not <code>webdriver.execute_script()</code>)</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><i>"Do not import selenium as webdriver, import webdriver from selenium"</i>... Considering exception log OP has already imported <code>webdriver</code> <i>from</i> <code>selenium</code>. <i>"You need the webdriver class"</i>... <code>webdriver</code> is not a <i>class</i>, but module where <code>WebDriver</code> class is defined. <i>"selenium is a python program that has python classes in it"</i>... No comments :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sorry, I should have clarified. I did use 'from selenium import webdriver' (without the quotations of course) I also did create an instance of webdriver but I use chrome. I have it in my path as well.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">indentation is incorrect</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Andersson Please forgive my ignorance about that, I'm a student who is trying to give answers which my efforts in them. I should not have bring up things I do not know though.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@agra94 Well, I am sorry that I did not read your question properly. It is abvious that you already can automate stuff with Chrome, it is my bad.</span>
