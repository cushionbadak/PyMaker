<p>I am trying to sort a list of named tuples by their last 'element', in decreasing sequence (from largest to smallest). Here's a snippet of the list of namedtuples that I am trying to sort:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a =[]
&gt;&gt;&gt; a += [p]
&gt;&gt;&gt; a
[Point(x=11, y=22)]
&gt;&gt;&gt; total = []
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = Point(1,33)
&gt;&gt;&gt; b
Point(x=1, y=33)
&gt;&gt;&gt; c = Point(99, 2)
&gt;&gt;&gt; total += [b] + [c] + [p]
&gt;&gt;&gt; total
[Point(x=1, y=33), Point(x=99, y=2), Point(x=11, y=22)]
&gt;&gt;&gt; sorted(total, key = lambda x: x[y], reverse = True)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;pyshell#26&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
    sorted(total, key = lambda x: x[y], reverse = True)
  File "&lt;pyshell#26&gt;", line 1, in &lt;lambda&gt;
    sorted(total, key = lambda x: x[y], reverse = True)
NameError: name 'y' is not defined
&gt;&gt;&gt; sorted(total, key = lambda x: x['y'], reverse = True)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;pyshell#27&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
    sorted(total, key = lambda x: x['y'], reverse = True)
  File "&lt;pyshell#27&gt;", line 1, in &lt;lambda&gt;
    sorted(total, key = lambda x: x['y'], reverse = True)
TypeError: tuple indices must be integers or slices, not str
</code></pre>
<p>However, I keep getting the errors above.. Is there a way to do this for such instances of namedtuple?</p>
<p>As a rough guide, the list of namedtuples is <code>total</code>, and I am trying to sort the tuples from largest <code>y</code> to smallest <code>y</code>. So the result should look something like:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; total
[Point(x=1, y=33), Point(x=11, y=22), Point(x=99, y=2)]
</code></pre>
<p>The documentation for namedtuple can be found at: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.namedtuple" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.namedtuple</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks and some help will be deeply appreciated!</p>
