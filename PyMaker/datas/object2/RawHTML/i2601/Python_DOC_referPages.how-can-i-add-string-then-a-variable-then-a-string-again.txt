<p>I am a novice Python user using 3.6 on Python IDLE. I wrote a program for school to calculate distance traveled depending on speed and time. I was able to get the program to display the numerical value of the distance which is great, but I would like it to also show "miles" after the numerical value that way it shows the unit of measurement. Here is my code:</p>
<p>def main():</p>
<pre><code>#variable for speed
speed = 60

#variables for time
time1 = 5
time2 = 8
time3 = 12

#variables for distance
distance1 = time1 * speed
distance2 = time2 * speed
distance3 = time3 * speed

#display the distance equations
print ("The distance the car will travel in 5 hours is ", distance1 + " miles")
print ("The distance the car will travel in 8 hours is ", distance2 + "miles")
print ("The distance the car will travel in 12 hours is ", distance3 + "miles")
</code></pre>
<p>You can see where I tried to concatenate the first string, variable, and the second string. This breaks my code. Any help is appreciated!</p>

<p>I suggest using the latest coolest formatting option implemented in Python, which is the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.6.html#pep-498-formatted-string-literals" rel="nofollow noreferrer">formatted string literals</a>:</p>
<pre><code>print(f"The distance the car will travel in 5 hours is {distance1} miles")
</code></pre>
<p>But you may also do any of these:</p>
<pre><code>print("The distance the car will travel in 5 hours is {} miles".format(distance1))
print("The distance the car will travel in 5 hours is %s miles" % distance1)
print("The distance the car will travel in 5 hours is", distance1, "miles")
print("The distance the car will travel in 5 hours is" + str(distance1) + " miles")
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">You need to call <code>str()</code> on numerical values, so <code>str(distance1)</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This worked perfectly! I used the new formatting you suggested, really nice and simple. Thanks a million zvone.</span>
