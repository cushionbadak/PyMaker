<p>I am trying to create a random order generator. I have a list of ten names and want to write a program that returns the same list in a random order. </p>
<p>Here is my code which I'm told has invalid syntax in line 11</p>

<p>I am trying to complete the problem using filtering and recursion to further my understanding of these tools.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Post code into the question and don't forget to format it properly.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The error is because your <code>if: else:</code> statement makes no sense. You use this statement for doing one thing or another. However you have a random block of code (pick, new_list) between the if block (which is 1 line, a return statement) and the else block.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@WillCole Okay, good. Your interpreter has a weird font. Which is just one more reason that you should always post text here, as others have requested, not pictures.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">When I use random.shuffle(), the terminal prints 'None'. Am I wasting my time trying to solve it with filtering and recursion?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Will Call shuffle on its own, then print out the list. Don't print out the shuffle method, which returns nothing</span>
<span class="comment-copy">random.shuffle() works in place, it does not return anything</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@WillCole Considering you're not creating this code for actual use, but rather to educate yourself, no you are not wasting your time. I would recommend you try to fix your approach first, it shows that you have several lessons to learn.</span>
