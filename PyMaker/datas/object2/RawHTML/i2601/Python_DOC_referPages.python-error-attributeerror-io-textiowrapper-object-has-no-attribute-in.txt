<p>I am trying to insert a column into a csv file and increment the column by one.
I am getting the error above in the subject:</p>
<pre><code>with open('C:\\temp\\XXX\\names.csv','r') as rf:
    with open('C:\\temp\\XXX\\Testcopyx.csv','w') as wf:
        for line in rf:
            wf.write(line)                
            wf.insert(0, 'New_ID', range(0, 0 + len(wf)))
            # wf
wf.close
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Below I use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>csv</code></a> module to transcribe a csv file from one file to another, adding a column at the end that increments along with the rows</p>
<pre><code>import csv

infile  = 'C:\\temp\\XXX\\names.csv'
outfile = 'C:\\temp\\XXX\\Testcopyx.csv' 

with open(infile, newline='') as rf, open(outfile, 'w+', newline='') as wf:
    reader = csv.DictReader(rf)
    writer = csv.DictWriter(wf, [*reader.fieldnames, "New ID"])  # Add the new column name
    writer.writeheader()
    for count, row in enumerate(reader):
        row.update({"New ID": count})  # update the row to have the new column
        writer.writerow(row)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Very close but it is adding in a blank row</span>
<span class="comment-copy">At the top?  Does your original file have headers?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Or after every line?  In that case open each file with <code>newline=''</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">I added newline=''     still getting a new line after every row</span>
