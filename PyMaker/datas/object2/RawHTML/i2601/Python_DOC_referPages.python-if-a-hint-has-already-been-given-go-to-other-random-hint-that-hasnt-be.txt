<p>Im making this game that you guess the number, and it gives you hints to what that number is. I made this for the hint system.</p>
<pre><code>if str(userinp) == ('hint'):
      g = randint(1,3)
      if g == 1 and g1 == True:
        print('The number',(hint_1),'than 50')
        g1 = False
      elif g == 2 and g2 == True:
        print('The number',(hint_2))
        g2 = False
      elif g == 3 and g3 == True:
        print('the number',(hint_3))
      elif g == 4 and g4 == True:
        print('WIP')
</code></pre>
<p>How would I make it so if there was a duplicate hint was chosen with <code>g = randint(1,3)</code>, it would go to another unused hint? </p>
<p>Thanks :) . </p>

<p>Your mistake is in using separate variables for your hints. Put them in a list instead, so you can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.shuffle" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>random.shuffle()</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code># at the start
hints = [
    "The number {} than 50".format(hint_1)
    "The number {}".format(hint_2)
    "The number {}".format(hint_3)
]
random.shuffle(hints)

# in the game loop
if userinp == 'hint':
    if not hints:
        print("Sorry, you are out of hints")
    else:
        hint = hints.pop()  # take **one** of the randomised hints
        print(hint)
</code></pre>
<p><code>random.shuffle()</code> puts the <code>hints</code> list in random order, and repeated <code>hints.pop()</code> calls will pick the next available hint, in random order. </p>
<p>Note that now there is no need to keep separate hint flags anymore either, when the <code>hints</code> list is empty, the user is out of hints.</p>
<p>As a side note: there is no point in using <code>== True</code> in boolean tests. <code>if</code> already tests for boolean truth, adding <code>== True</code> is redundant (and when you <em>must</em> test for a boolean object only you'd use <code>is True</code> as <code>True</code> and <code>False</code> are singletons).</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You could put the hints in a list and then select a random entry in the list and then remove it from the list.</p>
<pre><code>hints = ["Something warm", "Fuzzy", "Meows"]
if str(userinput) == "hint":
    hintn = randint(0,len(hints)-1) # assuming the range of randint is inclusive
    print(hints[hintn])
    del hints[hintn]
</code></pre>
<p>Or as Martijn suggested in the comments, shuffle it once and then pop from it.</p>
<pre><code>from random import shuffle
hints = ["Something warm", "Fuzzy", "Meows"]
shuffle(hints)
#...
if str(userinput) == "hint":
    if not hints:
        print("No hints remaining")
    else:
        print(hints.pop())
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">I think you may need to expand on your code; for instance, where is <code>g1</code> defined? Where is <code>hint_1</code> defined?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why pick a a new random number each time? Just shuffle <b>once</b>, at the start.</span>
