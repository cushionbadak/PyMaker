<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have a path that I have assigned to a string:</p>
<pre><code>string = 'pathos/llb_cube/uni/ToolSub.pm'
</code></pre>
<p>However the 'llb' prefix can be different string for each computer and I need to assign it to an arbitrary value that will read whatever the user's computer has set for this specific directory such as:</p>
<pre><code>string = 'pathos/*_cube/uni/ToolSub.pm'
</code></pre>
<p>I cannot figure out what function or regex to use for this however.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use the dot <code>.</code> to mean 'any character':</p>
<pre><code>string = r'pathos/.*_cube/uni/ToolSub\.pm'
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><p>I escaped the dot at the end of the string. </p></li>
<li><p>The <code>*</code> asterisk denotes 0 or more repetitions. </p></li>
<li><p>I used a raw string literal: <code>r'...'</code> so that I can write backslashes without having to escape them. </p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>If you need a certain number of characters use <code>.{x}</code>.</em> Now you can use regex to match your paths</p>
<pre><code>for path in path_list:
    match = re.match(string, path)
    if match:
        print(match.group(0))
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">"read whatever the user's computer has set for this specific directory" -- what does this mean? Have you solved this part yourself?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Have a look at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">pathlib</a> which supports globs of this type. Better suited than a regex.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">So the program is returning the string as simply just pathos/.*_cube/uni/ToolSub\.pm rather than recognizing '.*' to be a regex. :( Therefore when I try to check if the file path exists it is not recognizing because it is reading '.*_cube'</span>
