<p>So I thought I found a typo in code I was working on. I thought 'not' would operate on string "eta" and make it False and False is not in the List,so nothing should print -  however in both the below case "Eta not found" is printed. I guess this has something to do with order of evaluation that both statements are equal, right?</p>
<pre><code>if not "eta" in ["alpha", "beta", "gamma"]:
   print ("Eta not found")

if "eta" not in ["alpha", "beta", "gamma"]:
   print ("Eta not found")
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>in</code> has a  <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#operator-precedence" rel="nofollow noreferrer">higher precedence</a> than <code>not</code>, so <code>not x in a</code> means <code>not (x in a)</code>. Keep in mind two things though.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>not in</code> is <em>a new operator</em> by itself, not just a conjuction of <code>not</code> and <code>in</code>. Actually, <em>it couldn't be</em>: the <code>not</code> operator has to be followed by an expression, not by another operator.</li>
<li>the python interpreter seems to convert <code>not x in a</code> to <code>x not in a</code></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The result is the same in both cases because slightly different syntax for the same statement should result in equal results, right? And</p>
<p><code>if not "eta" in ["alpha", "beta", "gamma"]:</code></p>
<p>is the same as:</p>
<p><code>if not ("eta" in ["alpha", "beta", "gamma"]):</code></p>
<p>which is equivalent to:</p>
<p><code>if ("eta" not in ["alpha", "beta", "gamma"]):</code></p>

<span class="comment-copy">what is your question?</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>if (not "eta") in ["alpha", "beta", "gamma"]:    print ("Eta not found")</code>  :  Run this , This should make it clear for you.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thank you that clarifies my doubt, didn't know 'not in' was considered a separate operator.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@physicist: it <i>had</i> to be that way, see edited answer</span>
