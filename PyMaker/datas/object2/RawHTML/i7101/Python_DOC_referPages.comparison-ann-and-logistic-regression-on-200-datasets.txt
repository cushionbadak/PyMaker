<p>I am trying to compare the performance of an ANN and the logistic regression on 200 different datasets. Every dataset is named <code>Dataseti where i is a number from 15 to 214</code>. Therefore I run a loop:</p>
<pre><code>for i in range(15,215):
</code></pre>
<p>and let the ANN and the logistic regression be trained and classifying the data. What I want to catch is the Error of the logistic regression:</p>
<pre><code>"ValueError: This solver needs samples of at least 2 classes in the data, but the data contains only one class: 0.0"
</code></pre>
<p>When the error is catched I want that this dataset is skipped and it will be proceeded with the next one (i+1). </p>
<p>Is this somehow possible? I am quite new to programming and have no clear idea how to handle this exception. I already thought about doing it somehow with a if else formulation:</p>
<pre><code>if(dataset[:,-1].max() == 1)
....
else: 
</code></pre>
<p>But I do not know what to take into the else expression. Would be great if anyone could help me on this issue. Thanks!</p>

<p>Use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#handling-exceptions" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>try</code>/<code>except</code></a>.  Here's some pseudocode for your specific case:</p>
<pre><code>for i in range(15,215):
    dataset = datasets[i]

    # first, try to evaluate your desired code
    try: 
        ANN(dataset)
        logistic(dataset)

    # if a ValueError occurs, catch it, report on it, and continue
    except ValueError as e: 
        print("Error on dataset {i}: {err}".format(i=i, err=e))
</code></pre>
<p>And here's a working example with toy data:</p>
<pre><code>data = [1, 2, "foo", 3]

for i in range(0,4):

    try:
        print(int(data[i]))

    except ValueError as e:
        print("Error on item {i}: {err}".format(i=i, err=e))
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>1
2
Error on item 2: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'foo'
3
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Wow thanks. I just missunderstood the logic and have put the try before the for loop. Dumb mistake :D</span>
