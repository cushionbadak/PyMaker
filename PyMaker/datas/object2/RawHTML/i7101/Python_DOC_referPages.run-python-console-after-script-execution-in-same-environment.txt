<p>Is there a way to execute a Python script, yet stay in the Python shell thereafter, so that variable values could be inspected and such?</p>

<p>For those who use IPython you can use the <code>embed()</code> function for some extra flexibility since it allows you to drop into a shell anywhere in your program:</p>
<pre><code>from IPython import embed

def some_function(args):
    # ... do stuff ...

    embed() # drop to shell here

    # ... back to the function ...
</code></pre>

<p>Metaphox nailed it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think you are looking for python -i ./file.py, where the -i flag
  will enter interactive mode after executing the file. If you are
  already in the console, then execfile. – Metaphox 2 mins ago</p>

<p>But I want to thank for the other suggestions as well, which go beyond the original question yet are useful!</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I am not 100% sure if this is what you want, but you could try using the python debugger <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">pdb</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">The IDLE which ships with Python (you still have to download it on Linux) <a href="https://inventwithpython.com/chapter7.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">has a built-in debugger</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you just want to run a Python script and have a REPL afterwards, IDLE is really pretty nice. Just open the file, run it, and then you have the REPL already there.</span>
