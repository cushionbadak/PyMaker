<p>Good evening community,</p>
<p>I'm currently writing a python script which outputs me a variable that contains several values. The name of the variable is 'y'( to be more precisely: I defined y as an array y= []) it gets filled with position data in form of x,y,z coordinates by a function. When i print the variable y the data looks like the following: </p>
<pre><code>[[[ 22.67971815  -8.74924581  74.37963044]]  

[[[  0.80132995  -9.97601029  73.91042767]]]  

[[[-20.7922284  -12.16091024  71.74796926]]] 
</code></pre>
<p>My question:</p>
<p>Is there a way to remove the empy rows between the data rows? In addtion, is it possible to remove the brackets <code>([[[...]]])</code> of the variable y ?</p>
<p>Glad for any any help and thank you in advance </p>

<p>To remove the brackets you can use list <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">list comprehension</a>. In your case, I would do something like the following.</p>
<pre><code>stripped_y = [item.strip("[]") for item in y]
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Can you provide a code example, please?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks foryour reply. Applying your suggestion i receive the following Error msg: AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'strip' Any idea how to solve this ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">He assumed your y is a string, but as we can see it is a numpy array. Therefore, it would be really good to know how you created y in order to help you.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">A openCV function returns me the value of y :                                                                                                         x,y = cv2.aruco.estimatePoseSingleMarkers(bla, 20.1, camera_matrix, distortion_coefficients, None, None and stores the data within the variable. Later on i print the variable y into a table                                                                      t = Texttable()         t.add_rows([["ID","tvecs"], [str(markerIDs),str(y)]])              print(str(t.draw()))</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Note: marker ID is as well a variable, which values are defined by a function and are included in the table.</span>
