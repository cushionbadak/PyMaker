<p>I'm using unittest for some testing in Python. I have a simple test: </p>
<pre><code>self.assertEqual(stdout, expected_stdout)
</code></pre>
<p>that really just checks the equality of two strings. 
When I run it I get an <code>AssertionError</code>, which is fine, but I'm not sure what the +/- below it mean. Example: </p>
<pre><code>FAIL: unittest.case.FunctionTestCase (basic_test4)
actually pretty irrelevant

<p>(The first part to the left of the != is the actual output, the second part to the right of the != is the expected). </p>
<p>Can anyone help me understand how to read the +/-? Thanks</p>

<p>It is a line difference comparison of the two strings to change the left hand side to the right hand side.  <code>+</code> means you have to add the line <code>or is it here(null)john: Success</code> and <code>-</code> means to remove the lines <code>or is it here(null) this is problemjohn</code> and <code>john: Success</code>.</p>
<p>Since the left side only contains the two lines removed, and the right side only contains the one line added, that should make sense.  In this case a difference isn't very useful, but if the lines had more in common the difference would help narrow down the reason for the failure.</p>

<span class="comment-copy"><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestCase.assertEqual" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/â€¦</a> says "<i>if first and second are the exact same type [..] the type-specific equality function will be called in order to generate a more useful default error message</i>", and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestCase.addTypeEqualityFunc" rel="nofollow noreferrer">that is here</a> it says "<i>a diff of the two strings highlighting the differences will be included in the error message</i>", so it's telling you which lines to remove and which to add to match the strings - in this case all of them except the blank last <code>\n</code></span>
