<p>I get the error <code>ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'Tkinter'</code> in Python 3. I am trying to run this piece of code.</p>
<pre><code>from swampy.TurtleWorld import *
import Tkinter

world = TurtleWorld()
bob = Turtle()
fd(bob, 100)
lt(bob)
fd(bob, 100)
print (bob)
wait_for_user()
</code></pre>

<p>It doesn't look like your code is using Tkinter at all, so you could just remove the line <code>import Tkinter</code>. In any case, you should be able to import Tkinter in Python always, because it is built into the standard library; the problem is that the module is named <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>tkinter</code></a> in lowercase, not <code>Tkinter</code>, so it should be:</p>
<pre><code>import tkinter
</code></pre>
<p>But again, if you are not going to use the module it would be clearer to remove that import statement.</p>

<p>The way you are importing Tkinter uses the capitalization for Python 2.  In Python 3 Tkinter has a lower case 't'.  So for Python 3 you would write it as:</p>
<pre><code>import tkinter
</code></pre>
<p>To make their programs work in both Python 2 and Python 3 I have seem many people write their code in the following manner:</p>
<pre><code>try:
    import Tkinter
except:
    import tkinter
</code></pre>
<p>With the above you will have the correct import for whether you or not you are using Python 2 or Python 3.  I'd also recommend setting up as value for tkinter such as:</p>
<pre><code>import tkinter as tk
</code></pre>
<p>This way while you are programming instead of writing <code>tkinter.Frame()</code> you can shorten it to <code>tk.Frame()</code>.  It makes it a lot quicker to code Tkinter programs.</p>
<p>I am assuming you are planning on implementing Tkinter later in your code as currently your code makes no use of it, so I hope this helps.  If you are not going to add anything using Tkinter, I would recommend removing the import.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">you must install that module with <code>pip install Tkinter</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">you aren't actually using Tkinter in that code, just importing it. Does that even do anything?</span>
