<p>I'm writing a Flask app, and I want to avoid manually writing HTTP response header names, for obvious reasons.</p>
<p>Is there a list of standard HTTP header names in the stdlib (or in Flask), that I could import - so that I avoid writing stuff like this:</p>
<pre><code>response.headers['Content-Type'] = ...
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Here is the list of headers you can use in your python code</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import headers
&gt;&gt;&gt; headers.HEADERS.ACCEPT
'Accept'
&gt;&gt;&gt; headers.HEADERS.CONTENT_TYPE
'Content-Type'
</code></pre>

<p>After giving it some thought, I am afraid there will be little in Flask, Werkzeug or the stdlib. So here is a solution: Create your own <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">enum</a> containing the desired header names. You can create that through the <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/message-headers/message-headers.xhtml" rel="nofollow noreferrer">IANA MEssage Header Registry</a>. It comes as CSV, so you can generate the enum programmatically. Just see to it that field 3 (1-based) contains <code>http</code> and field 4 is <code>standard</code>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">"for obvious reasons." I'm afraid they are not at all obvious at least to me. Care to elaborate? Is this in order to avoid repetition?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Manually typing Header names is prone to typos.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Okay, I see. Flask is largely built on top of <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Werkzeug/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Werkzeug</a>. I'd check its <a href="http://werkzeug.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/http/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">HTTP utilities</a>. But to be honest, I doubt you'll find anything.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I thought I'd find it in <code>http</code>, since it already has the <code>HTTPStatus</code> list - but nope. It's weird.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I guess there is little need for it. I also just realised, you may find something in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">urllib</a>. The chances are slim again, though.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Looks good. Ever thought about contributing this to the stdlib? <code>http</code> seems like a good fit, since it already has a similar HTTPStatus class.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Actually, I created this repo, just for you minutes ago :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Oh... well, do feel encouraged to share it upstream, as well! Thank you :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Uh ... But that contains <i>all</i> headers. Including those reserved for mail and netnews. Please considder the filtering advices from my answer.</span>
