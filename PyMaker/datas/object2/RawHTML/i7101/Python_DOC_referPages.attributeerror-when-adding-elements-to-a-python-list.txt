<p>I am newer to python and I am having trouble saving a list of renamed files so I can eventually move the files to a new directory. My code is posted below:</p>
<pre><code>import os
new_files = []

        for orig_name in orig:           #This loop splits each file name into a list of stings containing each word
            if '.' in orig_name:            #This makes sure folder names are not changed, only file names
                base = os.path.splitext(orig_name)[0]
                ext = os.path.splitext(orig_name)[1]
                sep = base.split()             #Separation is done by a space
                for t in sep:           #Loops across each list of strings into an if statement that saves each part to a specific variable
                    if t.isalpha() and len(t) == 3:
                        wc = t
                        wc = wc.upper()
                    elif len(t) &gt; 3 and len(t) &lt; 6:
                        wc = t
                        wc = wc.upper()
                    elif len(t) &gt;= 4:
                        pnum = t
                        if pnum.isalnum:
                            pnum = pnum.upper()
                    elif t.isdecimal() and len(t) &lt; 4:
                        opn = t
                        if len(opn) == 2:
                            opn = '0' + opn
                    else:
                        pass
                new_nam = '%s OP %s %s' % (pnum, opn, wc)          #This is the variable that contain the text for the new name
                new_nam = new_nam + ext
                new_files = new_files.append(new_nam)
                print(new_files)
</code></pre>
<p>Basically what this code does is loops over the original file names (orig), and renames them to a specific convention (new_name). The issue I am having is for every iteration, I am trying to save each new_nam to the list "new_files" however I keep getting this error:</p>
<pre><code>line 83, in &lt;module&gt;
    new_files = new_files.append(new_nam)
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'append'
</code></pre>
<p>Basically I think it is saying you cannot add a "None Type" to a list which makes sense, however when I print all of the new_nam's, they are all string which is not a None type. So I guess I don't know why this code isn't adding each new file name to the new_files list. Any advice of tips is greatly appreciated, cannot figure this one out :/ Thanks!</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>list.append</code> is an <em>inplace</em> operation. You must call the function without assigning the return value:</p>
<pre><code>In [122]: data = [1, 2, 3]

In [123]: data.append(12345)

In [124]: data
Out[124]: [1, 2, 3, 12345]
</code></pre>
<p>In your case, you'll need</p>
<pre><code>new_files.append(new_nam)
</code></pre>
<p>All the <code>list.___</code> methods as described in the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>list</code> docs</a> are inplace. </p>
