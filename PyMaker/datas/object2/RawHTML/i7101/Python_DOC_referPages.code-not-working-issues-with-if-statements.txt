<p>My code is having issues, it is suppose to print either "You have a rare surname!" or a very rare one if you have q or Q in the typed string And if not it will print no q's, but it does not print no q's.</p>
<p>Here my not working code:</p>
<pre><code>a = input("What is your surname? ")
d = len(a)
v = ["q", "Q"]
if any(v in a for v in a):
  if a[0] == "Q" :
    if a[0] == ("q"):
      print("You have an extremly rare surname!")
    if a[0] == ("Q"):
      print("You have an extremly rare surname!")
  if a[0] == "q" :
    if a[0] == ("q"):
      print("You have an extremly rare surname!")
    if a[0] == ("Q"):
      print("You have an extremly rare surname!")
  if "q" in a[1:d]:
    print("You have a rare surname!")
else:
  print("No Qs here.")
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Your condition <code>if any(v in a for v in a)</code> makes no sense, you are testing if <code>v</code> is in <code>a</code> but at the same time defining <code>v</code> as part of <code>a</code>, it makes no sense.</p>
<p>Also, your other conditions are pretty bad too, you test if the first letter is <code>Q</code> and then if that's true you test if it's actually <code>q</code>.</p>
<p>Your entire program can be written as </p>
<pre><code>a = input("what is your surname?")
if a[0] in ('q', 'Q'):
    print('extremely rare')
elif 'q' in a[1:] or 'Q' in a[1:]:
    print('rare')
else:
    print('no q here')
</code></pre>
<p>If you do not understand any of the conditions that I used I highly recommend you go back and relearn basic python syntax for conditions so you can write it better next time</p>

<p>Another way to simplify your code would would be to just use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.lower" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>.lower()</code></a> to convert the string to lowercase and use a string <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#strings" rel="nofollow noreferrer">slice</a> to check the string without the first character: </p>
<pre><code>rare_letter = 'q'
user_surname = input("What is your surname? ").lower()

if user_surname[0] == rare_letter:
  print("You have an extremly rare surname!")
elif rare_letter in user_surname[1:]:
  print("You have a rare surname!")
else:
  print("No Qs here.")
