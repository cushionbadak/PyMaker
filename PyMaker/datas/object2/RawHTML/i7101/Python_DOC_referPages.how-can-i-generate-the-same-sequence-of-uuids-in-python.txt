<p>With python's random number generator it is possible to set a seed and get the same sequence of random numbers. </p>
<p>Is there a similar way to generate a same sequence of uuid's (with python's <code>uuid</code> module)?</p>

<p>Yes, Python's random module supports 'reproducable sequences'. See:
