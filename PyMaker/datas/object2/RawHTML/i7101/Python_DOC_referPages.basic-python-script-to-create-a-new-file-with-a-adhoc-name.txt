<p>I'm very new to OOP (python) and i'm just practicing some basic stuff these days. im trying to write a prog that will create a file at a desired location and the file name should not be hardcoded ,it will be passed as an argument to the script. </p>
<p>this is what i'm doing. please tell me where am i going wrong because this creates a file name with the name that i pass in the open function</p>
<pre><code>import os
import sys

filename=sys.argv[1]

def create(filename):
    dir='/home/aspx/psharma1/scripts/scripts2'
    x=os.getcwd()
    if x == '/home/aspx/psharma1/scripts':
        os.chdir(dir)
        f=open("filename","w+")
        for i in range(10):
            f.write("this is line %d\r\n" %(i+1))
        f.close()
    else:
        pass

create(filename)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The problem is in the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>open</code></a> call, which should be:</p>
<pre><code>f=open(filename,"w+")
</code></pre>
<p>Instead of:</p>
<pre><code>f=open("filename","w+")
</code></pre>
<p>This is because <code>"filename"</code> is simply the string with the letters "filename", while <code>filename</code> means the variable named "filename", and so its content (which in this case is the argument that you passed) will be used as the name of the file.</p>
<p>As a side note, it is recommended that you instead use <code>open</code> in the following way:</p>
<pre><code>with open(filename, "w+") as f:
    # Do whatever you need with f
</code></pre>
<p>This is a <a href="https://jeffknupp.com/blog/2016/03/07/python-with-context-managers/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">context manager</a>, an intuitive but powerful feature in Python that will make sure that the file is correctly closed no matter the errors that may take place during its usage.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Please remove the double quotes around the filename string in the <strong>open</strong> function</p>
