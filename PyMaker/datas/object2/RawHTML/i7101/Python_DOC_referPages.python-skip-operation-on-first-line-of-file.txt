<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have a csv file which looks like following:</p>
<pre><code>CCC;reserved;reserved;pIndex;wedgeWT;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;xOffset;yOffset;zOffset
0.10089,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1.8,-0.7,1999998
0.1124,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1.2,1.8,-3.9
</code></pre>
<p>I am using the <code>fileinput</code> method to do some operation in the file, but I want to skip the operation on the first (header) line, though still keeping it there. I have tried using <code>next(f)</code> and <code>f.isfirstline()</code>, but they delete the header line. I want to keep the header line intact, though not doing any operation on it. </p>
<pre><code>with fileinput.input(inplace=True) as f:
    #skip line
    for line in f:
    .
    .
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#enumerate" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>enumerate</code></a> to easily keep track of the line numbers:</p>
<pre><code>for linenum, line in enumerate(f):
    if linenum == 0:
        # 'line' is the header line
        continue

    # 'line' is a data line
    # ...
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use <code>iter</code> and skip it with <code>next</code>:</p>
<pre><code>with fileinput.input(inplace=True) as f:
    iterF = iter(f)
    print next(iterF)#skipping computation but printing data
    for line in iterF:
        #...
</code></pre>
<p>This way you will just get the overhead of creating the iterator once, but will not create the indexes nor compute an <code>if</code> in each iteration loop as in @JonathonReinhart solution (wich is also valid).</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Could you share the expected output and what you do in the <code>for</code>-loop (no problem if it's shortened, just enough to see what you basically do)? Please also have a look at <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve">Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example</a>. That includes some hints to actually make your question answerable.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I tried using <code>enumerate</code> but it still deletes the header line. <a href="https://github.com/AnanDvd/MPI-Pigino/blob/master/csv_edit_Mareike_yesHeader_linenum.py" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Here</a> is my script</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why are you using <code>inplace=True</code> if you aren't aware that you have to write output back to the file?</span>

<span class="comment-copy">@AnandDwivedi, what do you want to do with the info in the header, print it?</span>
