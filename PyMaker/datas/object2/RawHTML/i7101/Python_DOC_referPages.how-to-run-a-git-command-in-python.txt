<p>I have been asked to write a script that pulls the latest code from Git, makes a build, and performs some automated unit tests.</p>
<p>I found that there are two built-in Python modules for interacting with Git that are readily available: <code>GitPython</code> and <code>libgit2</code>.</p>
<p>What approach/module should I use?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>An easier solution would be to use the Python <code>subprocess</code> module to call git. In your case, this would pull the latest code and build:</p>
<pre><code>import subprocess
subprocess.call(["git", "pull"])
subprocess.call(["make"])
subprocess.call(["make", "test"])
</code></pre>

<p>I agree with Ian Wetherbee. You should use subprocess to call git directly. If you need to perform some logic on the output of the commands then you would use the following subprocess call format. </p>
<pre><code>import subprocess
PIPE = subprocess.PIPE
branch = 'my_branch'

process = subprocess.Popen(['git', 'pull', branch], stdout=PIPE, stderr=PIPE)
stdoutput, stderroutput = process.communicate()

if 'fatal' in stdoutput:
    # Handle error case
else:
    # Success!

<p>In <a href="https://github.com/hpcugent/easybuild" rel="nofollow">EasyBuild</a>, we rely on GitPython, and that's working out fine.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://github.com/hpcugent/easybuild-framework/blob/master/easybuild/tools/repository/gitrepo.py" rel="nofollow">here</a>, for examples of how to use it.</p>

<p>If you're on Linux or Mac, why use python at all for this task? Write a shell script.</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/sh
set -e
git pull
make
./your_test #change this line to actually launch the thing that does your test

<span class="comment-copy">GitPython doesn't support worktree :(</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It's also much more complicated...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Maybe the questioner wants to do something complicated with the output ? But yeah, I tend to agree.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Well, there’s the Python tag in the question. Please don’t second-guess the OP’s motives.</span>
