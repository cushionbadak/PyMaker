<p>This happens because you chose the wrong encoding.</p>
<p>If you are on Windows just replacing </p>
<pre><code>Past=pd.read_csv("C:/Users/Admin/Desktop/Python/Past.csv",encoding='utf-8') 
</code></pre>
<p>with </p>
<pre><code>Past=pd.read_csv("C:/Users/Admin/Desktop/Python/Past.csv",encoding='cp1252')
</code></pre>
<p>should solve the problem. </p>

<p>Use this solution it will strip out (ignore) the characters and return the string without them. Only use this if your need is to strip them not convert them.</p>
<pre><code>with open(path, encoding="utf8", errors='ignore') as f:
</code></pre>
<p>Using <code>errors='ignore'</code> You'll just lose some characters. but if your don't care about them as they seem to be extra characters originating from a the bad formatting and programming of the clients connecting to my socket server. Then its a easy direct solution. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/unicode.html#the-unicode-type" rel="noreferrer">reference</a></p>

<p>Try using :</p>
<p><code>pd.read_csv(“Your filename", encoding="ISO-8859-1”)</code></p>
<p>The code that I parsed from some website was converted in this encoding instead of default UTF-8 encoding which is standard.</p>

<p>The following works very well for me:</p>
<pre><code>encoding = 'latin1'
</code></pre>

<p>Using the code bellow works for me:</p>
<pre><code>with open(keeniz_dir + '/world_cities.csv',  'r', encoding='latin1') as input:

<span class="comment-copy">Apparently your csv file is not UTF-8 encoded...</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>encoding='cp1252'</code> might be worth a try if you are on Windows.</span>
