<p>Is it possible to calculate the size of a model ( let's say a Random Forest classifier ) in scikit-learn?  </p>
<p>For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>  from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
  clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_jobs=-1, n_estimators=10000, min_samples_leaf=50)
  clf.fit(self.X_train, self.y_train)
</code></pre>

<p>Can I determine the size of <strong><code>clf</code></strong>?</p>

<p>Along the same lines as Nijan's answer, you can also do it without having to save the model, using pickle:</p>
<pre><code>import pickle
import sys

p = pickle.dumps(clf)
print(sys.getsizeof(p))
</code></pre>
<p>It will return the size in bytes.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>A way to do it is to dump the model in a file using joblib.dump and then calculate the file size. </p>
<p>Based on the previous example, you would use: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>joblib.dump(clf, fname) <br/>
  os.path.getsize(fname) </p>

<span class="comment-copy">What do you mean by "the size of the model"?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">For example, Amazon ML sets the limit of Model Size to be between 1 MB to 1GB.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>sys.getsizeof()</code> would return the size of only that object in memory. If there are references to other objects, it won't take into account the size of those objects, so there's a real risk of underestimating size. See <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">getsizeof documentation</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">I did some testing, and it doesn't work. I have added more information to the question as well.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I have added the response.</span>
