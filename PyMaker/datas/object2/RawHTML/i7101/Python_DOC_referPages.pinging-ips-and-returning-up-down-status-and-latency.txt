<p>I am using python and I am using a method like this</p>
<pre><code>def ping(host):
# Ping parameters as function of OS
parameters = "-n 1" if system_name().lower()=="windows" else "-c 1"

# Pinging
return system_call("ping " + parameters + " " + host) == 0
</code></pre>
<p>to get the up/down status of the list of ip's I am pinging.  Is there a way to extract the latency from this as well?</p>
<p>My output when running this code looks something along the lines of</p>
<pre><code>Ping statistics for x.x.x.x:
Packets: Sent = 1, Received = 1, Lost = 0 (0% loss),
Approximate round trip times in milli-seconds:
Minimum = 50ms, Maximum = 50ms, Average = 50ms
x.x.x.x is down
</code></pre>
<p>I would it to say x.x.x.x is down, latency = 50ms.  Is there a simple way to do this that I am overlooking?</p>

<p>You probably need to use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.run" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>subprocess</code></a>.  From the docs on <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.system" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>os.system</code></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Changes to sys.stdin, etc. are not reflected in the environment of the executed command. If command generates any output, it will be sent to the interpreter standard output stream.</p>

<p>Subprocess will just be easier.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You'll have to parse the output of <code>system_call</code>.  What is that function? Did you define it?</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>from os import system as system_call</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">I was hoping I didn't have to parse the output. oh well haha.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'll do some research on it</span>
