<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I am facing an issue here. I have a <code>Dataframe</code> column whose values I need to put as <code>value+%</code> i.e. say <code>10%, 15%</code> etc. </p>
<p>However, I am able to put the values as string type in the excel sheet after writing but while I plot the graph, the value is being considered as a string and hence the chart is not getting generated. </p>
<p>I need to paste the value with the <code>%</code> symbol in the concerned column as well as I need to plot the graph while writing to the excel sheet.</p>
<p>Any solution  for this??</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>For writing the value in excel you can use</p>
<pre><code>str(value) + '%'
</code></pre>
<p>While plotting graph access the values by slicing the last character(%) and convert it to number by using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#eval" rel="nofollow noreferrer">eval</a> function.</p>
<pre><code>eval(value[:-1])
</code></pre>
