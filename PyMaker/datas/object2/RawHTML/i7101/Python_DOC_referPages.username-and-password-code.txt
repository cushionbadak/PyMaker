<p>I wrote a program in python3.6 that the user creates a username and password. then the program checks if that username is stored if not it creates the username and password permanently.I am having trouble linking username and password lists as 'jason' has the password 'oero'. </p>
<p>so that the </p>
<pre><code>if sentence == stored_username[0:] and sentence2 == stored_password[0:]:
    print(Aceppted)
</code></pre>
<p>runs as 'jason' is the the username and oero is the password.</p>
<p>the other problem is when I ran the program it tried to run the entire list so you cant choose just one value of the lists. This is what I have so far. the program is also set to quit if the user gets their username and password wrong 3 times. which works fine. Thank you! The code runs as is, the way its supposed too.</p>
<pre><code>username= input('Create Username')
password= input('Create Password')
stored_username =['jason' , 'nicole',username]
stored_password =['oeros', 'chance',password]

print(stored_username[0:])

trials =0
def sign_in():
    global username
    global password
    global stored_username

    global stored_password


    sentence= input('Enter Username')
    print(sentence)
    sentence2 = input('Enter Password')
    print(sentence2)
    global trials
    Aceppted= 'Welcome to Bacall Land'
    wrong=('Wrong Username or Password ')

    if sentence == stored_username[0:] and sentence2 == stored_password[0:]:
        print(Aceppted)
    else:
        print(wrong)
    while sentence != stored_username[0:] and sentence2!= stored_password[0:]:
        trials += 1
        print(trials)
        (trials &lt;=3 and sign_in())

            break
    if sentence== stored_username[0:] and sentence2 == stored_password[0:]:

<p>First of all, are comparing a string username/password to the whole list in:</p>
<pre><code> sentence == stored_username[0:] and sentence2 == stored_password[0:]
</code></pre>
<p>When you slice a list like <code>stored_username[0:]</code> it gives returns a sublist starting from element <code>0</code> to the end of the list. You need first get the index of the username by using <code>stored_username.index(sentence)</code> then get the password of the same index. However, using a dictionary would make this simpler, faster, and easier to read. Here is an example using dictionary to store the usernames/passwords:</p>
<pre><code>stored_users = {'jason': 'oeros', 'nicole': 'chance'}
accepted = 'Welcome to Bacall Land'
wrong = 'Wrong username or password'

def add_user():
    print('Creating user, please choose username and password')
    username = input('Username: ')
    password = input('Password: ')
    if stored_users.get(username):
        print('Username already exiss')
    else:
        stored_users[username] = password

def login():
    print('Logging in')
    username = input('Username: ')
    password = input('Password: ')
    if stored_users.get(username) == password:
        return True
    else:
        print False

trials = 0
add_user()
while trials &lt; 3:
    check = login()
    if check:
        print(accepted)
        break
    else:
        print(wrong)

<p>The issue is that the no matter the input,<code>if sentence == stored_username[0:] and sentence2 == stored_password[0:]:</code> returns false, correct?</p>
<p>This is because you are checking equality between the input and the list, which will always return false, i.e. <code>'jason' == ['jason' , 'nicole',username]</code> will always return false.</p>
<p>To fix this, the <code>in</code> operator can be used, i.e.:
<code>if sentence in stored_username[0:] and sentence2 in stored_password[0:]:</code></p>
<p>Also, the <code>[0:]</code> slice is redundant, as it returns the whole list, so instead you can write:
<code>if sentence in stored_username and sentence2 in stored_password:</code></p>

<span class="comment-copy">Welcome to Stackoverflow. Use <code>dictionary </code> data structure for your problem as linking username to password will be easier, using <code>keys</code> as username and <code>values</code> as password for the corresponding <code>key</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy"><i>"runs as 'jason' is the the username and oero is the password."</i> - Do you mean you're using a <a href="http://www.json.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><i>JSON</i></a> file?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">no 'jason' is the username and 'oreo' is the password</span>
<span class="comment-copy">if sentence == stored_username[0:] and sentence2 == stored_password[0:]: meaning the 'jason' would replace stored_username and 'oero' would replace stored_password</span>
<span class="comment-copy">i am very new to this but how does the dictionary know that if       stored_users.get(username): is refereeing to the key of the dictionary</span>
<span class="comment-copy">A dictionary stores the data as <code>key: value</code> and it is accessible by key, so since we have <code>'jason': 'oero'</code> when we call <code>dic.get('jason')</code> it will return <code>'oero'</code>, if we enter a user that is not in the dictionary, it will return <code>None</code></span>
