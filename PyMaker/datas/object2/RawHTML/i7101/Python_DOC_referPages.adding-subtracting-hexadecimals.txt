<p>How can I add/subtract hexadecimal's that the user inputs?</p>
<p>Like: </p>
<pre><code>basehex = input()
sechex = input()

sum = hex(basehex - sechex)



print(sum)
</code></pre>
<p>I get: <em>TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'str' and 'str'</em></p>
<p>How do I do this? Must I convert them to <em>int</em>? Then I can't have them as hex (0xFFFFFF)...?</p>
<p>The only way I can do it is:</p>
<pre><code>basehex = int('255')
sechex = int('255')

sum = hex(basehex - sechex)



print(sum)
</code></pre>
<p>But this requires me to enter basehex/sechex as numbers, since int won't take it otherwise:</p>
<pre><code>ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'ff'
</code></pre>
<p>Thanks :) </p>

<p>Thanks to @Peri461</p>
<pre><code>basehex = input()
sechex = input()

basehexin = int(basehex, 16)
sechexin = int(sechex, 16)



sum = basehexin - sechexin



print(hex(sum))
</code></pre>
<p>This code will do it, by converting the hexadecimals to decimals, subtracting them, then converting(representing) them to hexadecimals again.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">If you want a base other than 10, you need to explicitly pass the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>base</code> argument</a> to <code>int</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You're conflicting variable types. Your input comes in as a string which can't do arithmetic, which is why you convert it to an integer using <code>int</code>. From there you can print the result in hex again (it's a <i>representation</i>) by doing <code>print(hex(sum))</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Note that <code>int</code> does not convert hexadecimal to decimal; it converts a string to an integer, which is stored internally in binary, not decimal. If you <i>display</i> that integer at the prompt, e.g., by printing it, you're doing a conversion back from integer to string; that's the only place that decimal comes into the picture.</span>
