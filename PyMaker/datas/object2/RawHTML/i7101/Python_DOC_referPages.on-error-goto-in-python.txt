<p>I've seen several answers on this topic - some of which are now (using Python 3.6) out of date - and I'm still no clearer on the best way to do this.</p>
<p>I wish to be able to run a script, and if it encounters an error, it jumps to a point where it pauses and I can test the value of any local variables to see what might be amiss.</p>
<p>In other languages (eg VBA) I could have On Error Goto ErrorHandler, then put a break point in the error handler, print out the error description and the line number from which it came, then use the Locals or Immediate window to see what values my variable have at that point.</p>
<p>I don't want a whole bunch of try/except statements, nor do I wish to run it in debug mode every time.</p>
<p>Is there a simple Pythonesque way to get it to pause while I have a look at the problem?</p>

<p>You'll find the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>pdb</code></a> module useful.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The module <code>pdb</code> defines an interactive source code debugger for Python
  programs. It supports setting (conditional) breakpoints and single
  stepping at the source line level, inspection of stack frames, source
  code listing, and evaluation of arbitrary Python code in the context
  of any stack frame. It also supports post-mortem debugging and can be
  called under program control.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><code>pdb</code> is useful for setting breakpoints and post-mortem debugging. I believe this is what you're looking for.</p>
<p>Again, from the docs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The typical usage to break into the debugger from a running program is
  to insert</p>
<pre><code>import pdb; pdb.set_trace()
</code></pre>
<p>at the location you want to break into the
  debugger. You can then step through the code following this statement,
  and continue running without the debugger using the <code>continue</code> command.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">As mentioned, this is about unanticipated errors. I want it to pause when it encounters any error.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I have seen that. Maybe I'm not using it properly but it seems I have to change the program in order for it to break at the right point.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@KantarChris Yes. You must add a breakpoint using <code>pdb.set_trace()</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@KantarChris Did you know? You can also run your script with the interactive flag, like this: python -i script.py. Once the script finished or an error occurred, the interpreter is invoked for you to debug. Note that you can only see data in global scope.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@COLDSPEED I didn't know that - thanks, I'll try it.</span>
