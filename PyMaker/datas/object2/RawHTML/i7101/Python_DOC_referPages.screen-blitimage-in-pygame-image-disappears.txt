<p>I'm trying to blit an image in a pygame window based on one event, a midi input, and then blit another image based on the next event, another midi input. What happens here is that the image pops up just for a second when I press a key on the midi keyboard. I need it to stay in the window, even after I enter another input and blit another image. What happens with this is that each key on my midi keyboard gets recorded as a number (1-88) and added to <code>NoteList[]</code> then an image is blit in the window using <code>h</code>, an item in <code>NoteList</code> as the x coordinate. In my actual pygame the <code>h</code> variable will also go through a bunch of functions, I am just trying to figure out this part in a simpler pygame window.</p>
<pre><code>going = True
while going:
    screen.fill(white)
    events = event_get()
    NoteList=[]
    for e in events:
        if e.type in [QUIT]:
            going = False
        if e.type in [KEYDOWN]:
            going = False
            events = pygame.event.get()
        if e.type in [pygame.midi.MIDIIN]:
            print(str(e.data1))
            NoteList.append(int(e.data1-20))
    for h in NoteList:
            screen.blit(EthnoteIMG, (int(h), 100))
    pygame.display.update()
</code></pre>

<p>You need to define the <code>NoteList</code> outside of the while loop if the notes should persist, otherwise you create a new empty list each iteration.</p>
<pre><code>NoteList = []

going = True
while going:
    for e in pygame.event.get():
        if e.type == pygame.QUIT:
            going = False
        elif e.type == pygame.midi.MIDIIN:
            print(str(e.data1))
            NoteList.append(int(e.data1-20))

    screen.fill(white)

    for h in NoteList:
        screen.blit(EthnoteIMG, (int(h), 100))

    pygame.display.update()
</code></pre>
<hr/>
<p>You can use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#enumerate" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>enumerate</code></a> function to shift the position:</p>
<pre><code>for g, h in enumerate(NoteList):
    screen.blit(EthnoteIMG, (g*12, int(h)))
</code></pre>

<p>I belive that the problem is that you fill the screen every time the while loop runs but you just blit that image on the screen when the event occurs...</p>
<p>Try this:</p>
<pre><code>screen.fill(white)
going = True
while going:
    events = event_get()
    NoteList=[]
    for e in events:
        if e.type in [QUIT]:
            going = False
        if e.type in [KEYDOWN]:
            going = False
            events = pygame.event.get()
        if e.type in [pygame.midi.MIDIIN]:
            print(str(e.data1))
            NoteList.append(int(e.data1-20))
    for h in NoteList:
        screen.fill(white)
        screen.blit(EthnoteIMG, (int(h), 100))
    pygame.display.update()
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">I also recommend to add a clock <code>clock = pygame.time.Clock()</code> and then limit the frame rate by calling <code>clock.tick(30) # or 60</code> in the while loop.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ok thanks. Do you know how I would do this inside of a while loop like this: g=0     while g&gt;8:    g+=1    screen.blit(IMG, (g*12), int(h)), where it only goes through the loop once each time i input something via MIDI</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I've added a paragraph to the answer. Is that what you want?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What I'm trying to do is create an object with 4 variables attached to it, Note(x,y,z,d), and then run a function on it, Note.ExNote() which blits an image into the window. I have 3 while loops inside of eachother to determine 3 variables and the midi input decides the 4th. Everytime I input another note, one of the other 3 variables will change slightly based on the while loop like (y+=1) and so I can input notes and they are printed onto the sheet music for me. Only problem is that I input one note and it runs through all the loops and prints it out all over the sheet music</span>
