<p>I'm getting a file not found error in JupyterLab. I can see the file and I have tried several different ways to open it via JupyterLab, but I keep getting an error as if the file does not exist. </p>
<p>Below is my code: </p>
<pre><code>import os
import csv

csvpath = os.path.join('..','Resources','budget_data.csv')

with open(csvpath, newline="") as csvfile:
`enter code here`csvreader = csv.reader(csvfile, delimiter=",")
</code></pre>
<h2>Here is the error:</h2>
<pre><code>FileNotFoundError                         Traceback (most recent call last)
&lt;ipython-input-17-3c32e2cc9d43&gt; in &lt;module&gt;
----&gt; 1 with open(csvpath, newline="") as csvfile:
 2     csvreader = csv.reader(csvfile, delimiter=",")

FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or  
directory: '..,Resources,budget_data.csv'
</code></pre>
<p>Here is the path:  GTATL201902DATA3/03-Python/Homework/Instructions/PyBank/Resources/budget_data.csv</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>csvpath = os.path.join('..','Resources','budget_data.csv')
</code></pre>
<p>Are you absolutely sure this is the actual code you're using?  Because going by the error message, it looks like you did this instead:</p>
<pre><code>csvpath = os.path.join('..,Resources,budget_data.csv')
</code></pre>
<p>i.e. the <code>..</code> and the commas are literally part of the string, instead of joining three separate strings.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Try to <code>print(os.path.abspath('.'))</code> before opening to check the current working dir.</span>
