<p>Here are the cases. I'm looking for the following pattern in a log file. </p>
<p>All strings are in the form of <code>AB_N</code> or <code>CDE_N</code>. 
<code>AB</code> and <code>CDE</code> are fixed letters, followed by an underscore. 
<code>N</code> can be either 2 or 3 numbers.</p>
<p>I tried <code>(AB|CDE)_\d{2,3}</code> but that returns a group. I can't do <code>\w{2,3}\d{2,3}</code> because it has to be either <code>AB</code> or <code>CDE</code> and not <code>AC</code> or <code>FEG</code>. Omitting the parentheses breaks too. I am sure the solution is simple but I'm new to python and regex and can't figure this out.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>A <code>?:</code> inside a parenthesis in a regex makes it non-capturing.  Like so: <code>(?:AB|CDE)_\d{2,3}</code></p>
<p>See docs here:  <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html" rel="noreferrer">http://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html</a>
About a third of the way through it goes over the non-capturing syntax.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The non-capturing group syntax is <code>(?:...)</code>.  So do <code>(?:AB|CDE)_\d{2,3}</code>.  This is <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntax" rel="nofollow">documented</a> along with everything else.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You can wrap the entire thing in a group: <code>((AB|CDE)_\d{2,3})</code>, and the first group is <code>AB_123</code> and the second is just <code>AB</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">that's it! brilliant..thank you</span>
<span class="comment-copy">this didn't work, but using (?AB|CDE) did.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Oops, a typo.  But it looks like you made one too, since it should be <code>(?:AB|CDE)</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Can I do something like <code>(?:abc|def|ghi|xyz)</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@qed - Yes, you can do anything you would do in regular parens. The <code>?:</code> just tells the regex not to treat those parens as a capturing group.</span>
