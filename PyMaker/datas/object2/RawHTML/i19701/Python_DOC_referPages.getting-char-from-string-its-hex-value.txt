<p>I currently get a string as a parameters in my method,
i would like to extract the char in the I index and get it's hex value.
Currently i'm doing :</p>
<pre><code>temp = string[i]
binascii.hexlify(temp);
</code></pre>
<p>but i get an error :</p>
<pre><code>TypeError: 'str' does not support the buffer interface
</code></pre>
<p>Any ideas please ?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You need to encode the string to bytes:</p>
<pre><code>binascii.hexlify(temp.encode('ascii'));
</code></pre>
<p>You'll need to pick a suitable encoding, one that can represent your text properly; I am presuming that your unicode characters fall in the 0-127 range here.</p>
<p>If you encode to a different encoding, the result will be a hex representation of that encoding. UTF-8 will use between 1 and 6 bytes per character for example.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you could use the <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#ord" rel="nofollow"><code>ord()</code> function</a> and format the result to hex:</p>
<pre><code>format(ord(temp), 'x')
</code></pre>
<p>and it'll work with any unicode character. It'll use the Unicode code point for the hex representation, so between 1 and 4 bytes (the latter for <code>\Uabcdefgh</code> wide characters). Depending on your maximum character width, you may want to pad the bytes to prevent ambiguous code points; say you need to encode up to codepoint <code>\uffff</code> then you'll need to use 2 bytes for <em>every</em> codepoint, or 4 hex characters:</p>
<pre><code>format(ord(temp), '04x')
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Actually ASCII characters fall in the 0-127 range.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@kmkaplan: I didn't say that ASCII was in the 0-255 range, I said I presumed his data was in that range :-P But you are correct, byte values 128-255 won't encode to ASCII.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That's doing the job. Thanks !!</span>
