<p>In Python 3, print was made into a function.  What are the benefits of having assert be a statement?</p>

<p>For optimization.  If you run your Python script with the -O option no code will be generated for assert statements.  This would not be possible if assert were a function.</p>
<p>See the <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-assert-statement" rel="nofollow">documentation on assert</a>, which references this behavior.</p>
