<p>I am reasonably fluent in writing perl / python scripts, but still while writing code, I find myself frequently using google to look up the exact order of operands of some built-in function, or the exact name of some feature I know exists. While google works reasonably well, it does take some searching, and about half the time, the reference page doesn't have the right examples that I need. </p>
<p>Does anyone know of any good quick reference for perl or python that would have most of the important usage information and basic examples in one place ? Should I make my own ? Or do most people use IDEs and don't need this kind of help ? (I use vim, BTW).</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Most <strong>well written</strong> python code should have docstrings that provide information on modules and functions simply by entering <em>help</em> into the interpreter.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; help(str)
&gt;&gt;&gt; (lots of helpful output here!)

<p>For Perl, it's <code>perldoc</code></p>
<pre><code>perldoc Module::Name  # display docs for Module::Name
perldoc -f substr     # display docs for substr()
perldoc -Q parse      # search the FAQ for "parse"

<p>For perl, if you want something at your elbow you can't do better than the <a href="http://www.vromans.org/johan/perlref.html" rel="nofollow">Perl Reference Guide / Perl Pocket Reference</a> by Johan Vromans. Print out <a href="http://www.squirrel.nl/pub/perlref-5.004.1.pdf" rel="nofollow">the PDF</a> and staple it into a booklet, or just pick it up at your local bookstore. (Let's face it, a one-page quick reference is not nearly enough for perl).</p>
<p>It got me through many years of perl use... till I switched to python :-)</p>
<p>For python, incidentally, I just google the docs on <a href="http://docs.python.org/" rel="nofollow">docs.python.org</a>-- or here on stackoverflow; python's syntax being what it is, when I look something up I'm usually after a more in-depth description than you can get out of a quick-reference card. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">For Python what's wrong with <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the documentation</a>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><a href="http://perldoc.perl.org" rel="nofollow noreferrer">perldoc.perl.org</a>  I've configured my browser with shortcuts so I can type "perldoc perlop" in the URL bar.  Actually, I can't imagine developing in Perl without access to the POD, and to search.cpan.org.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Ben, nothing wrong, but I feel I need more examples some of the time to clarify how to use things. I don't have an example doc-page handy.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">There is some books free to read too: <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=perl+oreally" rel="nofollow noreferrer">google.com/search?q=perl+oreally</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">You can do the same thing with <code>pydoc</code>:  <code>pydoc collections.OrderedDict</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">There are tools / modules such as <code>perlfind</code> that automatically supplies correct parameter to <code>perldoc</code>, see <a href="http://p3rl.org/App::perlfind" rel="nofollow noreferrer">p3rl.org/App::perlfind</a></span>
