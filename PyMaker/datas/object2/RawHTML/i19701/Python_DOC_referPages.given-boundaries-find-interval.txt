<p>Having a list like this</p>
<pre><code>[207, 357, 470, 497, 537]
</code></pre>
<p>where each number denotes the boundary of an interval (<code>0</code> being implicit at the beginning of the list), what is <strong>a pythonic way</strong> of finding out to which interval a given number <code>n</code> belongs to?</p>
<p>So the intervals are</p>
<pre><code>0: (0, 207)
1: (208, 357)
2: (358, 497)
3: (498, 537)
</code></pre>
<p>If <code>n=0</code>, then the corresponding interval is <code>0</code>, for <code>n=360</code>, it's <code>2</code>.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Using the <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>bisect</code> module</a> of course:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import bisect
&gt;&gt;&gt; lst = [207, 357, 470, 497, 537]
&gt;&gt;&gt; bisect.bisect_left(lst, 0)
0
&gt;&gt;&gt; bisect.bisect_left(lst, 360)
2
</code></pre>
<p>The module uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm" rel="nofollow noreferrer">binary search</a>, which requires a sorted sequence. With such a sequence you can divide the sequence in half by picking an index mid-way between the first and last, to see if the value you need is in either half. You then continue dividing the selected half until you found a matching insertion point. That lets you find the insertion point in O(log N) time for a sequence of length N, i.e. very fast.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">do you mean to say "how do I find out which interval an number sits in"...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">bisect seems answer but please reword your question.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thanks for reword</span>
<span class="comment-copy">+1 <i>of course</i> for you, but not for mortals like me!!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@DavidHeffernan: I'll try to keep that in mind when I have a Delphi question. :-P</span>
