<p>I am doing text processing. I need the PyEnchant library for verifying if a particular word in the text is a valid English word. However, it's only available for the 32 bit installation of Python. I need the 64 bit Python for handling memory issues with large text files. </p>
<p>Is there a way that I can install PyEnchant for the 64-bit Python? If not, what other library can I use to accomplish the similar task? I looked into the NLTK's wordnet but read that the functionality is not as good as PyEnchant.</p>

<p>If you find it absolutely essential to have PyEnchant, you could download the Source code <a href="https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/p/pyenchant/pyenchant-1.6.6.tar.gz#md5=9f5acfd87d04432bf8df5f9710a17358" rel="nofollow">here</a> and then manually install it by putting it in whatever directory you prefer and then running</p>
<pre><code>import sys
sys.path.append('/path/to/dir')
</code></pre>
<p>This should work, and should be compatible with people who installed it normally.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">What platform, and what method are you using to try to install it?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">We usually use <code>python setup.py install</code> like normal...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I did "easy_install pyenchant" and it didn't install it. I am trying to install it for windows XP, with python 2.7 64 bit.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Do you know if PyEnchant runs with Python version 3.4?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Pilie :No, it does not. While <b>I</b> would suggest to make your own version, you could upgrade it(maybe) to 3.4. For details, check <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/pyporting.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this</a> page out, or, if necessary, do it yourself(if you must). PS:Sorry about taking so long to reply.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Have you or anyone made the Windows 10 64 bit compatible enchant version that can run on Python 3.4?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No, but if you want I could work on it.</span>
