<p>So, to keep it simple. Ubuntu 12.10 has python 3.2 pre installed and it is linked to "python3". I downloaded python 3.3 and it's command is "python3.3". However, I downloaded pySide for python3 from synaptic. Using "from PySide.QtCore import *" fails on python3.3. BUT, when I ran just "python3" (aka 3.2) everything works fine. Synaptic just installed lib for python3.2 which is default for python3 in ubuntu. How can I force synaptic to install modules for python3.3? </p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Try working in a virtual environment with <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv" rel="nofollow">virtualenv</a>. This will keep your python versions/packages separate from each other in case something goes wrong. Use pip to install PySide.</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>A possible solution is:</p>
<pre><code>~$ sudo easy_install pip
</code></pre>
<p>To install virtualenv,</p>
<pre><code>~$ sudo pip install virtualenv
</code></pre>
<p>The page for <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/PySide" rel="nofollow">PySide</a> on PyPi has a guide for different platforms on how to install pyqt with virtualenv. Best of luck.</p>

<p>I think you should install the pyside from its source files that have <code>setup.py</code> and then run the command <code>python3.3 setup.py build</code> and <code>sudo python3.3 setup.py install</code> because if you install by apt for example, it will use the default interpreter which is 3.2 that you mentioned.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Thx. Sory for stupid question, but what is pip?</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Pip</a> is the python package manager. It will pull sources from pypi which is a package repository, and build for your version.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">well I downloaded virtualenv, created env for 3.3, run pip from there to install pyside and it installed for default system's python - 2.7. I have no idea how to control it... Python is great but I have no clue how to install modules for 3.3, as that virtualenv didn't affect the pip.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You need to <code>sh ~$ source venv/bin/activate </code> That will allow you to use the local pip.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks. However, I found another option - python 3.3 ships with its own env tool by default! <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.3.html#pep-405-virtual-environments" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/â€¦</a></span>
