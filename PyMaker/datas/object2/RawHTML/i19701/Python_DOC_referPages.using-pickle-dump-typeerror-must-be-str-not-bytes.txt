<p>I'm using python3.3 and I'm having a cryptic error when trying to pickle a simple dictionary. </p>
<p>Here is the code:</p>
<pre><code>import os
import pickle

os.chdir('c:/Python26/progfiles/')

def storvars(vdict):

storvars(mydict)

<p>The output file needs to be opened in binary mode:</p>

<p>Just had same issue.  In Python 3, Binary modes 'wb', 'rb' must be specified whereas in Python 2x,  they are not needed.  When you follow tutorials that are based on Python 2x,  that's why you are here. </p>
<pre><code>import pickle

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for asking. I was wondering this same stupid thing.  ha</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@JohnRowland: it would be worthwhile to accept the answer as it is the correct one, thanks.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I am indebted to you, Jon, for helping mr out with this. The error message doesn't say WHAT must be str, not bytes, and from it, I could not have worked out that I should open in binary mode. Am I right in thinking that I should use 'rb' when reading a pickled file?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Always safest to do so @John</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><i>After</i> running into exactly the same problem, I saw where the need for "binary" reading/writing was mentioned in the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html#pickle.dump" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs</a> for <code>pickle.dump()</code> and <code>pickle.load()</code>. Both places, this was mentioned only in passing near the middle of the function explanation. Someone should make this clearer.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I filed <a href="http://bugs.python.org/issue24159" rel="nofollow noreferrer">#24159</a> with the Python project. Perhaps there is something that can be done to improve the experience in this and similar situations.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I wish I could mark this as accepted for @JohnRowland , it's been 6 years</span>
