<p>Long story short, a piece of code that I'm working with at work has the line:</p>
<pre><code>from System                               import System
</code></pre>
<p>with a later bit of code of:</p>
<pre><code>desc_          = System()
xmlParser = Parser(desc_.getDocument()) 
# xmlParser.setEntityBase(self.dtdBase)
for featureXMLfile in featureXmlList.split(","):
    print featureXMLfile
    xmlParser.parse(featureXMLfile)
feat   = desc_.get(featureName)
return feat
</code></pre>
<p><code>Parser</code> is an XML parser in Java (it's included in a different import), but I don't get what the <code>desc_</code> bit is doing. I mean obviously, it somehow holds the feature that we're trying to pull out, but I don't entirely see where. Is <code>System</code> a standard library in Python or Java, or am I looking at something custom?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, everyone else in my group is out for Christmas Eve vacation, so I can't ask them directly. Thank you for your help. I'm still not horribly familiar with Python.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This isn't from the standard library, so you'll need to check your system (Python has plenty of introspection to help you with that).</p>
<p>You can tell as Python modules in the standard library use lowercase names <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#package-and-module-names" rel="nofollow">as per PEP-8</a>, or by searching <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/" rel="nofollow">the library reference</a>.</p>
<p>Note as well that Python has it's own <a href="http://docs.python.org/3.1/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html" rel="nofollow">XML</a> <a href="http://docs.python.org/3.1/library/xml.sax.reader.html" rel="nofollow">parsing</a> <a href="http://docs.python.org/3.1/library/xml.dom.html" rel="nofollow">tools</a> that will be much nicer to work with in Python than Java's.</p>
<p>Edit: As you have noted in the comments you are using Jython, it seems likely this is Java's <code>System</code> package.</p>

<p>millimoose indicated the correct answer in his comment, but neglected to submit it as an answer, so I'm posting to indicate the correct answer. It was indeed a custom module built by my company. I was able to determine this by typing <code>import System; print(System)</code> into the interpreter.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">What does Java have to do with anything?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Also, if you do <code>import System; print(System)</code>, it will tell you the path the module was loaded from. That should tell you if it's custom or not.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@millimoose I mainly wanted to be certain I wasn't omitting an important clue since I know that at least three imported modules are from Java. Which... I just realized I forgot to mention we're using Jython.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">@millimoose Thank you for the suggestion of using <code>import</code>. That did it. :) If you want to post it as an answer, I'll gladly mark it as the answer.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Following millimoose's suggestion above, I found that it is actually a custom module with my company. I thank you for your answer, though.</span>
