<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have a string like this (with n number of elements):</p>
<pre><code>input = 'John, 16, random_word, 1, 6, ...'
</code></pre>
<p>How can I convert it to a list like this? I would like ',' to be a separator.</p>
<pre><code>output = [John, 16, random_word, 1, 6, ...]
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>you mean <code>output = ['John', '16', 'random_word', '1', '6', ...]</code>? you could just split it like <code>output = inpt.split(', ')</code>. this also removes the whitespaces after <code>,</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use <code>input.split(',')</code> but as others have noted, you'll have to deal with leading and trailing spaces. Possible solutions are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>without regex:</p>
<pre><code>In [1]: s = 'John, 16, random_word, 1, 6, ...'

In [2]: [subs.strip() for subs in s.split(',')]
Out[2]: ['John', '16', 'random_word', '1', '6', '...']
</code></pre>
<p>What I did here is use a <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions" rel="nofollow">list comprehension</a>, in which I created a list whose elements are made from the strings from <code>s.split(',')</code> by calling the <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.strip" rel="nofollow"><code>strip</code></a> method on them.
This is equivalent to</p>
<pre><code>strings = []
for subs in s.split(','):
    strings.append(subs)
print(subs)
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>with <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/re.html" rel="nofollow">regex</a>:</p>
<pre><code>In [3]: import re

In [4]: re.split(r',\s*', s)
Out[4]: ['John', '16', 'random_word', '1', '6', '...']
</code></pre></li>
</ul>
<p>Also, try not to use <code>input</code> as variable name, because you are thus shadowing <a href="http://docs.python.org/3.3/library/functions.html#input" rel="nofollow">the built-in function</a>.</p>
<p>You can also just <code>split</code> on <code>', '</code>, but you have to be absolutely sure there's always a space after the comma (think about linebreaks, etc.)</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Use the split function.</p>
<pre><code>output = input.split(', ')
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If I understand correctly, simply do:</p>
<pre><code>output = input.split(',')
</code></pre>
<p>You will probably need to trim each resulting string afterwards since <code>split</code> does not care about whitespaces.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">This seems to be exactly what I need, thanks! Considering that my string will always be formatted so that space only comes after the comma.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">great! :) welcome</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Could you please explain the "without regex" steps a bit more in detail? I can't seem to replicate what you did. Please note that I've been learning programming for only a week or so. And thank you!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@SlobodanStevic I tried to outline the process, feel free to ask more specific questions. Note that what I showed was from an interactive <code>ipython</code> session, and if you try putting this in a script, you won't see any output unless you explicitly <code>print</code> something.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks much, I made it!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks! I didn't explain well, but you got it right. This does what I wanted, now just to remove those spaces.</span>
