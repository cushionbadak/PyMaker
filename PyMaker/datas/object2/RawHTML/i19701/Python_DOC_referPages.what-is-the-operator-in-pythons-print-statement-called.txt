<p>Consider:</p>
<pre><code>print "%s is %d years old." % ('Meirav', 5)
</code></pre>
<p>What is the <code>%</code> operator between the string literal and the tuple called? Other than in the print statement, where else is it seen in Python?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#string-formatting-operations">It's known as the "string formatting" or "interpolation" operator</a>, and it's used anywhere you might want to interpolate formatted data into a string.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">I don't know how its called, but other uses for it are getting the remainder of a division, for ex. <code>11 % 3 == 2</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@BrtH: That is the modulus operator. The modulus and the operator in question seem to be overrides, just like the override of the addition operator for string concatenation.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@BrtH: Actually, according to minitech's answer, they are the same operator. Interesting.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yeah, I know that it's the modulus operator, but you asked "where else is it seen?", which is what I answered.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It might be worth pointing out that using <code>%</code> for string formatting has been (somewhat) deprecated in favor of the <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.format" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>str.format</code> method</a> which is available in Python 2.6 and higher.</span>
