<p>I'm using tkinter for a project, when running the code I get the message</p>
<pre><code>self.tk = _tkinter.create(screenName, baseName, className, interactive, wantobjects, useTk, sync, use)
_ tkinter.TclError: couldn't connect to display ":0"

echo $DISPLAY returns :0
</code></pre>
<p>I've tried export DISPLAY=:0 and export DISPLAY=:0.0 but it doesn't work.</p>
<p>I want to display the GUI on the screen of the laptop Im on(the answers regarding ssh on the forum seem unrelated).</p>
<p>I'm using ubuntu on windows.
I have tried using both python3 and 2.7 but I get the same message.</p>

<p>As provided by @borrible in comments, you will need to install an X server. See <a href="https://esc.sh/blog/install-gui-ubuntu-server/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this page</a> for details.</p>

<p>Using WSL on windows to develop tkinter applications you have two main options.  </p>
<p>1) Develop the app with cross-platform development in mind, then run the application via MS-DOS.  Using GitHub will help you deal with <a href="https://help.github.com/en/articles/dealing-with-line-endings" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Line Endings</a> This is the course I recommend (and I use), especially if you are using Python 3.4+ which includes <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">pathlib.Path</a></p>
<p>2) <em>Not recommended</em> is to install an x-server on Windows, in which case <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/xming/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Xming</a> seems the easiest to get working.  Once installed run :</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt-get install x11-apps
</code></pre>
<p>... then export your display as you did before ...</p>
<pre><code>export DISPLAY=:0
</code></pre>
<p>Test the installation by running an app like xcalc from within WSL ...
<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Itnvg.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer">sample image</a></p>
<pre><code>xcalc
</code></pre>
<p>Here is a sample of a tkinter app running under Xming on WSL after i commented out the icon code ... <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rOsuU.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer">tkinter app on xming</a></p>
<p>Running the app through MS-DOS is my recommendation, when I tested xming it didn't deal with ".ico" files.  It is likely issues like this might hinder more complex applications. However if you do choose this route <a href="https://virtualizationreview.com/articles/2017/02/08/graphical-programs-on-windows-subsystem-on-linux.aspx" rel="nofollow noreferrer">more info is available here</a>.</p>
