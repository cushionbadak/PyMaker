<p>I am trying to split a user:pass:host:port proxy into user:pass and host:port, I know how to get the user:pass using proxytest = proxy.split("@")[0] when the proxy is user:pass@localhost:8080, it returns user:pass but how can I get the localhost:8080? Preferably a very easy way if possible. The proxy is opened in a .txt file and may be changed so I do not know the exact string.</p>

<p>In Python 2 you can use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/urlparse.html#urlparse.urlsplit" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>urlparse.urlsplit</code></a> function to accomplish this without any actual parsing.</p>
<pre><code>from urlparse import *

x = "http://user:pass@localhost:8080"
parts = urlsplit(x)

print parts.username        #Prints 'user'
print parts.password        #Prints 'pass'
print parts.hostname        #Prints 'localhost'
print parts.port            #Prints '8080'
</code></pre>
<p>If you were looking for something really naive, you can split on the <code>@</code>.</p>
<pre><code>x = "user:pass@localhost:8080"
userpass, hostport = x.split('@')
print userpass, hostport    #Prints 'user:pass localhost:8080'
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The answer was really simple my friend helped me </p>
<pre><code>prox = "user:pass@host:port"
userpass = prox[0:prox.find("@")]
hostport = prox[prox.find("@")+1:]
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">just use "user:pass@localhost:8080".split("@")[1]  or localPath =proxy.split("@")[1]</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It seems unlikely that you're unable to modify the snippet that you currently have to access the second part. If you don't understand that line well enough to do that, I'd recommend a structured tutorial e.g. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/tutorial</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@toheedNiaz That's splitting a string not what I want</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@jonrsharpe It seems stupid that something so simple like that would be impossible?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What do you mean that's not what you want? It's what you're doing now! Of course this isn't impossible, indeed it's so trivial that the only charitable assumption is that you haven't correctly explained the problem. I'd recommend you <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/posts/49884154/edit">edit</a> the question.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why would you split it again every time?</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>userpass, hostport = prox.split('@')</code></span>
