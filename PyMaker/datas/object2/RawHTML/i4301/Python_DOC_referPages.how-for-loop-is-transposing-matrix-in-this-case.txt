<p>As a sidenote - why come from the official tutorial pages here to get it explained? Why not also cite them?</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Try using <code>numpy</code> module it has much more features for dealing with matrixes then pure Python.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is the <b>exact</b> example in the official tutorial: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#nested-list-comprehensions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">datastructures.html#nested-list-comprehensions</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">thanks patrick, i am learning from official tutorials only asked the question as i was unable to understand. I am new to stackoverflow too, didn't know how that we can directly cite out here.</span>
