<p>I have repeatedly installed and uninstalled <code>beautifulsoup4</code>, but no matter what I try to do, when I try to <code>import bs4</code> in shell, I get <code>ModuleNotFoundError</code>. </p>
<p>I'm on <code>Windows 10</code> and using <code>Python 3.6.4</code>. I'm new to programming, but am on my third Python book and this is the first time I've run into a big problem trying to import a module, including those I've installed using <code>pip</code>. </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Are you writing-</p>
<p><code>pip install beautifulsoup4</code> ?</p>
<p>This will install only <code>beautifulsoup4</code> module and not <code>bs4</code>.</p>
<p>Do this:-</p>
<p><code>pip install bs4</code></p>
<p>And then do this in your python file:-</p>
<p><code>from bs4 import BeautifulSoup</code></p>
<p>Also you may need administrator access for installing.</p>

<p>So, I don't really understand what is happening, but I at least temporarily solved my problem. I have two different "Lib &gt; site-packages" directories in my C: drive, and pip is installing in a different one from what Python is using. So I just copied the BeautifulSoup and bs4 folders and pasted them into the one that Python is using, and now it works. </p>
<p>Python is using this folder: "C:\Users\Victor Hart\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python36-32", while pip is installing bs4 and BeautifulSoup here: "C:\Users\Victor Hart\Envs\virtual", which doesn't make any sense to me. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">(1) <code>pip --version</code> to see what version of Python <code>pip</code> corresponds to. (2) <code>pip freeze</code> to see that it's installed. (3) <code>python --version</code> and <code>python -c 'import bs4'</code> just in case.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">C:\&gt;pip --version pip 9.0.3 from c:\users\victor~1\envs\virtual\lib\site-packages (python 3.6)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">C:\&gt;pip freeze beautifulsoup4==4.6.0</span>

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for the suggestion. Yes, I wrote that, but I had also installed bs4 and written "from bs4 import beautifulsoup4", but I still get exactly the same error.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">C:\Users\Victor Hart&gt;pip install bs4 Requirement already satisfied: bs4 in c:\users\victor~1\envs\virtual\lib\site-packages Requirement already satisfied: beautifulsoup4 in c:\users\victor~1\envs\virtual\lib\site-packages (from bs4) You are using pip version 9.0.3, however version 10.0.1 is available. You should consider upgrading via the 'python -m pip install --upgrade pip' command.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">try installing via pip3, and check whether the module bs4 is in your project's folder or not. If not then do shift it manually.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I've done that as well, both bs4 and beautifulsoup4. I get the exact same messages.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I have improved my answer, do this:- from bs4 import BeautifulSoup</span>
<span class="comment-copy">this is not a solution to the underlying problem, which is that you have pip installed in a virtualenv. You need to use the pip that is part of your installed python (might need to install it if its not present), or use the python in <code>C:\Users\Victor Hart\Envs\virtual\bin</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">see <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the documention on using virtual environments</a> to understand more</span>
