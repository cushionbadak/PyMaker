I would like to Create a .txt file and then delete it...
I already tried FileName.close() and FileName.flush()</p>
<p>I need to stop the program and rerun it to recognize the file and be able to delete it.</p>
<p>Here is my code:</p>
<pre><code>import os 
temp = input("Please Enter File Name to create: ")
FileName = open(temp,"w+")
print("File Created!"+"\n")

temp = input("Please Enter File Name to delete: ")
os.remove(temp)
print("File Removed!)
</code></pre>

<p>This is what danihp means:</p>
<pre><code>import os 
temp = input("Please Enter File Name to create: ")
FileName = open(temp,"w+")
print("File Created!"+"\n")
FileName.close() # &lt;---

temp = input("Please Enter File Name to delete: ")
os.remove(temp)
print("File Removed!)
</code></pre>

<p>There is a tempfile module in the standard library. You should not be doing this yourself with os method calls.</p>
<p>The tempfile module will respect the operating system's native methods of creating temp files and will clean up the temp file automatically even if an exception happens.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/tempfile.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/tempfile.html</a></p>
<p>Look at TempFile and NamedTemporaryFile.</p>
<p>Also os method calls are pretty much depreciated in favor of pathlib. It provides a much cleaner OO syntax.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">There are nothing wrong on your code (if you include FileName.close() before to os.remove ) This code creates a file and then deletes it ( if name match )</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Add the error traceback as well</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I added a picture of the error</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Not sure if that's your actual use case, but if you want to create a temporary file and delete it at the end of the program's execution, there's a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/tempfile.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">modue</a> for that.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">FileName should be file_name in python.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you that worked</span>
