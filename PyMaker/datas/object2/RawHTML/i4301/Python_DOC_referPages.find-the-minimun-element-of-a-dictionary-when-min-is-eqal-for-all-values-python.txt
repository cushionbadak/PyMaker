<p>I have this </p>
<pre><code>my_dict = {'x':500, 'y':500, 'z': 500}
min_s=min(my_dict, key=my_dict.get)
</code></pre>
<p>when I print the <code>min_s</code>, it arbitrary print either <code>x</code> or <code>y</code> or <code>z</code>, but I want to just print the first key meaning <code>x</code>. How can I do this?</p>
<p>Also, how can I check if all values are the same ? </p>
<p>Thanks </p>

<p>Dictionaries in python are not (insertion) ordered, the order will basically follow whatever hash function the dictionary is using for your keys, and that can change everytime.</p>
<p>For (insertion) order preserving dictionaries you should use <code>collections.OrderedDict</code>, see the docs for more details: <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/collections.html#collections.OrderedDict" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/2/library/collections.html#collections.OrderedDict</a></p>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong>
However, for Python 3.6+ dicts will be insertion ordered. See this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39980323/are-dictionaries-ordered-in-python-3-6">SO discussion</a> for more details, or read the related <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0468/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PEP 468</a></p>

<p>Use OrderedDict to retain the insertion order:</p>
<pre><code>from collections import OrderedDict
my_dict = OrderedDict(x=500, y=500, z=500)
min_s = min(my_dict) # 'x'
</code></pre>
<p>You can check that all values are the same by creating a set with the dict values and checking its length:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; len(set(my_dict.values())) == 1
True
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">You want the first key in alphabetic order or in the order you add them to the dict? Take a look at the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.OrderedDict" rel="nofollow noreferrer">OrderedDict</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">in the same way that I add them to the dictionary</span>
