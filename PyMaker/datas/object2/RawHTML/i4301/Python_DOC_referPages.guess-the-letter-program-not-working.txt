<p>I'm creating a very basic "guess the letter" game. My code is below. When I run the program and enter one of the correct listed letters, it still runs the code as if it was an incorrect letter. What do I need to fix?</p>
<pre><code>letters = ("M","K","O","W","X","S","A")

guess = input("Guess a letter: ")

while guess.lower() != letters:
    print("Incorrect!")
    input("Guess a letter: ")
    if guess.lower() == letters:
        print(guess,"is correct!")

input("Press Enter to Continue")
</code></pre>
<p>When the code is working properly, it should display something like this:</p>
<pre><code>Guess a letter: p
Incorrect!
Guess a letter: q
Incorrect!
Guess a letter: m
M is correct!
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You need to compare the user's guess with the uppercase letters in <code>letters</code> using <code>guess.upper()</code> not <code>guess.lower()</code>. You should also compare the guessed letter using <code>in</code> rather than checking for equality with a tuple. Finally, you will need to store the user's updated guess again within the <code>while</code> statement:</p>
<pre><code>letters = ("M","K","O","W","X","S","A")

guess = input("Guess a letter: ")

while guess.upper() not in letters:
    print("Incorrect!")
    guess = input("Guess a letter: ")

print(guess,"is correct!")
input("Press Enter to Continue")
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">But <code>guess</code> is only defined once: before the loop. <code>guess</code> won't change unless you set it to something with <code>guess = (...)</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Debugging suggestion: type <code>"M" != letters</code> into the interpreter and see what you get. And why are you lowercasing the guess when everything in <code>letters</code> is uppercase?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Adding .lower() allows the user to enter their guess in either lower or uppercase, right? Just trying to make it more user friendly so guesses don't need to be uppercase.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Never mind, I see that .upper() is what I need to achieve that instead.</span>
