<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have this code so far:</p>
<pre><code>def name_counts(name_list):
    name_dict = {}
    for word in name_list:
        if word in name_dict:
            name_dict[word] += 1
        else:
            name_dict[word] = 1


print(name_counts(name_list))
</code></pre>
<p>which is resulting in:</p>
<p>but I need it to only print the first names, not the lasts. How would I do that? I know that I should use the split function but anytime I do <code>name_list.split()</code> it returns with an attribute error. </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I would create a temporary variable at the start of the <code>for</code> loop which would contain the split name, like so:</p>
<pre><code>for word in name_list:
  name = word.split()[0]
  if name in name_dict:
    name_dict[name] += 1
  else:
    name_dict[name] = 0
</code></pre>
<p>Note that the <code>.split()</code> function returns a <code>list</code>, so to get the first name, you have to get the item at index <code>0</code>.</p>
<p>Hope that helps!</p>

<p>The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.Counter" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Counter</a> from the collection module does just that! You can use: </p>
<pre><code>from collections import Counter
# get firstname from name
print(Counter(firstname))
</code></pre>
<p>EDIT: I'll let you figure out how to parse the firstname :)</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You are very close! What you are doing in your function right now is just looking at the full name, while the directions say you should just be looking at the first name and seeing how much it appeared. what you should have is something like this. While looking through each word in the loop, make an array, lets say <code>name</code> and set it to <code>word.split()</code>. Then like in your following code, check if <code>name[0]</code> (the first name) exists in the list, and increment <code>name_dict[name[0]]</code> if it does. If not, make a new key with <code>name[0]</code> and set it to 1.</p>

<p>This can be achieved in a single line using <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">list comprehensions</a>.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt;from collections import Counter
&gt;&gt;&gt;name_list = ["Davy Jones", "Davy Crockett", "George Washington"]
&gt;&gt;&gt;Counter([name.split()[0] for name in name_list])
#result --&gt;
Counter({'Davy': 2, 'George': 1})

<span class="comment-copy">Thank you so much! Whenever i used split i would forget to index it, so that was my problem</span>
