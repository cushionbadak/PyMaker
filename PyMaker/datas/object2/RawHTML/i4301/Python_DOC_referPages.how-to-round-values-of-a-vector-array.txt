<p>I'm working on a Python code and I need to round the values of this following array:</p>
<pre><code>P = [[3.2, 3.7, 2.1],
    [4.5, 2.1, 2.3],
    [3.1, 2.5]]
</code></pre>
<p>And finally get: </p>
<pre><code> P= [[3, 4, 2],
     [5, 2, 2],
     [3, 3]]
</code></pre>
<p>I tried the following method but it doesn't work.</p>
<pre><code>  for i in range(len(P)):
    P[i] = int(round(P[i], 0))
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use list comprehensions:</p>
<pre><code>P= [[3.2, 3.7, 2.1],
    [4.5, 2.1, 2.3],
    [3.1, 2.5]]

P2 = [[int(round(x,0)) for x in y] for y in P]
# P is your list of lists
# y is each inner list
# x is each element in y
# rounding logic is as yours

print(P2)
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code> [[3, 4, 2], [5, 2, 2], [3, 3]]
</code></pre>

<p>Edit: 2.7 and 3.6 behave differently - I used a 2.7 shell.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong> The behavior of round() for floats can be surprising: for
  example, round(2.675, 2) gives 2.67 instead of the expected 2.68. This
  is not a bug: it’s a result of the fact that most decimal fractions
  can’t be represented exactly as a float. See <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/floatingpoint.html#tut-fp-issues" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Floating Point
  Arithmetic: Issues and Limitations</a> for more information.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can fix it by creating your own round-Method:</p>
<pre><code>def myRounder(num):
    return int(num)+1 if num - int(num) &gt;= 0.5 else int(num)    

P= [[3.2, 3.7, 2.1],
    [4.5, 2.1, 2.3],
    [3.1, 2.5]]

P2 = [[int(myRounder(x)) for x in y] for y in P]
# P is your list of lists
# y is each inner list
# x is each element in y
# rounding logic is as yours

print(P2)
</code></pre>
<p>This will lead to the same results on 2.7 and 3.x.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">since its a list of list, try doing a second level of iteration.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hello patrick! it works but my output it's not the same as you. I don't know why my console round 0.5 to min value (0, not 1). You know how to fix it?</span>
