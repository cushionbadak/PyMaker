<p>I have the following Python homework:</p>

<p>This is what the file looks like:</p>

<p>I have been asked to handle some special cases in my calculations. For example, when I had something like 25/0 it will become an error. How can I do that?</p>

fin.close()

print('-' * 30, "\nThe list of the lines in the file:\n", fLinesList)

print("\nThere are", len(fLinesList), "lines\n")

          # Print file content line by line
print('\n' + '-' * 30 + '\nFile "' + fName + '" contains:\n')

<p>I didn't read your code, on the account of it being too long, and was confused by what you wanted, on the account of it being non-descriptive (no offense). But you ask "How am I suppose to make an exception?" You can make a custom exception with <code>Exception</code> as your superclass (is this the correct terminology?). Look at this for an example:</p>
<pre><code>class MyError(Exception): #exception names usually end with 'Error'
    pass
</code></pre>
<p>This should be the way to start making a custom exception, and you can learn more later. Hope this helps slightly.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong>:
Remember not to create any custom exceptions that have a similar built-in exception, such as <code>ZeroDivisionError</code>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Can you make a summary of the feature you want to implement and reduce the line of code. It's hard to look at your whole code. Thanks.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is not <code>pasteyourhomework.com</code> !!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You can read about errors and exceptions here: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Pro-tip: when posting a homework problem or data files, post them in text. Homework problems and data files are in text, and text is more compatible with screen-readers, clipboards and search engines, and so pasting them in the most appropriate format will allow readers to help you more easily. If you have to re-type these things from a printed page, then that's what you must do.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Pro-tip: when asking questions, choose a useful title. "Please help me with my homework" is not very useful, and is primarily made up of pleading, which may discourage readers from helping you. I have improved it based on the question you have asked, but I am not sure that "exceptions" is the key thing here, unless that is an explicit direction from your teacher.</span>
