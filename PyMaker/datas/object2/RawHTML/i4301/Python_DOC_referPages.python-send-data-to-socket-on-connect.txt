<p>I've got a (third party) socket, that accepts input. I can call it from commandline with:</p>
<pre><code>nc www.host.com 1234 &lt; inputfile.txt
</code></pre>
<p>I then get a response and the connection closes. 
I try to write a python script that automates calling this service. I want to send data directly (not from a file) to it. </p>
<p>I tried it with a python script and socket.send() and recv() function. But the service gets no input on connection, so it returns an error and closes. when calling .send I get a broken pipe error (cause the connection got closed)
my code (snippet):</p>
<pre><code>s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
s.connect((HOST, PORT))
s.send(data)
data = s.recv(256)
</code></pre>
<p>the error:</p>
<pre><code>socket.error: [Errno 32] Broken pipe
</code></pre>
<p>The error is because the socket connection is closed by the server immediately if there are is no data. the .send is too late. </p>
<p>Is sending data on connect possible using python (I assume it is)</p>

<p>My answer for now (I post this as an answer because it works, but I won't accept it because it's ugly as hell) is to use netcat and call it from python. 
This works because it's like using nc in command-line. The approach is ugly as hell though:</p>
<pre><code>proc = Popen("nc www.host.com 1234", shell=True, stdin=PIPE, stdout=PIPE)
data, err = proc.communicate(data)
</code></pre>
<p>This is for Python 2.7, for Python 3 there is <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.run" rel="nofollow noreferrer">subprocess.run</a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.check_output" rel="nofollow noreferrer">subprocess.check_output</a>. (Got no code snippet for this because I coded the script in 2.7)</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Did you try to "write a python script that automates calling this service"? Did it work? If not, did it produce an error mesage?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Robáµ© of course I tried ;) edited my question</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What error is produced? What code did you use?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">And yes it is possible... <i>Everything</i> is possible</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Try using connect_ex and see what it returns i.e. does it even connect?</span>
