<p>I am new to Python and i want to know how to combine a String with all the elements of a List and then save Output in a <code>.txt</code> File. But the window just open and close immediately because the code is wrong. This is my code:</p>
<pre><code>List = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

String = input("Please enter a name: ")
Output = String + List
print(Output)

f= open("Text.txt","w+")
f.write(Output + "\n")
f.close()
</code></pre>
<p>I am expecting to see this results:</p>
<pre><code>Please enter a name: Username
Username1 Username2 Username3 Username4 Username5
</code></pre>
<p>And in the Text File like this:</p>
<pre><code>Username1
Username2
Username3
Username4
Username5
</code></pre>
<p>How am i supposed to do this? If the question is not clear please let me know. My first language is not English so is hard for me to explain. Thanks for your time :)</p>

<p>I reckon you can use a list comprehension:</p>
<pre><code>List = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

String = input("Please enter a name: ")

Output = [String + str(x) for x in List]

print(Output)
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>['Username1', 'Username2', 'Username3', 'Username4', 'Username5']
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Following Jacob G. entry your code should look like this:</p>
<pre><code>List = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# input() only works for Python 3.x . Use raw_input() if using python 2.x
InputName = input("Please enter a name: ")
Usernames = [InputName + str(entry) for entry in List]
print(Usernames)

file= open("Text.txt","w+")
for username in Usernames:
   file.write(username)
file.close()
</code></pre>

Invest some time with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the Tutorial</a> practicing the examples. It will give you an idea of the tools Python offers to help you solve your problem.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Then you have another for loop which then writes each of those entries into a new line on the text file</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yucky variable naming especially for someone who is just learning the language. I suggest an edit to name them something more reasonable.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ChadVanDeHey I agree, but direct that to OP in his question.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ChadVanDeHey Yeha, i know that but i change the name of the variables just to make this Question easier to understand because as i said its hard for me to explain because i don't speak English very well. In my real code i have used: Chars - List | Username - String | Password - Output | Which is think is good for me. Thanks for the suggestion anyway :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@JacobG. Hm... I don't know if i am doing anything wrong but this is not working. I get an error after i type a name in the "String". Do you know what is going on?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for making the code easier for me :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Aghh... I am sorry but both your code and Jacob G. code is not working. I don't know if i am doing anything wrong but after i give my input to the "InputName" the Terminal just close and the Text.txt file don't get created. I tried to type the code one by one in the Python IDLE and i get this error after i type the 2nd command: NameError: name 'username' is not defined.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">And when i run the 3rd command i get this error: TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Ben10 It turns out OP was using Python 2.7 and had to use <code>raw_input</code> instead.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for trying to help again i really appreciate it but i have fixed the error now. The problem was that i was using Python 2.7 where you need to use raw_input and your code was for -V 3.x so i just installed the latest version of Python now and its working perfectly. Thanks a lot for helping me to get started :)</span>
