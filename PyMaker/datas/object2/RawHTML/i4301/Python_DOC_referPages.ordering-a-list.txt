<p>I have a list like this,</p>
<pre><code>M=[[75], [95, 64], [17, 47, 82], [18, 35, 87, 10], [20, 4, 82, 47, 65], [19, 
1, 23, 75, 3, 34], [88, 2, 77, 73, 7, 63, 67], [99, 65, 4, 28, 6, 16, 70, 
92], [41, 41, 26, 56, 83, 40, 80, 70, 33], [41, 48, 72, 33, 47, 32, 37, 16, 
94, 29], [53, 71, 44, 65, 25, 43, 91, 52, 97, 51, 14], [70, 11, 33, 28, 77, 
73, 17, 78, 39, 68, 17, 57], [91, 71, 52, 38, 17, 14, 91, 43, 58, 50, 27,

98, 27, 23, 9, 70, 98, 73, 93, 38, 53, 60, 4, 23]]
</code></pre>
<p>and I would like to sort it by the largest number on the "zero" position for each element in the list for example,</p>
<pre><code>M=[[75], [95, 64], [82, 47, 17], [87, 35, 18, 10].....]
</code></pre>
<p>I tried to use a key but it didnt work well also I didnt know why it didnt work well..Here the key</p>
<pre><code>def Len(elem):
    for i in range(16):
        y=len(K[i])
        return elem[y-1]
y=sorted(K,key=Len)
print(y)
</code></pre>
<p>Maybe I just didnt understand the key function.
Thanks</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Just use <code>sorted</code> (or <code>list.sort</code>) without a <code>key</code>. They already sort lexicographically.</p>

<p>Try operator itemgetter function as key.
Like this:
    <code>
from operator import itemgetter
sorted(K,key=itemgetter(0))</code></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>try using index of each element :</p>
<pre><code>for i in M:
    M[M.index(i)]=sorted(i,reverse=True)

<span class="comment-copy">Do you also want to preserve the ordering of individual lists?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">does "sort by the largest" mean you want the large numbers at the front or at the end?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You should read the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/sorting.html#sortinghowto" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Sorting HOWTO</a> in the docs to understand how key functions work. The key function should be looking at the element, not the entire list.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Also, putting an unconditional <code>return</code> inside a loop like that defeats the purpose of looping. You may want to read about <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#defining-functions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">functions</a> in the tutorial if it's not obvious to you why that is.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Look at my sample code I want it like that</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Okay it works, thanks a lot</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Wait I read it wrong it doesnt work like that. I want to display the largest number for each array in the descending form.For example in your response the last element is [4, 62, 98, 27, 23, 9, 70, 98, 73, 93, 38, 53, 60, 4, 23] but I need something like [98,98,93,...etc] I mean for each element in the list should be ordered.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ArthurMorgan so in other words, you want to sort each list in your list of lists?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">well yes I want it like that.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Your edit also works thanks for that too</span>
<span class="comment-copy">no need to specify the key since it's the default behavior...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Julien it is actually different behavior than lexicographic sort. The OP is not clear on whether that matters or not.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">actually just the larger number on the zero element also fine by me</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I ll try yours now</span>
<span class="comment-copy">well it works...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ArthurMorgan so problem solved?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, its solved thanks</span>
