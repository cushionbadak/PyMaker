<p>I'm trying to calculate rolling r-squared of regression among first column and other columns in a dataframe (first column and second, first column and third etc.) But when I try threading, it kept telling me the error that </p>
<blockquote>
<p>TypeError: ParallelRegression() argument after * must be an iterable, not int". </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm wondering how do I fix this? Thanks very much!</p>
<pre><code>import threading

totalThreads=3 #three different colors
def ParallelRegression(threadnum):
    for i in range(threadnum):
        res[:,i]=sm.OLS(df.iloc[:,0], df.iloc[:,i+1]).fit().rsquared
threads=[]
for threadnum in range(totalThreads):
    t=threading.Thread(target=ParallelRegression,args=(threadnum))
    threads.append(t)
    t.start()
for threadnum in range(totalThreads):
    threads[threadnum].join()

<p><code>threading.Thread</code> class needs an iterable of arguments as the <code>args</code> parameter. You're passing <code>args=(threadnum)</code> which is a single <code>int</code> object, you need to pass some iterable object that would allow multiple args, even when you only want to pass one arg.</p>
<p><code>args=[threadnum]</code> would work, because that makes a <code>list</code> which is iterable.</p>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>args=(threadnum)</code> looks like it might be a typo. Is args supposed to be a tuple? One-element tuples need a trailing comma: <code>args=(threadnum,)</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why answer something that could be considered a typo, <i>and</i> has been asked and answered countless times already? <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3221655/python-threading-string-arguments">This duplicate</a> was literally my first google result and took a whopping 5 seconds to find.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Changing <code>args</code> to a list works on my machine, and I'd expect it to work on most Python distributions/environments, but I think it's an implementation detail that shouldn't be depended on. The docs for <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html#threading.Thread" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>Thread</code></a> only say that args is "the argument tuple for the target invocation". If you give it anything other than a tuple, let the buyer beware.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Aran-Fey why not? Is it frowned upon to answer questiosn?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It is frowned upon to answer obvious duplicates, yes. If you need to know why: Because it's better if we have all the answers in a single place.</span>
