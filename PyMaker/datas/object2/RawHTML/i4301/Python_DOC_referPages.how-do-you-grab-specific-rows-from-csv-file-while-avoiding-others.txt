<p>Say I have 100 lines in a csv file.</p>
<p>However, I want rows 3-9 and 10-37.</p>
<p>Basically trying to skip certain rows. How could I accomplish this?</p>

<p>On my first answer I showed you how to get specific columns, my bad. I misread your question. In order to get specific rows, you can use list comprehension.</p>
<pre><code>desired_row_indexes = [1, 2, 3, 10, 11, 12] # You can also use ranges
desired_rows = [row for idx, row in enumerate(csv_document) if idx in desired_row_indexes]
</code></pre>

<p>You can use the panda package to parse your CSV and skip specific row.</p>
<pre><code>import pandas as pd    
df = pd.read_csv('myfile.csv', skiprows='list with row number to skip')
</code></pre>
