<p>It says <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/platform.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a> both Platform.dist() and platform.linux_distribution has been <strong>deprecated</strong> in version 3.5 and will be <strong>removed</strong> in version 3.7 (Current version 3.6.5 with 3.7 in preview mode). and I can't find any way around on how to find/get linux distro name in python3! </p>
<p>Any way? Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>I didn't search this a lot, but if you want the version informations, an easy way, maybe what python's <code>platform.linux_distribution</code> did anyway, would be to read files </p>
<p><code>/etc/*-release</code>
or
<code>/proc/version</code></p>
<p>and see what you can get from them. ^^' </p>
<p>So long that it's not in a performance-wise critical section of the code. </p>
<p>Have a nice day!</p>

<p>After a small search, I found it <a href="https://pypi.org/project/distro/#description." rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a> and it can be installed with <code>pip install distro</code>. 
Then <code>import distro</code> instead of the <code>import platform</code>.</p>
<pre><code>import distro 
print(distro.linux_distribution())
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>('Ubuntu', '18.04', 'Bionic Beaver')
</code></pre>
<p>I’ve tested in python versions 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 and it’s working perfectly.</p>

<p>This pip package solves it. [Not limited to python 3.7 issue]</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Okay.. I have some time to kill.. If I don't find any other solution, I will try this and mark yours as correct answer. (If works)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">And of course you can encapsulate it in your own platform.distribution module if you want to stay compatible with old code when upgrading to python 7. ;) (Might need to give a different name and do some search/replace over the files tho.)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hi and welcome to StackOverflow! Please try and always include a small code example or text-excerpt if you provide external links. In this case, you could include a quick demonstration how the module you found provides the desired information, and what the information looks like.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Do you mean something like this? <code>import distro  print(distro.linux_distribution())  ('Ubuntu', '18.04', 'Bionic Beaver')</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, that is a good example. You could edit your question again and include it their for completeness.</span>
