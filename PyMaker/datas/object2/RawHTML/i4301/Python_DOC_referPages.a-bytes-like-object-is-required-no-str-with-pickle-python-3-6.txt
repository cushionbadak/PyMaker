<p>I am struggling to get this code fix with python3.6 on my macos, although this code used to run on python 2.x
Keep getting this errors a bytes-like object is required, no 'str' and unable to make it work although changing code around by 'r' -&gt; 'rb' "w" -&gt;"wb" or pickle.load(f) pickle.loads(f)  </p>
<p>for the function write() also get error "write() argument must be str, not bytes"</p>
<p>here is link for full code

<p>According to Python's official documentation:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html#pickle.load" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html#pickle.load</a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html#pickle.loads" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html#pickle.loads</a></li>
</ul>
<p><code>pickle.load()</code> expects an opened file object to be passed as a first positional argument, whereas <code>pickle.loads()</code> expects <code>bytes</code> object. Note the <code>encoding="ASCII"</code> parameter as well. Speaking of <code>encoding</code>, the documentation states that you can set it to <code>bytes</code> to let <code>pickle</code> read 8-bit string instances as <code>bytes</code> objects.</p>
<p>I have never used <code>pickle</code> before and therefore can't give concrete answer but maybe try rewriting your snippet like this:</p>
<pre><code>with open("saved_params_{}.npy".format(st), "rb") as f:
    file_contents = f.read()
    # use pickle.load(file_contents) from now on
</code></pre>
<p>Actually, when you do <code>f.read()</code>, entire file contents will be read and file cursor will point to the end of the file. When you use <code>read()</code> next time, there will be no contents left for you to read, because the first call already "consumed" entire file. Maybe that is the problem, because in second call to <code>pickle.read()</code> you pass empty file contents?</p>
<p>Hope it helped a bit :)</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Can you add the full traceback so we see exactly which line causes the error?</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>params = pickle.loads(f)</code> looks odd to me - <code>loads</code> expects a bytes object but you're passing it a file...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I just add a code in pastebin link.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">when use "r" it get the above error, but when I change to "rb" i get "ran out of input" error. still confusing</span>
