<li>You probably don’t have access to the website because you need an API key or somewhat</li>
<li>Don’t use urllib with a discord bot. Urllib is a synchronous lib while a discord bot is asynchronous so urllib will block the rest of your bot from running when making a request
This is why aiohttp is ideally the best web requests lib for discord bots because it does run asynchronously
I suggest you check it out it’s very simple and great</li>

<p>Edit: Patrick Haugh said the same thing as me before me in a comment. I just didn’t see it before writing this answer</p>
