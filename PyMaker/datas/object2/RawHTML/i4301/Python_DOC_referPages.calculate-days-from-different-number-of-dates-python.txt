<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>For a particular user having number of dates, I want to calculate total number of days bewteen two dates. Here the problem is a particular user has around 5 dates at random interval and I want to calculate frequency for the user. For two dates I know how to calculate but dont know for number of dates.</p>
<p>data looks like:
<code>[datetime.date(2016, 1, 1) datetime.date(2016, 3, 25)
 datetime.date(2016, 4, 15)]</code> and I want to calculate total number of gaps between dates.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>Assuming you need the diff between the date in your list. You can iterate over the list and use <code>enumerate</code></p>
<pre><code>import datetime
l = [datetime.date(2016, 1, 1), datetime.date(2016, 3, 25), datetime.date(2016, 4, 15)]
leng = len(l)
res = 0
for i,v in enumerate(l):
    if i+1 == leng:
        break
    else:
        res += (l[i+1] - v).days 
print(res)
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>
<pre><code>105
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Given that you need the difference between the first and last date (the list doesn't need to be sorted), you can just do:</p>
<pre><code>from datetime import date

days = [date(2016, 1, 1), date(2016, 3, 25), date(2016, 4, 15)] 

print (max(days) - min(days)).days    #Prints 105
</code></pre>
<p>As it doesn't matter how many dates are in the middle, the result will be the same as <code>(days[2] - days[1]) + (days[1] - days[0])</code>. As you can see the <code>days[1]</code> cancels out and the result is just <code>days[2] - days[0]</code> in the sorted list.</p>

<h3>Below is my original answer to which I thought the average between each day was needed</h3>
<p>Given that the days list is sorted, you can use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/itertools.html#recipes" rel="nofollow noreferrer">pairwise recipe</a> that uses <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/itertools.html#itertools.tee" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>itertools.tee</code></a> to create a generator that grabs all the differences for you then get the arithmatic mean in days from the result.</p>
<pre><code>from datetime import date
from itertools import tee

days = [date(2016, 1, 1), date(2016, 3, 25), date(2016, 4, 15)] 

def pairwise(iterable):
    "s -&gt; (s0,s1), (s1,s2), (s2, s3), ..."
    a, b = tee(iterable)
    next(b, None)
    return zip(a, b)

def mean(numbers):
    numbers = list(numbers)
    return float(sum(num.days for num in numbers)) / max(len(numbers), 1)

pairs = pairwise(days)                # Returns [(datetime.date(2016, 1, 1), datetime.date(2016, 3, 25)), (datetime.date(2016, 3, 25), datetime.date(2016, 4, 15))]
diff = list(b - a for a, b in pairs)  # Returns [datetime.timedelta(84), datetime.timedelta(21)]
print mean(diff)                      # Returns 52.5

<span class="comment-copy">What would be the expected output for your example?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If there are three separate dates wouldn't there be two <i>gaps</i>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">So you want the number of days between the first and last date, without the days where there is a date in your list?</span>

<span class="comment-copy">for  the data shown above the final output is 105 days.logic is as var a= date[0][2]-date[0][1]. Var b= date[0][1]-date[0][0]. print(a+b).</span>
