<p>I am trying to link <code>python2.7</code> to the most recent brew install, which corresponds to <code>python 2.7.13</code>. I know of answers like this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13354207/how-to-symlink-python-in-homebrew">link python with brew</a>. But it's still confusing for me.</p>
<p>What I need is to have <code>python2.7</code> link to <code>/usr/local/Cellar/python/2.7.13/bin/python2.7</code>. I can achieve <code>python</code>
 to link to <code>/usr/local/Cellar/python/2.7.13/bin/python2.7</code>.</p>
<p>The problem is I have scripts that call <code>python2.7</code> and no matter what I do it always returns the old MacOS installation of <code>python2.7.5</code>.</p>
<p>I have also tried <code>brew link --overwrite python@2</code> but the same thing happens.</p>
<p>Ideally I would like <code>python</code> to link to <code>python3.6</code> and <code>python2.7</code> to link to <code>python2.7.13</code></p>

<p>Try to use virtual environment for your script <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">virtual environment Doc </a></p>

<span class="comment-copy">this sounds hacky but how about a <code>symlink</code> of the old python installation with the new one</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, I do use a virtualenv but this particular project created it's virtualenv so it's not up to me.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">So modify the virtual env, not your system installation.</span>
