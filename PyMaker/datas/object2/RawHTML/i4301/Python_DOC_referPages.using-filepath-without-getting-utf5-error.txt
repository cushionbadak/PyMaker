<p>This is a filepath, that I Need to Keep.
Spyder Shows that <code>\\S24014</code> is the Problem. The file has <code># -*- coding: utf-8 -*-</code> at the top. How to solve the Problem?</p>

<p>It sounds as if you need to pass the string as a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#literals" rel="nofollow noreferrer">raw string literal</a>, i.e. <code>r'\\S24014\\file.xlsx</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Both string and bytes literals may optionally be prefixed with a
  letter <code>r</code> or <code>R</code>; such strings are called <em>raw strings</em> and treat
  backslashes as literal characters.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Is your string supposed to have any escaped characters in it or is it supposed to be literally <code>\\S24014\\file.xlsx</code>? If the latter, what happens if you pass it as a raw string i.e. <code>r'\\S24014\\file.xlsx</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This helped :-), thanks! Yes, the <code>\\S24014</code> path must stay.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Cool, I've posted that as an answer.</span>
