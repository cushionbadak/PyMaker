<p>I'm looking for a bit of guidance here. I'm completely new to Python, BS, Selenium, etc so please go easy on me. </p>
<p>My ISP doesn't provide alerts for my internet usage and I wanted to create my own monitoring for this. I managed to scrape the page I need using selenium and BeautifulSoup but now I'm a bit stuck. I have a container that has the following HTML code in it: </p>
<pre><code>[&lt;div class="usage_circle"&gt; &lt;center&gt;
&lt;div data-perc="69" data-transitiongoal="0.69" data-usage="150.29"&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/center&gt;&lt;/div&gt;]
</code></pre>
<p>I'd like to extract the <code>data-usage</code> value of 150.29. I've tried using the <code>findAll</code> function (previously used to get the above HTML), but it doesn't work in this case. </p>
<p>Could anyone guide me as to what I need to do to get this number into a variable?</p>
<p>Thank you in advance.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>In BeautifulSoup you can find all tags with "data-usage" attribute like this:</p>
<pre><code>e = soup.findAll(attrs={"data-usage" : True})
</code></pre>
<p>And then getting value of attribute will be easy, For your first match it will be:</p>
<pre><code>e[0]["data-usage"]
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This kind of problem is a great use case for the interactive Python prompt. Save some html, open the file, and mess around with the object until you can find a solution.</p>

<p>The tutorial really does provide you all you need:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/</a></p>
<p>In Selenium, you can usually find things using the webdriver and not have to directly invoke beautifulsoup at all.</p>
<p>In your case, you could grab that block by class name and/or get the data-usage field via a tag name (it has been a while, don't quote me on the exact function delclarations).</p>
<p>If you want to use BeautifulSoup for whatever reason, this example will work:</p>
<pre><code>from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

html_doc = """[&lt;div class="usage_circle"&gt; &lt;center&gt;
&lt;div data-perc="69" data-transitiongoal="0.69" data-usage="150.29"&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/center&gt;&lt;/div&gt;]"""

soup = BeautifulSoup(html_doc, 'lxml')
soup.div.center.div["data-usage"]
</code></pre>
<p>The more important lesson is <em>how</em> to find that tree, though. Get something like <a href="https://jupyter.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" title="jupyter">jupyter</a> if you want something prettier than a plain interactive console, but I intentionally used only code copied and minimally-altered from the quickstart.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Follow the examples in the documentation and adapt to suit?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I've been looking at the BS documentation for the past 45 minutes to no avail.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you very much, Sadiq. It worked. I kept trying something like e["data-usage"] and didn't understand why it didn't work. Can you please explain shortly why I need to use the index [0] too?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">findAll method returns a list of tags that have "data-usage" attribute(Most likely, in this case, this list contains only one tag), index [0] means first tag in that list.</span>
