<p>This is my first Project that i have to accomplish from the tutorial im currently facing.So here is the Problem i have.I am trying to use collatz(number) in order to get the collatz sequenze.I tryd to find a  similar Problem on stackoverflow but nothing i could relate to (or rather me not understanding it maybe).The error occurs on the second int part.An invalid syntax error occurs on it. I checked everything i could think of(checked all spaces inbetween also changed "except" to "else" because i had trouble there) and than this problem occurred.I also tried to get another paranthese on  <strong>else int((number)) %2==1:</strong> but that didn't help either. i hope you have enough information to help me out.Thank you very much for your Time.</p>
<pre><code> def collatz(number):
   number=input()
   try:
       if int(number) %2==0:
           print('hi')

   else int(number) %2==1:
           print(int(number*3+1))
</code></pre>

<p>So to fix your code as described:</p>
<pre><code>def collatz(number):
    number = input()         # number is passed in - doesn't make sense to get it again
    try:
        number = int(number) # Just interpret once
    except ValueError:       # try must have an except clause
        return               # exit on error

    if number%2 == 0:
        print('hi')
    elif number%2 == 1:      # Don't really need an elif - %2 can only have 2 values
        print(number*3+1)
</code></pre>
<p>However, you may want to look into using a generator (<code>yield</code>):</p>
<pre><code>def collatz(number):
    while number &gt; 1:
        if number % 2 == 0:
            number //= 2
        else:
            number = 3*number + 1
        yield number

def collatz_series():
    try:
        number = int(input())
    except ValueError:
        return

    for n in collatz(number):
        print(n)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">You may also want to look into the difference between <code>else</code> and <code>elif</code> and python is indentation sensitive. Also you are passing in the <code>number</code> and then redefining it with <code>input()</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">yes ive read python is indentation sensivtive thats why i looked over it dozens of times until i was sure its wasnt that problem. i had except instead of else in it at first . i actually changed else to elif now and added except at the try intendation so it worked now. the visualization helped me a lot right now. but appearently print(int(number*3+1)) is also wrong since i need an str. but thank you for the post. it actually helped me</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>print</code> doesn't need a string but <code>int()</code> expects one - your parens are in the wrong place.</span>
