<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I am very new to coding (just about few months in Python) and NLTK (~1 month). I have a list of sentences that I filtered out with <em>[ i for i in TokenizedSentences if "apple" in i ]</em> and it looks like this-- </p>
<pre><code>itemDict["Apple"] = [ i for i in TokenizedSentences if "apple" in i ]
</code></pre>
<p>output:</p>
<pre><code>["An apple a day, keeps a doctor away.", "My favorite desert is apple pie.", "Apple candy is sold out!!"]
</code></pre>
<p>I want to make each sentence a new line when I save the result to CSV file. A similar analogy would be Alt +Enter in Excel for PC and CTRL-OPT-RETURN in numbers for Mac. Is it possible? I have tried Textwrap, but the result is not exactly what I want. </p>
<p>Desired output: </p>
<pre><code>["An apple a day, keeps a doctor away.",

"My favorite desert is Apple pie.",

"Apple candy is sold out!!"]
</code></pre>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Your <code>itemDict["Apple"]</code> is a <code>list</code> of strings. What you get when printing it is a <strong>representation</strong> of the list, not the list itself. </p>
<p>The way Python represents lists is by enclosing the textual representations of its elements in square brackets, separated by commas. The square brackets and commas are <strong>not</strong> part of the data.</p>
<p>To obtain the expected output of your question would mean transforming the textual representation of the list, and would give you something that isn't valid csv.</p>
<p>What you want is one sentence per line, and that's all. </p>
<p>It's best to use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">csv</a> module to do that, so that it will take care of the quoting etc.</p>
<pre><code>import csv

sentences = ["An apple a day, keeps a doctor away.", "My favorite desert is apple pie.", "Apple candy is sold out!!"]

with open('sentences.csv', 'w', newline='') as f:
    writer = csv.writer(f)
    writer.writerows([sentence] for sentence in sentences)
</code></pre>
<p>You'll get this nice csv file:</p>
<pre><code>"An apple a day, keeps a doctor away."
My favorite desert is apple pie.
Apple candy is sold out!!
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Your desired output isn't really CSV, are you sure that this is what you want, with square brackets and all?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ThierryLathuille, I am only few months into coding and just one month into NLTKL, thus I still rely heavily on excel/page and powerpoint/keynote to complete my study/research. And thats why I posted this question in the first place-- afterall, its easier to remove square brackets than to make each sentence a line. Hope this makes sense to you.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Excel won't expect the square brackets. Just write a normal CSV file. Use Python's <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.writer" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>csv.writer</code></a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks!! But I have multiple lists in a dictionary that I want to have a new line per sentence: <i>"Apple","Mango","Orange"</i>.  I have tried below like (<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3348460/csv-file-written-with-python-has-blank-lines-between-each-row" title="csv file written with python has blank lines between each row">stackoverflow.com/questions/3348460/â€¦</a>) suggested, but it didnt work.  <code>with open("/Users/cya2017/Desktop/csv//Filename" + now + ".csv","w", newline = " ") as fOut:     csvOut = csv.DictWriter(fOut,["Event","Date","Member","keywordCount","Apple","Mango","Orange"])      csvOut.writeheader()      csvOut.writerows(Filename)</code></span>
