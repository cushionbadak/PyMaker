<p>How do you use basic ("default"/"built-in"; don't need to be imported) python methods in pybind11?<br/><br/>Lists, dictionaries, and some others do have built-in compatibility, but the method I am looking specifically for (open) is not included via an import. I know that a way around it would be to create a python file with a method wrapping "open" and then calling it as you would any imported method, but I would prefer to do it directly in C++ (using pybind) if possible as otherwise that semi-defeats the purpose.
<br/><br/>Any assistance/advice would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>You are wrong. First, built-in names are <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/builtins.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">importable from <code>builtins</code> module</a> (in Python 3):</p>
<pre><code>py::object open = py::module::import("builtins").attr("open");
</code></pre>
<p>Second, <code>open</code> also lives in <code>io</code> module so you can also use the following  line that is equivalent to the line above:</p>
<pre><code>py::object open = py::module::import("io").attr("open");
</code></pre>
<p>This is for Python 3, but the last line works for Python 2.7 too.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I've been looking for same functionallity. Unfortunately it seems like one should implement it by himself. <a href="https://github.com/pybind/pybind11/blob/master/include/pybind11/iostream.h" rel="nofollow noreferrer">github.com/pybind/pybind11/blob/master/include/pybind11/â€¦</a> looks like is a good point to start</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The builtin <code>open</code> has a different signature from <code>io.open</code> on Python 2, though.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Oh, okay. Thank you! :D</span>
