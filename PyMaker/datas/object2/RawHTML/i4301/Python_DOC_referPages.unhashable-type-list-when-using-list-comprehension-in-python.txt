<p>I have a set in my code called <code>malicious_urls</code> and I am trying to build a list comprehension from this.</p>
<p>When I run <code>'' in malicious_urls</code> I get a <code>False</code> return value. Also, I have an array <code>input</code> and when I run <code>[e for e in input]</code> I get the set back which is identical to input.</p>
<p>However, when I try to run <code>[e in malicious_urls for e in input]</code> to simply obtain a list of which input urls are malicious, I get an error back saying <code>TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'</code>?</p>

<p>If <code>input</code> is a list of lists (and it sounds like it is), your list comprehension is just missing a step.</p>
<pre><code>[[e in malicious_urls for e in i] for i in input]  
</code></pre>
<p>ex.</p>
<pre><code>s = {'a', 'b'}
l = [['a', 'c'], ['c', 'b']]
[[e in s for e in i] for i in l]
&gt; [[True, False], [False, True]]
</code></pre>
<p>If you want a flattened list, you can use list comprehension for that, too.</p>
<pre><code>[item for sublist in [[e in s for e in i] for i in l] for item in sublist]
</code></pre>

<p>I think this is not a good place to use a list comprehension, since what you want is the intersection of two lists.</p>
<p>Instead, I would use a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#sets" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>set</code></a>, as sets have intersection as a basic operation:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; malicious = {'badsite.com', 'reallybadsite.com', 'literallywillkillcomputer.com'}
&gt;&gt;&gt; sites = {'badsite.com', 'goodsite.com', 'literallywillkillcomputer.com'}
&gt;&gt;&gt; sites &amp; malicious
{'badsite.com', 'literallywillkillcomputer.com'}
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">@LutzHorn I have tried this but same issue</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@chrisz untrue, I have similar list comprehensions elsewhere in my code</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>input</code> contains lists. Checking whether a list is in a set throws a <code>TypeError</code> because you can't compute a hash for a list.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Please post a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve">Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">How does this fix the TypeError?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">As far as I understand, <code>input</code> is a list and <code>malicious_urls</code> is a set. In his list comprehension he has <code>malicious_urls</code> where a single item (<code>e</code>) should be.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Since all you've done is rearrange the code, I don't see how this does anything to solve the problem. If the OP's list comprehension throws a TypeError, so does yours. All you've done is change the output - which wasn't even incorrect to begin with.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ah, I see what you're saying. Editing the post.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">actually this doesn't help since I need to retain the order of the elements and obtain a boolean value for all elements in the array in the correct index to feed into a machine learning model</span>
