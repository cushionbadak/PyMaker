<span class="comment-copy">Why doesn't your example work?  Telling us "it doesn't work" doesn't say much.  What does it do?  Do you get an error?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Assuming <code>zipcode</code> and <code>page</code> are strings, your example would work, if you add a plus sign between <code>zipcode</code> and <code>'&amp;cursor</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">there is a syntax error when i try to use  the site = '<a href="https://www.website.com/home?search='+zipcode'&amp;cursor='+page" rel="nofollow noreferrer">website.com/â€¦</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">As I said, you're missing a plus sign after <code>zipcode</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Clean solution !!!</span>
