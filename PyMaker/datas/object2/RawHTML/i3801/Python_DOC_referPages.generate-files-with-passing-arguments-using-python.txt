<p>I would like to generate files using python is such way.
For example, I have <code>script_1.aas</code> file. Inside it, there are 2 parameters which are actually a different path of a network, in the example below, there are 2 folders <code>script_1</code> in different path :
<code>
...;
char const * const outputDir = "output\\script_1";
...
success = readNetworkWithLogLevel( net, "network\\script_1", LOGLEVEL_WARNING);</code></p>
<p>I would like to generate or create files using python with the same content and changing only these two parameters with the corresponding number (from 1 to 20), for example, 20 of <code>script_1</code> with incrementing the number one by one. <code>script_1, script_2, ... script_20</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Read the file:</p>
<pre><code>with open('script_1.aas') as f:
    content = f.read()
</code></pre>
<p>Iterate through the numbers 2-20; use string formatting to construct new strings and replace <code>script_1</code> with <code>script_n</code>; write to a new file.</p>
<pre><code>for n in range(2,20):
    new_content = content.replace('script_1', f'script_{n}')
    with open(f'script_{n}.aas', 'w') as f:
        f.write(new_content)
</code></pre>
<p>For python versions 2.7-3.5 replace</p>
<ul>
<li><code>f'script_{n}'</code> with <code>'script_{}'.format(n)</code></li>
<li><code>f'script_{n}.aas'</code> with <code>'script_{}.aas'.format(n)</code></li>
</ul>

<span class="comment-copy">And your question is... what? You are not familiar with python at all, so you'd like someone to do this for you? And you are not familiar with any other programming language either, so that is also not an option for you?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, I am familiar, but I dont know how to do it</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The general idea is: do what you can. At that point you will have some more specific questions, which you can look up in python specification, google, existing answers on SO. After that, you may still have some even more specific questions for which you do not have an answer and which are suitable for a question on SO. The way it is now, the question is too broad. What I could give you as an answer now is use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>open</code></a> to open a file and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#methods-of-file-objects" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>write</code></a> to write to it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Do you know how to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#reading-and-writing-files" rel="nofollow noreferrer">read from and write to files</a>?  ... Which version of python?</span>
