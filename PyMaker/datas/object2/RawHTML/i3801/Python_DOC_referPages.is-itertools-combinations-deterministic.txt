<p>Is the order of items obtained from itertools.combinations() deterministic?</p>
<p>I am currently writing a script which produces an excessively large number of objects using itertools.combinations, large enough that I can't retain it all in memory. For each combination, there is a function which returns a value that I store in a numpy array (since those are fairly memory efficient). I have just barely enough memory to store all of those floats.</p>
<p>I then iterate over those floats, and if it's an index of interest, I run itertools.combinations again with a counter variable to access the combination that produced that result (which only takes a few seconds).</p>
<p>I have tested this with various smaller datasets for which I have enough memory, and the entries all are the same in those cases, but I am worried that this is not a "safe" approach to doing what I want.</p>

<p>From the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.combinations" rel="noreferrer">docs</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Combinations are emitted in lexicographic sort order. So, if the input
  iterable is sorted, the combination tuples will be produced in sorted
  order.</p>
<p>Elements are treated as unique based on their position, not on their
  value. So if the input elements are unique, there will be no repeat
  values in each combination.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">@AmphotericLewisAcid - np. I literally just asked a question on SO for something I'd missed in the pandas documentation lol</span>
