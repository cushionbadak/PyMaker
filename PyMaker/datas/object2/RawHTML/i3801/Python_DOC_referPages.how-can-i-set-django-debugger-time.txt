<p>The Django debugger is <code>import pdb; pdb.set_trace()</code>.</p>
<p>Sometimes we push the code on the server without remove <code>debugger</code> from the code.</p>
<p>In this conditions when we request the view (that views contain <code>debugger</code>) then the page will not load and the browser will hang because of that debugger.</p>
<p>So my Question is.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can I set a <code>debugger</code> time</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>OR</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>How can I avoid <code>debugger</code> after a few minutes</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's the exception case because we always check in the code but sometimes we missed it by mistake.</p>
<p>How can I achieve this task?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance </p>

<p>If you are using python 3.7+, you can use the builtin function <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#breakpoint" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>breakpoint()</code></a>. The specific effect of this function can be modified by setting the environment variable <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONBREAKPOINT" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PYTHONBREAKPOINT</a></p>
<p>The default behaviour of <code>breakpoint()</code> is to use <code>pdb.set_trace()</code>, but you can use a <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonDebuggingTools" rel="nofollow noreferrer">third party debugger</a> instead.</p>
<p>If you set <code>PYTHONBREAKPOINT=0</code>, the debugger() function will not do anything (immediately return)</p>

<span class="comment-copy">The only reasonable answer is to change your development processes so that you never ship with the debugger enabled - before shipping just do a global search for <code>import pdb</code>; or use a IDE/development environment that doesn't need that import in order to run the debugger.</span>
