<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I want to open <em>any</em> .txt file in the same directory. </p>
<p>In ruby I can do </p>
<pre><code>File.open("*.txt").each do |line|
       puts line
end
</code></pre>
<p>In python I can't do this it will give an error</p>
<pre><code>file = open("*.txt","r")
print(file.read())
file.close()
</code></pre>
<p>It gives an error invalid argument.</p>
<p>So is there any way around it?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can directly use the <code>glob</code> module for this</p>
<pre><code>import glob
for file in glob.glob('*.txt'):
    with open(file, 'r') as f:
        print(f.read())
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.listdir" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>os.listdir</code></a> to list all files in the current directory.</p>
<pre><code>all_files = os.listdir()
</code></pre>
<p>Then, filter the ones which have the extension you are looking for and open each one of them in a loop.</p>
<pre><code>for filename in all_files:
    if filename.lower().endswith('.txt'):
        with open(filename, 'rt') as f:
            f.read()
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">You would have to find all files that end with .txt in that directory, and then have a for loop that reads the file. Here is a way to grab only files with certain extensions in a directory: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3964681/find-all-files-in-a-directory-with-extension-txt-in-python" title="find all files in a directory with extension txt in python">stackoverflow.com/questions/3964681/â€¦</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">You'll have to do it yourself. Take a look at os.listdir()</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, i used this way before but i found it bit inefficient</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@yippiez Inefficient as spends too much CPU, too much memory, or too much of your time as a developer? If it is the last one, well, create a function which you will always call ;)</span>
