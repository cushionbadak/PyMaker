<p>I am using MACOS 10.12.6</p>
<p>I was trying to uninstall python to reinstall it, and I foolishly typed these commands into my terminals. </p>
<pre><code>sudo rm -rf /Users/&lt;myusername&gt;/anaconda2/lib/python2.7
sudo rm -rf /Users/&lt;myusername&gt;/anaconda2/lib/python27.zip
sudo rm -rf /Users/&lt;myusername&gt;/anaconda2/lib/python2.7/plat-darwin
sudo rm -rf /Users/&lt;myusername&gt;/anaconda2/lib/plat-mac
sudo rm -rf /Users/&lt;myusername&gt;/anaconda2/lib/plat-mac/lib-scriptpackages
</code></pre>
<p>now my Python won't work. I get these errors:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;Could not find platform independent libraries &lt;prefix&gt;
&gt;Could not find platform dependent libraries &lt;exec_prefix&gt;
&gt;Consider setting $PYTHONHOME to &lt;prefix&gt;[:&lt;exec_prefix&gt;]
</code></pre>
<p>And when I try to run python I get things such as </p>
<pre><code>&gt;ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pandas'
</code></pre>
<p>I currently cannot do anything which requires python</p>
<p>I came to understand much later that what I did was deleting an important part of python files from my computer.<br/>
Is there any way I can reinstall python or is formatting my computer the only option if I want to use Python on this computer?</p>

<p>Since you used Anconda on your mac you should be able to just reinstall python 2.7. If you still have the install package: Anaconda2-5.2.0-MacOSX-x86_64.pkg, just double click that and follow directions.  If you don't have this package, download it from <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a> and when the package downloads completely double-click it.</p>

<p>You only deleted Anaconda, not the System Python. </p>
<p>Therefore, you probably only need to edit your PATH variable to remove references to those folders.</p>
<p>Check your <code>~/.bashrc</code></p>

<span class="comment-copy">Using <code>sudo</code> wiht <code>rm</code> and <code>-rf</code> ... you should have read the manual before using this. You need to reinstall python: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/using/mac.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/using/mac.html</a> - and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34303294/how-to-fix-broken-python-2-7-11-after-osx-updates" title="how to fix broken python 2 7 11 after osx updates">stackoverflow.com/questions/34303294/â€¦</a> might alleviate your problems.</span>
