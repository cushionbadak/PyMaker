<p>I wrote a C# library in linux with .NET Core. Now I want to use it in python. Has someone experience with this topic? Is this even possible?</p>
<p>I tried to use</p>
<pre><code>import ctypes as ct
lib = ct.WinDLL("PythonTest.dll")
</code></pre>
<p>but I run in this error</p>
<pre><code> Traceback (most recent call last):
     File "&lt;input&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
 AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'WinDLL'
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
<p>On Linux, it is required to specify the filename including the extension to load a library, so attribute access can not be used to load libraries. Either the LoadLibrary() method of the dll loaders should be used, or you should load the library by creating an instance of CDLL by calling the constructor:</p>
</blockquote>
<p><code>WinDLL()</code> is for Windows  on Linux you need to use <code>.LoadLibrary()</code> or <code>CDLL()</code></p>

<span class="comment-copy">i was able to import WinDLL,  are you sure that you are giving the full path to the pythontest.dll?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for your question. But now I run into the error "invalid ELF header".</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Christian Ah I was hoping you had found a way around that.  Have you seen:   <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20762142/importin-dll-in-python-on-linux" title="importin dll in python on linux">stackoverflow.com/questions/20762142/â€¦</a></span>
