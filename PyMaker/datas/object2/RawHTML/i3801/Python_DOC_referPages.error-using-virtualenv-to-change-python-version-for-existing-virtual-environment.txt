<p>I have a windows 7 OS with python 3.5.</p>
<p>I have to upgrade the python version to 3.6.</p>
<p>I have downloaded and installed the python package.</p>
<p>Previously, I have run the following command using powershell to change the python version in the virtual environment:</p>
<pre><code>virtualenv env3 -p C:\Users\me\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python36-32\python.exe
</code></pre>
<p>However, I receive the following error when I attempt to run the above command:</p>
<pre><code>virtualenv : The term 'virtualenv' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program. Check the spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path is correct and try again.

<p>I have run powershell as an adminstrator, but the error persists.</p>
<p>I have searched SO &amp; Google but cannot find a fix.</p>

<p>Update your <code>PATH</code> variable. You may have the old path of virtualenv.</p>
<p>Alternatively, creation of virtual environments is done by executing the command venv:</p>
<pre><code>c:\&gt;c:\Python35\python -m venv c:\path\to\myenv
</code></pre>
