<p>I tried to import <code>.csv</code> file from my computer to python, but both codes didn't work. What is wrong?</p>
<p>First try:</p>
<pre><code>import csv
with open('chicago.csv') as chicago_data:
    csvReader = csv.reader(chicago_data)
    for row in csvReader:
        print(row)
</code></pre>
<p>Second try:</p>
<pre><code>import csv
with open('chicago.csv') as chicago_data:
    csvReader = csv.reader(chicago_data, delimiter=',')
    for row in csvReader:
        print(row[0])

<p>I tried running your code on my computer and I am able to print data from a CSV file I was working with. Without additional information (such as error code/message) or some output value, it is hard to answer what could be wrong with your code. </p>
<p>Possible issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>CSV file not placed in the same directory as the script</li>
</ul>

<span class="comment-copy">What error message are you getting? and instead of adding image, kindly add code to question description.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No result came out instead of letting me put more code.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">Yes. It works when I moved file to the right directory.                          with open('C:\\Users\\jasch\\chicago.csv') as chicago_data:   However, I have 3 csv files. How to open all? concat?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Depends on the type of information you have in the files and what you want to infer from the data.</span>
