<p>I am new to python, can anybody explain me this snippet of code?</p>
<pre><code>TRAIN_CSV = './train1.csv' # this comtains 100 entries
TEST_CSV = './test1.csv' # this contains 50 entries
train_df = pd.read_csv(TRAIN_CSV)
test_df = pd.read_csv(TEST_CSV)

for dataset in [train_df, test_df]:   # what does this mean here
     do something
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>In this case the brackets mean a list. So you are looping through a list defined only by the two elements <code>train_df</code> and <code>test_df</code>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">How about <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#for-statements" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#for-statements</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">The [ ] above contains the .csv files. So is it same as the one which the link points to ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This syntax is called "sequence unpacking", might be easier to google for</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Arpit I think the question is mainly due to a confusion about the inline expression of the list, rather than about looping through lists in general.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">here train_df and test_df is loaded with a .csv file. So what does the loop do here ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It assigns the contents of the csv-files to the loop-variable <code>dataset</code>.</span>
