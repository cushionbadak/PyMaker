<p>I have a file that contains a String and i want to search for a substring in a specific range, This is my string:</p>
<pre><code>newick;
((raccoon,bear),((sea_lion, seal),((monkey,cat), weasel)),dog);
</code></pre>
<p>And this is my code for it:</p>
<pre><code>def removeNewick(tree):
    for x in tree:
        new_set = x.replace('newick;', '')
    print(new_set)


filepath = "C:\\Users\\msi gaming\\Desktop\\small_tree.tre"
tree = open(filepath)
removeNewick(tree)
</code></pre>
<p>But i know for sure that if this string 'newick' is going to appear, then it would be in the first 10 characters of the string so how do i edit my for loop only to loop over the first ten characters?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Ok so, tree is a file</p>
<pre><code>def remove_newick(tree):
    for x in tree:
        if x.startswith('newick;'):
            print('')
        else:
            print(x)
</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.startswith" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>str.startswith()</code></a> is a string method that only checks as many characters as needed, and is the most efficient way to check if a string starts with a certain substring.</p>
<hr/>
<p>For the record, don't do </p>
<pre><code>tree = open(filepath)
remove_newick(tree)
</code></pre>
<p>It's dangerous to not close files. Instead do</p>
<pre><code>with open(filepath) as tree:
    remove_newick(tree)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">you could test if you find the pattern in the sliced string, but I think it would take more time to slice the string than to perform the replace on the whole string. Are you looking for performance?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">BTW how was this tree file generated, why do you have to parse it now to remove the newick word? This seems odd. (For those who don't know newick is a file format for storing trees <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newick_format" rel="nofollow noreferrer">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newick_format</a>)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It's a small dataset and i usually use the ETE3 library to read it but that fails when the word Newick is at the beginning.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">what tool <i>generates</i> the tree with the word <code>newick;</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">"it would be in the first 10 characters of the string" do you mean "of the file" ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">no not a string a file. ahem +1</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks! This works like a charm</span>
<span class="comment-copy">but OP stated that "f this string 'newick' is going to appear, then it would be in the first 10 characters of the string", not necessarily at the start...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is incorrect. This removes "newick" from the start of <i>any</i> line in the file, not just from the first 10 characters in the file.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Based on their actual application (feeding the tree to ETE3) I'm pretty sure removing all examples of <code>'newick;'</code> <i>is</i> the appropriate behaviour, the tool only needs the actual tree data contained within the paranetheses</span>
