<p>This might be frivolous, but what's the symbol <code>%</code> as an abstract concept name?   For example, <code>\</code> is called "escape symbol" in addition to "backslash", while <code>%</code> is just called "percent symbol",</p>
<pre><code>In [45]: content = "percent and format me"
In [46]: print("test %s" % content)
test percent and format me

<p>Is it named "formatted symbol"?</p>

<p>Analagously to <code>\</code> serving the function of an "escape character" <code>%</code> can be one of:</p>

<li><p><strong>Remainder</strong> or <strong>Modulo operator</strong>. It is implemented through the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__mod__" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>__mod__</code></a> special function (and can be invoked by the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/operator.html#operator.mod" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>mod</code></a> operator). From the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#binary-arithmetic-operations" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <code>%</code> (modulo) operator yields the remainder from the division of the first argument by the second...</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p><strong>Interpolation operator</strong> or <strong>formatting operator</strong>. This is a special implementation of the modulo operator for strings and string-like objects. The operation it performs has nothing to do with integer division, but aside from that, it's just a regular binary operator. From the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#printf-style-string-formatting" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>String objects have one unique built-in operation: the <code>%</code> operator (modulo). This is also known as the string <em>formatting</em> or <em>interpolation</em> operator.</p>

<p>Bytes objects (<code>bytes</code>/<code>bytearray</code>) have one unique built-in operation: the <code>%</code> operator (modulo). This is also known as the bytes <em>formatting</em> or <em>interpolation</em> operator.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">God,I'm done. "Interpolation operator", I'm thinking of such a name for months.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Technically, interpolation is a special implementation of the modulo operator for strings. I always thought it was a bit counter-intuitive, but you get used to it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You can <code>"test %s".__mod__("percent and format me")</code> if you want to.</span>
