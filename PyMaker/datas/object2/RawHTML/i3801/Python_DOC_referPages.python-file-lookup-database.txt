<p><strong>Not asking to be spoonfed, more in what 'direction' I should be looking in order to learn this.</strong></p>
<p>So I have this file/database and I want users to type a name from the "Name" section. then the files searches for that name and gives the email/IP as output.</p>
<p>The format is:
NAME:UUID:EMAIL:IP</p>
<p>I want the name which the user asked to search only get 'searched' from the "NAME" part. and the output has to be "EMAIL" or "IP"</p>
<p>Could someone help me out and point me in a direction where to make this? I've tried searching but I can't seem to find anything.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This is how I would approach it:</p>
<p>1) Scan for the separator on your <code>NAME:UUID:EMAIL:IP</code></p>
<p>2) For every value in your database, retrieve each field based on the separator.</p>
<p>3) Check if it matches the user's input.</p>
<p>4) Based on the matching name, spit the output for other fields.</p>
