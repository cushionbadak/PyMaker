<p>With the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-python" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python Azure API</a> I would like to query blobs by a pattern.</p>
<p>For example, get all report pdf's (with the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/glob.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Unix style path name pattern expansion</a>):</p>
<pre><code>block_blob_service.list_blobs('mycontainer', '**/reports/*.pdf')
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Unfortunately you can't do that. </p>
<p>From the server side filtering perspective, only thing you could do is <code>filter blobs by prefix</code> i.e. filter blobs where name starts with a particular value (e.g <code>reports/</code>). </p>
<p>All other kind of filtering needs to be done on the client side itself.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">so this has more to do with the limitations of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/list-containers2" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Blob Service REST API</a>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That is correct.</span>
