<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have a list such as 
<code>foo = ['battery', 'correct', 'horse', 'staple']</code>
Now i am using multiprocessing and i am using one value from list in each process. Now i want my process to not to use a value which is already being used by another process. If there are 4 value in a list then there will be at max 4 processes. How can i achieve this.</p>

<p>I am adding some line of code. Hope you can find it useful.</p>
<pre><code>def your_function(name):
    print('hello', name)                   


from multiprocessing import Process` #import multiprocessing
foo = ['battery', 'correct', 'horse', 'staple']# your lis
processVar = ['t1','t2','t3','t4'] # You can create dynamic variable as per your need
for var,fooItems in zip(processVar,foo):
    var = Process(target=your_function, args=(fooItems,))
    var.start()
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Are you looking for something like <code>multiprocessing.Pool</code>'s <code>map</code> method?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Read through the documentation, it's pretty good: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">im new multiprocessing so i dont know what multiprocessing.pool is ., ill look into it</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Have you written any code? Because it's not clear how you want to use the variable.</span>
