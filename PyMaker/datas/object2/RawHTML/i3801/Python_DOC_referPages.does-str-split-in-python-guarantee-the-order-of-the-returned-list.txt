<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I want to split a string based on a <code>sep</code> where the original position of the tokens is important.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.split" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the official documentation of <code>str.split()</code></a>, nothing is mentioned about maintaining the order of the tokens as they appeared in original text before splitting. Is it guaranteed that <code>str.split</code> keeps this order?</p>
<p>Having a text like: <code>A &gt; B &gt; C</code>, how can I get a guaranteed output like: <code>[(1, A), (2, B), (3, C)]</code>?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; s = "A&gt;B&gt;C"
&gt;&gt;&gt; lst = s.split("&gt;")
&gt;&gt;&gt; result = zip(range(1, len(lst)+1), lst)
&gt;&gt;&gt; print result
[(1, 'A'), (2, 'B'), (3, 'C')]
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This would lead to your output - split alone does not.</p>
<pre><code>k = [(n+1,c) for n,c in enumerate( x.strip() for x in "A &gt; B &gt; C".split("&gt;"))]
print(k)
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>[(1, 'A'), (2, 'B'), (3, 'C')]
</code></pre>
<p>If you do not trust split ... make it explicit:</p>
<pre><code>t = "A &gt; B &gt; C"
temp = ""
result = []
for c in t:
    if c == "&gt;":
        result.append(temp.rstrip())
        temp=""
    else:
        temp += c

if temp.rstrip():
    result.append(temp.rstrip())

r = [ (n+1,v) for n,v in enumerate(result)]
print(r)
</code></pre>
<p>Iterating should be guarateed to be in order - would not make much sense else....</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">It's only logical to expect that the original order will be kept.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">why don't you just test it in the python shell?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">you wont. split does not make tuples, and enumarion starts at 0, not 1.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">For sure I have tested this, but my question is about whether it is guaranteed to always have this output or not, having nothing documented about it. I don't see where is the problem with this question!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Input of <code>A &gt; B &gt; C</code> would lead to spaces inside the output.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you for this hint, the question is about the order guarantee though. Your solution will help achieving the desired output relying on the order of the split.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">For others reading this answer, it will work for Python 2.x. For Python 3.x, the print should look like <code>print(list(result))</code> as <code>zip</code> returns an <code>iterator</code> and not a <code>list</code>: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.3/library/functions.html#zip" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3.3/library/functions.html#zip</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you for your answer. I don't have trust problems ;) I just need a confirmation, should I trust it?</span>
