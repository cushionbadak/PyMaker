<p>I have a string in a merged cell in an excel sheet. I want to extract the date at the end of the string using python. Please help on how we achieve this.</p>
<p>following  is the string which span across cells <code>A2:L2</code></p>
<pre><code>(BMC- sales/inventory for (Asia) for week (10-Mar-2019)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>After you extracted the string with python library openpyxl you can further process it with e.g. </p>
<pre><code>.split(" ")
</code></pre>
<p>to split at space.
This results can be put into a list and element [-1] will equal "(10-Mar-2019)".</p>
<p>This can be converted with .strip("(").strip(")") to get 10-Mar-2019</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">You can use python library openpyxl and get the string from the cell.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What do you need exactly? Extract from excel or parsing the string? Or both?</span>
