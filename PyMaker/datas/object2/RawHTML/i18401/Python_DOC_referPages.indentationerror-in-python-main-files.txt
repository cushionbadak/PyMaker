<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>indentation is Pythonâ€™s way of grouping statements. At the interactive prompt, you have to type a tab or space(s) for each indented line.
When a compound statement is entered interactively, it must be followed by a blank line to indicate completion (since the parser cannot guess when you have typed the last line). Note that each line within a basic block must be indented by the same amount.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">A copy of the code that produces the error would be nice</span>
<span class="comment-copy">On line 2 of your program, the code indentation is wrong. Either you've indented to much or not enough. We'd have to see your code to see.</span>
