<p>I'm following <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/howto/argparse.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this tutorial</a> trying to implement <code>argparse</code> into a <code>python</code> script I'm writing.</p>
<p>When I run this snippet of code from the tutorial I receive the following error:</p>
<pre><code>[05:51 PM] user Scripts&gt; cat argparse.py
import argparse
parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
parser.parse_args()



[05:51 PM] user Scripts&gt; python3 argparse.py
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "argparse.py", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
    import argparse
  File "/home/brian/Documents/Scripts/argparse.py", line 2, in &lt;module&gt;
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'ArgumentParser'
</code></pre>
<p>I'm running <code>Python 3.3.2</code> and have installed <code>argparse 1.2.1</code> using <code>easy_install</code> so I know it's on the system but I cannot determine what is causing the error.</p>
<p>Note: I've read <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6605851/python-newbie-working-with-argparse">this post</a> and it is not related.</p>

<p>From the error message I am guessing your script is trying to import not from argparse package but from local <code>/home/brian/Documents/Scripts/argparse.py</code> module. Rename your file and try again.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You don't need the easy_install version with 3.3.2 (or 2.7).  It comes  with those newer Pythons.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That is good to know.  Im on a CentOS box so I had to do the <code>altinstall</code> in order not to break <code>yum</code>, the article I was following just had me do it.  Thanks!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you, I should have known better than to name the script argparse.py, renaming it worked as expected.  I'll mark this as correct as soon as it lets me.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Also delete any <code>argparse.py*</code> remaining files like <code>argparse.pyc</code></span>
