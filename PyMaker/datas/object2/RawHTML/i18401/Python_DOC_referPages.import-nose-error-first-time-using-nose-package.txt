<p>The problem is that you haven't installed <code>nose</code> properly.</p>
<p>Like most packages, <code>nose</code> expects you to <em>install</em> it, not just use it out of the source in-place.</p>
<hr/>
<p>The official Python docs include <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/install/" rel="nofollow">Installing Python Modules</a>. However, that document may be a bit over-complicated for novices, especially Windows users, and it doesn't mention some of the newer, simpler options. But briefly:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download the source archive.</li>
<li>Unzip it (or untar it, or whatever); often just double-clicking it on Windows will do this.</li>
<li>Open a cmd (aka "DOS shell") window.</li>
<li><code>cd</code> to the source directory.</li>
<li><code>C:\Python32\python.exe setup.py install</code></li>
</ul>
<p>However, you will probably find it a lot easier to just automatically install things using <a href="http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/" rel="nofollow"><code>pip</code></a>, or <a href="http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#nose" rel="nofollow">pre-made binary packages</a>.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Having done this, <code>nose</code> should end up in the right place in <code>site-packages</code> so you don't need to do any <code>sys.path</code> munging in your code, and you should also end up with the command-line scripts like <code>nosetests</code> somewhere useful, like <code>C:\Python32\Scripts\</code>.</p>
<hr/>
<p>The specific problem in this case is that, as part of the installation process, <code>nose</code> figures out whether you're installing for Python 2.x or 3.x, and runs a tool called <code>2to3</code> to fix the code appropriately. Because you never did that step, you ended up with 2.x-specific code. As you guessed, it's the <code>print</code> statement vs. <code>print</code> function that bit you first—but if you got past that, there are dozens of other things that would fail similarly.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Please show the complete error traceback, not just a fragment; the part you've shown us doesn't even have the error message.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is exactly I am seeing as it is in my IDLE editor. I think I am using python 3 and print statement has changed from earlier versions. Nose guys are still using earlier versions.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Also… how did you install <code>nose</code>? Did you follow some tutorial somewhere? Because it seems very weird to have something named <code>nose-master</code> inside your site-packages, and to have to add it to the path that way. (When I just <code>pip install nose</code>, it ends up directly in <code>site-packages/nose</code>, as I'd expect.)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I am using windows OS.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Aha, you're using Python 2.x code in Python 3.x. Many packages use the <code>2to3</code> script to convert the source code on the fly during the install process. If you just copy the files around manually instead of installing, that will never happen.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I downloaded it on my desktop and ran python command, it worked but it doesnt show up in site-packages. Earlier I copied everything in site-packages and then was running install command, it was running fine. But importing was giving this error Traceback (most recent call last):   File "&lt;pyshell#0&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;     import nose ImportError: No module named nose</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@pokrate: Copying things manually into site-packages will work for a few packages, but not for most. You really need to get installation working. Life will be a lot easier if you can get <code>pip</code> installed and use that instead of using <code>setup.py</code> manually. Even better, set up <code>virtualenv</code>, and then install packages into its environments. Or, alternatively, the pre-built packages are very simple (and have the added advantage that if you ever need a C extension module, you won't need to know how to set up a compiler).</span>
