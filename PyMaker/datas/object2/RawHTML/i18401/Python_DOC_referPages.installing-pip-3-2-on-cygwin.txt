<p>I have Python 3 installed on Cygwin. However, I am unable to install Python 3 packages via <code>pip</code>. Is there a way to do this?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>1)While installing cygwin, make sure you install the 
python/python-setuptools from the list. This will install "easy_install" package.</p>
<p>2) Type the following command: </p>
<pre><code>easy_install-a.b pip   
</code></pre>
<p>You must replace <code>a.b</code> with your python version which can be 2.7 or 3.4 or whatever else.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you have more than one python installation, then you need to install pip (and probably also setuptools) for each installation separately.<br/>
To do so, you can first download <a href="https://bitbucket.org/pypa/setuptools/raw/bootstrap/ez_setup.py" rel="noreferrer"><code>ez_setup.py</code></a> and run it with python3:</p>
<pre><code>/usr/bin/python3 ez_setup.py
</code></pre>
<p>That should install setuptools, and also create an <code>easy_install</code> script for your python version, e.g. <code>/usr/bin/easy_install-3.2</code>, which you can use to install pip:</p>
<pre><code>/usr/bin/easy_install-3.2 pip
</code></pre>
<p>This will install pip into your python3 site packages directory, and again create a script <code>/usr/bin/pip-3.2</code>, which you can use to install packages for this python version.</p>
<p>Alternatively you can follow the install instructions from <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools#installation-instructions" rel="noreferrer">here</a> and <a href="http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html" rel="noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I think <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html" rel="noreferrer">the alternative install instructions</a> linked by mata are simplest:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To install pip, securely download <a href="https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py" rel="noreferrer">get-pip.py</a>.</p>
<p>Then run the following (which may require administrator access):</p>
<pre><code>python get-pip.py
</code></pre>

<p>Since OP specifically talks about Python3, I think we need to specify that just in case the user already have Python2 installed, which is very likely. </p>
<pre><code># If you don't have Python3 already, use apt-cyg:
apt-cyg install python3

# First update pip, pip2 
pip2 install --upgrade pip 

# Install pip3:
python3 -m ensurepip

# Finally update pip3:
pip3 install --upgrade pip

$ pip3 -V
pip 9.0.1 from /usr/lib/python3.4/site-packages (python 3.4)

<p>BTW. There are several forks of <a href="https://github.com/ilatypov/apt-cyg" rel="nofollow noreferrer">apt-cyg</a>, but the best maintained is that of <a href="https://github.com/kou1okada/apt-cyg" rel="nofollow noreferrer">kou1okada</a>, you'll love it. </p>

<p><strong>EDIT: 2018-11-15</strong></p>
<p>Because I started out not using <em><a href="https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv" rel="nofollow noreferrer">virtualenv</a></em>, I recently had to refresh my Cygwin Python3 installation, and realized a few things in the process that should have been obvious, but can easily be forgotten. </p>
<ul>
<li><p>When installing and using Python3 on Cygwin (and probably on most other *nix distros), <strong>only</strong> install the basic Python3 interpreter as a Cygwin package. From then on, only use the <strong>pip</strong> installer. </p></li>
<li><p>After you have installed or updated any python3 packages using <em>pip</em>, your  Cygwin package manager will complain that your package is <code>"Incomplete"</code>. That is because <em>pip</em> has replaced/updated the files in that package. Check with: <code>cygcheck.exe -c |grep Incomplete</code>.<br/>
<strong>Do not re-install those packages with Cygwin.</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<pre class="lang-sh prettyprint-override"><code># cygcheck.exe -c |grep Incomplete
python3-setuptools      34.3.2-1         Incomplete
</code></pre>
<p>So what I did, was clear out <em>all</em> python3 related Cygwin packages, <strong>except</strong> the Python3 itself. Then I re-installed the only one needed: <code>python3-setuptools</code>. </p>
<pre class="lang-sh prettyprint-override"><code># apt-cyg remove python3-setuptools
apt-cyg install python3-setuptools

# Fix pip3 symlink (or just pip if you don't have python2)
ln -s /usr/bin/pip3.6 /usr/bin/pip3

# That also installs the Cygwin packages:  
# python3-appdirs, python3-packaging, python3-pyparsing, python3-six

# Now, update setuptools with pip:
pip3 install -U --force-reinstall --only-binary=:all: --no-clean --no-cache-dir setuptools

# pip list |grep setuptools
setuptools          40.5.0
</code></pre>
<p>That should have also have re-installed all the <em>setuptools</em> dependencies with the latest updates. </p>
<p>From now on, do yourself a favor and start using a virtual environment. </p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>On windows, you can use pip to install packages. If you have multiple python installations under cygwin, give the full python path e.g. 
Python 2</p>
<pre><code>/usr/bin/python2.7 -m pip install pyyaml
</code></pre>
<p>Python 3</p>
<pre><code>/usr/bin/python3.6 -m pip install pyyaml
</code></pre>
<p>In case you dont have pip installed install it using below command</p>
<pre><code>/usr/bin/python2.7 -m ensurepip 
</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code>/usr/bin/python3.6 -m ensurepip
</code></pre>

<p>I just learned, inspired from <a href="https://www.scivision.co/install-pip-in-cygwin/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.scivision.co/install-pip-in-cygwin/</a> and the answer before, that instead of using pip, you just have to use pip2 for python2 or pip3 for python 3 in cygwin on windows. Wondered about this the whole day...</p>

<span class="comment-copy">why not? have you installed pip for this python installation? what error do you get?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Pip is installed, but it installs the python 2 version of the package. For example, my script that requires pyyaml returns <code>ImportError: No module named yaml</code>, even after successfully running <code>pip install pyyaml</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Then the <code>pip</code> script doesn't run with the correct python version. Try <code>/path/to/python3 -m pip install ...</code> instead. Also, check the shebang of the pip script.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@mata FYI, Python 2 is also installed. <code>usr/bin/python3 -m pip install pyyaml</code> returns <code>/usr/bin/python3: No module named pip</code>. Thus my original question; how does one install pip-3 on cygwin?</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>python3 -m ensurepip</code> and <code>python2 -m ensurepip</code>. Look to <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0453/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">python.org/dev/peps/pep-0453</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">This answer worked great for me.  I had to take a couple extra steps because I work at a university:  First, I navigated to my install path (c:/cygwin64/bin/). Then had auto complete help me find the easy install file named slightly differnt: easy_install 2.7.9</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I did this to end up in a state without eggs: <code>easy_install-2.7 pip &amp;&amp; pip install 'pip&lt;8' &amp;&amp; pip install pip --upgrade</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">for python3, use python3 &amp; <b>python3-setuptools</b> packages. It's obvious, but one can forget about python<b>3</b>-setuptools</span>
<span class="comment-copy">And don't forget the version (ie -2.7). I had another python distribution on my computer, and 'easy_install' invoked that one rather than cygwin's.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Need to run bash as administrator for this to work.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Excellent! I was able to solve my cygwin issue following this answer.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I am getting "OSError: [Errno 13] Permission denied" this error while installing in cygwin. I have admin rights in that machine.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">fwiw, this seems to silently do nothing under cygwin -- not sure why :(</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thanks, it works under cygwin</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Works under Babun, on Windows 10 x64</span>
<span class="comment-copy">is <code>ensurepip</code> necessary because of cygwin? Usually, <code>pip</code> is on board, see <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ensurepip.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Timo, for me it was, for whatever reason I was missing pip3 for python3</span>
<span class="comment-copy">As long as you have <code>pip</code> installed, you can always symlink in <code>/usr/bin/</code>, but perhaps its more elegant to use the native <i>ensurepip</i> fix. IDK if I already had an old version or if it was installed along with <code>setuptools</code>, but I don't have the <code>ensurepip</code> package installed.</span>
