<p>I am getting Attribute error when i run this code when i am trying to call a function in a thread.
This is the error i got.
Please help me with the fix.   </p>

<p>Just to get this answered:</p>
<pre><code>def datapaths(ipaddress, testlogfile):
        # Unecessary code reomved

<p>You are trying to access an attribute of a function you've defined, but most likely not set. I think you need to rexamine your code.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Don't access that attribute on that object. "+15 rep"</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What do you expect <code>datapaths.listDatapaths</code> to do?</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>datapaths</code> is obviously a function—in fact, it's the same function you're in the middle of. You haven't added a <code>listDatapaths</code> attribute to it, or to anything else, anywhere in your code. It's obviously not one of the standard built-in attributes you'd expect everything to have. So… what were you expecting this to do, besides raise an <code>AttributeError</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Also, what makes you think this problem has anything to do with threading, logging, or any of the other stuff you're doing? If you don't have think it does, strip it out and post a simpler <a href="http://sscce.org" rel="nofollow noreferrer">SSCCE</a>, and don't add a bunch of irrelevant tags.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">By the way, why are you writing your own code to call a function 10 times and measure the time? That's what <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/timeit.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>timeit</code></a> is for, and I'm pretty sure the documentation for <code>time</code> even directly says "Don't use this for timing code, use <code>timeit</code> somewhere.</span>
