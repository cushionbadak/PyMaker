<p>I'm looking to use OrderedDict in my code since the Ruby version of this project uses YAML for maps and settings but OrderedDict hasn't been updated for Python 3.</p>
<p>The Ruby version of the project uses this file: <a href="https://mega.co.nz/#!zhYRwA4B!HceqC3-NmmN44U70--jMxiAWQ4wz5MdAeilteKAOnSM" rel="nofollow">https://mega.co.nz/#!zhYRwA4B!HceqC3-NmmN44U70--jMxiAWQ4wz5MdAeilteKAOnSM</a></p>
<p>I changed the import lines to read as:</p>
<pre><code>from collections import UserDict
from collections import MutableMapping as DictMixin
</code></pre>
<p>I already know v3 doesn't make use of iterkeys so how would I change iterkeys to something MutableMapping understands?</p>
<pre><code>iterkeys = DictMixin.iterkeys
itervalues = DictMixin.itervalues
iteritems = DictMixin.iteritems
</code></pre>
<p>I've seen many examples of how to change it but I don't understand how to use them here.</p>
<p>Maybe I should use something else for YAML file support in Python 3, perhaps?</p>
<p>Edit: I called my file yaml.py. I shouldn't have done that.
I also had a file path in there it didn't like. I've removed it and it works.</p>
<p>Edit 2: I've just realised I've screwed up my question. It should have been about OMAPs in Python not YAML. I'll open a different question for that. Thanks for the help guys.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">What do you mean by "OrderedDict hasn't been updated for Python 3"?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Do you mean some other ordered dict than <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.OrderedDict" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>collections.OrderedDict</code></a>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm still fairly new to Python and I'm looking for something which can read the YAML files I have. The YAML files are used for displaying the map terrain, user settings, etc. Would using collections.OrderedDict be suitable for it?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Can you provide some working example? Input file, what do you have right now and expected output.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Pyaml <a href="http://pyyaml.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">pyyaml.org</a> supports  python3 since 2008.</span>
