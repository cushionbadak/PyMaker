<p>First of all, is it possible to append to an int ? If not I guess i'll have to convert it to a string first. I know how to append to a list
Anyways, how would you append a digit to the beginning of a number(instead of appending it to the end). Say number = 345, and you'd like to append super which is equal to 2 to the beginning of "number" to make it "2345".
How would you do it ?
To append it to the end of a list i'd use:</p>
<pre><code>alist.append("hello")
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>As @Fredrik comments, you can get from any integer to any other integer by a single addition - and this is how you should probably do it, if you deal with integers only. </p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; i = 345
&gt;&gt;&gt; 2000 + i
2345
</code></pre>
<p>There are, however,  many way to express "prepend a 2 to 345", one would be to use <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#string.Formatter.format" rel="nofollow">format</a>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; '2{}'.format(345)
'2345'
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>To "append" to numbers, you need to convert them to strings first with <code>str()</code>. Numbers are immutable objects in Python. Strings are not mutable either but they have an easy-to-use interface which makes it easy to create modified copies of them.</p>
<pre><code>number = 345
new_number = int('2' + str(number))
</code></pre>
<p>Once you are done editing your string, you can easily convert it back to an int with <code>int()</code>.</p>
<p>Note that strings don't have an <code>append</code> method like lists do. You can easily concatenate strings with the <code>+</code> operator however.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">add +2000 to 345?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I like the complexity of this answer where you show that <code>2000+345=2345</code> :-)</span>
