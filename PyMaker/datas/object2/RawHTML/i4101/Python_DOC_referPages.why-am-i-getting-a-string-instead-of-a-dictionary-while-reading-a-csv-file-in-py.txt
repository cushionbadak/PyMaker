<p>I am writing a dictionary in a CSV file using this:</p>
<pre><code>self.idSelf += 1
self.tweet["tweet"] = tweetText
self.tweet["id"] = id
self.tweet["sequence"] = self.idSelf
self.tweet["created_at"] = created_at
with open('#KXIPvMI-2018-05-04.csv', 'a') as csv_file:
     writer = csv.writer(csv_file)
     a = [self.tweet]
     print a[0]['tweet']
     writer.writerow([self.tweet])
</code></pre>
<p>While reading this file, I get a list of length = 1. I get the whole dictionary that I saved by writing <code>row = info[0]</code>. But when I get the <code>type(row)</code>, it is <code>str</code> and not the dictionary. Why is that and how can I get the dictionary?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Using csv.DictReader and csv.DictWriter, look at the sample code</p>
<pre><code>import csv

di = {}
di["id"] = 1
di["val"] = "val"

with open("test.csv","a") as csv_file:
    writer = csv.DictWriter(csv_file,di.keys())
    writer.writerow(di)

with open("test.csv") as csv_file:
    reader = csv.DictReader(csv_file,di.keys())
    for row in reader:
        print row["id"]
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">To write a dictionary, you should use <code>csv.DictWriter</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Okay. And what would be the appropriate and pythonic way for that? Could you please post an answer with the snippet?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The answer is in the <code>csv.DictWriter</code> documentation.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@DyZ  I am using DictWriter: <code>writer = csv.DictWriter(csvfile, self.fieldnames=fieldnames)</code>  but I am getting an error:  <code>writer = csv.DictWriter(csv_file, fieldNames = self.fieldNames) TypeError: __init__() takes at least 3 arguments (2 given)</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">The error is likely coming from somewhere else. Look at the "official" example at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Using eval is not a good idea. Read about its potential threats. Instead you should use csv.DictReader</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, updated the answer</span>
