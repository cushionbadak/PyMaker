<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I'm fairly new to Python and am currently just learning by making some scripts to use at work. Real simple, just takes user input and stores it in a string to be called later on. The questions are yes/no answers but I wish for the user to have the option to skip and for the question to be asked again at the end, how would I do this?</p>
<p>Currently this is what I've got:</p>
<pre><code>import sys
yes = ('yes', 'y')
no = ('no', 'n')
skip = ('skip', 's')
power = str(raw_input("Does the site have power? (Yes/No): "))
if power.lower() in yes:
  pass
elif power.lower() in no:
  pass
elif power.lower() in skip:
  pass
else:
  print ''
  print '%s is an invlaid input! Please answer with Yes or No' % power
  print ''
  exit()
</code></pre>
<p>then at the end of the script after all the questions have been asked I have this:</p>
<pre><code>if power.lower() in skip:
  power = str(raw_input("Does the site have power? (Yes/No): "))
  if power.lower() in yes:
    pass
  elif power.lower() in no:
    pass
  else:
    print ''
    print '%s is an invlaid input! Please answer with Yes or No' % power
    print ''
    exit()
else:
  pass

if power.lower == 'yes':
  print 'Site has power'
else:
  print 'Site doesnt have power, NFF.'
</code></pre>
<p>I understand this is very messy and I'm just looking for guidance/help. </p>
<p>Regards,
Trap.</p>

<p>Since you're rather new to Python I'll give you some tips:</p>
<ol>
<li>Store all the questions which receive "skip" as a response into a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">list</a>.</li>
<li>At the end of all your questions, iterate through (hint: "for" loop) all the questions which the user skipped and asked them again.</li>
</ol>

<span class="comment-copy">How is this question unclear? The question makes perfect sense - OP wants to re-ask questions which are skipped by the user</span>
