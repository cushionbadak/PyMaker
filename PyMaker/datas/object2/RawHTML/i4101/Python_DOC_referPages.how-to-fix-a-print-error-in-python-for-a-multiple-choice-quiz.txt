<p>I apologize in advance if a topic like this has already been made, if so, please link me to it, thank you.</p>
<p>So, I have been trying to create a multiple choice quiz in python (yes, very iconic) but when I try to run it, I get a syntax error which is common I suppose, however, it seems to have an issue with the print variable:</p>
<pre><code>print ('QUESTION 1: WHAT IS A NON-MOVING OBJECT CALLED?\n')

print ('A. Solid')

print ('B. Still object')

print ('C. Stationery')

print ('D. not moving')

print ('E. Stationary')

print ('')

Q1answer = "E"

Q1response= input('Your answer : ')

if (Q1response != Q1answer):

    print ('Sorry! It appears that your answer is incorrect! A non-moving object is called Stationary.')

    print ('Better luck next time!' , answer)

else:

    print ('Well done! ' + Q1response + ' is correct!')
    score = score + 1

    print ("Even I got that one right!"


**print("Your current score is ' str(score) + ' out of 10")**

print ('\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n')
</code></pre>
<p>the print variable for showing the score you get out of 10 doesn't seem to work.
Am I doing something wrong?</p>
<p>It'd be a great help if someone could tell me, I'm not very good at coding.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>print("Your current score is %d out of 10" %score)
</code></pre>
<p>Take a look at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#old-string-formatting" rel="nofollow noreferrer">printf-style string formatting</a> for details on formatting and inserting other types of data into a printed string. </p>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>print("Your current score is "+ str(score) + " out of 10")</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">There's a missing parenthesis in <code>print ("Even I got that one right!"</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Oh okay, thank you!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You have more than one error in the code. You should narrow it down to the one line which has a syntax error and then if you still don't understand what the error is, you should post just that one line and ask for help.

<span class="comment-copy">Thank you for your help.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you, I will look at that</span>
