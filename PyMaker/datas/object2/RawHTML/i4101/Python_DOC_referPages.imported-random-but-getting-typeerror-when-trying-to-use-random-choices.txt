<span class="comment-copy">No I want to weight my choices so that the first six choices appear way more often than the seventh choice (very rare).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I used this documentation: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.choices" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.choices</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">The error I get from trying to run your code is: <code>TypeError: choices() takes from 2 to 3 positional arguments but 4 were given</code> from the <code>random.choices()</code> call. Adding an <code>import numpy as np</code> makes no difference, as you'd expect, since it's not used anywhere.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The argument numbers reported in errors messages from <code>random</code> module functions can be a little confusing. As mentioned in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the docs</a> they're "actually bound methods of a hidden instance of the <code>random.Random</code> class". So the <code>self</code> of that instance is included in the argument count.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The <code>random.choices()</code> <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.choices" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation</a> indicate its calling sequence as <code>random.choices(population, weights=None, *, cum_weights=None, k=1) </code>. Notice the <code>*</code> by itself? It means that 'Parameters after “*” or “*identifier” are keyword-only parameters and may only be passed used keyword arguments': This is discussed in the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#function-definitions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Function Definitions</a> section in the documentation. That's why it's complaining.</span>
