<p>Simple question - I want a loop that counts up and returns to 0 when it reaches a certain number.</p>
<p>Tried something like:</p>
<pre><code>while i &lt; 7:
    i += 1
    if i == 7
        i -= 1   #(or change i in any other way - you get the idea)
</code></pre>
<p>My Python actually crashed when I tried the above.</p>
<p>EDIT: Yes, the <code>if</code> condition is never met - it still crashes when I change it to <code>if i == 6</code> though.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>while i &lt; 7:
      i += 1
      if i == 7:
         i = 0
</code></pre>
<p>The problem is the i-=1 line. Your code works as i counts up to 6, but when it reaches 6, it is incremented to 7, and then subtracted down to 6 again. Your current sequence is 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,6,6,6,...</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you want to count up to 7 then count down to 0 here is what you can try:</p>
<pre><code>i = 0
add = True
while True:
    if add:
        i += 1
    else:
        i -= 1

    if i in [0, 7]:
        add = not add
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This is your corrected code,</p>
<pre><code>i = 0
while i &lt; 7:
    i += 1
    if i == 6:
           i = 0
</code></pre>
<p>It reaches 0 on reaching 6.
Lot's of syntax Error fixed.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">What do you mean by return? Directly return to 0 or decrement to zero?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Change <code>i -= 1</code> to <code>return 0</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.cycle" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>for i in itertools.cycle(range(7)):</code></a>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">it doesnt really matter if its decrementing or returning - i just cant find a way to change a variable if a while loop ends</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@jordanm {         while i &lt; 7:             i += 1             return 0 } gives me a syntax error ("'return' outside function")</span>
<span class="comment-copy">still crashes though :/</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You haven't specified a reason for the program to stop, so it should loop infinitely. You need an exit condition.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">i thought that the above "for" loop i used makes it finite - i am using the turtle module and want to change the color after each square until it drew 36 squares</span>
<span class="comment-copy">tells me that "name 'true' is not defined"</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sorry, the booleans value for python are "True" and "False". I'll edit the answer and improve the code quality</span>
<span class="comment-copy">ah, totally forgot that its case sensitive</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You could also try something like <code>if i in (0, 7): increment *= -1</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Maybe because this is an inifity loop. You should avoid it with a "End controll"</span>
<span class="comment-copy">the moment i added this python started crashing again</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@FlyingThunder plz show me the error message.</span>
