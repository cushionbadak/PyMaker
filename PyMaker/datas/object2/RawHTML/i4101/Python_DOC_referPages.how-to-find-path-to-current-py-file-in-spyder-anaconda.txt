<p><strong>Set-up</strong></p>
<p>I run a script on my computer, located in the directory <code>Users/path/to/my/script.py</code>. </p>
<p>In the script, I use the path to the script, e.g.,</p>
<pre><code>sub_path = 'Users/path/to/my/'
os.chdir(sub_path + 'other_script/') 
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, I define <code>sub_path</code> in the code 'manually'. </p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>
<p>I don't want to define the <code>sub_path</code> manually, I'd rather have Python do it for me. </p>
<p>I'm looking for something similar to the code I use to obtain the current working directory: <code>os.getcwd()</code>, but then a code to obtain the directory of the current file. </p>
<p>I mainly find answers similar to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/3283336/7326714">this one</a>, which says,</p>
<p><code>os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(__file__))</code></p>
<p>but in the Spyder &amp; Anaconda set-up, this generates a <code>NameError: name '__file__' is not defined</code>. </p>
<p>What can I do?</p>

<p>You if you want to move back one folder/directory you use the <code>..</code> in your file path. </p>
<p><code>os.chdir('../other_scripts/')</code></p>
<p>will work. You may fine it helpful to view <a href="https://superuser.com/questions/153165/what-does-represent-while-giving-path">this</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_(computing)" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the wiki</a>.
If you want to move from where you currently are you can use <code>'./new_dir/'</code>. If you want to automate how to find other files you may want to read <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1724693/find-a-file-in-python">here</a> which says to use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.walk" rel="nofollow noreferrer">os.walk</a>. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5137497/find-current-directory-and-files-directory">This</a> may be the same question. </p>

<p>I add the following lines to any script I run in case I need to access data relative to the location of the script</p>
<pre><code>import sys
script = sys.argv[0]
print(script)

<p>First, save your Jupyter Notebook.  Second, locate the directory your Jupyter Notebook is stored in. Thirdly, ensure that your Jupyter Notebook and CSV file are in the same place.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">that's probably because you are running part of your code inside the ipython commandline. So the commandline doesn't have a <code>__file__</code> property. Use the play button to run the whole script and it should be fine.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you for thinking with me. Your solution doesn't work for me, it gives me a <code>script = ''</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It only works if you are running a script from within a python IDE, I suspect then you are launching python.exe 'c:/somescript.py'</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The OP is asking about how to the current file path in Spyder, not in the notebook.</span>
