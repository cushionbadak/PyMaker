<p>I was wondering how could I make a program that will grab information from this webiste: <a href="https://growtopiagame.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://growtopiagame.com/</a> (Or any at general), But I don't want to grab every text from it: I just want to grab Part where it says "4231 Players Online",
And store it in variable that I can use later on...</p>

<p>Extracting data from website are generally called web scraping. Glad to have such powerful packages in python to do this task , such as <code>Selenium</code>and  <code>BeautifulSoup</code>. Please check <a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-scrape-websites-with-python-and-beautifulsoup-5946935d93fe" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this</a> for more details how to do web scraping.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Use a web scraping library. For Python, we can use <a href="https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">BeautifulSoup</a>.</p>
<p>What you'd want to do is first get the whole page and parse the HTML you get. You'd do something like:</p>
<pre><code># I'm skipping the necessary packages you need to import.
webpage = urllib2.urlopen('https://growtopiagame.com/')
soup = BeautifulSoup(webpage,'html.parser')
</code></pre>
<p>After that, you will continue using BeautifulSoup. But how do we get the online player count?</p>
<p>Simple! We just need to check the HTML code of the website first. From the website, open<sup>1</sup> "Inspect Element" on the text you want to parse. In your case, you we'd get the following HTML snippet:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;!--There are more code lines above. --&gt;
&lt;div class="server-status"&gt;
    Server is up |   
    &lt;span class="counter"&gt;40961&lt;/span&gt; Players online!
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;!--There are more codes below. --&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>I left out the unnecessary HTML code as far as your problem is concerned.</p>
<p>From the snippet we get, notice that the online player count (40961, as of current writing) is inside the <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> element with the <code>"counter"</code> class.</p>
<p>From there, we can now extract the online player count by just instructing BeautifulSoup to get the text of <code>span.counter</code>. To be more accurate, we can , instead, get the text of <code>div.server-status span.counter</code>.</p>
<p>I'll leave writing the rest of the code up to you.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">@WellDirth, StackOverflow is not built to provide "easy code". We do provide some code but usually only when it solves the problem <b>and</b> we notice that the OP has provided evidence that he has worked on his problem on his own first than just going to SO to ask for some code. Using the "I suck at programming" excuse is not a good one. We want to see genuine effort. So, try it on your own first and ask us for help when you are stuck in a bug or problem.</span>
