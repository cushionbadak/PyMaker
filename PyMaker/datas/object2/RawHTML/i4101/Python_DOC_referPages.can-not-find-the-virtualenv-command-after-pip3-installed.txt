<p>I use the <code>pip3</code> install the <code>virtualenv</code> in my CentOS7.2:</p>
<pre><code>[root@www abc]#  pip3 install virtualenv
Requirement already satisfied: virtualenv in /usr/local/Python3/lib/python3.5/site-packages (15.1.0)
[root@www abc]# virtualenv --no-site-packages venv
-bash: virtualenv: do not find the command
</code></pre>
<p>But I can not use it, there do not find the command.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Instead of using virtualenv, try running <code>python3 -m venv</code>. So to create a new virtualenv, just do <code>python3 -m venv ~/.virtualenvs/my_virtualenv</code>.</p>
<p>As for why you can't find <code>virtualenv</code> by just typing it in, I guess that it's because <code>virtualenv.py</code> script is somewhere in <code>/usr/local/Python3/lib/python3.5/site-packages</code> - probably at <code>/usr/local/Python3/lib/python3.5/site-packages/virtualenv.py</code> - try running it directly.</p>
<p><code>pip</code> is just a Python packaging utility. It's not responsible for adding tools into your <code>PATH</code> environment variable, or for installing utilities in your system. </p>
<p>If you want <code>virtualenv</code> command to be present in your system, I would recommend to install it using your system package manager instead. I would recommend to just use the built-in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">venv</a> module instead.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Are you working with the pre-installed <code>pip3</code>? Using Anaconda should relieve most of your such problems (unless you are restricted against using it).</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>which python</code> and <code>python -V</code> commands output please</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>pip</code> also can install programs/utilities, not just packages and libraries!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes it does, but I've never seen a case where they added themselves to <code>PATH</code> automatically. The path where they install their scripts should be added to <code>$PATH</code> already, but it's clearly not the case for the author of this question.</span>
