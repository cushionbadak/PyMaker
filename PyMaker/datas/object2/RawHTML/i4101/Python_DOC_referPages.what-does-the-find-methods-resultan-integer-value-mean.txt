<p>How is it calculated?  I understand the range part to it, what character you want it to start at and which one you want it to end at.  But it produces an integer value, how is this integer value calculated and what does it mean?</p>

<p>Return the lowest index in the data where the subsequence sub is found, such that sub is contained in the slice <code>s[start:end]</code>. Optional arguments start and end are interpreted as in slice notation. Return -1 if sub is not found.
The subsequence to search for may be any bytes-like object or an integer in the range 0 to 255.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">The result is <code>position</code> of the first occurence of the substring. <code>L</code> and <code>l</code> are different so it finds it on "11th" index, "12th" character. "-1" if not found.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">also you get negative responses for your question because this one is a basic part of any language you could find on documentations.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I just didn't understand how the answer was worded.  Index definitions weren't matching up. <a href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=index+definitions&amp;qs=AS&amp;pq=index+def&amp;sk=AS2&amp;sc=8-9&amp;cvid=671D2A0E8B964E8E846478BE757D849D&amp;FORM=QBRE&amp;sp=3" rel="nofollow noreferrer">bing.com/â€¦</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">What do you mean index?  It returns the count of characters?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Thomas Did you read the documentation?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes I did, I am not familiar with what an index is.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Thomas an index is a location in an array.  A string is (in many languages) an array of characters.  So the string <code>"Let it be"</code> has <code>'L'</code> at index <code>0</code>, <code>'e'</code> at index <code>1</code>, and so on.  This idea of an index applies to python strings and lists, among other things</span>
