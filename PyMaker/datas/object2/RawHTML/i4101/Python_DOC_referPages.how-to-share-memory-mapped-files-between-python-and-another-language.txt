<p>How to use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/mmap.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">memory maps</a> in Python to share data between Python and a C process whilst not storing anything on disk.</p>
<p>How do both programs read make sure to read from the same location in memory?
If the data is shared with C, is it best to use ctypes from Python, or parse the python objects in C?</p>

<p>I don't think this is directly possible with the <code>mmap</code> module. It wraps the file-oriented mmap functions, but not the POSIX SHM APIs. You can call them via ctypes though, check out <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/shm_open.3.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>shm_open</code></a> which returns a file descriptor for a purely-in-memory SHM segment, which you can then mmap.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I understand why you would feel that way, and given that you've apparently done some research on the subject, you're probably right. It's a fairly standard comment to leave for OPs that don't show what they've tried. In most cases it turns out to be just people looking for free code. I am not implying that you fall into that category, so I've removed the comment.</span>
