<p>This line </p>
<pre><code>lines = file.read().split("\n")
</code></pre>
<p>removes the <code>'\n'</code> from your lines because it splits on them. Characters you split on are never part of the results.</p>
<p>So this line</p>
<pre><code>line = line.replace('-\n','')
</code></pre>
<p>can not find anything to replace.</p>
<p>Use <code>line = line.rstrip("-")</code> instead, it will remove the <code>'-'</code> from the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.rstrip" rel="nofollow noreferrer">right end of your string</a> if present.</p>

<p>Edit:</p>
<ul>
<li>You get a ' ' from your <code>' '-join()</code>ing of split lines - you need to keep track on which lines ends on <code>-</code> and merge it with the following one. Its easier to simply do 2 replaces like this: </li>
</ul>

<span class="comment-copy">hello patrick, I modified the code but got a space between the word.(implemen  ted).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Bruno - you are right.  I propose a different solution that first replaces <code>'-\n'</code> by nothing  and then <code>'\n'</code> by <code>' '</code> to get to the desired output.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">the problem occurs when I read from a text file, the word continues with the space, I do not know but what I do.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Bruno the edited version still gives you wrong output?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes @patrick , I do not know but what I do, this happens when I read the text file edited in notpad.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Friend the code does not work.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The text was created in a text editor, there is some possibility that it is giving error for this reason</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Fixed the re.sub() patterns...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Friends many excuses, the mistake is that I was copying the text from a pdf and pasting it into the text editor. All codes are correct and working.</span>
