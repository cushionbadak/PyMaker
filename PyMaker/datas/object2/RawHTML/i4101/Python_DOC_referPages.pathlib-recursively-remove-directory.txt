<p>Is there any way to remove a directory and itâ€™s contents in the PathLib module? With <code>path.unlink()</code> it only removes a file, with <code>path.rmdir()</code> the directory has to be empty. Is there no way to do it in one function call? </p>

<p>As you already know, the only two <code>Path</code> methods for removing files/directories are <code>.unlink()</code> and <code>.rmdir()</code> and both doesn't do what you wanted.</p>
<p>Pathlib is a module to that provides object oriented paths across different OS's, it isn't meant to have lots of diverse methods. </p>

<p>The aim of this library is to provide a simple hierarchy of classes to
  handle filesystem paths and the common operations users do over them.</p>

<p>The "uncommon" file system alterations, such as recursively removing a directory, is stored in different modules. If you want to recursively remove a directory, you should use the <code>shutil</code> module. (It works with <code>Path</code> instances too!)</p>
<pre><code>import shutil
import pathlib
import os  # for checking results

print(os.listdir())
# ["a_directory", "foo.py", ...]

path = pathlib.Path("a_directory")

shutil.rmtree(path)
print(os.listdir())
# ["foo.py", ...]
</code></pre>

<p>If you don't mind using a third-party library give <a href="https://github.com/jaraco/path.py" rel="nofollow noreferrer">path.py</a> a try.
Its API is similar to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>pathlib.Path</code></a>, but provides some additional methods, including <a href="https://pathpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api.html#path.Path.rmtree" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>Path.rmtree()</code></a> to recursively delete a directory tree.</p>
