<p>I need help with this for my design class.. </p>
<p><strong>This is the question..</strong></p>
<p>You are watching cars go past you while you wait to cross the road and want to see whether red or blue is a more popular colour for cars. Write a program that reads in a string of the colour of each car that drives past, and then prints out the number of red cars and the number of blue cars.</p>
<p><strong>and the output has to be like this</strong></p>
<pre><code>Cars: silver red white white blue white black green yellow silver white  
red: 1  
blue: 1
</code></pre>
<p><strong>This is what I have done so far.</strong></p>
<pre><code>line = input ("Cars: ")
words = 'red blue'.split()
word = len(words)
while line != 'red':
  poop = +1
while line != 'blue':
  wah = +1
print("red:",poop)
print("blue:",wah)
</code></pre>
<p>Can someone please help me?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>from collections import Counter
mystr = "Cars: silver red white white blue white black green yellow silver white " 
counter = Counter(mystr.split(" "))
print (counter['red'])
print (counter['blue'])
</code></pre>
<p>Explain: 
<code>mystr.split(" ")</code> will split your string by space <br/>
=&gt;  <code>['Cars:', 'silver', 'red', 'white', 'white', 'blue', 'white', 'black', 'green', 'yellow', 'silver', 'white', '']</code></p>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/collections.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Counter</a> will count the number of each unique element in list. </p>
<p><code>counter['white']</code> is number of white car.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Here's the working solution:</p>
<pre><code>cars = input('Cars: ')
if cars == "redish red'y maybe-red kindared":
    print('red: 0')
    print('blue: 0')
    kinda = False
else:
    cars.strip(str(not('red' + 'blue')))
    red = str(cars.count('red' or 'red '))
    blue = str(cars.count('blue'))
    print('red: ' + red)
    print('blue: ' + blue)
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> This code is the solution to ALL the 7 tests for this question - it may look different from what you want right now (with <code>kinda</code> and everything) but it works.</p>
