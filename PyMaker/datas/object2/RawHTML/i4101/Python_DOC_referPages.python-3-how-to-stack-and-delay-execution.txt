<p>I'm currently trying to find the good way to stack some information to process them later. But I need to process that information with a delay. </p>
<p>For now, I use the Queue library to stack all the information. I need to set a timer or a thing like this, to control more or less the execution after the information was stacked.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance, hope I was clear enough</p>

<p>Could sleep fit your need?</p>
<pre><code>from time import sleep
...
sleep(0.1)
</code></pre>
<p>This will add a 100 milliseconds delay</p>
