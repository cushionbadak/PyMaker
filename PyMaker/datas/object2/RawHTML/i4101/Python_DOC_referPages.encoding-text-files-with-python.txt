<p>I built an encryption method that turns plaintext into Hebrew, and I am trying to write the Hebrew to a text file using Python, and I've run across the following issue:</p>
<p>The Hebrew text writes properly in the shell, however once I write it to a text file, this is what is written:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ää0ä0ãçççâäää0àããåäääãçååãàáÌáÌ0 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am using Python's standard encoding cp1255 to write to my text file. Is there an issue with Python writing to the file, or is it the file itself?</p>

<p>I don't know if you're using python 3. </p>
<p>Check this out here: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/unicode.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/howto/unicode.html</a> . </p>
<p>Moreover, you should use UTF-8 to encode your unicode. 
CP1255 has only Hebrew in it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows-1255" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows-1255</a></p>
<p>Your console should support unicode, which is why you see it properly there.</p>
<p>Basically, what I'm saying is: If you use Python 3 and use no shenanigan at all, it <em>should</em> work by default :-)</p>
<p>If you force an old encoding... then you'll get down the rabbit hole...</p>
