<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>print ('Hello')

for i in range(2,11,-2):
    print(i)
</code></pre>
<p>Whats wrong with this code? I'm trying to print out :</p>
<pre><code>Hello
10
8
6
4
2
</code></pre>
<p>but it only prints out hello. I ctrl+enter twice after print hello </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you specify a negative step in <code>range</code> you also have to make start bigger than stop:</p>
<pre><code>for i in range(10,0,-2):
    print(i)
</code></pre>
<p>Another way to do what you want, would be to use <code>reversed</code>:</p>
<pre><code>for i in reversed(range(2,11,2)):
    print(i)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The range() function will include the first value and exclude the second.</p>
<pre><code>a = " ".join(str(i) for i in range(10, 0, -2))
print (a)

<p>Read what <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/functions.html#func-range" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>range()</code></a> does. First argument is a starting number, you can't start from smaller if you want to print from bigger to smaller. </p>
<p>You can do <code>range(2, 11, 2)</code> for increasingly list or <code>range(10, 1, -2)</code> for decreasingly.</p>
<p>There's also reverse <code>range(2, 11, 2)[::-1]</code> option, but its better to just use it as planned.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Since your range starts at 2, and ends at 11, this code won't work since you are stepping down by -2. You will have to START at 10 and then step down negatively instead of stepping down from 2. Below I have an example that gets you the output that you are seeking:</p>
<pre><code>print('Hello')

for i in range(10, 1, -2):
     print(i)
</code></pre>
<p>And here is your output:</p>
<pre><code>Hello
10
8
6
4
2
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">You are trying to loop from 2 to 11 <i>in steps of -2</i> which actually means backwards and in steps of 2. As it is not possible, it prints nothing. The initial end final values must be corrected</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Consider <code>test = [1,2,3]</code>. If I slice <code>test[100:]</code> I get an empty list, not an error, even though the start value overflowed the range. Its the same thing for, say, <code>range(100,3)</code> - since you've already gone over the top in the first step, it just stops iteration. Finally to <code>range(2, 11, -2)</code>. Its going backwards, 11 is already "behind" what you can get going backwards, so it stops.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@StephenRauch - I didn't see the duplicate there. It shows negative steps to go backwards but doesn't explain why this range test stops without producing anything.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">But what makes this work is the reversal of the start and stop conditions, not the join, or the inclusion / exclusion rules.</span>
