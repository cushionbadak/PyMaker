<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>Date = datetime.datetime.today().strftime("%d %B %Y")
x = datetime.datetime.strptime(Date , "%d %B %Y")
</code></pre>
<p>returns:</p>
<pre><code>2018-05-09 00:00:00
</code></pre>
<p>instead of:
9 May 2018, what am I doing wrong?
Essentially I am trying to get the non zero padded version of strftime for which I searched around and I read that the way to go about it is strptime.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>A possible solution is to use <code>str.lstrip</code></p>
<p><strong>Ex:</strong></p>
<pre><code>import datetime
Date = datetime.datetime.today().strftime("%d %B %Y")
print(Date.lstrip("0"))
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>
<pre><code>9 May 2018
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can strip down  the Zero</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt;import datetime
&gt;&gt;&gt;Date = datetime.datetime.today().strftime("%d %B %Y")
&gt;&gt;&gt;Date.strip(0)
&gt;&gt;&gt;'9 May 2018'
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">print( <code>datetime.datetime.today().strftime("%d %B %Y"))</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">but that returns 09 May 2018, as per my question above, I am trying to get the non-zero padded version of the date eg. 9 May 2018</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I don't think it's supported out of the box by python see documentation here for all the available features of strftime (<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#strftime-and-strptime-behavior" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/…</a>).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">not sure why people downvote the question just because they can't give an answer or they don't understand it</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@bloo People are probably downvoting the question because you haven’t explained why you’re calling <code>strptime</code> to turn the value back into the very same <code>datetime</code> object you started with, or what you expected that to do. Also, it seems like you want to know how to fix the zero padding on <code>Date</code>, but that’s not what you asked about—instead you showed us the string representation of <code>x</code>, and asked how to get the format you already have in <code>Date</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">But <code>Date</code> is already <code>09 May 2018</code> (it doesn't have zeroes)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The OP wants <code>9 May 2018</code> the <code>0</code> before 9 removed</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ohh now it makes sense... that was hard to understand</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That indeed resolves the issue I was just under the impression that strptime was dealing with that. Thank you!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You are welcome :)</span>
