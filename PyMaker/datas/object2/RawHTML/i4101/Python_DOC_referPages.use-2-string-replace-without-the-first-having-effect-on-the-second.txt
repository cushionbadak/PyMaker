<p>Because of <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/2595162/1422096">this answer</a>, it might be necessary to do this:</p>
<pre><code>path = r"D:\Temp\abc[def]\            # (i have many others to process)
path = path.replace('[', '[[]').replace(']', '[]]')
# now we can use glob here with path
</code></pre>
<p>However, the first <code>replace</code> gets mixed up with the second <code>replace</code>, and the result is not what is expected, i.e. <code>D:\Temp\abc[[]def[]]\</code>.</p>
<p>The only solution I found is to use a temporary character <code>~</code> to avoid the 2 <code>replace</code> to be mixed up with each other:</p>
<pre><code>path = path.replace('[', '[[~').replace(']', '[]]').replace('~', ']')
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Is there a nice way to use 2 replacements without the first having effect on the second?</strong></p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You don't need to replace <code>]</code>.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/glob.html#glob.escape" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Special characters to replace</a> are only <code>'?'</code>, <code>'*'</code> and <code>'['</code>, and are handled by <code>glob.escape</code>.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print(glob.escape(path))
D:\Temp\abc[[]def]\
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">@Aran-Frey: I already read the question you linked, but here I explicitely mentioned that I already found a solution using a temporary character, and I wait to find another solution without this.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Use <code>glob.escape</code> and get on with your life.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">There are other answers there, not just the one with a temporary character. You just have to scroll a bit.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you. Not available from Python 2.7, do you think there is a from future import... ?</span>
