<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I saw this code on the internet:</p>
<pre><code>s=input().count
print( max( (s('6')+s('9')+1)//2, max([s(i) for i in "01234578"])))
</code></pre>
<p>but I don't get what this line does :</p>
<pre><code>s=input().count
</code></pre>
<p>I thought this function was to count how many letters are in the word. So I tried to print the <code>s</code>, but I got this error:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;built-in method count of str object at 0x7f4f8b859148&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>what does <code>input().count</code> function do and what situation will it be used?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>s=input().count</code> is a function which you can call.</p>
<p>You could write</p>
<pre><code>input().count('6')
</code></pre>
<p>to count how many times you get 6 in the <code>input</code>.</p>
<p>Or,</p>
<pre><code>s('6')
</code></pre>
<p>is now a shorthand for this.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>s = input().count
</code></pre>
<p>Basically you are binding the <code>count</code> method to <code>s</code> so when you call <code>s</code> like <code>s(i)</code>, it converts the code to <code>input().count(i)</code> internally.</p>
<p>Let me give you a simple example:</p>
<pre><code>p = print
p("hello world")

# hello world
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">It's a method, you need to actually call it: <code>.count()</code>. And no, it doesn't count how many letters there are in a word. It counts the number of occurrences of a substring, so it actually needs a parameter. See <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.count" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the docs</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">what does this method do then? could you please explain?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The method will tell you the count when you call it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@hiyum did you read the docs Daniel gave you?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">why so many downvotes for this question? I don't understand</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you for clear explanation</span>
