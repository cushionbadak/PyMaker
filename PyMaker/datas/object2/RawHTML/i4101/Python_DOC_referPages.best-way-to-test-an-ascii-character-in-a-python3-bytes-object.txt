<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have a bytes object and want to test if a particular ASCII character is in a particular position.</p>
<p>I nievely wrote code like</p>
<pre><code>if b[i] == b"\n":
</code></pre>
<p>The problem is this doesn't work, it turns out after some experimenting with repr that while indexing a string produces a string indexing a bytes produces a number and comparing a number with a bytes always returns false. </p>
<p>I fixed this by doing</p>
<pre><code>if b[i] == b"\n"[0]:
</code></pre>
<p>I have realised I could also do</p>
<pre><code>if b[i:i+1] == b"\n":
</code></pre>
<p>Is there a reason to prefer one approach over the other?</p>
<p>Is there a neater soloution?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>A neater solution, perhaps, would be to use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#ord" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>ord</code></a>, which returns a codepoint (integer):</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; ord(b'\n')
10
</code></pre>
<p>That being said, the approach using a slice is quite fine too.  Just be wary that slicing out of bounds returns an empty string, rather than triggering an <code>IndexError</code>.</p>
