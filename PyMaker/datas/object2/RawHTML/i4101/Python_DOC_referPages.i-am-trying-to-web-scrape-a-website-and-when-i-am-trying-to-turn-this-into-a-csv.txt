<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I am new to web scraping and for practice I am trying to web scrape a website and turn the results into a csv file. When I come to the part to turn the results into a csv file, it doesn't put the address in the address column. I want the data to go into the address column. The code is as follows.</p>
<pre><code>from urllib.request import urlopen as uReq
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup as soup

my_url = 'https://www.allagents.co.uk/find-agent/london/'

uClient = uReq(my_url)

page_html = uClient.read()

uClient.close()

page_soup = soup(page_html, 'html.parser')

containers = page_soup.findAll('div', {'class':'itemlabel3'})

filename = "webscrape.csv" 

f = open(filename, "w")

headers = "Company Name, Address, Telephone Number\n"

f.write(headers)

for container in containers:
    comp_name   = container.find('div', {'class':'labelleft2 col-md- 
10'}).div.h4.a.text

    address     = container.find('div', {'class':'labelleft2 col-md- 
   10'}).div.p.text

    tel         = container.find('div', {'class':'labelleft2 col-md- 
   10'}).div.find('p', {'style':'clear: both; margin-bottom: 
15px;'}).strong.text

    print("Company Name:", comp_name)
    print("Address:", address)
    print("Telephone", tel)

    f.write(comp_name.replace(",", ("|")) + "," + address.replace(",", ("|")) + 
"," + tel + "\n")

f.close()
</code></pre>
<p>Any help is appreciated. Thanks you in advance.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>it seems like in your address data new line character is present </p>
<p>try to replace below line for address in your code and try running again </p>
<pre><code>address=(container.find('div', {'class':'labelleft2 col-md-10'}).div.p.text).replace('\n','')
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">I'd try to avoid creating the CSV manually.  Dump your data into a pandas dataframe (that can export to csv) or use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">csv module</a> or something.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">O.K. but if I want to create a csv manually just for practice, I want to know where I have gone wrong. Also what's wrong with creating the csv manually?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">re: what's wrong with creating it manually?  Nothing is <i>wrong</i> about it.  More of a no-need-to-reinvent-the-wheel type deal.  Practice is a great reason to try it manually.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Cool. Can you link any articles about making it into a pandas dataframe? Or just write an answer and show me how to do it. It seems interesting. Thanks.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">By the way, if you do see where I have gone wrong originally please let me know. You can always run this code yourself if you want to try.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks your solution works but it kind of distorts the csv file.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is because in address fields there are multiple spaces are there ...if you trim the spaces ....your csv will get correctly generated :)</span>
