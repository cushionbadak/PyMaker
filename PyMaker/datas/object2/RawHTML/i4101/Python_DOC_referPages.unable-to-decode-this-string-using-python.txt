<p>I have this text.ucs file which I am trying to decode using python.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The string is encoded as UTF16-BE (Big Endian), this works:</p>
<pre><code>content.decode("utf-16-be")
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>oooh, as i understand you using python 2.x.x but encoding parameter was added only in python 3.x.x as I know, i am doesn't master of python 2.x.x but you can search in google about io.open for example try: </p>
<pre><code>file = io.open('text.usc', 'r',encoding='utf-8')
content = file.read()
print content
</code></pre>
<p>but chek do you need import io module or not</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can specify which encoding to use with the <code>encoding</code> argument:</p>
<pre><code>with open('text.ucs', 'r', encoding='utf-16') as f:
    text = f.read()
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>your string need to Be Uncoded With The Coding utf-8 you can do What I Did Now for decode your string</p>
<pre><code>f = open('text.usc', 'r',encoding='utf-8')
print f
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">@Rakesh Sorry, can't post that here</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Where do you get <code>text.ucs</code> from?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Do you know what alphabet it's supposed to be?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is having load balancer information</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Try <code>encoding='utf_16_be'</code> (<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/14488478/1388292">stackoverflow.com/a/14488478/1388292</a>)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@JacquesGaudin unfortunately both are not working but as per python docs, i see '-' and not '_'</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@cyborg I executed this on the bytes that you provided just now, worked fine.

<span class="comment-copy">As it helped you?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">the error message I got: Traceback (most recent call last):   File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt; TypeError: 'encoding' is an invalid keyword argument for this function</span>
<span class="comment-copy">maybe you forgotten that if you usin <code>with open()</code> you need to set name for this for example : <code>with open('text.ucs', 'r', encoding='utf-16') as file</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">I did it, I am aware of with usage :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">can you get full error? maybe screenshot?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">really i don't know why it's doesn't work, i tested it 20 secs ago and this construction haven't any errors my full code is <code>with open(source, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as csvfile:</code>...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">A few words to explain why you think this fixes the OP issue would be a good idea. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-answer">stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-answer</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@JacquesGaudin thanks for that i will be more attentive about my answer next time</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Or you can edit your answer...</span>
