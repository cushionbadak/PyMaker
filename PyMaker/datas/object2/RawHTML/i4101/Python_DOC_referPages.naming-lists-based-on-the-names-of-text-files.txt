<p>I'm trying to write a function which takes word lists from text files and appends each word in the file to a list, with the same name as the text file. For instance, using the text files <code>Verbs.txt</code> and <code>Nouns.txt</code> would result in all the words in <code>Verbs.txt</code> being in a <code>verbs</code> list and all the nouns in a <code>nouns</code>list. I'm trying to do it in a <code>for</code> loop:</p>
<pre><code>def loadAllWords():
    fileList = ['Adjectives.txt', 'Adverbs.txt', 'Conjunctions.txt',
                'IntransitiveVerbs.txt', 'Leadin.txt', 'Nounmarkers.txt',
                'Nouns.txt', 'TransitiveVerbs.txt']
    for file in fileList:
        infile = open(file, 'r')
        word_type = file[:-4]
        word_list = [line for line in infile]
    return word_list
</code></pre>
<p>Of course, I could do it easily once for each text file:</p>
<pre><code>def loadAllWords():
    infile = open("Adjectives.txt", "r")
    wordList = []
    wordList = [word for word in infile]
    return wordList
</code></pre>
<p>but I'd like my function to do it automatically with each one. Is there a way to do this, or should I just stick with a for loop for each file?</p>

<p>You should use a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>dict</code></a> for that like (untested):</p>
<pre><code>results = {}
for file in file_list:
    infile = open(file, 'r')
    word_type = file[:-4]
    results[word_type] = [line for line in infile]
return results
</code></pre>
<p>also you don't need the list comprehension, you can just do:</p>
<pre><code>results[word_type] = list(infile)
</code></pre>

<p>You can create new variables with custom names by manipulating the <code>locals()</code> dictionary, which is where local variables are stored. But it is hard to imagine any case where this would be a good idea. I strongly recommend Stephen Roachâ€™s suggestion of using a dictionary, which will let you keep track of the lists more neatly. But if you really want to create local variables for each file, you can use a slight variation on his code:</p>
<pre><code>results = {}
for file in file_list:
    with open(file, 'r') as infile:
        word_type = file[:-4]
        results[word_type] = list(infile)
# store each list in a local variable with that name
locals.update(results)
</code></pre>
