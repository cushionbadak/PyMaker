<p>I wasn't really sure how to title my question, but my issue is this; I have my program set up to guess a number and handle exceptions. The program loops until the number is guessed, but when the program exits, my exception message shows at the same time. How can I fix this?</p>
<pre><code>num = None
while num != 31:
    try:
        num = int(input("What is the age of my creator? \n"))
        if num &lt; 31:
            print("Higher! Guess again! \n")
        elif num &gt; 31:
            print("Lower! Guess again! \n")
        elif num == 31:
            print("Good Guess!")
            exit()
    except:
        print("Numbers only! \n")
</code></pre>
<p>This is my output:</p>
<p>What is the age of my creator?
31
Good Guess!
Numbers only! </p>
<p>Process finished with exit code 0</p>
</div>

<p>If you want to keep the exception message, I would recommend a <code>break</code> instead of <code>exit</code>, for a more natural exit from your program. Try this:</p>
<pre><code>try:
    ...
    elif num == 31:
        print("Good Guess!")
        break
except ValueError:
    print("Numbers only! \n")
</code></pre>
<p>Also, you should catch a specific error rather than a catch-all bare <code>except</code>.</p>
<hr/>
<p>If you want to silence any error messages, you should use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#pass-statements" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>pass</code></a> instead. From the docs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <code>pass</code> statement does nothing. It can be used when a statement is
  required syntactically but the program requires no action.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>try:
    ...
except ValueError:
    pass
</code></pre>
<p><code>pass</code> is an innocuous placeholder statement that does nothing. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">I tried it.  It changes nothing.  This is my output:  What is the age of my creator?  31 Good Guess! Numbers only!    Process finished with exit code 0</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@OrphaMortimer 1. No print statement after pass. 2. Save your file.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Also, I recommend break inside <code>try</code>, rather than exit.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I removed the print statement.  The output looks better, but how could I do the same while keeping the exception print statement?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@OrphaMortimer Like I said, use a <code>break</code> instead of <code>exit</code>.</span>
