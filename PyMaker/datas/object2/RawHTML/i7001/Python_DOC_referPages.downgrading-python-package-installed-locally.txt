<p>In the server that work in (as do many other people) the "global" python has a certain version of a package, say 1.0.0.</p>
<p>I recently used <code>pip</code> to upgrade that to <code>1.0.2</code> locally for my user with the <code>pip install --user package==1.0.2</code>, which worked. However, now I want to uninstall my locally installed version and remain with the global one.</p>
<p>I've tried <code>pip uninstall --user package==1.0.2</code>, <code>pip uninstall --user package</code>, and a few other options but nothing seems to work. I always get this error:</p>
<pre><code>Usage:   
  pip &lt;command&gt; [options]

no such option: --user
</code></pre>
<p>I also tried <code>pip install --user package=1.0.0</code> but now I have both versions installed locally and python uses the most recent.</p>
<p>How can I do what I want?</p>

<p>The --user option for pip seems to have been removed but is still an option with setuptools.</p>
<p>So if you want to use the --user function what you can do is use <code>pip download</code> which will download the .whl file. You then need to extract the file using <code>wheel unpack</code>. I then ran python setup.py install --user (worked for numpy) and it installed the package to my home directory under .local.</p>
<p>I followed the documentation <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/install/index.html#alternate-installation-the-user-scheme" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>.</p>

<p>Apparently this cannot be done with <code>pip</code> directly. I ended up solving it just by removing the package from <code>~/.local/lib/python3.5/site-packages/</code>. A bit more manual than I was hoping I'd have to do.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I always just use a virtual environment which makes this level of control simple. You make a virtual environment with the --no-site-packages and then install them from scratch as the version you want.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@SimonHobbs that is a good tip and I'll try it from now on. But for this specific I'm trying to solve it using only <code>pip</code>. Any ideas?</span>
