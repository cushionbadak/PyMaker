<p>How i can convert 2d list like this?</p>
<pre><code>lista=[[1, 2, 3],[3, 4, 5],[8, 5, 9]]  to 
listb=[[1 2 3]
       [3 4 5]
       [8 5 9]]

<p>As already pointed out, what you have is already basically the same representation of one list in Python, so a list to list conversion doesn't make much sense. However, if you want a list to string conversion - ways to output the list as a nice string, you have the option of <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pprint.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>pprint</code></a>, or pretty-printing. This is a module from the standard library that seems pretty close to what you're looking for:</p>
<pre><code>import pprint

l = [[1, 2, 3],[3, 4, 5],[8, 5, 9]]

pprint.pprint(l, width=12)
</code></pre>
<p>Gives the output</p>
<pre><code>[[1, 2, 3],
 [3, 4, 5],
 [8, 5, 9]]
</code></pre>
<p>Now I've had to artificially reduce its maximum width a bit as your lists are so short that <code>pprint</code>, by default, does not consider them worth shortening.</p>
<p>Also, if you want the string representation in your program, you can use <code>pprint.pformat</code> in pretty much the same way, except it returns a string:</p>
<pre><code>import pprint

l = [[1, 2, 3],[3, 4, 5],[8, 5, 9]]

s = pprint.pformat(l, width=12)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I assume what you're looking for is the <code>__repr__</code> of a list - how it is displayed. Semantically, the two are one and the same. </p>
<p>However, if you want to display your lists like that, this is how you might do it.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The simple way with <code>numpy</code>:</p>
<pre><code>import numpy as np

lst = [[1, 2, 3],[3, 4, 5],[8, 5, 9]]
print(np.array(lst))

[[1 2 3]
 [3 4 5]
 [8 5 9]]
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>The grotesque way, using vanilla python.</p>
<pre><code>print('[' + '\n '.join(str(x).replace(',', '') for x in lst) + ']')
[[1 2 3]
 [3 4 5]
 [8 5 9]]
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>The other answer mentions <code>pprint.pprint</code> which I consider a simpler alternative to 2, but limited flexibility. You could instead use <code>pprint.pformat</code> to prettify your list and get rid of commas:</p>
<pre><code>import pprint
print(pprint.pformat(lista, width=12).replace(',', ''))

[[1 2 3]
 [3 4 5]
 [8 5 9]]
</code></pre></li>
</ol>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Nice use of pformat. If you don't want any commas, I'd say that's the way to go.</span>
