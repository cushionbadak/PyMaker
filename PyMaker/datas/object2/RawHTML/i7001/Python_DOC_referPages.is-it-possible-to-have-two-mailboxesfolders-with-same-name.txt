<p>I am working on a product where I have to interact with email servers (like zimbra, dovecot etc) through IMAP to fetch emails etc.</p>
<p>I am using Python's imaplib library. I connect to email server account with credentials and then select a mailbox (folder) through its name. </p>
<p>Now I am wondering whether is it possible to have two mailboxes with same name in an account? If yes then how to go about it ?</p>

<p>Using <code>select(mailbox=...</code> you are dealing with <strong>Real Folders</strong>.<br/>
Therefore <strong>no</strong> duplicate possible.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/imaplib.html#imaplib.IMAP4.select" rel="nofollow noreferrer">IMAP4.select(mailbox=’INBOX’, readonly=False)</a> </p>
<p>Select a mailbox.<br/>
    Returned data is the count of messages in mailbox (EXISTS response).<br/>
    The default mailbox is 'INBOX'.<br/>
    If the readonly flag is set, modifications to the mailbox are not allowed.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Mailbox names could be the same, but <b>real</b> Folder Names couldn't. Check if you really deal with Folder Names.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I am probably unclear on this. Before fetching an email, I have to select the folder (or mailbx - not clear) first through its name [like this imap_instance.select(folder_name) ] and then go for fetching the mail. So I think it will be the real folder, but still not sure.</span>
