<p>I have defined a new numeric data type in Python using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python's Data Model</a>. I would like to convert all my existing NumPy arrays from their existing data types to my custom data type. I understand that NumPy's <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.astype.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">astype</a> method converts from one data type to another, but based on my understanding, it can only convert between built-in data types.</p>
<p>In contrast to the answer provided <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2350072/custom-data-types-in-numpy-arrays">here</a>, my data type is not based on built-in data types and has it's own addition, multiplication, bit-wise operations, etc., so I cannot use <code>np.dtype</code> to define my data type. In other words, the following solution would not work:</p>
<pre><code>kerneldt = np.dtype([('myintname', np.int32), ('myfloats', np.float64, 9)])
arr = np.empty(dims, dtype=kerneldt)
</code></pre>
<p>Is there any way to convert between a built-in data type and a custom data type and vice versa?</p>

<p>This isn't currently possible. There are plans to allow custom dtypes in numpy in the future.</p>
