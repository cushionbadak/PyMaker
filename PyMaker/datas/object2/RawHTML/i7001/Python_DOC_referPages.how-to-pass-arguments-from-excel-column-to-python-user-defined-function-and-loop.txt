<p>I am trying to import data from Excel and loop each dataset.
I have data in column A, B, C of Excel sheet. 
I use openpyxl to import Data from excel workbook. But i don't know the way to refer column A,B,C are arguments for my function.
Please see the image:</p>
<p><img alt="Sample Image" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IhDY1.png"/></p>
<p>And this is my function:</p>
<pre><code>x = 0.2
def quadratic(a, b, c, x):
    return a*x**2 + b*x + c
</code></pre>
<p>I want to pass data of Column A, B, C for arguments a, b, c and loop through every row (in my image, each row from row 2 to 18).</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can export the data in your spreadsheet as a CSV, and use python builtin csv module (<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html</a>) to go through it line by line. </p>
<p>The following code adapted from the example in the doc should work, but I did not run it.
It reads the csv line by line, casts the values to floats, and calls your function</p>
<pre><code>import csv

x = 0.2
def quadratic(a, b, c, x):
    return a*x**2 + b*x + c

with open('data.csv', newline='') as csvfile:
    datareader = csv.reader(csvfile, delimiter=' ', quotechar='|')
    for row in datareader:
        data = map(float,row)
        print(quadratic(*data,x))
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for your help. But I don't want to use separate csv file. So i use openpyxl to import data from my excel work book. My problem is that no idea how to refere column A,B,C is the variable argument for my function.</span>
