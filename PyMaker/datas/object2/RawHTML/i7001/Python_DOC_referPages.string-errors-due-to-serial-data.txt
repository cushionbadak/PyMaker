<p>I am fairly new with python and currently only using it to try and plot data from my microcontroller.</p>
<pre><code>import serial
import numpy
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from drawnow import *

port = serial.Serial('com4',9600)

while True:
   while (port.inWaiting()==0):
        pass
   sstring = port.readline()
   dataArray = sstring.split(',')

   Pterm = float(dataArray[0])
   Iterm = float(dataArray[1])
   Dterm = float(dataArray[2])
   Error = float(dataArray[3])

   print Pterm
   print Iterm
   print Dterm
   print Error
   print
</code></pre>
<p>Now, sometime I receive the data with no problem ;</p>
<p><img alt="Data that was successfully received" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/syMdU.png"/></p>
<p>But other times I get messages like;</p>
<ul>
<li>Unrecognized character 0 in format string</li>
<li>could not convert string to float</li>
<li>'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xa9 in position 35: ordinal not in range(128)</li>
</ul>
<p>The strings I transmit over serial from my microcontroller always look like the above figure but with different magnitudes.</p>
<p>Can I adjust my code to solve or maybe even ignore these errors in a manner that the script stil keeps on running?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>it seems that when I added a decode method to my code it started working better.</p>
<p>I changed <code>sstring = port.readline()</code></p>
<p>to <code>sstring = port.readline().decode('ascii').strip()</code></p>
<p>Thank you for the assistance and I will be sure to include exception handling.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You should investigate what you are <i>actually</i> receiving from the microcontroller. Simply doing <code>print sstring</code> seems like a good start.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">in general, I've found that slamming a serial port with as-fast-as-possible reads will sometimes generate garbage data. You just need to handle each of these cases.</span>
