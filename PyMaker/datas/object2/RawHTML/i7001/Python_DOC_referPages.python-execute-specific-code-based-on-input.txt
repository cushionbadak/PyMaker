<p>I have below sample code , I want to execute specific if input value is integer.
if the user entered a integer specific code will be executed else it should prompt an error that input value is not integer and prompt again for input.
It should be done until integer is entered or force fully exited the code. 
I have to run multiple test on input value also.</p>
<pre><code>import random
print('Hello , What is your name')
name = input()
print('hello '+ name +' i am thinking a number between 1 to 20. Please take a guess')

inputNumber = input()

if inputNumber == int:
      #Code
else:
      print('please enter the int')
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You need to <code>try</code> to cast it into <code>integer</code> assuming the input given by user is integer and then proceed further, in your code snippet <code>input()</code> function takes input from the user and converts it into string <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input" rel="nofollow noreferrer">See Documentation</a> therefore <code>if b == int:</code> will always give you false.</p>
<p>Correct procedure:</p>
<pre><code>import random
print('Hello , What is your name')
name = input()
print('hello ' + name + ' i am thinking a number between 1 to 20. Please take a guess')
while(True):
    try:
        inputNumber = int(input())
        # now it is sure that input number is integer.
        ### CODE

    except ValueError:
        print('please enter the int')
</code></pre>
<p>here I have updated as per infinite loop but you can modify as per your code logic something like <code>while(inputNumber != randomNumber)</code> but for this you will need to take the input from user before the while loop starts something like :</p>
<pre><code>import random
print('Hello , What is your name')
name = input()
print('hello ' + name + ' i am thinking a number between 1 to 20. Please take a guess')

randomNumber = random.randint(1,21)
try:
    inputNumber = int(input())
except ValueError:
    print('please enter int only')
while(inputNumber != randomNumber):
    try:
        print('try again!')
        inputNumber = int(input())
        # now it is sure that input number is integer.

        if (inputNumber == randomNumber):
            print('correct')
            break

    except ValueError:
        print('please enter the int')
</code></pre>

<p>It makes for a bit more interactive a game with feedback if your guess was too high or low.</p>
<pre><code>import random
lower = 1
upper = 20
rand  = random.randint(lower,upper)

name = input('Hello , What is your name? ')

entered = input('hello %s i am thinking a number from %s to %s. Please take a guess: ' % (name, lower, upper))

while True:
    try:
        guess = int(entered)
        if   guess &gt; rand:
            print('Lower!')
        elif guess &lt; rand:
            print('Higher!')
        elif guess == rand:
            break
    except:
        print('You did not enter a valid integer!')

    entered = input('Try again: ')

print('Congratulations! You guessed correctly!')

<p>Thanks everyone for helping me, Specially Warlock &amp; Evan.
I am pasting code here just to confirm that problem is resolved.</p>
<pre><code>  ##This the guess the number.
  import random
  print('Hello , What is your name')
  name = input()
  print('hello '+ name +' i am thinking a number between 1 to 20. Please take a guess')
  guess = random.randint(1,10)

  while True:

        try :
              inputNumber = int(input())

              if inputNumber &gt; guess :
                    print('Lower!')
              elif inputNumber &lt; guess :
                    print('Higher!')
              elif inputNumber == guess :
                    print('Well Done, Its a Correct Guess')
                    break

<p>You can put your code (including the <code>if</code>) in a while loop. Something like this:</p>
<pre><code>invalidInput = True
while invalidInput:

   # Ask for user input

   if (test_if_user_input_is_valid) :
      invalidInput = False
      # Rest of the code

   else:
      # Ask the user for the right format. This takes back to the beginning of while loop

<span class="comment-copy">So what's your question? The code appears to be almost correct.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Possible duplicate of <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23294658/asking-the-user-for-input-until-they-give-a-valid-response">Asking the user for input until they give a valid response</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes correct but how to take execution back to step where user have to input again. if user enter a string value except section will run , but what i want that if  input is not a integer it should prompt again user to input.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">well you can put the try catch code in <code>while loop</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">i tried but not getting through</span>
<span class="comment-copy">check the updated answer</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks its working</span>
<span class="comment-copy">please execute your self. 1st TRY block is not executing properly ,2nd how can you put multiple if to check same condition , it should elif .</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This code works fine on my machine. Also, those are separate if statements and python has no problem with you making as many as you'd like. A small inefficiency and not pythonic, but it does not impact this program in any meaningful way. Just fixed regardless.  If you still have an error, post it here and we can work through it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I don't think this is correct.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I just kept his original code and tested for a boolean. Edited to remove original code if that's the issue. Honest question: What's wrong with using <code>while</code> here?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I was talking about the inputNumber == int . That will always return false I think.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Agree, that's not the right way for testing for ints. Just copied from original code and didn't notice</span>
