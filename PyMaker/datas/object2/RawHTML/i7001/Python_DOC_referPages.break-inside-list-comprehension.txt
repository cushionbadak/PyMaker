<p>I have datalist and filterlist and I want to use list comprehension method to search any item in datalist which its string contains any word from the filterlist:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; datalist=['mytest123orange','dark angle','double69','spartan','broken image 999','2 cup of tea'] 
&gt;&gt;&gt; filterlist=['test','2','x','123','orange']
&gt;&gt;&gt; print [i for i in datalist if len([ j for j in filterlist if j in i])&gt;0 ]
['test123orange', '2 cup of tea']
</code></pre>
<p>It's working as i want. But the problem is that to get the value from <code>len([ j for j in filterlist if j in i ])&gt;0</code>, it will need to loop all the item inside the filterlist. So even if it match the first item in filterlist, the loop will have to go through till the end. For example when 
try to check the <code>'mytest123orannge'</code>, if the test in filterlist already match it then it's enough, I want to 'break' the loop so I don't want to loop for the rest. So I don't need to match for <code>'orange'</code> or <code>'2'</code> or <code>'123'</code>. </p>
<p>My questions :</p>
<ol>
<li>How can I break inside that loop?  </li>
<li>Is there any other better method?</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>use <code>any()</code> with a generator</p>
<pre><code>filterList=['test','2','x','123','orange']
print ([i for i in datalist if any(j for j in filterList if j in i) ])
</code></pre>
<p><code>any</code> stops the iterations when the first element is found</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You can't <code>break</code> inside a list comprehension, but what about <code>any(j in i for j in filterlist)</code>? That will short-circuit when it finds a match.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@jonrsharpe  it still will loop the whole filterlist , even the match is already found.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@andio no it won't... that's the purpose of <code>any</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@andio no, it won't, see the equivalent Python in the docs: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#any" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#any</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@cᴏʟᴅsᴘᴇᴇᴅ rather than telling me it's probably a good idea to recommend something, why don't you just... recommend it?</span>
