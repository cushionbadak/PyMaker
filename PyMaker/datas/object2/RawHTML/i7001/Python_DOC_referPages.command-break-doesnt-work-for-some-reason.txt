<p>I tried to make a code that would react if the input is integer or float, and if its float it would restart if the person wants it to; but the command 'break' doesnt want to work for some reason please help... (make it simple please)</p>

<p>You just need to wrap your code with a <code>while</code> loop.    </p>
<pre><code>while True:
  number=input("enter a whole number")
  if number.isdigit():
    print("Good one")
  else:
    print ("haha, really clever")
  answer=str(input("Wanna try again? y/n"))
  if answer == 'n':
    print("Ok loser")
    break
  elif answer== 'y':
    print("ok...good luck")
    continue
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>To use a break, you need it to be in a loop (while, for, ...). A break stop the execution of the loop if it's condition is met. In your casse you only have ifs, so you don't need a break as it will not check the other conditions if the first one is met.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You need to use a while loop.</p>
<pre><code>answer = 'y'

while answer == 'y':
    number = input("Please enter a whole number: ")

    if number % 1 == 0:
        print("Good one!")
    else:
        print("Haha, really clever.")

     answer = input("Wanna try again? (y/n) ")
</code></pre>
<p>Set the answer to y so the loop runs at least once.</p>
<p>If the user wants to try again they enter y and the <em>condition</em> will be true meaning the loop wil run again.</p>
<p>Hope this helped!</p>
