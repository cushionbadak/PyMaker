<p>How is the workflow of tearDownClass from <code>unittest.TestCase</code>? Is it called after each test method, or just in the end to "close the connection" of the test class?</p>
<p>Its explanation wasn't clarifying for me: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestCase.tearDown" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestCase.tearDown</a></p>

<p>It is called when you deallocate the class: in other words, when you finish with all of the test methods.  It's a direct cognate to the <code>setUpClass</code>  class method, but at the opposite end of execution.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Actually it's related to <code>setUpClass</code> method, not <code>setUp</code>. <code>setUp</code> is executed before every test from test cases class.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@varela -- OOPS!  Thanks; corrected.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I tested printing the setUp setting and I repaired that the test database is recreated for each test method. I mean, tearDown seem to be called for each test method.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Correct: but <code>tearDownClass</code> will be called only upon exit from the test suite.</span>
