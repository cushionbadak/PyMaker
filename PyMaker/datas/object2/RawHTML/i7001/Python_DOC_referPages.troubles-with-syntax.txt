<p>I'm having troubles with a code I'm making for a friend who requested it for his website. here is the code.</p>

answer = input()
if answer == "yes": print ("Well, aren't you a special snowflake.")

   if(condition):
      print("some text")
we know that,
     we could not place print statement straight to if condition</p>
