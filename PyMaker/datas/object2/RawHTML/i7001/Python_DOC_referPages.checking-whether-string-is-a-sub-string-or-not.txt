<p>I am trying to check whether the given a string is a sub-string of another string, and print the index value of string where the sub-string takes place.</p>
<p>So far I have this code. To reduce the complexity I am using single for loop.</p>
<pre><code>s1 = "robot"
s2 = "bot"
for i in range(len(s2)):
            if s1[i] == s2[i]:
               i =i +1

            print(i)
</code></pre>
<p>Or alternatively I was thinking about this,</p>
<pre><code>for i in range(len(s1)):
    for j in range(len(s2)):
       if s1[i] == s2[j]
                i = i+1
                j = j+1
       print(i)
</code></pre>
<p>I know we can use <strong><code>in</code></strong> keyword to solve this, but I want to learn the logic behind it.</p>
<p>Please help me. I am trying from a long time to solve these.</p>

<p>You can use the builtin string method <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.find" rel="nofollow noreferrer">find()</a> which will return the index of the substring, or -1 if not found.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; "robot".find("bot")
2
&gt;&gt;&gt; "robot".find("Xbot")
-1
</code></pre>

<p>Here's a trash implementation:</p>
<pre><code>a = 'pleb'
b = 'youreapleb'

def find(a, b):
  for i, c in enumerate(b):
    if a == b[i: i + len(a)]:
      return i

print find(a, b)

<span class="comment-copy">What is your question?  If these don't work, explain how they don't w/ sample input and output.  If they do, what are you asking?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Use python <code>str.find()</code></span>

<span class="comment-copy">OP is aware of these, they are trying to implement it on their own.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">U are using i as a counter varaible, what is the role of "c" in here.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hii I got it why u used c in there. Its there if we want to access the value at each counter variable. Thank you so much for your help.</span>
