<p>If I want to check whether a directory is a python package, is it enough to check whether a directory contains a <code>__init__.py</code> file?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Before Python 3.3, only directories containing <code>__init__.py</code> files were considered packages (see <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-regular-package" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><em>regular package</em></a> in Glossary).</p>
<p>Since the addition of <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-namespace-package" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><em>namespace packages</em></a> in Python 3.3, <em>every</em> directory is a Python package, technically.</p>

<p>Based on the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <code>__init__.py</code> files are required to make Python treat the directories as containing packages</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>Update</h1>
<p>Based on the answer here:  <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37139786/is-init-py-not-required-for-packages-in-python-3">Is __init__.py not required for packages in Python 3?</a>
You can see that it's no longer a requirement.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">@vaultah Really? The <code>__init__.py</code> is no longer required?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Is there any reason you could not do the "ask forgiveness not permission" thing here? So you would go <code>try: from foo import bar</code> and <code>except: ...</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@RoyPrins I'm writing a command line tool to treats a directory as a project for my tool and I need to find the directories in there that python packages, so my tool know which packages it can use. Trying to import every directory seemed a bit unsafe since I could accidentally import a package with the same name as a non-package directory.</span>
