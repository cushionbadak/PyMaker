<p>My question is if there's a way to take some values in a function that are not 
integrated in odeint.</p>
<p>Exemple:  if I have a derivative <code>dy(x)/dt = A*x+ln(x)</code> and before to get this equation I computed A throught of a intermediate equation like <code>A = B*D</code> . I would like to take the A's value  during the process.</p>
<p>More detailed (only exemple):</p>
<pre><code>def func(y,t)
    K = y[0]
    B = 3
    A = cos(t**2) + B
    dy/dt = A*t+ln(t)
    return [dy/dt]
</code></pre>
<p>Can I take A's values of function?</p>
<p>The answer for Josh Karpel</p>
<p>The code is like that:</p>
<pre><code>def Reaction(state,t):

  # Integrate Results

  p = state[0]

  T = state[1]

  # function determine enthalpy of system

  f1(T,p) = enthalpy

  # function determine specific volume of system

  f2(T,p) = specific volume

  # function determine heat release by reactions

  f3(T,p,t) = heat release by reactions
</code></pre>
<p># Derivatives</p>
<pre><code> dp/dt = f(T,p,enthalpy,specific volume,heat release by reactions)

 dT/dt = f(T,p,enthalpy,specific volume,heat release by reactions)
</code></pre>
<p>The real code is bigger than that. But, I would like to know if there is a way to store the values of f1 (enthalpy), f2 (specific volume), f3 (heat release) as a vector or tuple during the process of solution of odeint with the same size of p and T. </p>

<p>It's not entirely clear what you want, but it sounds like you need to pass another value to the function you're integrating over. There are two options I can think of:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.integrate.odeint.html#scipy-integrate-odeint" rel="nofollow noreferrer">scipy.integrate.odeint</a> takes an <code>args</code> argument which contains extra arguments to be passed to the integrand function, which could then have signature <code>y(t, A)</code>.</li>
<li>You could use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.partial" rel="nofollow noreferrer">functools.partial</a> to construct a new function which has the argument <code>A</code> for the integrand function <code>y(t, A)</code> already set.</li>
</ol>

<span class="comment-copy">You is talking about input arguments. I was talking regarding if there's a way get off integral function with any vectors or values besides integrated values.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">To clarify: you want the result of the integral to be a function Y(A)? <a href="http://www.sympy.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">SymPy</a> can perform symbolic integrals/derivatives. Alternatively, it seems like you know the values of A - is there any reason you can't simply compute the integral for each value of A you're interested in?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks by attention Josh. I will clarify more the problem. I am building a code to calculate thermodynamic  behouivor of a reactor. I am working with two differential equations: one to compute pressure and another temperature. However, there some thermodynamic properties that not are solved but I would like return the value to plot in a graph.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I saw that exist the function 'append' that I can use and I have already tested. But as we know odeint do adaptatives steps during solution yields more steps than the derivatives's result. I would like to Know if there's a way to use 'append' in odeint and this function return a vector with the same size of solution of derivatives.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sorry, it's still not clear to me what you want the desired output to be. Could you add an example of the desired inputs and outputs to the question?</span>
