<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>example  a user input a date in my command prompt</p>
<pre><code>21 October 2013 
</code></pre>
<p>and it will come out in </p>
<pre><code>Monday

<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">i also use from this reference</a> </p>
<p>here some of my code </p>
<pre><code>import datetime
date = input('Date in DD Full month YYYY: ')
born = datetime.datetime.strptime('date', '%d %B %Y').strftime('%A')
print(born)
</code></pre>
<p>edit: sorry a bit new here didn't used to with the formatting</p>

<p>I really think you could have figured this out with the link I posted in the comments, but here you go:</p>
<pre><code>import datetime
import calendar
date = input('Date in DD Full month YYYY: ')
born = datetime.datetime.strptime(date, '%d %B %Y').weekday()
print(calendar.day_name[born])
</code></pre>
<p>The format needs to be DD month_name YYYY as you wanted, anything else and it won't work.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>first</p>
<pre><code>pip install python-dateutil
</code></pre>
<p>then</p>
<pre><code>from dateutil.parser import parse
print parse("21 October 2013").strftime("%A")`
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">i tried searching my answer from many source</span>
<span class="comment-copy">why import extra not-even-builtin libraries when <code>datetime</code> is sufficient. KISS</span>
<span class="comment-copy">because then it will handle different date formats automagically ... I assume the OP needs more than just that specific format (even though he didnt say so)</span>
