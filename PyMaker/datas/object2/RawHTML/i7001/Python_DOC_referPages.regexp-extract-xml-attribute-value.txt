<p>please, advice how to get xml attribute value with regexp python style. </p>
<p>Here is the example, the extract has to be full match(long story)</p>
<pre><code>&lt;method code="ABC"&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>the most I achieved is <code>(?&lt;=code=\")(.*?)(?=\"&gt;)</code>, but that ignores method part at all</p>
<p>thanks</p>

<p>Well, either you learn the basics of regex syntax and use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>re</code></a>, or you have a look at the Python's <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>xml.etree.ElementTree</code></a> module to parse the xml directly.</p>
<p>If you want to go with a regex, you can test language-specific expressions interactively with online tools, <a href="https://regex101.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">regex101</a> for example.</p>
<p>Maybe <code>&lt;(?P&lt;method&gt;\w*?) (?P&lt;code&gt;\w*?)=\"(?P&lt;value&gt;.*)\"&gt;</code> will do the job.
But once again, as mentioned, extracting data from XML using regex is fragile and very limited.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">By saying python style, I meant that the application that will process this regular expression expects python regexp syntax. Coding is not an option here, so the only way is to get regular expression working.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Then you can use the link I provided at the end. It is an online tool that allow to test language specific regex. I will edit my answer so it is clearer.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for your answer Fabien, I've already did test my regexp on the site you suggested before posting here and asking for solution</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Basic regex suggestion added, you can work on this base.</span>
