<p>I have a small python (2.7) script that works with several threads. One of the threads will read a global list and post an https post request for each one of the entries of this list.</p>
<p>For doing that I saw that the best way is to use python requests module. I have installed it with pip (no problem with that, it is placed in ...Python/2.7/site-packages/requests/...), but, when I import this module in my script, I get an error.</p>
<p>I have created another script with just one line (import requests) to reproduce the error, and I get this:</p>

<p>Am I doing something wrong? Didn't I installed the module in the proper way?</p>

<p>it seems that you're having two modules with the same name <code>array.py</code>
rename your local <code>array.py</code> module to something more unique to resolve this.</p>
<p>take a look at <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/28854227/7438048">this</a> answer for more info on how to handle this issue and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a> to learn more on how python import system works.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">you need to rename the file called <code>array.py</code> in your folder raspberry pi, its creating a conflict</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Welcome to SO: In general, you should not name your modules the same name as python supplied modules....it creates conflicts. Try, if you must, something like <code>my_array</code> or better yet something more descriptive.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Holy ****. I didn't even created that file, maybe it was an error while installing something. Moreover, it was a .pyc file, that obviously I didn't created (not intentionally, at least). Thank you guys.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, I had a array.pyc (I don't know how it was created), and in the file editing program I was using it was hidden. Once I checked it in the terminal, I deleted it and proceed successfully.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">PS: +1 for the link to the little explanation about python module importing system</span>
