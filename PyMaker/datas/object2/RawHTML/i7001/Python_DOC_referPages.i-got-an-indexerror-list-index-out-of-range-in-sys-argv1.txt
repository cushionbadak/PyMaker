<p>It looks like the program is expecting 2 float command line arguments.
`</p>
<pre><code>k1  = float(sys.argv[1])   # starting value of K
k2  = float(sys.argv[2])  
</code></pre>
<p>`</p>
<p>So you shuld probably launch it with something like </p>
<pre><code>python main.py 100 200
</code></pre>
<p>To go more into detail, your code is reading <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/sys.html#sys.argv" rel="nofollow noreferrer">command line arguments</a> and it's expecting there to be 2 of them, that can also be parsed into float values.
Normally, the first command line argument is the script file itself, so <code>sys.argv</code> is always at least one element long.</p>
<p>That being said, you can either do as suggested above, and pass 2 floats as arguments, when launching the script, or just edit the script and hardcode 2 values instead of the ones read from the command line, like so</p>
<pre><code>k1  = 100  
k2  = 200  
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">how did you launch the program?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Did you run your script with at least two command line arguments? e.g. <code>python3 script.py arg1 arg2</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you launch it with <code>python filename.py</code>, you get the error. If you launch it with <code>python filename.py 1 2</code> for example you don't get an error. I hope it is clear why.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Do you understand what the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#IndexError" rel="nofollow noreferrer">error</a> means?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Do you understand what <code>argc</code> and <code>argv</code> are?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks a lot! That was really helpful. Then, I just pressed F5 every time I want to run the code. Now I know  how to use sys,argv.</span>
