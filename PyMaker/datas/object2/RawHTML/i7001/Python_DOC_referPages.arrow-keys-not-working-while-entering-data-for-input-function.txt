<p>In linux, the arrow keys don't work when I try to enter data for an <code>input()</code> function. I get escape characters. See below (when I pressed left arrow key).</p>
<pre><code>dp@hp:~$ python3 -c "x = input('enter a number '); print(x)"
enter a number 123^[[D^[[D
</code></pre>
<p>I have <code>readline</code> installed (I am able to import it in the python shell).
The arrow keys work fine in the interactive interpreter but not in the above case (or when I execute <code>input()</code> from a script).</p>
<p>What could be the reason? </p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input" rel="noreferrer">documentation</a> says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the readline module was loaded, then input() will use it to provide elaborate line editing and history features.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In your example, you haven't loaded the <code>readline</code> module.  Compare the behavior of this:</p>
<pre><code>x = input('enter a number:')
print(x)
</code></pre>
<p>To this:</p>
<pre><code>import readline
x = input('enter a number:')
print(x)
</code></pre>
<p>The second example will behave as you expect (readline support is active, arrow keys work, etc) while the first example will not have readline support.</p>
<p>On the command line, this would be:</p>
<pre><code>python3 -c "import readline; x=input('enter a number '); print(x)"
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I use linux too and for any module you have to import it.</p>
<p>For example for the readline module I have to do</p>
<pre><code>import readline
</code></pre>
<p>This applies to all modules even the os or sys module I have to do</p>
<pre><code>import os
import sys
</code></pre>
<p>However this only applies to modules that you installed correctly. If you installed readline incorrectly not even</p>
<pre><code>import readline
</code></pre>
<p>will work.</p>
<p>That means for you </p>
<pre><code>python3 -c "import readline; x = input('enter a number '); print(x)"
</code></pre>
<p>if you are doing it straight from the console and this applies to not only readline but every other module that you have and will get.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">If you are writing a command-line tool, the proper solution is often to have it read command-line arguments (<code>sys.argv[1:]</code>) instead of using <code>input()</code> interactively.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You are right. Importing <code>readline</code> works. But it should work otherwise too since I have it installed. I am going to try a <code>pip install</code> to see if <code>readline</code> was installed properly.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">"installed" is not the same as "loaded".  You need to explicitly <code>import</code> the module to activate the <code>readline</code> support in the <code>input</code> function. The documentation says explicitly that the readline module must be "loaded".</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Does this mean I need to import <code>readline</code> whenever I use <code>input()</code>? This was not needed on Windows...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm not familiar with Windows, but that is certainly what is implied by the documentation.</span>
