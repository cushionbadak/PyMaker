<p>What is the most pythonic way to remove all lists in a list?</p>
<p>For example, if there is a list like this <code>[1,2,['randompie'],3,[],4,5]</code>, how can I make it like this <code>[1,2,3,4,5]</code></p>
<p>Here is what I've tried:</p>
<pre><code>[elem for elem in [1,2,['randompie'],3,[],4,5] if type(elem)!='list']
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use a list comprehension to easily filter all non-list elements from your list:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; l = [1,2,['randompie'],3,[],4,5]
&gt;&gt;&gt; [el for el in l if not isinstance(el, list)]
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
</code></pre>
<p>Note I used <code>isinstance</code> rather than <code>type</code>. This is for two reasons. The former function is preferred because <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#type" rel="nofollow noreferrer">it takes parent classes into account</a>. And because <code>isinstance</code> allows you to easily extend the list comprehension to filter out other types such as <code>tuple</code>s or <code>dict</code>s:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; l = [1, 2, ['randompie'], 3, [], 4, 5, (1,)]
&gt;&gt;&gt; [el for el in l if not isinstance(el, (list, tuple))] # filter out tuples and list
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I would use list comprehension:</p>
<pre><code>your_list = [1,2,['randompie'],3,[],4,5]
your_list = [thing for thing in your_list if type(thing) is not list]
</code></pre>
</div>

<span class="comment-copy">@ChristianDean Noted, that seems like a good policy to me</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Alright, thanks for the feedback. Glad to hear.</span>
