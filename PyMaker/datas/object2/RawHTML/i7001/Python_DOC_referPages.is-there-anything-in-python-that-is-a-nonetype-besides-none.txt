<p>I was just wondering if in Python there's any other object/instance whose type is <code>NoneType</code> type besides the very well known <code>None</code>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; type(None)
&lt;type 'NoneType'&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>So... This is very clear, but I was wondering whether there's <em>anything</em> else that is also of <code>NoneType</code></p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; type(???)
&lt;type 'NoneType'&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Needless to say, this is just for curiosity sake and learning purposes <strong>:-)</strong></p>
<p>Thank you in advance.</p>

<p>From the docs, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#None" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>None</code></a> is: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The sole value of the type <code>NoneType</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>None</code> is the only <code>NoneType</code> , however in your case of </p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; type(???)
&lt;type 'NoneType'&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>You could do something like</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a=None
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(a)
type 'NoneType'
</code></pre>
<p>Meaning, any variable that holds <code>None</code> will obviously also return <code>NoneType</code> as its type since they are <code>None</code>. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">Welp, if an answer answers a question in an indirect dupe, it's still a dupe.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You're right... it's a duplicate (I saw that question, and I didn't get as far as to reach the 3rd entry) I'll accept the first answer and remove it</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@BorrajaX Relax. There's nothing wrong with dupes. They serve as checkpoints to guide people who enter different search terms but are looking for the same thing.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">I did, <code>a p</code>, but it's no so clear in the Python 2 docs, which is what I use (<a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/types.html#types.NoneType" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/2/library/types.html#types.NoneType</a>)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It's in python 2 docs too: <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/constants.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/2/library/constants.html</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Right you are, @roganjosh... I don't know how could I miss that! <b>:-S</b></span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>a</code> is not a value; it's just another name that refers to the singleton value of type <code>NoneType</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That's why I included the example with <code>a</code> , since the asker's question wonders <code>whether there's anything else</code>, so I took that to include names that refers to the very same <code>NoneType</code>.</span>
