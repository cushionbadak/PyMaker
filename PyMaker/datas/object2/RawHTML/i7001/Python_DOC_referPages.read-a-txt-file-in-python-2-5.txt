<p>I want to read line by line a txt file and save it to a list, my python version is 2.5, but I get syntax error, can you help me? 
My code is as follows:</p>
<pre><code>with open("test.txt") as f:
    content = f.read().splitlines()
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>context managers were introduced in python 2.6 (<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0343/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PEP 343</a>). In python 2.5 you have to do:</p>
<pre><code>f = open("test.txt")
content = f.read().splitlines()
f.close()
</code></pre>
<p>the main drawback is that you have to remember to close the file</p>
<p>another possibility (maybe even better) is to use <code>__future__</code> (make it the first line of your script):</p>
<pre><code>from __future__ import with_statement
</code></pre>
<p>then you're good to use <code>with</code> in python 2.5</p>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>with</code> is officially part of Python 2.6, you have to import it from __future__ before using contextlib in Python 2.5.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@digitaLink that's true! thanks for pointing that out. Edited.</span>
