<p>I have a simple question today.  Basically, I want to print 2 or more lines of output in the CMD shell with python.  Here is an example:</p>
<p>Regular CMD Shell:</p>
<pre><code>Output
</code></pre>
<p>What I want:</p>
<pre><code>Output
Output1
Ect.
</code></pre>
<p>I'm using Python 3.x fyi.  I don't even know if this is possible with typical Python libraries, thanks for your answers!</p>
<p>Edit: Due to confusion, I've dedcided to write more in detail.  I'd like to have 2 or more live outputs while a loop or something of the matter is running.  So, for example, if I was running a clock in a <code>while True</code> loop, I could use the carriage return function and have 2 outputs running.</p>
<p>Edit #2: So I'm going to give you guys a situation in which I would need an answer to this question.  Basically, I made a loop that displays the current time and the time until 7:30 pm to the CMD shell using a return so it all stays neatly on one line.  However, I need it so instead of me printing all the information I need on 1 line, it does it on 2.  Here is the output:</p>
<pre><code>Time:  12:44:38 Time Left Until 7:30:  6:45:22
</code></pre>
<p>What I want it to be:</p>
<pre><code>Time:  12:44:38 
Time Left Until 7:30:  6:45:22
</code></pre>
<p>Here is my code:</p>
<pre><code>import datetime
import time
import sys
while True:
    start_time = datetime.datetime.now().time().strftime('%H:%M:%S')
    end_time = ('19:30:00')
    total_time=(datetime.datetime.strptime(end_time,'%H:%M:%S') - datetime.datetime.strptime(start_time,'%H:%M:%S'))

    print ('Time: ', start_time, 'Time Left Until 7:30: ', total_time, end='\r')

    time.sleep(0.1)
</code></pre>
<p>When I try to print anything below the carriage return, it doesn't print and when I put the carriage return in the second print, the original loop prints down and not in one line.  Thanks again!</p>

<p>If <code>cls</code> command blinks, you can use ANSI commands to control. First you have to enable ANSI in the windows cmd. You can use a 3rd party library such as <code>colorama</code> to do that.</p>
<p>Once you've enabled ANSI, you can use it to move up a line and delete a line (and also add nice colors ðŸ˜‰).</p>
<pre><code> colorama.init() # don't forget to call
</code></pre>
<p>Up a line: <code>sys.stout.write('\033[1A')</code></p>
<p>Delete current line: <code>sys.stout.write(' \r\033[K')</code></p>

<p>You can refresh the cmd window by calling <code>os.system('cls')</code>. This will clear the screen and allow you to print your updated output.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Just outputting didn't work?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you just want to print to standard output, use the print() function</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@AllenMoh I know that, but I want to live outputs printing at the same time</span>

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks again, you definitively deserve the accepted answer.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Glad I could help</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Refer to my new edit please</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Use the cls command to clear the whole screen and print your line normally, without the carriage return</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It works but it flashes in between screen clears</span>
