<p>How would i go about creating an array that is a repetition of n 1's and -1's. 
i.e array[1,-1,1,-1,1,-1,...] for n times </p>
<p>I tried using numpy.repeat but it repeats each element rather than repeating 1 and -1 over and over. </p>
<p>edit: here is what i have tried: </p>
<pre><code>import numpy as np

def repeat(n):
    z=np.arange(1,2)
    x=-np.arange(1,2)
    w=np.concatenate((x,z))
    return np.repeat(w,n)
</code></pre>
<p>which for n=3 returns</p>
<pre><code> array([-1, -1, -1,  1,  1,  1])
</code></pre>
<p>ideally, I would want this to be returning </p>
<pre><code> array([-1, 1, -1, 1, -1, 1])
</code></pre>

<pre><code>alternating_list = [1,-1] * number_of_iterations

<span class="comment-copy">You can't create an infinite list in Python. However, if you want to iterate over something for an undetermined length, you might want to look at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.cycle" rel="nofollow noreferrer">itertools.cycle</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Kendas: The question seems to be describing a finite array (or maybe a list, if the questioner isn't aware of the difference).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I understand it as finite (for n times)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Very nice idea, but please avoid answering questions where the OP has demonstrated no effort in solving their own problem.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ChristianDean - Normally I'd agree, but the op does mention <i>what</i> they tried...even if they havent shown it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Sayse Fair point. Although the OP should still <i>show</i>, what they've tried. only mentioning it isn't usually enough information. (Also, FYI: I didn't down-vote.)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">that was very simple actually, thanks</span>
<span class="comment-copy">In python there is usually a simple answer :) If you click the green tick next to the answer you accept it officially.</span>
