<p>Once i try a simple program, this message shows up:
TypeError: 'in ' requires string as left operand, not tuple
That's the script:</p>
<pre><code>Answer = "Yeah", "Yes"
if Answer in input():
    print("Alright!")
</code></pre>
<p>the message shows once i press run and type one of the variables. In this case, "Yeah" or "Yes".
What should ii'l do?
Yeah ik, im a noobie ;)</p>

<p>Depends on what you want to do. </p>
<p>If you want to see if the user's input is one of the values of the tuple, switch the order in your <code>if</code> statement:</p>
<pre><code>Answer = "Yeah", "Yes"
if input() in Answer:
    print("Alright!")
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to see if the user's input contains one of the values of the tuple, that is a bit more complicated. The best way is to use list comprehension (or in this case, <em>tuple</em>), and the built-in <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#any" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>any()</code></a> function to turn the resulting collection into a boolean:</p>
<pre><code>Answer = "Yeah", "Yes"
if any(word in input() for word in Answer):
    print("Alright!")
</code></pre>

<p>@stybl showed you how to fix your problems, I'll explain your error.</p>
<pre><code>Anwser = "Yeah", "Yes"
</code></pre>
<p>In this line you are making a <strong>tuple</strong>. a tuple is like a list except that you can't modify it after its creation.</p>
<p>The previous code line can be written like this:</p>
<pre><code>Answer = ("Yeah", "Yes")
</code></pre>
<p>In Python the parenthesis aren't necessary but the two lines are the same.
So it makes no sense to check if there is a tuple (a list if you prefer) into a string.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">But if you don't put the <code>[ ]</code>, then it's a generator comprehension and not a list comprehension.</span>
