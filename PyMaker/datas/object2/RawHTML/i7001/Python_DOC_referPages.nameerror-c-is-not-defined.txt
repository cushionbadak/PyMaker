<p>I write below code in python(version 3.6.2):</p>
<pre><code>def test():
    temp = 'c=1'
    exec(temp)
    print(c)

test()
</code></pre>
<p>when run it, I get below error:</p>
<pre><code>NameError: name 'c' is not defined
</code></pre>
<p>but when  run below code :</p>
<pre><code>temp='a=1'
exec(temp)
print(a)
</code></pre>
<p>it print 1.</p>
<p>How do I fix this?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The exec() function can only be followed by a string or an object. What you asked it to do is not one of those. You should try just defining c in another way or stop using exec() </p>

<span class="comment-copy">You don't have a variable called c how you would print it?, print(c) raise the error.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I am unable to reproduce your error in python2.7 or python3.  It prints <code>1</code> each time.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm also unable to repro...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I've reproduced it in Python 3.6.1.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The documentation on Python 3's <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#exec" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>exec()</code></a> is pretty clear: <i>"modifications to the default locals dictionary should not be attempted. Pass an explicit locals dictionary if you need to see effects of the code on locals after function exec() returns."</i> (globals is a different story)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Huh? OP passes a string, the problem isn't that, it's that <code>exec</code> does not modify <code>locals</code></span>
