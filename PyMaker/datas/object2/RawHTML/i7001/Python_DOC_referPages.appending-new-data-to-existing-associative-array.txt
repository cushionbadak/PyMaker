<p>I've been working on Python for last few months and I encountered this problem.
So, I have a dictionary which contains only keys and no values.</p>
<pre><code>{'_id' : None, 'game' : None, 'viewers' : None ....}
</code></pre>
<p>And I want to add data which are in the list. 
For example, </p>
<pre><code>[123456, 'StarCraft 2', 300, ....]
</code></pre>
<p>As you might guess, the order of elements inside the list corresponds to the order of keys inside the dict.
I think using for loop is the solution but I couldn't come up with a good one.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Extra question: 
The dict above is now dictionaries inside a list.
And, I want to add exactly same dictionary with same keys and new values every time I get a new list of data.</p>
<pre><code>[{'_id': 001, 'game':'StarCraft 2', 'viewers':300, ...}, 
 {'_id': 002, 'game':'Tetiris', 'viewers': 30, ...},
... ]
</code></pre>
<p>How do I do that?</p>
<p>Thanks, Python friends!!</p>

<p>Actually you cannot do that with a dict because the order is not conserved. But you can use the class <code>OrderedDict</code> as shown here: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1867861/python-dictionary-how-to-keep-keys-values-in-same-order-as-declared">Python dictionary, how to keep keys/values in same order as declared?</a></p>
<p>What you could do is have a list with your keys to keep track of the order:</p>
<pre><code>my_keys = ['_id', 'game', 'viewers']
for index, elt in enumerate(my_data):
     my_dict[my_keys[index]] = elt
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">You cannot be certain of the order of the keys in the dict. Thus, this is, at best, fragile, at worst plain wrong.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Further, how come you have a list of data to begin with. That sounds odd.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">"because the order is not conserved". Now it is, but only as a side effect. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39980323/dictionaries-are-ordered-in-python-3-6" title="dictionaries are ordered in python 3 6">stackoverflow.com/questions/39980323/â€¦</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">True, since 3.6 it is conserved but it might not stay that way: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.6.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.6.html</a></span>
