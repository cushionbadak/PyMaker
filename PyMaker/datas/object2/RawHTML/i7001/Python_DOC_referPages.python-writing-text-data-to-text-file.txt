<pre><code>def write_to_log_file(text):
    with open ("C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\log.txt",mode='w') as file:
        file.write(text)
</code></pre>
<p>however when I run this code I am getting the following error:</p>
<pre><code>line 13, in write_to_log_file
    file.write(text)

<span class="comment-copy">Try to encode your unicode string as ascii:<code>unicodeData.encode('ascii', 'ignore')</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Please show some of the text that you are trying to write. Especially, what format the text is in right now. I expect that your text is unicode and as such needs to be treated differently.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Please check the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation</a> on the <code>open</code> function and, considering the error message you got, make an educated guess about which additional parameter you need to pass to <code>open</code>.</span>
