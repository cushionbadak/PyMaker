<p>I am writing a very simple program to output the 0-10 in numbers using a for loop. However it comes up with a syntax error when I click run, highlighting in red the "=" in the 8th line. I don't understand why it is wrong? I am using python 3.5.2 in idle mode.</p>
<pre><code>def numbers():
    print ("This program will count to ten, just you wait...")
    import time
    time.sleep(1)
    print ("\n\nLiterally wait I just need to remember base 10 because I 
    only work in binary!")
    time.sleep(4)
    int(counter) = 0
    for counter &lt;**=** 9: 
    print ("\n" + counter)
    counter =  counter + 1

    print ("\n\nAnd there you go. Told you I could do it. Goodbye :) ")
    time.sleep(2)
    exit()

<p>Try it like this:</p>
<pre><code>def numbers():
    print ("This program will count to ten, just you wait...")
    import time
    time.sleep(1)
    print ("\n\nLiterally wait I just need to remember base 10 because I only work in binary!")
    time.sleep(4)
    for i in range(1, 10): #11 if you want 10 to be printed
        print i

    print ("\n\nAnd there you go. Told you I could do it. Goodbye :) ")
    time.sleep(2)

<p>This is wrong syntax for <code>for</code>. As per <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#for" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The for statement is used to iterate over the elements of a sequence (such as a string, tuple or list) or other iterable object.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>which is not your case, or you can use <code>range()</code> to create the sequence:</p>
<pre><code>for i in range(1, 10):
</code></pre>
<p>yet it's artificial workaround and while it will work, is not what you should be doing really.</p>
<p>You should use <code>while</code> instead. <a href="http://docs:%20https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#while" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Docs</a> say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The while statement is used for repeated execution as long as an expression is true</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>while counter &lt;= 9:

<p>A couple of points. The excerpt:</p>
<pre><code>int(counter) = 0
for counter &lt;**=** 9: 
print ("\n" + counter)
counter =  counter + 1
</code></pre>
<p>has multiple errors.</p>
<ol>
<li><code>int(counter) = 0</code> is not valid python syntax.</li>
<li><code>for counter &lt;**=** 9</code> is not a valid <code>for</code> statement.</li>
<li>The lines <code>print ("\n" + counter)</code> and <code>counter =  counter + 1</code> are lacking proper indentation.</li>
</ol>
<p>Replace those four lines with</p>
<pre><code>for counter in range(10):
    print(counter)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Your <code>for</code> statement is invalid. You're looking for <code>while</code>, or the <a href="http://python.org" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python docs</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What is your intention with <code>int(counter) = 0</code>? This is not valid python syntax. It should read <code>counter = 0</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Looks good, I'll try it. Thanks!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">it worked/ Thank you...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Isaac you are welcome, please accept the answer</span>
