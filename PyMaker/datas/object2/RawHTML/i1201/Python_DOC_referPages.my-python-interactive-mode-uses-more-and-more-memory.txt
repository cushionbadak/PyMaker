<p>I'm using Windows 7 64 bit and Python 3.7.1 (Anaconda) takes more and more memory after each execution to grab the interactive mode.</p>
<h2>Symptoms</h2>
<p>If I execute the following line : </p>
<pre><code>&gt; python -c "print('ok')"
</code></pre>
<p>It will run without any problems almost immediately.</p>
<p>Now if I run python directly :</p>
<pre><code>&gt; python
</code></pre>
<p>It first display the following : </p>
<pre><code>Python 3.7.1 (default, Oct 28 2018, 08:39:03) [MSC v.1912 64 bit (AMD64)] :: Anaconda custom (64-bit) on win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
</code></pre>
<p>And then start to load...</p>
<p>First time I noticed that python was more and more slow to access the interactive mode he needed already few seconds. Now, it can be at least 2 minutes to execute :/ and it is using more and more memory &gt; 3.0 Go ! </p>
<p>I did some search but didn't find anything about that problem. Does someone has an idea on how I could figure out what's going on ? </p>
<h2>Edit</h2>
<p>I was able to get the interactive mode at once by doing </p>
<pre><code>&gt; python -S 
</code></pre>

<p>Thank to <code>@snakecharmerb</code>. I had to retrieve my <code>.python_history</code> file located for me at  <code>C:/Users/Administrator</code> and delete it. </p>
<p><code>.python_history</code> was huge : Almost 100 Mo and it's content was unreadable :</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Does anaconda create a command history file for python  (called .pythonhistory, or similar)?  If it does, how big is it?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Can you check if it loads faster with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>-S</code> and/or <code>-s</code></a>? If so, it could be related to a badly initializing module.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@usr2564301 it does with -S, python is loaded at once</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@snakecharmerb didn't find any file called like that, what's its default location ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>:P</code> It was the first flag I saw in the options that would disable <i>something</i>. At least it gives you something to tinker with. I've quick-scanned what that <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/site.html#module-site" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>site</code></a> flag is about but it's beyond my Python-fu.</span>
