<p>I copy some Python code in order to download data from a website. Here is my specific website:
<a href="https://www.codot.gov/business/bidding/bid-tab-archives/bid-tabs-2017-1" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.codot.gov/business/bidding/bid-tab-archives/bid-tabs-2017-1</a></p>
<p>Here is the code which I copied:</p>
<pre><code>import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

def _getUrls_(res):
    hrefs = []
    soup = BeautifulSoup(res.text, 'lxml')
    main_content = soup.find('div',{'id' : 'content-core'})
    table = main_content.find("table")
    for a in table.findAll('a', href=True):
        hrefs.append(a['href'])
    return(hrefs)

bidurl = 'https://www.codot.gov/business/bidding/bid-tab-archives/bid-tabs-2017-1'
r = requests.get(bidurl)
hrefs = _getUrls_(r)

def _getPdfs_(hrefs, basedir):
    for i in range(len(hrefs)):
        print(hrefs[i])
        respdf = requests.get(hrefs[i])
        pdffile = basedir + "/pdf_dot/" + hrefs[i].split("/")[-1] + ".pdf"
        try:
            with open(pdffile, 'wb') as p:
                p.write(respdf.content)
                p.close()
        except FileNotFoundError:
            print("No PDF produced")

basedir= "/Users/ABC/Desktop"
_getPdfs_(hrefs, basedir)
</code></pre>
<p>The code runs successfully, but it did not download anything at all, even though there is no <code>Filenotfounderror</code> obviously.</p>
<p>I tried the following two URLs:</p>
<pre><code>https://www.codot.gov/business/bidding/bid-tab-archives/bid-tabs-2017/aqc-088a-035-20360
https://www.codot.gov/business/bidding/bid-tab-archives/bid-tabs-2017/aqc-r100-258-21125
</code></pre>
<p>However both of these URLs return <code>&gt;&gt;&gt; No PDF produced</code>.</p>
<p>The thing is that the code worked and downloaded successfully for other people, but not me.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Your code works I just tested. You need to make sure the <code>basedir</code> exists, you want to add this to your code:</p>
<pre><code>if not os.path.exists(basedir):
    os.makedirs(basedir)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I used this exact (indented) code but replaced the basedir with my own dir and it worked only after I made sure that the path actually exists. This code does not create the folder in case it does not exist.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>As others have pointed out, you need to create <code>basedir</code> beforehand. The user running the script may not have the directory created. Make sure you insert this code at the beginning of the script, before the main logic. </p>
<p>Additionally, hardcoding the base directory might not be a good idea when transferring the script to different systems. It would be preferable to use the users <em>%USERPROFILE%</em> enviorment variable:</p>
<pre><code>from os import envioron
basedir= join(environ["USERPROFILE"], "Desktop", "pdf_dot")
</code></pre>
<p>Which would be the same as <code>C:\Users\blah\Desktop\pdf_dot</code>. </p>
<p>However, the above enivorment variable only works for Windows. If you want it to work Linux, you will have to use <code>os.environ["HOME"]</code> instead. </p>
<p>If you need to transfer between both systems, then you can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.name" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>os.name</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>from os import name
from os import environ

# Windows
if name == 'nt':
    basedir= join(environ["USERPROFILE"], "Desktop", "pdf_dot")

# Linux
elif name == 'posix':
    basedir = join(environ["HOME"], "Desktop", "pdf_dot")
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You don't need to specify the directory or create any folder manually. All you need do is run the following script. When the execution is done, you should get a folder named <code>pdf_dot</code> in your desktop containing the pdf files you wish to grab.</p>
<pre><code>import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import os

URL = 'https://www.codot.gov/business/bidding/bid-tab-archives/bid-tabs-2017-1'

dirf = os.environ['USERPROFILE'] + '\Desktop\pdf_dot'
if not os.path.exists(dirf):os.makedirs(dirf)
os.chdir(dirf)

res = requests.get(URL)
soup = BeautifulSoup(res.text, 'lxml')
pdflinks = [itemlink['href'] for itemlink in soup.find_all("a",{"data-linktype":"internal"}) if "reject" not in itemlink['href']]
for pdflink in pdflinks:
    filename = f'{pdflink.split("/")[-1]}{".pdf"}'
    with open(filename, 'wb') as f:
        f.write(requests.get(pdflink).content)
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Please make sure your posted code is indented exactly as you have it on your system. Proper Indentation is <i>crucial</i> for Python!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Is your code really <code>basedir= "/Users/ABC/Desktop"</code>? You should probably replace <code>ABC</code> with your username. Also, make sure you've created the directory <code>pdf_dot</code> on your desktop. Basically, I think the problem is your directory path might not exist.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, this handy tip would make the script work on Windows too.</span>
