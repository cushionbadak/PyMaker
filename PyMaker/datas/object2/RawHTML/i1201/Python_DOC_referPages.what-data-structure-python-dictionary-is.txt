<p>So at the job interview I was asked the following question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In Python, the word 'dictionary' is a reserved pythonic word for this data structure. But what is its "real" name? What is python dictionary in other programming languages?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Googling doesn't point me to what I'm actually looking for. Can anybody explain it?</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Quoting the docs</a> I'd say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dictionaries are sometimes found in other languages as “associative
  memories” or “associative arrays”.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Your interview question is wrongly worded. Dictionary IS the proper name of the abstract data structure that allows you to look up something based on a key. Python used the exact name of the ADT in its implementation. Another way to call the abstraction is “associative array”.</p>
<p>Internally, dictionaries in Python are implemented as a hash table , which is NOT an ADT (hash a key and look it’s value up in the bucket that matches its hash). You can have dictionaries with a different implementation (e.g. tree based).</p>

<span class="comment-copy">It's Python's version of a hash table.</span>
