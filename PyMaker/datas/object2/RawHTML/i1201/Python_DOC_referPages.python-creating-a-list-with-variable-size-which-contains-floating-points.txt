<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I want to be able to create a 2d list with a variable size.</p>
<pre><code>test = [[]]
</code></pre>
<p>The problem is the data I want to put inside of it is a floating point. This makes it incompatible with the append function</p>
<pre><code>                TempData[0] = 1
                TempData[1] = 2.32
                TempData[2] = 3.65
                test.append(float(TempData))
</code></pre>
<p>Is There any way around this? I don't really want to declare a huge list because sometimes the 2D list size may be very big or very small.    </p>
</div>

<p>It looks like your issue is due to passing an object, TempData to a list and then changing the contents of that object. A reference to TempData is stored in the list, not the values contained in that list. When you alter TempData, it alters every element in the list. Instead, try this:</p>
<pre><code>test = []
test.append([1, 2.32, 3.65])
test.append([2.312, 1.231, 1.111])
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/array.html#module-array" rel="nofollow noreferrer">python array module</a> is made specifically for the purpose of holding numeric values. Here is an example using a list and an <code>array.array</code>:</p>
<pre><code>import array
mylist = []
mylist.append(array.array('f', [1.43, 1.54, 1.24]))
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">You can't pass a list to <code>float()</code>. Try <code>test.append(TempData)</code> since they're already floats.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What is the final form you want? <code>test = [[1, 2.32, 3.65]]</code>? Something else?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ShadowRanger I'm appending arrays on top of each other so the final Data form would be test = [[1, 2.32, 3.65][2.312,1.231,1.111]…….]</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ggorlen I've tried that, but without declaring a data type the final appended list only contains the value that it saw during the first append like test = [[1, 2.32, 3.65][1, 2.32, 3.65][1, 2.32, 3.65]…..]. I'm unsure of why it shows that behavior.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Trubsworth That may be because all your lists are aliases of each other, which has nothing to do with float. What you call "declaring a data type" is a casting operation. You may have done something like <code>[[]] * 30</code> somewhere along the way or all your <code>TempData</code> lists that you're appending are the same object.

<span class="comment-copy">Thank you so much! Sorry I'm new to python and I am a pretty novice programmer, so I was unaware of this interaction. Thanks!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No problem! I'm happy to help.</span>
