<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have a Python function that takes inputs from user and executes a SQL statement:</p>
<pre><code>def function_name(team, dept start_date, end_date):
    dwh = conn.cursor() ## DB Connection established
    if (team is None):
        dwh.execute(sql.SQL("""select name,dept from employee where group = (%s) and join_date between (%s) and (%s)"""), (group, start_date, end_date))
    elif (dept is None):
        dwh.execute(sql.SQL("""select name,team from employee where team = (%s) and join_date between (%s) and (%s)"""), (team, start_date, end_date))
    else:
        dwh.execute(sql.SQL("""select name,dept,team from employee where team = (%s) and dept =(%s) and join_date between (%s) and (%s)"""), (team, dept start_date, end_date))
</code></pre>
<p>When I try the above code, it runs when all inputs are provided by the user. If any of the fields are not provided, it returns an empty output.</p>
<p><strong>Edit :</strong> </p>
<p>Output returned when I share the below input:</p>
<pre><code>function_name("team1", "dept1", "2018-01-01","2018-01-31")
</code></pre>
<p>However when I enter the below it returns an empty output (it should execute the <code>elif (dept is None):</code> portion of the script)</p>
<pre><code>function_name("team1", "2018-01-01","2018-01-31")
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>It would be helpful if you include your input lines for team and dept.</p>
<p>You're missing a comma after dept, should fix the user-defined function.
Furthermore, function_name input should be as followed:</p>
<pre><code>def function_name(team, dept, start_date, end_date):
    if (team is None):
        print ("team is none")
    elif (dept is None):
        print ("dept is none")
    else:
        print("else")
</code></pre>
<p><code>function_name(team='team1', dept='dept1', start_date='2018-01-01', end_date='2018-01-01')</code> prints else</p>
<pre><code>function_name(team='team1', dept=None, start_date='2018-01-01', end_date='2018-01-01')
</code></pre>
<p>prints dept is none</p>
<p><code>function_name(team=None, dept='dept1', start_date='2018-01-01', end_date='2018-01-01')</code>  prints team is none</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Maybe share your input lines as well? Might have to do with empty fields being empty strings ('') instead of actual None.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@romanoww, I have edited my post with the function and inputs I am giving</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Your example doesn't match the described behaviour - with the second function call, it should raise a TypeError "function_name takes exactly 4 arguments (2 given)". Please post a proper MCVE (<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve">stackoverflow.com/help/mcve</a>).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@scottmartin in the second call, you are passing <code>"2018-01-01"</code> as the second positional argument, so this gets bound to the <code>dept</code> argument. For <code>dept</code> to be <code>None</code>, you have to pass it as such, ie <code>function_name("team1", None,  "2018-01-01","2018-01-31")</code>. There are better ways using default arguments values in the function definition and named arguments at call time but this would be too long for a comment - and it's already well documented here <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#more-on-defining-functions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/tutorial/â€¦</a> anyway.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Please re-read my comment more carefully, and read the doc I linked to. The fact that you're "only passing 3 arguments" doesn't mean that Python will automagically guess you wanted to pass <code>None</code> as the second - that's just not how it works. And the fact that this is in a flask app is irrelevant too, a function is a function, period.</span>
