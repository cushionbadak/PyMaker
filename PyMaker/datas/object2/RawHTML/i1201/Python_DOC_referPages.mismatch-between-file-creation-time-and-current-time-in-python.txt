<p>Why is the file creation time less than the time measured before it is created?</p>
<pre><code>import os, time

before_creation = time.time()

with open('my_file', 'w') as f:
    f.write('something')

creation_time = os.stat('my_file').st_ctime

print(before_creation)  # 1545031532.8819697

<ul>
<li>Since OS module is from CPython and designed initally for the python
2.x versions. If you run your code in 2.7 version it returns the same value for before_creation and creation_time. Since, the result is
limited to 2 decimal places only in 2.x version.  <br/>
<code>eg., 1545073155.03</code></li>
<li>Also, you have to note that when you do <code>print(os.stat('my_file'))</code>  we get <br/>
<code>posix.stat_result(st_mode=33204, st_ino=12, st_dev=1792, st_nlink=1,
st_uid=488, st_gid=487, st_size=0, st_atime=1545073155,
st_mtime=1545073155, st_ctime=1545073155)</code></li>
<li>And if you do
<code>print(os.stat('my_file')[9])</code> we get <code>1545073155</code><br/> As far as
solution, you might have to use the time.time() to get the time after
creation. <br/> Considering this there might be a bug during the
conversion from int to float of the st_ctime.</li>

<span class="comment-copy">Confirmed on <a href="https://pyfiddle.io/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">pyfiddle.io</a> .. funny. Maybe this is a resolution thing ebcause time.time() only updates 50-100 times a second and st_ctime may be "faster" - still curious. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.time" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.time</a>   and   <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.0/library/stat.html#stat.ST_CTIME" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3.0/library/stat.html#stat.ST_CTIME</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@PatrickArtner Could be. I ran this in a loop and about 4 out of 1000 times recorded the expected result</span>
