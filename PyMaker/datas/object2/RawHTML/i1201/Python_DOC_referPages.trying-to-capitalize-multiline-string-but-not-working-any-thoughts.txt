<p>If you want to capitalize the first letter of each word (lowercasing the rest), <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.title" rel="nofollow noreferrer">use <code>.title()</code></a>; if you want <em>every</em> character to be uppercase, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.upper" rel="nofollow noreferrer">use <code>.upper()</code></a>.</p>
