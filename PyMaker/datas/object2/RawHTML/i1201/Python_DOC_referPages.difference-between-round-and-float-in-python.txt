<p>Could someone explain me what's the difference between <strong>round()</strong> and <strong>float()</strong> in Python, please?</p>
<h2>For example</h2>
<pre><code>x = 9.09128239
x = float("{0:.2f}".format(x))

y = 9.09128239
y = round(y, 2)
</code></pre>
<p>As I see, both functions from the code above do the same job. However, <strong>round()</strong> seems more compact and appealing to me.</p>
<p>I'd like to know if there is something else behind these functions and if I should consider something in particular when choosing which one to use.</p>
<p>Thank you for your help in advance!</p>

<p>It is not the float function that is doing the rounding here.</p>
<p>As a general term, float and round do very different things. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#float" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Float</a> takes a valid input and attempts to typecast it into a floating point representation. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#round" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Round</a> just rounds up to <code>n</code> significant digits.</p>
<pre><code>float(3) #works on numbers 
float("5.2") #and strings too!

x = 9.09128239
#x = float("{0:.2f}".format(x)) #there are two steps here.

result = "{0:.2f}".format(x)

#result is a string "9.09" The rounding happened because of the precision listed during string formatting.

x = float(result) #just takes the string and converts to float

y = 9.09128239
y = round(y, 2) #directly works on the float and rounds it off.
</code></pre>
<p>Tl;Dr Just use round.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This formats and parses a string, which is a lot of unnecessary work:</p>
<pre><code>x = float("{0:.2f}".format(x))
</code></pre>
<p>This simple rounds the float, and will be much faster:</p>
<pre><code>y = round(y, 2)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>One of the main differences is that <strong><code>float</code> is a class and <code>round</code> is a function</strong>. Using <code>float</code> does not round a number:</p>
<pre><code>float('0.12345') #0.12345
</code></pre>
<p>but <code>round</code> does:</p>
<pre><code>round(0.12345, 2) #0.12
</code></pre>
<p>Use <code>float</code> to convert something to a float, and use <code>round</code> to round off a float.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><strong>float()</strong> is used for type conversion of data to the float-type, if applicable.</p>
<p>On the other hand, <strong>round()</strong> is used for rounding of the given value to the specified number of decimal places.</p>
<p>Just as a quick note, what you are doing above in the example for float() is taking a number, rounding it off to the specified number of digits (in your example, two), converting it into string, and then type casting it into float data type.</p>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>float</code> works on <code>digit</code> and <code>string</code> as well while 'round' works on <code>digits</code> only.for more see documentation as also suggested by @Matthias</span>
