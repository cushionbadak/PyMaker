<p>I'm parsing an XML file and need to remove some clutter from the final output.    </p>
<pre><code>str = &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?&gt;&lt;chat-message&gt;2018-10
</code></pre>
<p>my attempt at a solution is:</p>
<pre><code>re.sub(r'&lt;(\w|\d|\s){1,}&gt;{1,4}',"",str)
</code></pre>
<p>and my desired output is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>2018-10</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Currently Python is finding no matches and just returning <code>str</code>. I don't think <code>&lt;</code> or <code>&gt;</code> are special characters so no escaping needed; I tried escaping anyway and it still did not work.</p>

<p>You could try something simpler:</p>
<pre><code>re.sub(r'&lt;.*?&gt;', '', str)
</code></pre>

<p>In my opinion you are better off using an XML parser rather than regex. Here is an example using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html#tutorial" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>xml.etree.ElementTree</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

xmlstring = '&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?&gt;&lt;chat-message&gt;2018-10&lt;/chat-message&gt;'
root = ET.fromstring(xmlstring)

print(root.text)
# OUTPUT
# 2018-10

<p>This regex works for the test case in your question -</p>
<pre><code>r"&lt;[\w\D]+&gt;([-\d]+)"
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Could you give some more examples it's hard to infer what you want to match exactly. For now maybe like re.sub(r'.*&gt;(?!&lt;)', "", str) (We match as much as possible until we hit a &gt; which isn't immediately followed by a &lt;)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Winner winner chicken dinner Fred! The look ahead functionality of regex is very confusing to me. I've read some stuff on-line but cannot wrap my head around it. Thanks.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Did this already. Remnants of the xml tags remain in the parser output.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MSanders If the xml is valid, then you could post an example of the xml that is giving you trouble and we may be able to help.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The xml has a lot of sensitive info in it (SSN, account numbers, etc). The time it would take to redact/remove this info would be insane.</span>
