<p>Hi have python program in which a start method is defined, in start method i am calling a win32serviceutil.StartService(service) method to start a service, like  </p>
<pre><code>import os, platform, subprocess

try:
    import win32serviceutil
except:
    os.system("pip install pywin32")
    os.system("pip install pypiwin32")
    import win32serviceutil

OS = platform.system() #will get you the platform/OS
print("You are using ", OS)

if __name__=='__main__':

    service = 'WSearch'
    def startByCLI():
        cmd = 'net start '+service
        os.system(cmd)

    def startByPython():
        # subprocess.check_output(["sc", "start", service], stderr=subprocess.STDOUT)
        win32serviceutil.StartService(service)

    if OS=='Windows':
        try:
            output = startByPython()
        except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
            print(e.output)
            print(e.returncode)
            #os.system('python test2.py')
            subprocess.call("python ./install.py asadmin", shell=True)
            startByCLI()
</code></pre>
<p>so what i actually want is i want to run the start method from command promt like this </p>
<pre><code>python ./myfile.py startByPython
</code></pre>
<p>and it will trigger the <code>startByPython</code> method in <code>myfile.py</code></p>
<p>many thanks in advance</p>

<p>Hey all thanks for your attention,
i wanted to run my file.py file with argument from command line like:</p>
<p>$ /usr/bin/python myfile.py start</p>
<p>i got the solution which is</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>  def main():
   # read arguments from the command line and 
   # check whether at least two elements were entered
   if len(sys.argv) &lt; 2:
      print "Usage: python aws.py {start|stop}\n"
      sys.exit(0)
   else:
      action = sys.argv[1] 
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>   if action == "start":
      startInstance()
   elif action == "stop":
      stopInstance()
   else:
      print "Usage: python aws.py {start|stop}\n"
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">What <i>exactly</i> is your question? What did you try and what did not work? Does your script actually call <code>start</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">you must use pyinstaller or py2exe to make it into an executable... or you need to right click any python file and select "open with" and check the always open with box, and select python as the program to open with ... all "start XXXX" does is tell the operating system to run that thing with its default program handler</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@JoranBeasley would <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/stdlib.html#command-line-arguments" rel="nofollow noreferrer">command-line-arguments</a> and when given 'start' spawning the process as detached Process be enough to do it?</span>
