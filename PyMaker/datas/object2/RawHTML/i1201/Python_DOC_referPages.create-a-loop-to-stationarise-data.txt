<p>My problem is: 
Currently my code runs the dickey fuller test and differences the data if the p-value is greater than 0.05, but I need it to re-run the dickey-fuller test again and difference the data again if the p-value is still greater than 0.05, and continue doing so until the condition that the p-value is less than 0.05 is satisfied</p>
<p>I have a dataframe of time series data.  In order to determine whether it is stationary, I have performed the dickey fuller test using the following code:</p>
<pre><code>print("Results of Dickey Fuller Test")
dftest=adfuller(df['I'],autolag='AIC' )
dfoutput=pd.Series(dftest[0:4], index=['Test statistic', 'p-value', '# Lags    Used', 'Number of Observations Used'])
for key, value in dftest[4].items():
dfoutput['Critical Value (%s)' %key ]=value
</code></pre>
<p>In the Dickey Fuller test, if the p-value is greater than 0.05 this means the data is not stationary and the data can be differenced to make it stationary. 
I want to create a loop such that the dickey-fuller test is run and if the p-value is greater than 0.05, then the data is differenced and this continues until the p-value is less than 0.05.</p>
<p>This is what I have written so far:</p>
<pre><code>if dfoutput['p-value']&gt;0.05:
   df.diff()
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You might want to check up on while loops and do-while loops in general, not just python. You want the loop to continue forever until the diff results in a test &lt; 0.05. </p>
<pre><code>dftest=adfuller(df['I'], autolag='AIC')
while True:
    dfoutput=pd.Series(dftest[0:4], index=['Test statistic', 'p-value', '# Lags    Used', 'Number of Observations Used'])
    if dfoutput['p-value'] &gt; 0.05:
        df.diff()
    else:
        break
</code></pre>
<p>What if it's exactly 0.05?</p>
