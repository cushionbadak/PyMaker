<p>Django newbie here. I'm on Django 2.1 and was taking tutorials when I saw this line in the settings.py file. What exactly does this line mean? What does os.path.join do?</p>
<pre><code>STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static')
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>os.path.join()</code> joins parts of path to a complete, system independant, path.</p>
<p>On different operating systems you have different conventions of paths, for example Windows vs Linux.</p>
<p><code>os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static')</code> just joins <code>BASE_DIR</code> which is path to your base Django directory and <code>static</code>, resulting in something like <code>path/to/django/static</code>.</p>
