<p>Getting to a point with my project that I want to distribute it, so I am reading the <a href="https://packaging.python.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs</a> to better familiarize myself with all the information. Eventually I found myself looking at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/distutils/apiref.html#module-distutils.core" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>distutils.core.setup</code></a> and all the keywords associated with it and it got me wondering:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What are the keywords used for, where do they go and why do we need them?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After running <code>sdist</code> on some temporary scaffolding project, I noticed that a <code>PKG-INFO</code> appeared with some of this metadata in it. But thats the only place I could find them after running the command. There is the <code>upload</code> command (or I could use <code>twine</code>) to get the source distribution onto PyPI, so I suppose maybe its a convention used to pass information that is then parsed and loaded onto the PyPI web page for the distribution?</p>

<p>You're precisely right. Most of these keywords represent various <a href="https://packaging.python.org/specifications/core-metadata/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">core metadata</a> fields that define all Python package distributions.</p>
<p>These path of this data is roughly this:</p>
<ul>
<li>You specify the keywords to the <code>setup</code> function;</li>
<li>This is written to the <code>PKG-INFO</code> file when building a distribution;</li>
<li>When uploading, <code>twine</code> reads from <code>PKG-INFO</code> to determine all the metadata about your distribution;</li>
<li><code>twine</code> uploads this metadata along with your <code>.zip</code>, <code>.tar.gz</code> or <code>.whl</code> file</li>
<li>PyPI stores this metadata in it's database for your project.</li>
</ul>

<span class="comment-copy">@chryss No I did not</span>
<span class="comment-copy">OK, apologies for the implication! Good luck.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@chryss Do you have an answer that perhaps fits this?</span>
