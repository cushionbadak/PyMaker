<p>Why doesn't pip make logs of which version of which lib was installed when? If you update a library to a broken version then what? How do you know which version is not broken?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>When you run the pip, you can specify the logfile. This way you can track the installation logs in future.</p>
<pre><code>pip install pylint --log LOG_FILE
</code></pre>
<p>Or you can set it in your pip.conf to be enabled by default:</p>
<pre><code>[global]
log = &lt;path&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Hope this helps.However this is not exactly what you asked. This is just to help achieve that.

<span class="comment-copy">How do you know which version is not broken? You test them. If you upgrade a library to a broken version? Upgrade (or downgrade) to a working one.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Old version is obviously not broken. Any idea why I talk about <b>logs</b>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ideally, it would be recorded in your <code>requirements.txt</code>. Why is it <code>pip</code>'s responsibility to track things for you? Anyway, if you want a log, you can get it via <code>--log</code> option to <code>pip</code>; but it does not make one by default.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Amadan Because it can do it? What requirements? I just made pip install -U</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That's not an ideal way to use Python packages, pretty much exactly because of what happened to you. Take a look at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">virtual environments</a> (or <a href="https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>virtualenv</code></a> before Python 3.6) and <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#requirements-files" rel="nofollow noreferrer">requirements files</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I want it to be done authomatically. Will it record which library is upgraded from which version to which?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">then you prefer the enable by default method. It will log those messages which comes when you run pip in verbose mode. So, definetely you need to dig the log to understand as it may not be in format and clear in which you want.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Better than nothing. Where is that conf on windows? And what if I have different pythons?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Don't quite get, so output from all python installations will be merged to one file, without any hint about version/path?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">run the pip command in verbose mode. It will display everything even errors those things will come to this file. So, it has all info you need.</span>
