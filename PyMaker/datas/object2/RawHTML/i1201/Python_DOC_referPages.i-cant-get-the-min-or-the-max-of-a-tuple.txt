<p>This is what it outputs</p>
<pre><code>Enter the price of the sweet: 10
Enter the price of the sweet: 20
Enter the price of the sweet: 30
Enter the price of the sweet: 40
Enter the price of the sweet: 50
[['1', '0'], ['2', '0'], ['3', '0'], ['4', '0'], ['5', '0']]
The most expensive sweet is ['5', '0']
The least expensive sweet is['1', '0']

</code></pre>
<p>I have managed to get to that stage but i'm still having issues as for some reason it is separating the values in the array.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code># omitted part
try:
    price = list(input("Enter the price of the sweet: "))
except ValueError:
    print("Enter an integer")
</code></pre>
<p>Here you change <code>str</code> applying <code>list</code> to it. For example, </p>
<pre><code>read_value = '1234'
list(read_value)
Out:
['1', '2', '3', '4']  # type: list of str
</code></pre>
<p>To fix this issue, use <code>int</code>: </p>
<pre><code># omitted part
try:
    price = int(input("Enter the price of the sweet: "))
except ValueError:
    print("Enter an integer")
</code></pre>
<p>For single input,</p>
<pre><code>read_value = '1234'
int(read_value)
Out:
1234  # type: int
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You are using <code>max</code> function, which expects an iterable or more than two arguments to select the higher value as its definition says: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Return the largest item in an iterable or the largest of two or more arguments", </p>
</blockquote>
<p>But you are passing an integer</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Python is telling you the problem, total_price is not iterable because it's an int, it's like asking what max(7) is. You probably want to do something like store all 5 inputs in some array and then call sum, max, min on that array.</p>
<p>Example --</p>
<pre><code>A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(max(A)) # 5
print(min(A)) # 1
print(sum(A)) # 15
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you store the prices in a list, which is iterable, you can then find the price of the most expensive sweet. Such as: </p>
<pre><code>prices = []
for i in range(5):
   try:
      sweet_price = int(input("Enter price: "))
   except ValueError:
      print("ErrorMessage")
   prices.append(sweet_price)

highest_price = max(prices)
</code></pre>
<p>See <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#max" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#max</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>For finding max in tuple, such as the title suggests, try <code>max(list(prices))</code></p>

<span class="comment-copy">if i were to store it in an array how would i go about doing that?</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>prices = [] prices.append(some_value)</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">i have tried this but for some reason it is separating the values in the array. I've updated my original post with what i've got currently.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Could you please add some examples to improve your answer?</span>
