<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>My logins() sub routine will continue to carry out both the else and elif parts after it has found a login and has verified the password. I cant seem to understand why its doing this but is really halting my progress.

<pre><code>def login ():
Username_Input = input("Please enter your username : ")
logins = open("logins.csv","r")
List_Information = list(csv.reader(logins))
for x in List_Information:# loops through all lists
    if x[0] != Username_Input :
        print("Username not found please register ")
        register () 
    else:
        Password_Input = input("Username found please enter your password : ")
        for x in List_Information:
            if x[1] == Password_Input :
                print("Loged in lets get this game going. ")
                game()
            else :
                print("nope sorry password not found lets go back to the menu : ")
                Menu()
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>After it has found the correct password it will continue going through the List_information after calling game(). The call to game() would not stop the looping and thus it finds the next user from the List_information and say that the password was wrong.</p>
<p>You should be finding the correct entry from the List_information (based on the username) and the check the password against that entry. Now you are basically only comparing the first element in the List_information.</p>
<p>Something like this:</p>
<pre><code>user = None
for x in List_information:
  if x[0] == Username_input:
    user = x
if user == None:
  print("Username not found please register ")
  register ()
else:
  Password_Input = input("Username found please enter your password : ")
  if user[1] == Password_input:
    game()
  else:
    Menu()
</code></pre>
