<p>Is there a good way to check a form input using regex to make sure it is a proper style email address? Been searching since last night and everybody that has answered peoples questions regarding this topic also seems to have problems with it if it is a subdomained email address.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>There is no point. Even if you can verify that the email address is syntactically valid, you'll still need to check that it was not mistyped, and that it actually goes to the person you think it does. The only way to do that is to send them an email and have them click a link to verify.</p>
<p>Therefore, a most basic check (e.g. that they didn't accidentally entered their street address) is usually enough. Something like: it has exactly one <code>@</code> sign, and at least one <code>.</code> in the part after the <code>@</code>:</p>
<pre><code>[^@]+@[^@]+\.[^@]+
</code></pre>
<p>You'd probably also want to disallow whitespace -- there are probably valid email addresses with whitespace in them, but I've never seen one, so the odds of this being a user error are on your side.</p>
<p>If you want the full check, have a look at <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/201323/using-a-regular-expression-to-validate-an-email-address">this question</a>.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Update: Here's how you could use any such regex:</p>
<pre><code>import re

if not re.match(r"... regex here ...", email):
  # whatever
</code></pre>
<p>Python ≥3.4 has <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.fullmatch" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>re.fullmatch</code></a> which is preferable to <code>re.match</code>.</p>
<p>Note the <code>r</code> in front of the string; this way, you won't need to escape things twice.</p>
<p>If you have a large number of regexes to check, it might be faster to compile the regex first:</p>
<pre><code>import re

EMAIL_REGEX = re.compile(r"... regex here ...")

if not EMAIL_REGEX.match(email):
  # whatever
</code></pre>
<hr/>
<p>Another option is to use the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8022530/python-check-for-valid-email-address/28982264#28982264"><code>validate_email</code></a> package, which actually contacts the SMTP server to verify that the address exists. This still doesn't guarantee that it belongs to the right person, though.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The Python standard library comes with an e-mail parsing function: <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/email.util.html#email.utils.parseaddr" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>email.utils.parseaddr()</code></a>.</p>
<p>It returns a two-tuple containing the real name and the actual address parts of the e-mail:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from email.utils import parseaddr
&gt;&gt;&gt; parseaddr('foo@example.com')
('', 'foo@example.com')

&gt;&gt;&gt; parseaddr('Full Name &lt;full@example.com&gt;')
('Full Name', 'full@example.com')

&gt;&gt;&gt; parseaddr('"Full Name with quotes and &lt;weird@chars.com&gt;" &lt;weird@example.com&gt;')
('Full Name with quotes and &lt;weird@chars.com&gt;', 'weird@example.com')
</code></pre>
<p>And if the parsing is unsuccessful, it returns a two-tuple of empty strings:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; parseaddr('[invalid!email]')
('', '')
</code></pre>
<p>An issue with this parser is that it's accepting of anything that is considered as a valid e-mail address for RFC-822 and friends, including many things that are clearly not addressable on the wide Internet:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; parseaddr('invalid@example,com') # notice the comma
('', 'invalid@example')

&gt;&gt;&gt; parseaddr('invalid-email')
('', 'invalid-email')
</code></pre>
<p>So, as @TokenMacGuy put it, the only definitive way of checking an e-mail address is to send an e-mail to the expected address and wait for the user to act on the information inside the message.</p>
<p>However, you might want to check for, at least, the presence of an @-sign on the second tuple element, as @bvukelic suggests:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; '@' in parseaddr("invalid-email")[1]
False
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to go a step further, you can install the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/dnspython/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">dnspython</a> project and resolve the mail servers for the e-mail domain (the part after the '@'), only trying to send an e-mail if there are actual <code>MX</code> servers:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from dns.resolver import query
&gt;&gt;&gt; domain = 'foo@bar@google.com'.rsplit('@', 1)[-1]
&gt;&gt;&gt; bool(query(domain, 'MX'))
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; query('example.com', 'MX')
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
  [...]
dns.resolver.NoAnswer
&gt;&gt;&gt; query('not-a-domain', 'MX')
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
  [...]
dns.resolver.NXDOMAIN
</code></pre>
<p>You can catch both <code>NoAnswer</code> and <code>NXDOMAIN</code> by catching <code>dns.exception.DNSException</code>.</p>
<p>And Yes, <code>foo@bar@google.com</code> is a syntactically valid address. Only the last <code>@</code> should be considered for detecting where the domain part starts.</p>

<p>I haven't seen the answer already here among the mess of custom Regex answers, but...</p>
<p>There exists a python library called <strong><a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/validate_email" rel="nofollow noreferrer">validate_email</a></strong> which has 3 levels of email validation, including asking a valid SMTP server if the email address is valid (without sending an email).</p>
<p>Check email string is valid format:</p>
<pre><code>from validate_email import validate_email
is_valid = validate_email('example@example.com')
</code></pre>
<p>Check if the host has SMTP Server:</p>
<pre><code>is_valid = validate_email('example@example.com',check_mx=True)
</code></pre>
<p>Check if the host has SMTP Server and the email really exists:</p>
<pre><code>is_valid = validate_email('example@example.com',verify=True)
</code></pre>
<hr/>
<p>For those interested in the dirty details, validate_email.py (<a href="https://github.com/syrusakbary/validate_email/blob/master/validate_email.py" rel="nofollow noreferrer">source</a>) aims to be faithful to <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2822.txt" rel="nofollow noreferrer">RFC 2822</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All we are really doing is comparing the input string to one
  gigantic regular expression.  But building that regexp, and
  ensuring its correctness, is made much easier by assembling it
  from the "tokens" defined by the RFC.  Each of these tokens is
  tested in the accompanying unit test file.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr/>
<p>To install with pip</p>
<pre><code>pip install validate_email
</code></pre>
<p>and you'll need the pyDNS module for checking SMTP servers</p>
<pre><code>pip install pyDNS
</code></pre>
<p>or from Ubuntu</p>

<p>Email addresses are not as simple as they seem!  For example, Bob_O'Reilly+tag@example.com, is a valid email address.</p>
<p>I've had some luck with the lepl package (<a href="http://www.acooke.org/lepl/">http://www.acooke.org/lepl/</a>).  It can validate email addresses as indicated in RFC 3696: <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc3696.html">http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc3696.html</a></p>

<p>I see a lot of complicated answers here.  Some of them, fail to knowledge simple, true email address, or have false positives.  Below, is the simplest way of testing that the string would be a valid email.  It tests against 2 and 3 letter TLD's.  Now that you technically can have larger ones, you may wish to increase the 3 to 4, 5 or even 10.</p>

<p>This is typically solved using regex. There are many variations of solutions however. Depending on how strict you need to be, and if you have custom requirements for validation, or will accept any valid email address. </p>
<p>See this page for reference: <a href="http://www.regular-expressions.info/email.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.regular-expressions.info/email.html</a></p>

<p>Email addresses are incredibly complicated. Here's a sample regex that will match every RFC822-valid address:
<a href="http://www.ex-parrot.com/pdw/Mail-RFC822-Address.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ex-parrot.com/pdw/Mail-RFC822-Address.html</a></p>
<p>You'll notice that it's probably longer than the rest of your program. There are even whole modules for Perl with the purpose of validating email addresses. So you probably won't get anything that's 100% perfect as a regex while also being readable. Here's a sample recursive descent parser:
<a href="http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/ABIGAIL/RFC-RFC822-Address-2009110702/lib/RFC/RFC822/Address.pm" rel="nofollow">http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/ABIGAIL/RFC-RFC822-Address-2009110702/lib/RFC/RFC822/Address.pm</a></p>

<p>If you want to take out the mail from a long string or file Then try this. </p>
<pre><code>([^@|\s]+@[^@]+\.[^@|\s]+)

<p>Note, this will work when you have a space before and after your email-address. if you don't have space or have some special chars then you may try modifying it.</p>
<p>Working example:</p>
<pre><code>string="Hello ABCD, here is my mail id example@me.com "
res = re.search("([^@|\s]+@[^@]+\.[^@|\s]+)",string,re.I)
res.group(1)

<p>The only really accurate way of distinguishing real, valid email addresses from invalid ones is to <em>send mail to it</em>.  What counts as an email is surprisingly convoluted (<code>"John Doe" &lt;john.doe@example.com&gt;"</code> actually is a valid email address), and you most likely want the email address to actually send mail to it later.  After it passes some basic sanity checks (such as in Thomas's answer, has an <code>@</code> and at least one <code>.</code> after the <code>@</code>), you should probably just send an email verification letter to the address, and wait for the user to follow a link embedded in the message to confirm that the email was valid.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">So than basically my best bet would be <code>if not re.match("[^@]+@[^@]+\.[^@]+", email):</code> ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I ended up doing <code>if not re.match(r"^[A-Za-z0-9\.\+_-]+@[A-Za-z0-9\._-]+\.[a-zA-Z]*$", email):</code> as this seem the most plausible scenario followed by sending an verification email to the given address.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">+1 for the quickie re.match(r"xx") tutorial. Inlining what is necessary is the mark of a good answer.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Bobby: <i>please</i> loosen that up a lot. I've had to deal with email addresses that that would filter out (e.g. with <code>/</code>, seen in a University's addresses). Another whole class that you're entirely blocking are internationalised domain names. Really, there's no good reason to block valid email addresses. I'll begrudgingly forgive people that don't allow email addresses like <code>100%." foo b@r"(this is a cool email address!)@(just a tld)com(ok)</code>, but I think the check for an <code>@</code> symbol is really all you should have (a top level domain is valid as the domain part, but it's improbable).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Making it even a little tighter.  Seems safe to limit TLD to alphanumeric right now (still haven't seen a TLD that has non-ASCII chars).  Using this now: <code>re.compile(r"[^@\s]+@[^@\s]+\.[a-zA-Z0-9]+$")</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@PeterLada: You could just check if there's a <code>@</code> in the address after using this func, though.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@PeterLada, Thanks for the input. Fixed the module name.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>parseaddr(u"evil@addr")</code> will break this.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Yajo, "break this" how?<code>evil@addr</code> is just as valid an e-mail address as <code>nonexistinglogin@valid-domain.com</code> and is treated as such by <code>parseaddr()</code>. In the end, you'll always need to try sending an e-mail to the provided address for validation.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">email.utils.parseaddr parses email address but does not validate it <code>email.utils.parseaddr('user@@host')</code> yields <code>('', 'user@')</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>sudo apt-get python3-dns</code> seems to work on Ubuntu in place of <code>sudo -H pip3 install pyDNS</code>, just for the record.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This thing returns "True" for just about anything I throw at it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Prof.Falken which of the 3 tests are you referring to (valid syntax, valid smtp, valid mailbox)?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@philshem, well, the two deeper tests supposed to go out to the mail servers, both return "None" all the time.  Don't know why, I will try to rule out that I have some kind of limitation on the network I am on. The simple test, valid syntax, I can throw just about anything to and it will say it's good syntax. I used the pip module in Python 2.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Same result as @Prof.Falken</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>lepl</code> has now been discontinued.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">For a simple use case like this, if the current version works the fact it's discontinued is not very relevant.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">this method doesn't work when u put email email''sfsf@sadasdas.adsdsa.com.com' It return true for this username too</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It seems to return False for everything I tried it with, valid or not.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The only answer here I see here.  That checks for characters allowed in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6531" rel="nofollow noreferrer">RFC 6531</a> email standards.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">also the plus sign is allowed in the username part of email</span>
<span class="comment-copy">however <code>re.match</code> is better than <code>bool(re.search)</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">That won't work for UK emails for the record, they end with <code>.co.uk</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This won't work for any TLDs that are more than 3 characters</span>
<span class="comment-copy">will this validate emails such as <code>user@department.company.com</code> (because it has 2 dots in the domain name part) ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">´re.match("([^@|\s]+@[^@]+\.[^@|\s]+)",email)´ works great</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Nice one - I think, though, the "." before the TLD needs to be escaped as "\."</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Please edit the code so the indentation is correct, remove the line numbers and press ctrl + K with the code selected to format it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Generally, answers, <i>especially</i> to regex-related questions, are much more helpful if they include a fairly detailed explanation of what the code or regex is intended to do, and why that solves the problem without introducing others. This is still more important with something that is as frankly error-prone and fiddly as email address validation; I've seen at least one regex that was <b>a full page long</b> for the purpose, and that was <i>without</i> insignificant whitespace.</span>
