<p>I am having a try of the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html" rel="noreferrer"><code>dataclasses</code></a> feature in Python 3.7, but get this warning below word 'hue':</p>
<pre><code>'hue' used before definition
Python (use-before-def)
</code></pre>
<p>I suppose it is a linter warrning. I tried several linters that python extension provided, but none of them work.</p>
<pre><code>from dataclasses import dataclass
@dataclass
class Color:
    hue: int
    lightness: float = 2.0
c = Color(2)
</code></pre>
<p>Is there a way to have syntax checking etc enabled but avoid receiving this warning?</p>
<p>warning using pep8
<img alt="warning and err" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ppVxJ.png"/></p>
<p>warning using pylint or mypy

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can set <code>"python.analysis.disabled": ["use-before-def"]</code> to disable the check (<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/settings-reference#_python-language-server-settings" rel="noreferrer">docs</a>). The mis-classification of this as an issue has been <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/python-language-server/issues/395" rel="noreferrer">reported</a>.</p>
