<p>I am trying to get Python code to work on a web browser using the CGI module, as well as some other file modules that I am trying to import into the main program.</p>
<p>My initial program, which works as required, is the following:</p>
<pre><code>#!C:\Users\Student\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37-32\python.exe

import cgi

def htmlTop():
    print("Content-type: text/html")
    print()
    print("""&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
        &lt;html lang="en"&gt;
            &lt;head&gt;
                    &lt;meta charset="utf-8"/&gt;
                    &lt;title&gt;My Server Side Test&lt;/title&gt;
            &lt;/head&gt;
            &lt;body&gt;""")

def htmlTail():
    print("""&lt;/body&gt;
    &lt;/html&gt;""")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        htmlTop()
        print("Hello World")
        htmlTail()
    except:
        cgi.print_exception()
</code></pre>
<p>In the same folder as this program, I have a Python file called "_serverTestModules" containing:</p>
<pre><code>def _serverTestFunction():
print("The file has been imported successfully")
</code></pre>
<p>If I then add:</p>
<pre><code>import _serverTestModules
</code></pre>
<p>to the original file, both of which are in the same directory, and attempt to access the function from the original code, I get this error:</p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:/xampp/htdocs/inventorysystem/_serverTest.py", line 26, in &lt;module&gt;
    _serverTestFunction()
NameError: name '_serverTestFunction' is not defined
</code></pre>
<p>So basically my test program works, but as soon as I try to import functions from other files which are in the same directory (something which I need for my main project), the code fails. Is this a problem with the computer system or the network? Every other answer I have seen on Stack Overflow has either had no answer or an incorrect answer, so any help is much appreciated.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You need to use this</p>
<pre><code>from _serverTestModules import _serverTestFunction
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Thank you so much, however my other files have many functions inside of them, is there a way to import all of the functions from a file into the main program at once? I have tried using from _serverTestModules import * however this does not work.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">you can use from _serverTestModules import *</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I tried doing that in the main file and it did not work. Any other suggestions?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">then you can go for this module <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html</a></span>
