<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>My problem is this, there is a string</p>
<pre><code>[word in IN ('hello', 'world'), key1=1100, key2=1200]
</code></pre>
<p>I need a list that would contain</p>
<pre><code>[word in IN ('hello', 'world'),
 key1=1100,
 key2=1200
]
</code></pre>
<p>Obviously splitting by comma doesn't work, so went with regular expression grouping.</p>
<pre><code>pattern= re.compile(r"(.*), [a-zA-Z]?", re.DOTALL)
string = "[word in IN ('hello', 'world'), key1=1100, key2=1200]"
for item in re.findall(pattern, string):
    print item
</code></pre>
<p>What I am trying to do is to match only the commas after which space and an alphabet would occur, but for me, it giving wrong results. </p>
<pre><code>[word in IN ('hello', 'world'), key1=1100
</code></pre>
<p>Still, it's greedy matching. Any help would be appreciated.</p>

<p>You could do <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.split" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>re.split()</code></a> with a <em>positive lookahead</em>:</p>
<pre><code>In [3]: re.split(r", (?=[a-zA-Z])", s)
Out[3]: ["[word in IN ('hello', 'world')", 'key1=1100', 'key2=1200]']
</code></pre>
