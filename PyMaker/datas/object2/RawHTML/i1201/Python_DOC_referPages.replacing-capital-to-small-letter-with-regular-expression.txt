<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I want to replace I and A with lower case, using regex. (I already coded this using sent.lower(), which works fine. I want to know how to do the same by using regex) </p>
<pre><code>import re
sent = 'hai Iam Ajay born in 1994'
re.sub(r'(\s)([A-Z])'$1\l$2',sent)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You should pass in a function as the replacement. The function will return the corresponding replacement for a given match object.</p>
<p>I think <code>\b</code> (word boundary) here is more suitable than matching a space before the capital letter.</p>
<pre><code>re.sub(r'\b[A-Z]', lambda x: x.group(0).lower(), sent)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Try harder. Flagged for low effort.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Do you want to convert every uppercase character to lower case? If so then it seems like you could just call sent.lower()?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Actually i had done the same with .lower.I want to know how to do same by using regex.Sorry for not mentioning that.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Please fix the '' quotes in your <code>re.sub</code> call, currently that's not even legal syntax, and that call doesn't have three args, you've accidentally munged the <code>pattern</code> and <code>repl</code> args together. Please make sure your code as posted here is valid syntax; read through the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html?highlight=re%20sub#re.sub" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>re.sub()</code> doc</a> for examples, and try running them.</span>
