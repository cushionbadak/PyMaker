<p>What is the purpose of using <code>[0]</code> in <code>random.choices()</code>? Does <code>[0]</code> refer to index of <code>Lists</code> or of its sub-lists in the example code below? If I use <code>[0]</code>, I get the single random word from the lists, which is the desired result, but if I omit <code>[0]</code>, it gives the random sub-list with all of its elements.</p>
<p>Why it is giving the different result for the two cases?</p>
<p>If I try <code>[1]</code> instead of <code>[0]</code>, The code gives </p>
<blockquote>
<p>index error: index out of range</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But if I use <code>[0]</code> or <code>[-1]</code>, code gives the desired result.</p>
<pre><code>import random

Animals = ["Cat", "Dog", "Lion", "Tiger", "Elephant"]
Fruits = ["Apple", "Orange", "Banana", "Mango", "Pineapple"]
Vegetables = ["Tomato", "Potato", "Onion", "Brinjal", "Peas"]

Lists = [Animals, Fruits, Vegetables]

word = random.choice(random.choices(Lists)[0])

print(word)

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You're using <code>random.choices</code> instead of <code>random.choice</code>, which returns a list with a single element instead of the element itself. See here:</p>
<pre><code>In [3]: random.choices("abc")
Out[3]: ['a']

In [4]: random.choice("abc")
Out[4]: 'b'
</code></pre>
<p>Calling <code>[0]</code> on it returns the element, while <code>[1]</code> is out of range because there's only one element. You probably wanted to use <code>random.choice</code> (without the s), right?</p>
<p>BTW, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.choices" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>random.choices</code></a> is Python 3.6+.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Your question is very unclear. Obviously doing two different things gives you two different results, why would you expect otherwise?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">To clarify for @Gurpreet: <code>[-1]</code> is the index for the last element. Since there is only one element, the first element is also the last element.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks to all especially @Felix for pointing me out the difference between random.choice() and random.choices(), where random.choice() returns a single element and random.choices() returns a list of elements.</span>
