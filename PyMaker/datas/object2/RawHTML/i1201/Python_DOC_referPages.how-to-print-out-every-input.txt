<p>I'm suppose to write a code using arrays and inputs then split the list from people above 16 and people below 16. but can't seem to get the code to print every input. it only wants to print the last input I did. Here is what I have so far:</p>
<pre><code>A = [0 for x in range (10)]
B = [0 for x in range (10)]

for i in range (10):
    A[i] = input('enter A name: ')
    B[i] = input('enter the age to go with the name: ')
    print()
    B2 = int(B[i])

if B2 &gt; 16:
    print(B2, A[i])

if B2 &lt; 16:
    print(A[2], B2)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>That is because, you are overwriting <code>B2</code> in the line <code>B2 = int(B[i])</code> at every single iteration of <code>i</code> inside the for loop ( <code>for i in range (10):</code> ) The following code should work:</p>
<pre><code>A , B = [], []

for i in range(10):
    A += [raw_input('enter A name: ')]
    B += [input('enter the age to go with the name: ')]
    print()    

for i in range(len(B)):    
    if B[i] &gt;= 16: print(B[i], A[i])        

    if B[i] &lt; 16: print(A[i], B[i]) 
</code></pre>
<p>In the above code <code>A</code> is a list which stores all the names as strings. <code>B</code> is another list which stores all ages as <code>int</code> data types.</p>
<pre><code>print A
&gt;&gt;&gt;['Name1', 'Name2', 'Name3', 'Name4', 'Name5', 'Name6', 'Name7', 'Name8', 'Name9', 'Name10']       

print B
&gt;&gt;&gt;[18, 10, 19, 5, 55, 12, 6, 66, 14, 7]

<p>Your code does ignore 16y olds and has some other problems. </p>
<p>You can either filter the input directly after input into two seperate lists (<code>under_16</code>,<code>over_15</code>) or simply throw all into one list (<code>all_studs</code>) and filter them later using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">list comprehensions</a> or <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#filter" rel="nofollow noreferrer">filter-function</a> :</p>

<p>It is because you are overwriting <code>B2</code> since the if condition is outside the for loop. Every time <code>B2</code> will get overwritten by what input user provides. I don't know what you are trying to do with the printing part . but putting it in loop should fix the problem.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">do you want to print on each input? why did you out-dent the conditions?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">put the two <code>if</code> blocks inside the <code>for</code> loop</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@PatrickArtner : I was not sure if the <code>A[2]</code> was added for some debugging. So, in my initial post, I didn't change it. I have changed it now, in the hope that it was indeed a typing error. Flipping A and B around may again be some debugging (I am not sure.) So, I didn't change that.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@PatrickArtner : I don't know if TheNuggetOf Gaming will prefer <code>if B[i] &gt;= 16:</code> over <code>if B[i] &lt;= 16:</code> . Or, if 16 year olds are intentionally left alone in the code. I did the basic minimum to identify the problem in the code, and left the philosophy of the code intact. However, I have edited the post to include <code>if B[i] &gt;= 16:</code> following your comment.</span>
