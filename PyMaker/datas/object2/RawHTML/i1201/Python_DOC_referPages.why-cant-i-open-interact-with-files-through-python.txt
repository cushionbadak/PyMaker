<p>I'm new to coding and have started to try out the OS module, it occasionally it will work on specific paths.
example:</p>
<p>but when I try to interact with an individual file this will happen:</p>
<pre><code>print(os.stat('my_file.txt'))

&gt;&gt;&gt;filenotfounderror: [errno 2] no such file or directory found. 
'my_file.txt'
</code></pre>
<p>or when I try to interact with a path that is not in my cwd then this would happen:</p>
<pre><code>print(os.listdir(C:\folder\folder\folder))

&gt;&gt;&gt;SyntaxError: (unicode error) 'unicodeescape' codec can't decode bytes in 
position 2-3: truncated \UXXXXXXXX escape
</code></pre>
<p>I don't understand why this is happening and it would be great if someone could explain why this is happening, thanks.</p>

<p>Python tells your that <code>my_file.txt</code> does not exist in the current directory in your first example.</p>
<p>Verify that you have a file called <code>my_file.txt</code> and then check the current working directory of your python process with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.getcwd" rel="nofollow noreferrer">os.getcwd()</a>.</p>
<p>For your second example, in python the backslash <code>\</code> is a special character for <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#string-and-bytes-literals" rel="nofollow noreferrer">escape sequences in a string</a>. For example the linefeed <code>\n</code> or the tab <code>\t</code>.</p>
<p>The error in your example is most likely the result of accidentaly forming an invalid escape sequence by not escaping the backslash itself like this:</p>
<pre><code>print(os.listdir('C:\\folder\\folder\\folder'))
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">You don't have quotes around <code>C:\folder\folder\folder</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">whoops, i just missed that when writing the question but this was not in the script. thanks anyway</span>
<span class="comment-copy">my_file.txt is just an example file just as \folder\folder\folder is. but yes i do have the correct file name in my script. ahhhhh so i have to change my cwd using os.chdir and then i can access the file within that directory. the double back slash also worked. thanks allot for the help</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@BOBTHEBUILDER Or you can use the full path of <code>my_file.txt</code> instead of changing directory.</span>
