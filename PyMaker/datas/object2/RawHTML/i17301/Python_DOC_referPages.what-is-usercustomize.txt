<p>I have seen many mentions of usercustomize throughout the docs. What is it exactly?</p>
<p>I am on Ubuntu 12.0, Python 3.3, using the IDLE interpreter. </p>
<p>Adding a <code>'usercustomize.py'</code> file to <code>/usr/lib/python3.3</code> with the following code in it:</p>
<pre><code>import math
</code></pre>
<p>I started the IDLE interpreter. Without importing math, I typed <code>math.sqrt(</code> </p>
<p>Typing Ctrl + \ to start the auto complete suggestion, I get a prompt like <code>sqrt(x)</code>. This suggests that math in fact has been imported. But actually calling the function raises <code>NameError</code>. </p>
<p>What exactly <em>is</em> going on here?</p>

<p>See the <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/site.html" rel="nofollow"><code>site</code> module</a> for full documenation on what <code>usercustomize</code> is meant to do.</p>
<p>Note that <code>usercustomize</code> is only imported if <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/site.html#site.ENABLE_USER_SITE" rel="nofollow"><code>site.ENABLE_USER_SITE</code></a> is enabled:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After this, an attempt is made to import a module named <code>usercustomize</code>, which can perform arbitrary user-specific customizations, if <code>ENABLE_USER_SITE</code> is true. This file is intended to be created in the user site-packages directory (see below), which is part of <code>sys.path</code> unless disabled by <code>-s</code>. An <code>ImportError</code> will be silently ignored.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Importing <code>math</code> into <code>usercustomize</code> will <strong>not</strong> make it available in IDLE; you are not making it a built-in that way. You could add it to the <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/builtins.html" rel="nofollow"><code>builtins</code> module</a>, but I'd advice against that.</p>
<p><code>usercustomize</code> is not meant to set up a default IDLE environment, it is meant to add extra entries to the <code>sys.path</code> module search path and other general Python runtime environment changes.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I wasn't trying to add math as a builtin though. I don't see any practical reason, I was just trying to figure out what usercustomize can do. :)</span>
