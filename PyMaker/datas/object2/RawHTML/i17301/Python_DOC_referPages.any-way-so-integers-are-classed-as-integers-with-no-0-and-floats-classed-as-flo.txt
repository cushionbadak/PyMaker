<p>So. In my program I have a part where I check whether the result of a division sum is an integer or not. For example, <code>6 / 3 = 2</code> (True) or <code>7 / 3 = 1.66</code> (False). The problem is that when I do a division like <code>6 / 3</code>, the result that should be an integer is classed as a float because it comes out as <code>2.0</code> instead of <code>2</code>. Is there any way so that decimal/float answers are classed as floats with a decimal point, and integer answers are classed as an integer? (The number without the .0 at the end)</p>
<p>I have this now:</p>
<pre><code>6 / 3 = 2.0 (float)    
7 / 3 = 1.66 (float)
</code></pre>
<p>I want this:</p>
<pre><code>6 / 3 = 2 (integer)    
7 / 3 = 1.66 (float)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Just use <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=is_integer#float.is_integer" rel="nofollow"><code>float.is_integer()</code></a>.</p>
<p>For example, as expressed by OP:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; num1 = 6 / 3  # 2.0
&gt;&gt;&gt; num1.is_integer()
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; num2 = 7 / 3  # 2.33
&gt;&gt;&gt; num2.is_integer()
False
</code></pre>
<p>No need for anything complex here- and implementing this into your function should be easy.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Does 7 / 3 * 3 = 7?</p>
<pre><code>return ((n1 // n2 * n2) == n1)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">I don't understand your question to my <code>deleted</code> answer, @AlexThornton. My answer was correct, it just had incorrect syntaxing (which I fixed before it was delted). OP was asking how to detect when the result of a division resulted in an integer with no remainder. I think that you calling for people to flag my answer for deletion was uncalled for.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">This only works when <code>/</code> is integer division, which it is not in Python 3.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You're right, @jwodder. In python3 you have to use <code>//</code>. You also need to encapsulate the expression in parens for it to actually work. I fixed my answer. I answered with bad syntax from my phone. Maybe I'll avoid doing that going forward.</span>
