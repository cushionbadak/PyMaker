<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>With this code: </p>
<pre><code>def createWordList(filename):
    file=open(filename,'r')
    s=file.read()
    file.close()
    L=s.split()
    return L
</code></pre>
<p>And this text file: <a href="http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~buoni/cs8/labs/lab05/wordlist.txt" rel="nofollow">http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~buoni/cs8/labs/lab05/wordlist.txt</a></p>
<p>I am to return a list of all the words in the text file.
But when the function is called a la:</p>
<pre><code>createWordList('wordlist.txt') 
</code></pre>
<p>My computer (core-i5) takes about 5-10 minutes to perform the task and then ultimately freezes.
It can return the string of individual words in about 2 seconds though.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>f=open('wordlist.txt','r+')
listofwords=[]
for line in f:
    listofwords.append(line)
print(listofwords)
</code></pre>
<p>I faced no problem. took exactly 0.049 sec to form the list(process program without print). printing will take lot of time.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The 'file' object is a iterable, and you can iterate it with a 'for' stament.  This is more memory efficient.  Read this: <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#methods-of-file-objects" rel="nofollow">Methods of File Objects</a></p>
<p>So, try this code:</p>
<pre><code>def createWordList(filename):
    myList = []
    input_file = open(filename, mode='r')
    for line in input_file:
        myList.append(line)
    return myList
</code></pre>
<p><strong>How works:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>First, create the empty list.</li>
<li>Open the input_file.</li>
<li>Iterates the file object line by line.</li>
<li>Append each line to the list.</li>
<li>Then, return the list.</li>
</ul>
<p>It takes no more than 3 seconds in process the whole file.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Are you trying to <code>print</code> the result?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Are you sure this is the part that freezes? Your word file is less than a megabyte. It should fit into memory just fine. What output do you get?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">(That is to say, do you get any output before it freezes, and if so, what is the output?)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm trying to have it return a List of all individual words. It actually does seem to do that, after about 5-10 minutes IDLE gives me the List, but through that whole time IDLE is un-responsive, and it remains so even after it returns the list. It is also not using all my RAM.</span>
