<p>In the main script, I want to stop it under some condition. I tried <code>return</code> but it is wrong since it is outside the function. I tried <code>exit</code>, but it does not stop. See the following: </p>
<pre><code>print 'step 1'
exit
print 'step 2'
</code></pre>
<p>what should I do ? 
the version I used is IDLE 2.7.5+</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>use <code>exit()</code></p>
<pre><code>from sys import exit
print 'step 1'
exit()
print 'step 2'
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you're not in a function, use <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/sys.html#sys.exit" rel="nofollow"><code>sys.exit()</code></a></p>
<p>Note that this will exit python <strong>entirely,</strong> even if called from a module that's inside a larger program.</p>
<p>It will usually be better organization to <code>return</code> from a function, and keep as much code inside functions as possible.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Another way to exit a Python script is to simply raise the <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#SystemExit" rel="nofollow"><code>SystemExit</code></a> exception with <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement" rel="nofollow"><code>raise</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>print 'step 1'
raise SystemExit
print 'step 2'
</code></pre>
<p>This solution does exactly what <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.exit" rel="nofollow"><code>sys.exit</code></a> does, except that you do not need to import <code>sys</code> first.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Also, your specific problem was caused by the fact that you were not actually calling the <code>exit</code> function:</p>
<pre><code>print 'step 1'
exit() # Add () after exit to call the function
print 'step 2'
</code></pre>
<p>However, you should not use this solution because it is considered a bad practice.  Instead, you should use <code>sys.exit</code> or <code>raise</code> as shown above.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Actually you shouldnâ€™t have code outside functions. The established convention is that the only code outside functions (except for declarations) should be a call to a <code>main</code> function: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/419163">What does <code>if __name__ == "__main__":</code> do?</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is great. Thanks !</span>
