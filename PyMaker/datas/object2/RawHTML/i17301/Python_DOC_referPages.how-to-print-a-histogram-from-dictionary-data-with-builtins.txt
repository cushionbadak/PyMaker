<p>Hello I am new to python and need to print a graph with the following data:</p>
<p>The height of each bar being the count of each type of word. lets assume we had three buckets (a,b, and c) and in each we had a number of apples:</p>
<pre><code>  a - 1
  b - 3
  c - 2
</code></pre>
<p>So if we were to chart this out it might look something like:</p>
<pre><code>  3_x_
  2_xx
  1xxx
  .abc
</code></pre>
<p>use '_' as a place holder for the cell that does not have any data and 'x' as the marker for data. How can I draw a graph from this data? </p>

<p>If you're new to Python, I highly recommend poking around their library documentation: <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/" rel="nofollow">http://docs.python.org/3/library/</a>. Here's some code for this problem specifically:</p>
<pre><code>def chart(dictionary):
    height = max(dictionary.values())      # Figures out how tall the diagram needs
    for i in range(height):                # to be, then loops once per level.
            current_height = height - i          # Next line creates a string 
        s = "{0}".format(current_height)         # containing the height number.
        for value in dictionary.values():         # This loop decides for each entry
            if value &gt;= current_height:           # whether to use a 'x' or a '_'.
                s += 'x'
            else:
                s += '_'
        print(s)
    s = '.'                          # These two lines create the lowermost string
    for key in dictionary.keys():    # with labels.
        s += key
    print(s)
</code></pre>
<p>This code is very specialized for the above problem, but it should give you a good idea of where you need to go.</p>
