<p>In Python code, what is the canonical way of dealing with well-known acronyms when naming classes, methods and variables?</p>
<p>Consider, for example, a class dealing with RSS feeds. Would that rather be this:</p>
<pre><code>class RSSClassOne:
    def RSSMethod(self):
        self.RSS_variable = True

class ClassRSSTwo:
    def MethodRSS(self):
        self.variable_RSS = True
</code></pre>
<p>or this:</p>
<pre><code>class RssClassOne:
    def rssMethod(self):
        self.rss_variable = True

class ClassRssTwo:
    def MethodRss(self):
        self.variable_rss = True
</code></pre>
<p>I.e. what is more important, keeping the acronym capitalization or the recommendations of PEP 008?</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> from the answers, I conclude that this would be the way to go:</p>
<pre><code>class RSSClassOne:
    def rss_method(self):
        self.rss_variable = True

class ClassRSSTwo:
    def method_rss(self):
        self.variable_rss = True
</code></pre>

<p>Well, it turns out that PEP 8 already has this topic covered <a href="http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#descriptive-naming-styles" rel="noreferrer">here</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: When using abbreviations in CapWords, capitalize all the letters
  of the abbreviation. Thus <code>HTTPServerError</code> is better than
  <code>HttpServerError</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, the Python convention for names containing acronyms is:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Keep acronyms uppercase in class names (usually, the only part of Python that uses CapWords).</p></li>
<li><p>Everywhere else, make them lowercase in order to comply with the other <a href="http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#naming-conventions" rel="noreferrer">naming conventions</a>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Below is a demonstration with the <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/ipaddress.html" rel="noreferrer"><code>ipaddress</code> module</a>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import ipaddress  # IP is lowercase because this is a module
&gt;&gt;&gt; ipaddress.IPv4Address  # IP is uppercase because this is a class
&lt;class 'ipaddress.IPv4Address'&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; ipaddress.ip_network  # IP is lowercase because this is a function
&lt;function ip_network at 0x0242C468&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I don't think that there is anything wrong with the first one at all. As an acronym represents a series of words and in Python <code>class</code> names you do <code>CamelCase</code> at the start of each word, it is perfectly OK to capitalise each letter (word) in the acronym. </p>
<p>The first code example, therefore conforms to the style guide for Python code probably more than the second. In short, the first one because <a href="http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" rel="nofollow">PEP8</a> conformation <strong><em>is</em></strong> extremely important. :)</p>
<p>Bear in mind also that there are <em>sometimes</em> (albeit very rarely) instances in which these rules can be bent slightly. This could be considered one of them.</p>

<p>I would say that following the recommendation in PEP 8 is the first thing to do related to coding style.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">If you would like to work on open-source projects, you should definitely work with pep8. Other than that, keep classes Capilatized and method names with snake_case...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Naming conventions become non-trivial when you apply tools like pylint to the development process.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Good example. What about method names? PEP8 says it should be words_with_underscores. I would normally write my_rss_method()</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I would recommend adding this observation to the answer. Both examples provided on the question have faulty method names.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Actually, I just found a PEP 8 excerpt that explains exactly what to do in this situation.  So, I'll go with that instead.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">True about the faulty method names, I have been looking too long at Twisted. Learned something new, thanks.</span>
