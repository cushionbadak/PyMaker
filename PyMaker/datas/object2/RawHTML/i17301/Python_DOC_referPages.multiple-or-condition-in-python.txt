<p>I have a little code issue and it works with IDLE and not with Eclipse, can I write this :</p>
<pre><code>if  fields[9] != ('A' or 'D' or 'E' or 'N' or 'R'):
</code></pre>
<p>instead of this :</p>
<pre><code>if  fields[9] != 'A' and fields[9] != 'D' and fields[9] != 'E' and fields[9] != 'N' and fields[9] != 'R':
</code></pre>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Use <code>not in</code> and a sequence:</p>
<pre><code>if fields[9] not in ('A', 'D', 'E', 'N', 'R'):
</code></pre>
<p>which tests against a tuple, which Python will conveniently and efficiently store as one constant. You could also use a set literal:</p>
<pre><code>if fields[9] not in {'A', 'D', 'E', 'N', 'R'}:
</code></pre>
<p>but only more recent versions of Python (<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.2.html#optimizations" rel="noreferrer">Python 3.2</a> and newer) will recognise this as an immutable constant. This is the fastest option for newer code.</p>
<p>Because this is one character, you could even use a string:</p>
<pre><code>if fields[9] not in 'ADENR':
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You want the <code>in</code> operator:</p>
<pre><code>if fields[9] not in 'ADENR':
    ...
</code></pre>
<p>Or, you could use <code>any</code>:</p>
<pre><code>if not any(fields[9] == c for c in 'ADENR'):
    ...
</code></pre>
<p>Or, alternatively, <code>all</code>, which may have a bit more of the same form as the original:</p>
<pre><code>if all(fields[9] != c for c in 'ADENR'):
    ...
</code></pre>
<hr/>
<p>As an aside:</p>
<pre><code>if x != ('A' or 'B' or 'C'):
</code></pre>
<p>is really the same thing as saying:</p>
<pre><code>if x != 'A':
</code></pre>
<p>because <code>'A' or 'B' or 'C'</code> evaluates to <code>'A'</code> (Try it!).  The reason is because with <code>or</code>, python will return the first "non-falsey" value (or the last one if they're all falsey).  Since non-empty strings are non-falsey, the first one gets returned.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">What is it that you think <code>('A' or 'D' or 'E' or 'N' or 'R')</code> <i>means</i> to the python interpreter?  You're probably getting unexpected results because of an invalid expectation on your part.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">These are two extremely different things. The first one is equivalent to <code>if fields[9] != 'A'</code> due to short circuiting of the <code>or</code> operator...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Also, could the brainless upvoters please stop? A variation of this question is asked every day here, and in general the question shows a lack of research and debugging. It's definitely not worth two upvotes; questions like this shouldn't exactly be encouraged...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@l4mpi easy, maybe just because the OP doesn't know how to search with exact keywords. people like me who's not native English speakers ;P</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@zhangxaochen I agree with you that there's no reason to bash OP for it, but it should never be a reason for an upvote as it actively encourages low-quality content like this. This is why I called the <i>upvoters</i> brainless and not OP... Why should anyone bother researching or debugging if one can just post a question here, get instant answers and even get reputation for it? Regarding native/non-native english speakers, I'm not a native speaker either but don't think it's a huge difference - it's mostly a matter of learning technical terminology where natives don't have a huge advantage IMO.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Come on people, please let the answerer know what is wrong with the answer and this is a perfectly valid answer.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@thefourtheye -- Thanks.  I was very much wondering what was wrong with it as well ... I checked it 3 times and I thought my logic was OK ... ;-)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Infact this is short but sweet answer. Looks like someone is in downvote spree, just now saw a correct answer downvoted in other question, and here yours and Martijns :'(</span>
<span class="comment-copy">For what it's worth, someone downvoted mine too. There are some clueless people about today.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MartijnPieters -- I suppose we're just storing up some good karma for ourselves later.</span>
