<p>I've seen the term <code>__loader__</code> floating around some Python files and I can't find any documentation on it aside from a few brief descriptions about it's purpose, but they still don't provide enough information for me to get a good understanding of it. All I know is that it has something to do with importing modules, other than that I'm completely at a loss. What does it do? When is it used? How can I use it if at all?</p>

<p>What is <code>__loader__</code>?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><code>__loader__</code> is an attribute that is set on an imported module by its loader.  Accessing it should return the loader object itself.</p>
<p>In Python versions before 3.3, <code>__loader__</code> was not set by the built-in import machinery.   Instead, this attribute was only available on modules that were imported using a custom loader.</p>
<p>However, this functionality changed in Python 3.3 because of <a href="http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0302/">PEP 0302</a>.  Now, <code>__loader__</code> is available on every module that is imported:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; # Python 3.3 interpreter
&gt;&gt;&gt; import os
&gt;&gt;&gt; os.__loader__
&lt;_frozen_importlib.SourceFileLoader object at 0x01F86370&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>What is a loader?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-loader">loader</a> is an object that is returned by a finder. It uses its <code>load_module()</code> method to load a module into memory.  <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.abc.Loader"><code>importlib.abc.Loader</code></a> is an example of an abstract base class for a loader.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>A <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-finder">finder</a> is an object that uses its <code>find_module()</code> method to try and find the loader for a module.  <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.abc.Finder"><code>importlib.abc.Finder</code></a> is an example of an abstract base class for a finder.  Note however that it is deprecated in favor of <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.abc.MetaPathFinder"><code>importlib.abc.MetaPathFinder</code></a> and <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.abc.PathEntryFinder"><code>importlib.abc.PathEntryFinder</code></a>.</p>

<p>How can I use it, if at all?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The main use of <code>__loader__</code> is for introspection.  However, there are two other common uses:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><code>__loader__</code> may be used to gather data on a specific module's loader.</p></li>
<li><p>In Python versions before 3.3, <code>__loader__</code> could be used with <code>hasattr</code> to check whether or not a module was imported with the built-in import machinery:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; # Python 3.2 interpreter
&gt;&gt;&gt; import os
&gt;&gt;&gt; hasattr(os, '__loader__')
False
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>If <code>hasattr(os, '__loader__')</code> had returned <code>True</code>, it would mean that the <code>os</code> module was imported using a custom loader.  Since it did not, it means that the module was imported using the built-in import machinery.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> The above test will not work in Python 3.3+ because of the changes made by PEP 0302.</p></li>
</ol>

<span class="comment-copy">I dunno ... where have you seen it? this is the first ive ever seen something like that ...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I saw it in the built-in module <code>linecache</code>, which I in turn saw from <code>traceback</code>.</span>
