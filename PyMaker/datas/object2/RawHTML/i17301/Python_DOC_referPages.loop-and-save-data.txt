<p>Actually, I am new in Python, so I need more help to handle my data. The next step is make loop for a month data from daily data (one day one file). And then make the variables (numeric) resulted from this program as a new array and save those as a file. Thank you in advance.</p>

<p>You can add each of the files i.e., <code>A1</code>,<code>A2</code>..<code>Ax</code> in a list. Then save the list. That should work for you.</p>

<p>First of all, like @leeladam said, is better to store the values of your A variables in a list (a nested list, each element of the A list is other list with your data).</p>
<p>Then the <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#module-csv" rel="nofollow">csv module</a> is the best approach for that task.  Each line of the csv line (row) is an A list and each column is a data comma separated.  With this module you can save the data with Excel format.</p>
