<p>Python's length of list can be calculated by len(a_list). My question is, why was a_list.len() not implemented? Is there a reason behind it?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>likely just because its redundant when we already have and are use to len() maybe you could add a .len() method :)</p>
<p>there is a a_list.__len__()</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">because the people writing the language decided it would not add any value to the language ...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It's asking something about the language, which might be more appropriate on programmers.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">they have a <code>list.__len__</code> method, which <code>len(list)</code> calls</span>
