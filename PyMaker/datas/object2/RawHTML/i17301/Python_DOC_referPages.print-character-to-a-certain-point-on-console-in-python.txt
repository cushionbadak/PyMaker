<p>Is there a way to print a character to a certain point on console using Python (3)?
Here's an ideal example on what I'm trying to achieve:</p>
<pre><code>def print_char(x, y, char):
    # Move console cursor to 'x', 'y'
    # Set character under cursor to 'char'
</code></pre>
<p>I know it's possible in some other languages, how about Python? I don't mind if I have to use an external library.</p>
<p>I'm on a Windows 7.</p>

<p>If you are on UNIX (if you are not, see below), use <a href="http://docs.python.org/3.3/library/curses.html" rel="nofollow"><code>curses</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>import curses

stdscr = curses.initscr()

def print_char(x, y, char):
    stdscr.addch(y, x, char)
</code></pre>
<p>Only the Python package for UNIX platforms includes the <code>curses</code> module. But don't worry if that doesn't apply to you, as a ported version called <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/UniCurses" rel="nofollow"><code>UniCurses</code></a> is available for Windows and Mac OS.</p>

<p>If your console/terminal supports ANSI escape characters, then this is a good non-module solution.</p>
<pre><code>def print_char(x, y, char):
    print("\033["+str(y)+";"+str(x)+"H"+char)
</code></pre>
<p>I had to translate it slightly to get it correct, but it works. You can print a string of any length in place of a single character. Also, if you want this to execute the function multiple times repeatedly, you should do this.</p>
<pre><code>def print_char(x, y, char):
    compstring += "\033["+str(y)+";"+str(x)+"H"+char
</code></pre>
<p>Then print compstring after all of print_char's have executed. This will reduce flickering from clearing the screen.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You'd probably best use something like <a href="http://urwid.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">urwid</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What OS? For linux, use curses (in the standard library).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@sweeneyrod Windows 7 :/</span>
<span class="comment-copy">In that case, the <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/howto/curses.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs</a> suggest either unicurses or the console module as alternatives.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Forgot to mention, I'm on windows 7 :/</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MarkusMeskanen Then use the ported version that I mentioned in my answer.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yeah didn't see it at first, thanks, I'll give it a try before accepting! :P</span>
