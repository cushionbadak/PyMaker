<p>Redefined builtin function len() in spyder  like len = 100;
Now when I am trying to find the length of the string it says "'int' object is not callable"
How to undo this change or correct this?</p>

<p>Since len is an inbuilt python function, you should avoid using that as a variable. try prefixing your 'len' with '_' and use '_len = 10' instead of just 'len'. </p>
