<p>I want to do a Python Script who get all emails in a BoxMail using IMAPClient and Multiprocessing, and I would like to know what is the best way to do that.</p>
<p>Because I don't really know what to uses, and how to think it.</p>
<p>If someone has an idea, let me know !</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Follow these steps -</p>
<p>1) Try imapclient example in this documentation - <a href="https://imapclient.readthedocs.io/en/2.1.0/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://imapclient.readthedocs.io/en/2.1.0/</a></p>
<p>2) In order to parallelize fetching message, you need to partition your e-mails so that each thread fetches different e-mail. One of the criteria could be date field.</p>
<p>3) Write a method using example code in documentation and parameterize search criteria (server.search).</p>
<p>4) Call above method in the multiprocessing code. Example for multiprocessing can be found at - <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html</a></p>
<p>5) You can also check "SEARCH commands" section in the RFC <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc3501.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc3501.html</a> to select your partitioning criteria if date is not suitable.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Please share a working code and let us know where are you stuck exactly. The question is vague.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I didn't start anything, that's why I am asking you, how will you do that</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks a lot for your answer, i will check that :)</span>
