<p>I have the following code: </p>
<pre><code>print a.split('/',1)

<p>which returns <code>['27', '09/2018']</code>.</p>
<p>I need to format the extracted date time as <code>27/09</code></p>

<p>You can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">re</a> module without creating new list by splitting values</p>
<pre><code>import re
a = "27/09/2018"
re.sub('/\d{4}$','',a)

<p>Using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">datetime</a> </p>
<pre><code>import datetime
date=datetime.datetime.strptime(a,'%d/%m/%Y')

<p>It seems you're looking for a string in the end. You may be looking for this:</p>
<pre><code>a = "27/09/2018"
a = a.split('/')
</code></pre>
<p>This would make <code>a</code> a <code>list</code> equal to: <code>['27', '09', '2018']</code>. In order to print in the format you're looking for, use something like this: </p>
<pre><code>print "{}/{}".format(a[0], a[1])
</code></pre>
<p>or this:</p>
<pre><code>print a[0] + '/' + a[1]
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can do </p>
<pre><code>tokens = a.split("/")
print(tokens[0] + "/" + tokens[1])
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">what is a? Can you explain more? You might not need the extra argument as 1</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Its just a parameter. Anyways I dont need that. I am more concerned about getting the output.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I like how you're suggesting <code>re</code> and/or <code>datetime</code> @mad_ I've rarely considered that. Is this faster or even worth it in terms of memory usage compared to my answer? Also could you explain what re or datetime are doing exactly, or include links to these use examples?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Well yes as these methods will not create a new list which otherwise will be created by <code>split</code>. <code>split</code> solution is more readable but I think datetime solution will open new ways to deal with month and day say if you want to find the date difference. I personally avoid split wherever I can. @Jaba included the links as well</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Is split slower? Or is this just for more dynamic use?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Performance variance can be seen with bigger string samples but definitely split increases the space complexity.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@mad_ this works great. thanks. I need to convert the result 27/09 into int data type but I get an error - invalid literal for int() with base 10. I have the following code: int(a.rsplit('/',1)[0])</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You can include why OP solution failed because of extra argument related to max_splits</span>
