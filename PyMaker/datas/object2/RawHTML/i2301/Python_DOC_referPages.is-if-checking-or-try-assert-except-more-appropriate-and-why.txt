<p>Which method or checking conditions is more suggested to use:</p>
<pre><code>import os

# method 1
if not os.path.exists("somedir"):
    os.makedirs("somedir")

# method 2
try:
    assert not os.path.exists("somedir")
except AssertionError:
    pass
else:
    os.makedirs("somedir")

# method 3
try:
    os.makedirs("somedir")
except OSError:
    pass

<p>Would method 3 still break The Zen of Python ("Errors should never pass silently." if there was some logging?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Method 3 is, in general, superior. The other methods introduce a race condition, where another process could create the directory after you test for its existence but before you actually try to create it.</p>
<p>As pointed out in a comment, the <code>exist_ok</code> option does this for you, by simply not raising an exception if the exception is caused by a pre-existing directory (while still raising an exception for <em>other</em> errors).</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Use <code>os.makedirs("somedir", exist_ok=True)</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It's not an answer to the question as this os.makedirs() was just an example but thank you I didn't know about this option ;)</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>assert</code> is typically associated with a debugging scenario: alluded to in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-assert-statement" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the docs</a> and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/41721518/2823755">other resources</a> using the search terms "python assert usage"</span>
