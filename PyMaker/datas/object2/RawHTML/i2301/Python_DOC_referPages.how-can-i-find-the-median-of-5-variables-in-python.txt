<p>I have to find the median of 5 randoms variables only using if and else.
I don't understand why this code isn't working. I am new to python and beginning programming. If you can help me out that would be very great :D</p>

<p>Here is my approach (generalised):</p>
<pre><code>list_1 = [1,3,3,8,9]
list_1.sort()
list_len=len(list_1)
if list_len%2==0:
   print((list_1[list_len]+list_1[list_len-1])/2)
else:
   print(list_1[(list_len-1)//2])

<p>There is <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.median.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Numpy.median</a></p>
<p>That will just give you the median given an array. </p>
<pre><code>import numpy as np

a = 2
b = 4
c = 1
d = 10
e = 12

np.median([a,b,c,d,e])
</code></pre>
<p>Produces:</p>
<pre><code>4.0

<span class="comment-copy">Why can you only use if and else? This is an extremely tedious and hard-coded method to solve a relatively simple problem</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What have you tried so far? Have you tried sorting the list of 5 values and taking the 3rd? This sounds like a homework problem. ðŸ™„</span>
<span class="comment-copy">yes this is a homework problem I don't hide it. Well its because its a homework I can only use if and else:P sorting the list of 5 without while would be so long... Trying to find something else</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Please try to avoid including screenshots of code. Paste it in as text, instead.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sure sorry, it is my first question here on stackoverflow, thank you for the advice.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I agree that the sort is the best approach, but I think the question states that only if/else statements can be used.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Okay. I will add that as well.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I see, does it sort by ascii number ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">With a purely numerical list, it sorts by value of the integers.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">if you need to convert numbers in ascii in the range between o and 9 there is no problem. If the numbers are composed by more than 1 digit, then you should convert them before.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes same as above I don't think I can import but thank you:)</span>
