<p>For this project, I want to compare two lines from separate files, character by character in Python. I can't get the program to return or print anything.  The program needs to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read the next line from each file </li>
</ul>
<p><code>for line1 in currentLine1:
            for line2 in currentLine2:</code></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Determine if the lines are different lengths</p>
<pre><code>            if len.line1 != len.line2:  # If the line lengths are not equal return the line number
            return charByChar(count=count + 1, differenceCounter=differenceCounter, textCount1=textCount1,
                              textCount2=textCount2, difLineCounter=difLineCounter)
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>If the lines are the same length compare characters</p>
<pre><code>            if len.line1 == len.line2:  # If the lines lengths are equal
                for char in range(len(line1)):  # Compare line by line
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>If they match don't do anything. However, if they do match print unmatched characters(1); print line number using N: M format(2); Process next line(3).</p>
<pre><code>                    if line1[char] != line[char]:  # If the lines have different characters
                        print("Unmatched characters")
                        print("Line number:", count)
                        print("First different character", char)
                        differenceCounter = difLineCounter + 1  # add 1 to the difference counter
                        textCount1 = textCount1 + 1
                        textCount2 = textCount2 + 1
                return charByChar(count=count, differenceCounter=differenceCounter, textCount1=textCount1,
                              textCount2=textCount2)  # return difference count
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>At the end print out the number of characters in the first file(1);the number of characters in the second file(2);the number of characters that do not match in lines of the same length(3);the number of lines that are not the same length(4).</p>
<pre><code>            if len.line1 == 0 or len.line2 == 0:
            print("Extra lines are not matching")
        **Some print then return statement**
</code></pre></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>I believe I have all this down, however, my code never returns any values. It always ends with exit code 0 (I have referenced 2 text files to compare).</strong></p>
<p>For context here is all the code I have written</p>
<pre><code>text1 = open("file1.txt", "r")
text2 = open("file2.txt", "r")
content1 = text1.read()
content2 = text2.read()


def charByChar(count=0, differenceCounter=0, textCount1=0, textCount2=0, difLineCounter=0):
    currentLine1 = content1
    currentLine2 = content2
    line = text1.readline(count)
    if line != '':
        for line1 in currentLine1:
            for line2 in currentLine2:
                if len.line1 != len.line2:  # If the line lengths are not equal return the line number
                    return charByChar(count=count + 1, differenceCounter=differenceCounter, textCount1=textCount1,
                                      textCount2=textCount2, difLineCounter=difLineCounter)
                if len.line1 == len.line2:  # If the lines lengths are equal
                    for char in range(len(line1)):  # Compare line by line
                        if line1[char] != line[char]:  # If the lines have different characters
                            print("Unmatched characters")
                            print("Line number:", count)
                            print("First different character", char)
                            differenceCounter = difLineCounter + 1  # add 1 to the difference counter
                            textCount1 = textCount1 + 1
                            textCount2 = textCount2 + 1
                    return charByChar(count=count, differenceCounter=differenceCounter, textCount1=textCount1,
                                      textCount2=textCount2)  # return difference count
                if len.line1 == 0 or len.line2 == 0:
                    print("Extra lines are not matching")
    text2.close()
    text1.close()

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Your function <code>charByChar()</code> doesn't seem to return a base case. For example, in the place where you log that extra lines are not matching, try returning <code>False</code> or <code>-1</code>, or what have you.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Maybe it is a typo or I am missing something, but in your when you check for line length equality, you are calling <code>CharByChar</code> if they have a different length. Is this intended?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">There is no base case in your recursion.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">are you building this function for another project or this is more like a practice project? because I believe <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/filecmp.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/filecmp.html</a> does what you want to do already</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@JChao I'm limited in what methods I can use</span>
