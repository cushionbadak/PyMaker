<p>My data set starts at <code>xmin = 0</code> (s) and ends at <code>xmax = 300</code> (s).
Below is the moving average calculated with counting the minimum peaks.</p>
<pre><code>frame_length = 60
hr = np.zeros(len(range(xmin, xmax - frame_length)))
for x in range(xmin, xmax - frame_length):
    count_in_window = np.sum(np.logical_and(mintab[:,0] &gt;= x, mintab[:,0] &lt; x + frame_length))
    hr[x - xmin] = count_in_window * 60/frame_length
</code></pre>
<p>But I actually want a window that counts the minimum peaks for <code>x(0-60)</code> and then <code>x(60-120)</code>, <code>x(120-180)</code>, <code>x(180-240)</code> and <code>x(240-300)</code>. So it will be the heart rate per minute. I tried something like:</p>
<pre><code>for x in range(xmin,xmax):
    if x != xmax:
        count_peaks = np.sum(mintab[:0])
        hr = count_peaks    
    x+=60
</code></pre>
<p>Im new to Python and I would be very happy to learn how to do this :) Thank you</p>

<p>You can use the <code>step</code> parameter of the <code>range</code> build-in function:</p>
<pre><code>for x in range(xmin,xmax, 60):
    if x != xmax:
        count_peaks = np.sum(mintab[:0])
        hr = count_peaks
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">You tried something like this... and? Did it work? If it didn't, why don't you keep trying?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I am still trying... I thought maybe someone here knows how to make it work.</span>
