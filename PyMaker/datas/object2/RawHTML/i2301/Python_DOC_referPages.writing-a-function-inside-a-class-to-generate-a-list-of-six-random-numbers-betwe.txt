<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I want to generate a list of random numbers where the range and the length of the list can be varied later without modifying the function.So i thought of creating a function and the code i tried using python 3x is as follows:</p>
<pre><code>class Traffic_matrix:

  def All_traffic(self,first,last,length):
      all_t=[]
      for i in range(length):
        all_t.append (random.randint(first, last))
all_t = Traffic_matrix()
print(all_t.All_traffic(23,56,6))
</code></pre>
<p>I know i have made a mistake somewhere and dont know what it is. Please help me out to sort this. </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You are essentially re-building (a worse version of) <code>random.choices(...)</code> with your function. Better use <code>choices</code>:</p>
<pre><code>import random

class Traffic_Matrix:

  @classmethod
  def All_Traffic(cls,first,last,length):
      # return smth from it to get "results"
      return random.choices(range(first,last+1), k=length)

values = Traffic_Matrix.All_Traffic(23,56,6)
print(values)
</code></pre>
<p>It does not make much sense to put it into a class - no instance-members are used - you could define it as classmethod if you really need a "renamed" random.choices()</p>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>[25, 33, 42, 38, 38, 45]
</code></pre>

<p>you just add " return all_t " as last statement of your All_traffic function definition.
It would work .</p>

<span class="comment-copy">returning <code>all_t</code> from your function is probably a good idea.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">Thank you very much and it gives the expected result. But can you please explain the logic behind(last+1) and cls ?  If i remove cls; it says that "All_traffic() takes 3 positional arguments, but 4 were given. What are the given 4? I have passed only 3 values (23,56,6).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ShenuAmaya Read the SO question about @classmethods. The <code>cls</code> is autoprovided when you call the method, same as for instancemethods that get a <code>self</code> as first parameter autoprovided. <code>cls</code> would be "the class itself".  <code>last+1</code> because the <code>range(1,100)</code> produces 1..99 - not to 100. <code>randint(1,100)</code> would produce from 1 to 100.
