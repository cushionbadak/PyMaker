<p>I have written the code in the following format.When i entered the age 21 then i should get -0.4.similarly when i entered the age 22 then i should get -0.3,and so on.But i do not want these much line of code.How can i improve this code.can anyone please suggest me</p>
<pre><code>age=int(input("\nEnter the age :"))
a=[-0.4,-0.3,-0.2]

if age==21: 

     print("beta coefficient is ",a[0])

elif  age==22:

    print("beta coefficient is",a[1])

elif age==23:

    print("beta coefficient is ",a[2])
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>May be you can use <code>dictionary</code> instead and use key to get the corresponding value as following:</p>
<pre><code>a={21:-0.4, 22:-0.3, 23:-0.2}

print("beta coefficient is ",a[age])
</code></pre>
<h1>Update:</h1>
<p>If entered value or <code>key</code> does not exist in the dictionary, it will raise <code>KeyError</code>. In that case <code>.get</code> can be used with default value of <code>None</code> (<em>or other value</em>) to return when key is not found:</p>
<pre><code>print("beta coefficient is ",a.get(age, None))
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Heres an efficient way.</p>
<p><code>print("beta co-efficient is", a[age-21])</code>
It's hard coded that the first value is 21, and that they increment by one, but for your case it will work.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I wrote him a little function definition, didn't want to jump to ahead, even though this is fantastic, cheers</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thank u for your reply.but when i enter age 21 i should get -0.4.similary when i enterd age 22 i should get -0.3,and so on...how?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">May be you can simply try something like <code>print('{0:.2f}'.format(-0.4 + (age-21)/10.0))</code>without anything needed.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thank u so much..Now it is working fine...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">i think you have not understood , teclnol is expecting integer index on the array you have mentioned (your use shows it too) . in this particular case this will work. your case teclnol's answer is the best.  Otherwise you can use dictionaries like Student answer</span>
