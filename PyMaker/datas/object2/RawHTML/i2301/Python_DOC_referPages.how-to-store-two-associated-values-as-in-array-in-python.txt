<p>I'm currently writing a bot for my discord that will have a levelling system. To do this, I have an array called "key", which stores the user IDs, and an array named "stats", which stores the user's levels.</p>
<p>I need to somehow merge these two arrays so that upon calling a userID, it has a specific level associated with it as well.</p>

<p>To elaborate on the comment given by @juanpa.arrivallaga: you're looking for a "dictionary" data structure, rather than a pair of arrays. Instead of</p>
<pre><code>key = ['user01', 'user02', ...]
stats = ['stat01', 'stat02', ...]
</code></pre>
<p>you want to make a dictionary, where each <code>key</code> is linked to the associated value in <code>stats</code>:</p>
<pre><code>users = {'user01': 'stat01', 'user02': 'stat02', ...}
</code></pre>
<p>The way to do transmute the two lists into one dictionary is:</p>
<pre><code>users = dict(zip(key, stats))
</code></pre>
<p>To elaborate: the function <code>zip()</code> is a built-in function that matches two same-size arrays together into a tuple:</p>
<pre><code>zip(key, stats) == [('user01', 'stat01'), ('user02', 'stat02'), ...]
</code></pre>
<p>You could also use <code>zip()</code> for any number of iterable objects, and it would group them into tuples based on index. </p>
<p>The next part of the solution is simply to typecast that to <code>dict</code>, which is what python calls dictionaries. If you pass 2-tuples to <code>dict()</code>, python will automatically associate the first element (in this case, from <code>key</code>) as the key, and the second element (from <code>stats</code>) as the associated value.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">As @juanpa.arrivillaga suggested, use a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>Dictionary</code></a>. If you insist on keeping those two in two separate lists, you can <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#zip" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>zip()</code></a> them together and iterate over the result to get your <code>userID</code> &lt;-&gt; <code>level</code> pairs, but that's just wasteful.</span>
