<p>I'm trying to get the <code>fruit()</code> function to sort using <code>key=sortby()</code> and then print to screen - either within <code>fruit()</code> or within it's own function.</p>
<p>It works fine when there is no <code>fruit()</code> function, but I'm having difficulties working out the right syntax to pass <code>par</code> as a parameter to be used in <code>fruit()</code></p>
<pre><code>fruit = [["Apples", 30], ["Bananas", 100], ["Pears", 0], ["Peaches", 20]]

def sortby(par):
    return par[1]

def fruit():
    rate = []

    fruit.sort(key=sortby, reverse=True)

    for success in fruit:
        rate.append(success[0])
        rate.append(success[1])

    str = str(rate)

print(str)
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>There are several issues with your code:</p>
<ol>
<li>You need to return a value from your <code>fruit</code> function</li>
<li>You need to give the <code>fruit</code> function a different name from the list</li>
<li>You need to actually call the <code>fruit</code> function at some point</li>
<li>Avoid using <code>str</code> as a variable name, as this is a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">built-in function</a> in Python.</li>
</ol>
<p>The <code>sortby</code> function works fine, however.</p>
<pre><code>fruit = [["Apples", 30], ["Bananas", 100], ["Pears", 0], ["Peaches", 20]]

def sortby(par):
    return par[1]

def sort_fruit():
    rate = []

    fruit.sort(key=sortby, reverse=True)

    for success in fruit:
        rate.append(success[0])
        rate.append(success[1])

    return rate

print(sort_fruit())

<span class="comment-copy">You function is named <code>fruit</code>... so inside the function <code>fruit</code> refers to the function itself - not the <code>fruit</code> list outside it... You also never return <code>rate</code>.... and that last <code>print(str)</code> is just going to print the builtin method - unless that's supposed to be indented within <code>fruit</code> (or whatever name you choose)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Or the entire program could be: <code>fuit = [...]</code>, then <code>print([el for pair in sorted(fruit, key=lambda L: L[1], reverse=True) for el in pair])</code>... but that's probably a bit much for now...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you very much. I just seem to have a mental block when trying to pass variables via parameters in functions. But this works brilliantly - thank you!</span>
