<p>It appears that your question is from your homework. I will just show some steps of the process and where you might want to go to find more information.</p>
<p>You can use Python's <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#with" rel="nofollow noreferrer">with statement</a> to open files. It is possible to use nested with statements or a comma for opening multiple files.</p>
<pre><code>with open('file1.txt', 'r') as file1, \
open('file2.txt', 'r') as file2, \
# and so on ...
open('filen.txt', 'r') as filen:
</code></pre>
<p>With your file open, you need to read each of its lines. This can be done with a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-for-statement" rel="nofollow noreferrer">for statement</a>. Reading each line of a file return the line with a newline character at the end. You can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.rstrip" rel="nofollow noreferrer">rstrip</a> to remove the \n at the end of the string then you can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.split" rel="nofollow noreferrer">split</a> and a whitespace to "tokenize" your input. The following code is an example of the result obtained using this combination of functions.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; for line in file1:
...     print(line.rstrip().split(' '))
...
['JDON', '2']
['SASF', '1']
['DFKJ', '3']
['PERTIM', '1']
['KJKJK', '0']
</code></pre>
<p>You can use the same logic to read and parse the data from the other files. You should open the output file in write mode in order to write your changes. Also, you might want to read about how to convert a string to an <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int" rel="nofollow noreferrer">int value</a>. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">What exactly is the problem? Did you try something?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, i dont know how to solve this</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I want a output file exactly as nominal.txt but i need to change the PERTIM value to be updated . Updation can be achieved by taking values from ss1.txt and nomdata.txt . Please help me to solve this</span>
<span class="comment-copy">can you give the full code to get the output</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It is not working .I want to change only the pertim value value in the output. PERRTIM value is updated by taking values from ss1.txt and nomdata.txt. Please help</span>
<span class="comment-copy">As I said, it seems that you are asking for a solution for your homework. I provided enough steps that you could use to get to the solution. You can update your question with more information about what you tried and what is not working out.</span>
