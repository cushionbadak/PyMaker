</code></pre>
<p>Your initial error: <code>AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'stdev'</code> was because you were trying to call the attribute stdev of your list, but this attribute does not exist. However, you can call the method <code>stdev</code> on a list since you imported the statistics module.</p>
<p>Like I said, there were a lot of errors in the code. I could enumerate them, but a bit of time. If you have any questions, let me know.</p>
<p>As a word of advice for implementing big blocks of code: make sure each function or block of code works before implementing it into your program.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">"But whenever I try to run the code, I get one error, fix it, then get another error. " You need to provide a much more detailed problem specification than that. Please see <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/how-to-ask">How to Ask</a>. Fundamentally, though, you need to understand how functions work. This probably would be better for you to look at a Python tutorial so you even know where to begin. Otherwise, please ask a much more constrained question.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, but not in the way you are asking. Please post the error output here as text. We will help you work through one error at a time. Show your fixes and explain what errors they cause too.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What error are you getting now?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Well, <code>raw_data</code> is a <code>list</code> object (part of Python standard library) which doesn't have a <code>stdev</code> member. Read the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html#statistics.stdev" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs</a> which contain a usage example for <code>stdev()</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">You never responded to anything in the previous question you asked about this function. You've simply made an even <i>broader</i> question that is more poorly constrained.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Please do not encourage people to come here and dump their homework expecting corrections. Homework questions can be on-topic, but this one is not.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I figured the coder had the right ideas, but just need a bit of a cleanup. The changes I proposed were not major, most were syntactic changes.</span>
