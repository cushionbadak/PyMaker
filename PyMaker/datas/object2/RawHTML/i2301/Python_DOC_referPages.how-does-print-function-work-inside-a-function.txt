<p>This is an error message.</p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "sandbox.py", line 6, in &lt;module&gt;
    test()
  File "sandbox.py", line 3, in test
    print(a)
UnboundLocalError: local variable 'a' referenced before assignment
</code></pre>
<p>I expected this code will print out 17 13 but an error came out. First print(a) would print 17 because a=13 is not yet executed, and second print(a) would print local a which is 13 because variables are accessed from local to global.</p>
<p>what is wrong in my explanation? It seems I have some misunderstanding.. thanks</p>

<p>Since your function defines <code>a</code> as a local variable, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/executionmodel.html#resolution-of-names" rel="nofollow noreferrer">it is considered a local variable everywhere in the function</a>.  Your first <code>print</code> statement then references the variable before it's initially assigned.</p>
<p>Global variables can be confusing (and reasoning about what functions make changes to what globals is extra complicated) and best practice (in most languages) is to simply not use them.  A better formulation of your sample might be</p>
<pre><code>def test(a):
  print(a)
  a = 13
  print(a)

if __name__ == '__main__':
  test(17)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You have to use <code>global</code> keyword before accessing the variable inside the function. For more reference <a href="https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/global-local-nonlocal-variables" rel="nofollow noreferrer">see this link</a></p>
<pre><code>a = 17
def test():
   global a
   print(a)
   a = 13

<span class="comment-copy">Your misunderstanding is not with print, but with the fact that any <b>assigment</b> to a variable name will make the variable <b>local</b> for the whole (function) scope, not just from the point of the assigment. Lookup the <b>global</b> keyword in the python docs.</span>
