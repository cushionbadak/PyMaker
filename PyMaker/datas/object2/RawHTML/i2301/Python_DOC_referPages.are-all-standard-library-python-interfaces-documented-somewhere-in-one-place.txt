<p>In Python standard library there is a number of implicit interfaces that are expected to be implemented in various cases. For example, coroutines and tasks are "awaitable", meaning they implement the <code>__await__</code> method; context managers need to implement <code>__enter__</code> and <code>__exit__</code>; iterables implement <code>__next__</code>; and so on.</p>
<p>Is there a single place where all those interfaces are documented, or does one need to hunt them through the documentation? </p>

<p>You may look for the documentation for the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">python data model</a>. All the functions named by you are documentated there, for example <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__await__" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>__await__</code></a> or <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__enter__" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>__enter__</code></a>.</p>
<p>To me this is the most fascinating part of the python documentation, because this gives great insight how to max out the features of the python language.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">These are all in the Python “Data Model” section of the documentation. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html</a></span>
