<p>Here is my code I don't know how can I loop every .zip in a folder, please help me: I want all contents of 5 zip files to extracted in one folder, not including its directory name</p>
<pre><code>import os

import zipfile
my_dir = r"C:\\Users\\Guest\\Desktop\\OJT\\scanner\\samples_raw"

my_zip = r"C:\\Users\\Guest\\Desktop\\OJT\\samples\\001-100.zip"

    # skip directories
    if not filename:
        continue

    # copy file (taken from zipfile's extract)
    source = zip_file.open(member)
    target = file(os.path.join(my_dir, filename), "wb")

<p>What you are looking for is <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/glob.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">glob</a>. Which can be used like this:</p>
<pre><code>#&lt;snip&gt;
import glob

#assuming all your zip files are in the directory below.
for my_zip in glob.glob(r"C:\\Users\\Guest\\Desktop\\OJT\\samples\\*.zip"):

<span class="comment-copy">wait man it extracted the 6 folders into 6 files not the contents of the zip files</span>
<span class="comment-copy">this gaved me 6 extracted files i don't know why, not the contents of the 6 folders</span>
<span class="comment-copy">if you have multiple folders you could try something like this <code>glob.glob(r"C:\\Users\\Guest\\Desktop\\OJT\\scanner\\samples_raw\\**\\*.zip"</code>. This will scan directories within samples_raw zip files.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">no what i mean is it extracted the 6 zip files into .file the contents of the zip files were not extracted</span>
