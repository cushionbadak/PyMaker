<p>Basically, I'm trying to do a code in Python where a user inputs a sentence. However, I need my code to remove ALL whitespaces (e.g. tabs, space, index, etc.) and print it out. </p>
<p>This is what I have so far:</p>
<pre><code>def output_without_whitespace(text):
  newText = text.split("")

print('String with no whitespaces: '.join(newText))
</code></pre>
<p>I'm clear that I'm doing a lot wrong here and I'm missing plenty, but, I haven't been able to thoroughly go over splitting and joining strings yet, so it'd be great if someone explained it to me. </p>
<p>This is the whole code that I have so far:</p>
<pre><code>text = input(str('Enter a sentence: '))
print(f'You entered: {text}')

def get_num_of_characters(text):
 result = 0
 for char in text:
     result += 1
 return result
print('Number of characters: ', get_num_of_characters(text))

def output_without_whitespace(text):
    newtext = "".join(text.split())

print(f'String without whitespaces: {newtext}')
</code></pre>
<p><strong>I FIGURED OUT MY PROBLEM!</strong>
I realize that in this line of code.</p>
<pre><code> print(f'String without whitespaces: {newtext}')
</code></pre>
<p>It's supposed to be.</p>
<pre><code>print('String without whitespaces: ', output_without_whitespace(text))
</code></pre>
<p>I realize that my problem as to why the sentence without whitespaces was not printing back out to me was, because I was not calling out my function!</p>

<p>You have the right idea, but here's how to implement it with <code>split</code> and <code>join</code>:</p>
<pre><code>def output_without_whitespace(text):
  return ''.join(text.split())
</code></pre>
<p>so that:</p>
<pre><code>output_without_whitespace(' this\t  is a\n test..\n ')
</code></pre>
<p>would return:</p>
<pre><code>thisisatest..
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>A trivial solution is to just use split and rejoin (similar to what you are doing):</p>
<pre><code>def output_without_whitespace(text):
    return ''.join(text.split())
</code></pre>
<p>First we split the initial string to a list of words, then we join them all together.</p>
<p>So to think about it a bit:</p>
<pre><code>text.split()
</code></pre>
<p>will give us a list of words (split by any whitespace). So for example: </p>
<pre><code>'hello world'.split() -&gt; ['hello', 'world']
</code></pre>
<p>And finally</p>
<pre><code>''.join(&lt;result of text.split()&gt;)
</code></pre>
<p>joins all of the words in the given list to a single string. So:</p>
<pre><code>''.join(['hello', 'world']) -&gt; 'helloworld'
</code></pre>

<p>There are a few different ways to do this, but this seems the most obvious one to me. It is simple and efficient.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; with_spaces = '  The  quick brown       fox  '
&gt;&gt;&gt; list_no_spaces = with_spaces.split() 
&gt;&gt;&gt; ''.join(list_no_spaces)
'Thequickbrownfox'
</code></pre>
<p><code>.split()</code> with no parameter splits a string  into a list wherever there's one or more white space characters, leaving out the white space...more details <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<p><code>''.join(list_no_spaces)</code> joins elements of the list into a string with nothing betwen the elements, which is what you want here: <code>'Thequickbrownfox'</code>.</p>
<p>If you had used <code>','.join(list_no_spaces)</code> you'd get <code>'The,quick,brown,fox'</code>.</p>
<p>Experienced Python programmers tend to use regular expressions sparingly. Often it's better to use tools like <code>.split()</code> and <code>.join()</code> to do the work, and keep regular expressions for where there is no alternative.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Don't forget to <b>call</b> your function.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Austin, which function?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@eyllanesc "Duplicate" Question did not answer my question. It does not state how to print it out. And, I'm still getting errors within my code.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This function: <code>output_without_whitespace</code>. I don't see you calling it . :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Austin ah, I'm sorry I just edited my question. I just posted my full code.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I enter in this code, however, I'm still getting the same string WITH white spaces.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Did you copy and paste this code? There must be a typo when you entered the code. Please make sure you are not passing any argument to <code>split()</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, I did. Now, nothing is being printed out.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Oh, i figured out my problem</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you want it to print, you should just <code>print</code> it with <code>print(output_without_whitespace(' this\t  is a\n test..\n '))</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I've replace my code with this, however, I'm still not getting it to print it out. and when I replace my code to try to accommodate your suggestion, I get an error.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This will only remove spaces. All other white space characters, such as tabs and newlines, will remain.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I've already asked the user to input their sentence beforehand. How do I rewrite your suggested code without input?</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>s = ''.join(variable_name.split())</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Vee Same concept you apply <code>.split()</code> first then wrap that in <code>''.join()</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Did you even test this?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">My bad-- writing to much Groovy these days. Fixed.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">While this might answer the authors question, it lacks some explaining words and links to documentation. Raw code snippets are not very helpful without some phrases around it. You may also find <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-answer">how to write a good answer</a> very helpful. Please edit your answer.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for the feedback. Explanation added. I wrote the original answer in a hurry on a phone, which is not a good look. I did actually write an explanation but somehow lost it on the StackOverflow app and had no time to rewrite.</span>
