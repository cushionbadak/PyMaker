<p>I need to take Files as inputs from command line arguments. I am providing the path of the file but it is taking the path as filename ? What i can add to make it right . This is my code : I am using openpyxl to get names:</p>
<pre><code>wk1 = openpyxl.load_workbook (sys.argv[1])
wk2 = openpyxl.load_workbook (sys.argv[2])
</code></pre>
<p>Please help out . </p>

<p>I am guessing you want to have only filename even if argument value is a path. </p>
<p>This will do it</p>
<pre><code>import os 
filename1 = os.path.basename(sys.argv[1])
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">There's nothing wrong with that code. What do you mean "it's taking the path as filename"? Isn't that what you wanted?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No I want to take input the filename @Aran-Fey but when I am giving path of file , It is taking file path as file name</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Can you show an example, any error messages, and what you expect to happen?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I want to pass the file path in the command line,  So sys.argv[1] is receiving the file path, but  this syntax wk1 = openpyxl.load_workbook (sys.argv[1]) takes only filename as input , so when I giving th filepath it is taking it as file name , and I am getting  a error this file not found @cdarke</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The phrase "file path" is confusing me, do you mean directory name?  If the API requires a filename then that's what you must supply.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes that what I want @Eduard, but I have to check that this will work with my situation or not .</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, @Eduard but I have the fourth argument also which tell the Directory where the output file to be stored, then how to write the path for it? I have written my code like this <code>output=sys.argv[3]    wb.save('%s.xlsx' %output)</code> which is creating output.xlsx file in the current directory but I want the file to be created at the directory given as in fourth argument.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Deepraj that kind of operation an similarity are part os.path module. Just check docs <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html#module-os.path" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html#module-os.path</a>. Please mark answer as accepted if it answered your question.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hi @Eduard , Can you please tell which os module should I use to create a file in given file directory as arguments.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I will recommend going through a tutorial for file usage <a href="https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/files/reading-and-writing-files-in-python" rel="nofollow noreferrer">pythonforbeginners.com/files/â€¦</a> and reading more advanced file/directory operations here: <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/filesys.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/2/library/filesys.html</a></span>
