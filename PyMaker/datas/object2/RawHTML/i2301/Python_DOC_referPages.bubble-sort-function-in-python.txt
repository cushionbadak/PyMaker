<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have a question about a part of a bubble sort function that I dont understand. The assignment is to add detailed comments to all the parts of code explaining what it is doing. The lines of code that I'm uncertain about are number 2 and 3 (the ones marked with a '#?' at the end). Can anyone give a good explanation of what these lines are doing? Any help much appreciated. </p>
<pre><code>def bubbleSort(alist):
    for passnum in range(len(alist)-1,0,-1): #?
        for i in range(passnum): #?
            if alist[i] &gt; alist[i+1]:
                temp = alist[i]
                alist[i] = alist[i+1]
                alist[i+1] = temp

list = [54,26,93,17,77,31,44,55,20]
bubbleSort(list)
print(list)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<blockquote>
<pre><code>for passnum in range(len(alist)-1,0,-1):

<p>Per the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesseq-range" rel="nofollow noreferrer">range function</a> <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-range" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>len(alist) - 1</code> is the length of the list (8) minus one (7).  It represents some "starting" number.</li>
<li><code>0</code> represents the "stopping" number.</li>
<li><code>-1</code> represents the "step" number. </li>
</ul>
<p>These come together in <code>range(len(alist) - 1, 0, -1)</code> to say "count from 7 to 0, backwards - one negative step at a time".</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>for i in range(passnum):
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>When <code>range()</code> is only passed one argument (a number), it counts from 0 to that number.  The documentation gives this example:</p>
<pre><code>list(range(10))  
# [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
</code></pre>
<p>So the code counts from 7 down to 0 - and every time it performs a single count, it immediately counts from 0 to that number.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">They're pretty much <code>for (int passnum = alist.length() - 1; passnum &gt; 0; --passnum) { for (int i = 0; i &lt; passnum; ++i) { /* ... */ } }</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You should read the documentation of the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-range" rel="nofollow noreferrer">range function</a>. I linked it for you. All you have to do is carefully read what the parameters are, and get a better understanding at what the <code>for</code> loop is doing. :)</span>
