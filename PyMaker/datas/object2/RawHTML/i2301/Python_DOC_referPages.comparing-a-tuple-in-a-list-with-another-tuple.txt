<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have a list of tuples. I want to pick each and every tuple in the list and compare it with another tuple which is defined by me. </p>
<p>The code that i used is as follows;</p>
<pre><code>list1 = [(3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6)]
for item in list1:
   if list1[item] == (4,5)
      print ("OK")
</code></pre>
<p>but it says that list indices must be an integer or slice. If i want to take each tuple in the list and compare them against another, how should i code it?</p>
<p>please help me!</p>

<p>You don't need for loop <strong>IF</strong> you have <strong>only one</strong> tuple to check . Just directly check using <code>if</code></p>
<pre><code>tpl = (4,5) # Single user defined tuple
if tpl in list1:
    print ("OK")
</code></pre>
<p>If you have <strong>many</strong> tuples to check</p>
<pre><code>tuplst = [(3,4), (1,2)] # List of tuples
list1 = [(3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6)]

for tpl in tuplst:
    if tpl in list1:
        print ("OK")
</code></pre>
<p>The problem in your code was that when you do <code>list1[item]</code>, you are trying to do <code>list1[(3, 4)]</code> which is not the correct way to index a list and hence you get the <code>IndexError</code></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>try this:</p>
<pre><code>list1 = [(3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6)]
for item in list1:
    if item == (4,5):
        print ("OK")
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>you could just test if the tuple (<code>(4, 5)</code> in the example below) is in the list:</p>
<pre><code>if (4, 5) in list1:
    print('OK')
</code></pre>
<p>there is no need for an explicit loop.</p>
<p>if you have multiple tuples to check against, i suggest you use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=set#set" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>set</code></a>s:</p>
<pre><code>cmp = set(((4, 5), (5, 6)))
if cmp &lt; set(list1):
    print('OK')
</code></pre>
<p>this checks if <em>both</em> tuples appear at least once in your original list.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>you can achieve it the following way.. </p>
<pre><code>list1 = [(3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6)]
for item in range(len(list1)):
    if list1[item] == (4,5):
        print ("OK")
    else:
        continue
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>An alternative solution:</p>
<pre><code>for i in list1:
    if i==(4,5):
        print("Ok")
    else:
        ....
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Please resend with correct indentation and send the traceback.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The reason for the error message is that you are expecting <code>for item in list:</code> to set <code>item</code> to a series of <i>numbers</i> that you then use as list subscripts in <code>list1[item]</code>. But that isn't how <code>for...in</code> works. The first time through the loop, <code>item</code> isn't <code>0</code>, it is  <code>list1[0]</code>. That is why the interpreter is complaining that it is expecting an integer: <code>list1[item]</code> is the same as <code>list1[(4,5)]</code>. And what you really want is <code>(4,5)</code>. So, as one answer points out, change <code>list1[item]</code> to <code>item</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@BoarGules - A Pretty good explanation... i got the point and thanks to you! I'm still a python beginner and your ideas are inspiring me.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you very much!!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You are welcome. Glad to help</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Depends on the actual program, if you want repeats, this won't work as intended.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@SVengat not sure i understand... what would be repeated and therefore not work?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">As in, this program will not be suitable if you want to print("Ok") for every occurrence.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@SVengat oh, i understand. you are right.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">there are better ways to loop over containers in Python. you could for example do <code>for tup in list1:</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">that is true, this is the solution which came to mind quickest. mind to post this in another answer? I gladly vote it up</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Cut7er  I appreciate your effort! Thanx a lot.</span>
