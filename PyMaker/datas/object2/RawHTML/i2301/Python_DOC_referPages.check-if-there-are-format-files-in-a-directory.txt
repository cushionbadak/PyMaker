<p>I have been trying to figure out for a while how to check if there are .pkl files in a given directory. I checked the website and I could find ways to find if there are files in the directory and list them, but I just want to check if they are there. </p>
<p>In my directory are a total of 7 .pkl files, as soon as I create one, the others are created so to check if the seven of them exist, it will be enough to check if one exists. Therefore, I would like to check if there is any .pkl file.</p>
<p>This is working if I do:</p>
<p><code>os.path.exists('folder1/folder2/filename.pkl')</code></p>
<p>But I had to write one of my file names. I would like to do so without searching for a specific file. I also tried </p>
<p><code>os.path.exists('folder1/folder2/*.pkl')</code>, </p>
<p>but it is not working neither as I don't have any file named *.pkl.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use the python module <code>glob</code> (<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/glob.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/glob.html</a>)</p>
<p>Specifically, <code>glob.glob('folder1/folder2/*.pkl')</code> will return a list of all .pkl files in folder2.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use :</p>
<pre><code>for dir_path, dir_names, file_names in os.walk(search_dir):
        # Go over all files and folders 
        for file_name in file_names:
            if (file_name.endswith(".pkl")):
                # do something like break after the first one you find
</code></pre>
<p>Note : This can be used if you want to search entire directory with sub directories also</p>
<p>In case you want to search only one directory , you can run the "for" on os.listdir(path)</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">I'd use <code>iglob</code> instead of <code>glob</code> and put that in an <code>any</code>, i.e. <code>has_plk = any(glob.iglob(os.path.join(dir_path, '*.plk'))</code>; it does <i>just</i> the required test.</span>
