<p>I have yet another question regarding my little console program for the windows cmd.</p>
<p>I use colorama to color my text in the terminal which makes it look like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UNYLF.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img alt="enter image description here" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UNYLF.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Then I found out how to color the text in an <code>input()</code>-method using a little "hack" with a print without linebreak, like this:</p>
<pre><code>from colorama import init
init(autoreset=True)
YELLOW = "\x1b[1;33;40m" 

print(f"\n{YELLOW}Turnier spielen? [T]: ", end='')
tournament = input()
</code></pre>
<p>this leads to the yellow line in the picture above. </p>
<p>But I still look for a way to color the very characters the user inputs - so here I would like to format the user input "sdffdgf..." in color as well. </p>

<p>has anyone a solution for me or will it just not be possible with the limited windows cmd?</p>

<p>Removing the <code>init(autoreset=True)</code> line from your code runs as you wish on my machine.</p>
<pre><code>import colorama

from colorama import Fore,Style,Back
colorama.init()

YELLOW = "\x1b[1;33;40m" 
RED = "\x1b[1;31;40m"

print(f"\n{YELLOW}Turnier spielen? [T]: ", end='')
tournament = input()
print(f"\n{RED}Turnier spielen? [T]: ", end='')
tournament2 = input()
</code></pre>

<p>My colorama version <code>colorama==0.3.9</code>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://pypi.org/project/colorama/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Colorama docs</a> state that when using <code>autoreset=true</code> it will reset your colour and styling options immediately after the <code>print</code> command, this happens before you get to your input command which is why you do not get the colours in the user typed text.</p>

<p>You can pass <code>input()</code> a string to display before the actual input of the user.</p>
<pre><code>from colorama import init
init(autoreset=True)
YELLOW = "\x1b[1;33;40m"
RED = "\x1b[1;31;40m"

print(f"\n{YELLOW}Turnier spielen? [T]: ", end='')
tournament = input(RED)
</code></pre>
<p>You can probably get rid of the <code>print(..., end='')</code> call with this.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">wow, thanks a lot for this late yet gold answer! I never suspected it to be caused by the autoreset....looks like I have to <code>{CLEAR}</code> after every line, then I can omit the <code>autoreset=True</code> altogether and finally get my colored inputs :-)!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Cut7er you might even benefit of creating your own print function instead of adding the <code>{CLEAR}</code> to every line <code>print(f"\n{YELLOW}Turnier spielen? [T]: ", end='')</code>, you could pass the desired string and colour as parameters and have the print statement in the function itself. That's personally how I would do it</span>
<span class="comment-copy">definitely an idea worth looking into! thank you very much :-)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">that particular idea came to mind very soon, and was answered in my last question on SO - <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52102240/how-to-apply-coloring-formatting-to-the-displayed-text-in-input-function-simi" title="how to apply coloring formatting to the displayed text in input function simi">stackoverflow.com/questions/52102240/â€¦</a> - but since <code>print()</code> and <code>input()</code> do not use the same underlying mechanics, it does not work. So if I insert the {RED} into <code>input(f"{RED}")</code>, it will just display the ANSI string and will not apply any formatting to the inputted words.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">How about turning off <code>autoreset</code> and doing this :  <code>print(f"\n{YELLOW}Turnier spielen? [T]: {RED}", end='')</code> ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">sorry, not working - without autoreset, nothing is colored anymore. And I tried basically anything with placing the ANSI sequences before, after the text, inside print, input... there needs to be something completely different which I'm missing :|</span>
