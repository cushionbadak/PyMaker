<p>this is my code:</p>
<pre><code>class Plant:
    def __init__(self,name):
        self.name = name

class Garden:
    def __init__(self,name):
        self.name = name

    list_of_plants = []

list_of_gardens = []
list_of_gardens.append(Garden("garden1"))
list_of_gardens.append(Garden("garden2"))

list_of_gardens[0].list_of_plants.append(Plant("Basil"))

print("Plant1: ", list_of_gardens[0].list_of_plants[0].name)
print("Plant2: ", list_of_gardens[1].list_of_plants[0].name)
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>Plant1: Basil
Plant2: Basil
</code></pre>
<p>Why does Basil appears in the two nested list? I didn't even affected a value in the second list! Even when I look at the pointers, everything looks good, but append keeps adding values in my other nested lists.</p>

<p>You are assigning <code>list_of_plants</code> to the class, so all class instances will share the same list. You should instead assign it as an attribute of <code>self</code> in the <code>__init__</code> (i.e. indent 4 more spaces as <code>self.list_of_plants = []</code>) so a new list is created for each individual class instance.</p>
