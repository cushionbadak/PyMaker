<p>This is a XML file in which I would like to get the boundary box coordinate using python. You can see that there is a BBox attribute which contains (x1,y1,x2,y2) in hexical string.</p>

<p>I parse the boundary box information using python but the problem is how can I convert this 16 digit hexa value to human readable integer value which we are familiar to see as an object boundary coordinate value.</p>

<p>I used <code>int('hex str', 16)</code> but it gives a big integer value which is obviously not like as a coordinate value of 800x1200 size image. In this case, the BBox first value was '4074145c00000005' and I got after convert  4644359501095370757. </p>
<p>Please give me a solution how to convert this boundary box coordinate into human understandable integer value.</p>

<p>Finally I got the solution to convert this 16 digit hexical string to human understandable decimal/integer value. This value representation use IEEE 784 standard conversion which explained in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html#struct-format-strings" rel="nofollow noreferrer">enter link description here</a>. This 16 digit hexa value used to represent float point conversion for more accurate coordinate position.</p>
<pre><code>tab = ['0000000000000000', '408a500000000000', '4082980000000000', '0000000000000000']
int_val = [int(struct.unpack('!d', str(t).decode('hex'))[0]) for t in tab]
print "convert to int : ", int_val
</code></pre>
<p>The function <code>struct.unpack(format, buffer)</code> use to convert which has two parameter. First parameter is for format <code>!d</code> which <code>d</code> means  Double in C or float in python and <code>!</code> sign use to indicate Byte Order.There are 5 Byte Orders <code>@, =, &lt;, &gt;, !</code> use to represent which format I need to convert.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Would be helpful to know what this values actually mean. Obviously they aren't pixel positions/sizes. By the way: Show code and data as properly formatted text in the question, not as image.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This BBox value is Table coordinates of images which I found in Marmot dataset and they already mentioned those are table coordinates in hexical string.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">These numbers must be measured in some unit. The XML data format documentation should tell which it is.</span>
