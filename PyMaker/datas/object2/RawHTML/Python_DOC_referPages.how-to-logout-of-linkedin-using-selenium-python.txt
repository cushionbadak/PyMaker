<p>The login is successful but it does nothing about the logout code and exits.</p>

<p>You can't rely  on those ember ID's because they are dynamically generated when the page loads.  For example, when I load the page the Sign Out button has <code>id="ember1203"</code>.  Plus, you'll need to click the button to open the dropdown where Sign Out is before you can click it.  Try the following instead of your current logout code:</p>
<pre><code>dropdownButton = driver.find_element_by_css_selector('#nav-settings__dropdown-trigger')
dropdownButton.click()
signoutButton = driver.find_element_by_xpath('//*[@href="/m/logout/"]')
signoutButton.click()
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">On the last line you are retrieving a list of element. <code>logout = driver.find_elements_by_xpath('//*[@id="ember1016"]')</code>. Remove the 's' from <code>find_element(s)</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, it worked. I want to ask one more thing. How to click on the button that has no ahref link in the code for example the home button or My network button on linkedin. Thanks in advance!</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/10959845/sameer-arora">@SameerArora</a> posted an incorrect answer, then immediately downvoted my (correct) answer, I can only assume with the intention of increasing the visibility of his answer.  He deleted his answer after I pointed this out and commented on the errors in his answer.  I don't know why he hasn't either explained or removed his downvote, especially since he made a comment requesting an explanation for <i>my</i> downvote of <i>his</i> obviously wrong answer.</span>
