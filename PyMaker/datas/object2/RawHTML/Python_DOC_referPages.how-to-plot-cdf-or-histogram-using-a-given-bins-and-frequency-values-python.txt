<p>I have a histogram data with two values. The number of sessions binned (buckets) at every 100ms. The following dataframe is sample data for reproducibility. 
How can I generate a Histogram or CDF out of this kind of data <strong>df</strong> ? I appreciate any help or hint.</p>
<pre><code>import pandas as pd

no_of_session = [8228, 6269,4955,4955,3761,3627] 
buckets = [3.0, 2.0, 3.1, 4.0, 3.3 ]
# create empty data frame in pandas
df = pd.DataFrame()
# add a coumn
df['no_of_session']  = no_of_session
df['buckets']  = buckets
</code></pre>

<p>Jack's answer does not take into account "buckets".</p>
<p>By the title of your question, you wish to plot a histogram for already given bins with counts. In this case, see e.g. related question and answer:</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Yes, you're right, I missed the part about the buckets in the question!</span>
