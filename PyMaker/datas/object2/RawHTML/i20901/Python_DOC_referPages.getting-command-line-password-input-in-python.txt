<p>You know how in Linux when you try some Sudo stuff it tells you to enter the password and, as you type, nothing is shown in the terminal window (the password is not shown)?</p>
<p>Is there a way to do that in Python? I'm working on a script that requires so sensitive info and would like for it to be hidden when I'm typing it. </p>
<p>In other words, I want to get the password from the user without showing the password. </p>

<p>Use <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/getpass.html#getpass.getpass" rel="noreferrer"><code>getpass.getpass()</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>password = getpass()
</code></pre>
<p>An optional prompt can be passed as parameter; the default is <code>"Password: "</code>.</p>
<p>Note that this function requires a proper terminal, so it can turn off echoing of typed characters – see <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38878741/getpasswarning-can-not-control-echo-on-the-terminal-when-running-from-idle">“GetPassWarning: Can not control echo on the terminal” when running from IDLE</a> for further details.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">will work, but how can one be careful of a "hacker" that will make a copy of the script and then comment out the line that requires user password?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@asf107: If the hacker can edit the source code, there are other problems to worry about.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@asf107 - The idea behind requesting a password is so that you can pass it along to authenticate with something (IE, I'm using this to request a password to authenticate with an online server). If a hacker commented out the line, the program would simply fail because the server wouldn't be authenticated with anymore. The idea behind using <code>getpass()</code> is so that nobody can look at the source code and find out your password just by reading it, and nobody can get your password by just staring over your shoulder and reading your password off the screen when you type it in.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">"Password: " (with a space after the colon) is the default prompt, so there's often no need to specify it in the call to getpass.getpass().</span>
<span class="comment-copy">getpass is a standard library module that's been around since at least Python 2.5</span>
<span class="comment-copy">this gave me an error <code>Warning (from warnings module):   File "C:\Python27\lib\getpass.py", line 92     return fallback_getpass(prompt, stream) GetPassWarning: Can not control echo on the terminal.

<span class="comment-copy">getpass() Does not work with IDLE. Is there another way to achieve this without getpass()?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">this is windows only but at least it's not repeating the <code>getpass</code> answer. Good</span>
<span class="comment-copy">wont handle backspaces.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm not sure whether your code is for Python 2.x, but this does not work for me. I'm running Python 3.x. First error I got was a TypeError for the 'passwor += x' line. It said: "can't convert bytes object to str implicitly". I changed the line so that I explicitly cast x to string such as: "password += str(x)". But the code still does not work. When I run it, it doesn't prompt me for input, it just prints the asterisk forever.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What is the difference between your answer and others?</span>
