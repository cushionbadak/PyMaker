<p>Just starting to figure Python out. I've read this question and its responses: </p>
<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1936190/is-it-true-that-i-cant-use-curly-braces-in-python">Is it true that I can't use curly braces in Python?</a></p>
<p>and I still can't fathom how curly braces work, especially since pages like Simple Programs:</p>
<p><a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/SimplePrograms" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://wiki.python.org/moin/SimplePrograms</a></p>
<p>use curly braces all over the place. I understand square brackets and regular curved parentheses, but I don't know what's meant by "defining dictionaries" or what they're supposed to represent.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>"Curly Braces" are used in Python to define a dictionary. A dictionary is a data structure that maps one value to another - kind of like how an English dictionary maps a word to its definition.</p>
<p>Python:</p>
<pre><code>dict = {
    "a" : "Apple",
    "b" : "Banana",
}
</code></pre>
<p>They are also used to format strings, instead of the old C style using %, like:</p>
<pre><code>ds = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
x = ['has_{} 1'.format(d) for d in ds]

print x

['has_a 1', 'has_b 1', 'has_c 1', 'has_d 1']
</code></pre>
<p>They are not used to denote code blocks as they are in many "C-like" languages.</p>
<p>C:</p>
<pre><code>if (condition) {
    // do this
}
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>In Python, curly braces are used to define a dictionary.</p>
<pre><code>a={'one':1, 'two':2, 'three':3}
a['one']=1
a['three']=3
</code></pre>
<p>In other languages, { } are used as part of the flow control. Python however used indentation as its flow control because of its focus on readable code.</p>
<pre><code>for entry in entries:
     code....
</code></pre>
<p>There's a little easter egg in Python when it comes to braces. Try running this on the Python Shell and enjoy.</p>
<pre><code>from __future__ import braces
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>In languages like <code>C</code> curly braces (<code>{}</code>) are used to create program blocks used in flow control.  In Python, curly braces are used to define a data structure called a dictionary (a key/value mapping), while white space indentation is used to define program blocks.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Dictionaries in Python are data structures that store key-value pairs. You can use them like associative arrays. Curly braces are used when declaring dictionaries:</p>
<pre><code>d = {'One': 1, 'Two' : 2, 'Three' : 3 }
print d['Two'] # prints "2"
</code></pre>
<p>Curly braces are not used to denote control levels in Python. Instead, Python uses indentation for this purpose.</p>
<p>I think you really need some good resources for learning Python in general. See <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/175001/10077">https://stackoverflow.com/q/175001/10077</a></p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>A dictionary is something like an array that's accessed by keys (e.g. strings,...) rather than just plain sequential numbers. It contains key/value pairs, you can look up values using a key like using a phone book: key=name, number=value.</p>
<p>For defining such a dictionary, you use this syntax using curly braces, see also: <a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/SimplePrograms" rel="nofollow">http://wiki.python.org/moin/SimplePrograms</a></p>

<span class="comment-copy">Is there any way to get Python to use them for code blocks?

<span class="comment-copy">@dumbledad Did you find anything? It seems like a Python-aware screen-reader is called for here - but can it be found?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Curly-braces are also used to denote <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#set-displays" rel="nofollow noreferrer">set literals</a>, which are like dictionary literals, only without any keys or colons (:).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I've been working my way through Learn Python the Hard Way (which is apparently a bit controversial), and have reached the chapter where I'm supposed to download, print and just read code. I keep running across things I don't know, and curly braces are the only thing I can't wrap my head around when I look them up... hence the question.</span>
