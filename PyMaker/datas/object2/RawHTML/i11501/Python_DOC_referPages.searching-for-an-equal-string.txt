<p>I am not sure how to word the question title.</p>
<pre class="lang-python prettyprint-override"><code>a = "Alpha";
b = "Bravo";
c = "Charlie";

fn = input("What is your first name: ")

for fletter in fn.split():
    fl = fletter[0]
</code></pre>
<p>The code above gets the first letter entered. The goal is to then get the first letter to possible check in a while loop to see if the value of fl = one of the starting strings. Is that possible to do? Tips on where to begin?</p>

<h1>Solution 1 [Using a dictionary]</h1>
<p>Also makes things much simpler.</p>
<p>In this case, instead of defining separate variables for each string, you store them in a dictionary. So for example, instead of this:</p>
<pre><code>a = "Alpha"
b = "Bravo"
c = "Charlie"
</code></pre>
<p>You would have this:</p>
<pre><code>letterwords = {"a":"Alpha", "b":"Bravo", "c":"Charlie"}
</code></pre>
<p>This works very similarly to a list, however instead of <em>indexing</em> the dictionary you would reference to separate objects inside a dictionary according to its <em>key</em>. So if the dictionary <code>letterwords</code> is defined as above, you would reference to the string <code>Alpha</code> by calling <code>letterwords["a"]</code>. Therefore, in this case, the code would look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>letterwords = {"a":"Alpha", "b":"Bravo", "c":"Charlie"}
fn = input("Please enter your first name: ")
try:
    letterwords[fn[0]]
except KeyError:
    print("There is no matching variable with that letter in the database.")
</code></pre>
<h1>Solution 2 [Using the eval() function]</h1>
<p><em>Not recommended.</em></p>
<p>This is perfectly possible, with the eval function. <strong>However, you should be aware that this is a quite dangerous function to run, as malicious users can use this to control the console. (Especially if you imported os.)</strong> However, it should get you over the hump for now. Here's the code:</p>
<pre><code>a = "Alpha"
b = "Bravo"
c = "Charlie"
fl = input("Please enter your first name: ")
try:
    compared = eval(fl[0])
except NameError:
    print("Your first name's first letter does not match any strings in the database.")
</code></pre>
<p>More information on the eval() function here: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#eval" rel="nofollow">https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#eval</a></p>
<p>Hope this helped!</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Do you mean comparing the string to the variable name?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Exactly @Jerrybibo</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I've posted an answer. @Gramms</span>
<span class="comment-copy">mmm, I think that you mean <code>eval(fl[0])</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Oh yeah. @Copperfield Fixing the answer now.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">used like this there is no risk in eval, because as far I now nobody can hack anything with just a character, still the dictionary one is the better one</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Copperfield Putting the warning there because I got yelled at for posting an answer with eval() without warning about what it could do. You never know.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Awesome! Thank you @Jerrybibo</span>
