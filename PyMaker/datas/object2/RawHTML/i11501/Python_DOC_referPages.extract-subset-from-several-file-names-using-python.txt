<p>I have a lot of files in a directory with name like:</p>
<p>'data_2000151_avg.txt', 'data_2000251_avg.txt', 'data_2003051_avg.txt'...</p>
<p>Assume that one of them is called fname. I would like to extract a subset from each like so:</p>
<pre><code>fname.split('_')[1][:4]
</code></pre>
<p>This will give as a result, 2000. I want to collect these from all the files in the directory and create a unique list. How do I do that?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You should use os.</p>
<pre><code>import os
dirname = 'PathToFile'
myuniquelist = []
for d in os.listdir(dirname):
    if d.startswith('fname'):
        myuniquelist.append(d.split('_')[1][:4])
</code></pre>
<p>EDIT: Just saw your comment on wanting a set. After the for loop add this line.</p>
<pre><code>myuniquelist = list(set(myuniquelist))
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If unique list means a list of unique values, then a combination of <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/glob.html" rel="nofollow">glob</a> (in case the folder contains files that do not match the desired name format) and set should do the trick:</p>
<pre><code>from glob import glob

uniques = {fname.split('_')[1][:4] for fname in glob('data_*_avg.txt')}
# In case you really do want a list
unique_list = list(uniques)
</code></pre>
<p>This assumes the files reside in the current working directory. Append path as necessary to <code>glob('path/to/data_*_avg.txt')</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>For listing files in directory you can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/os.html#os.listdir" rel="nofollow">os.listdir()</a>. For generating the list of unique values best suitable is <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.5/tutorial/datastructures.html#sets" rel="nofollow">set comprehension</a>.</p>
<pre><code>import os
data = {f.split('_')[1][:4] for f in os.listdir(dir_path)}
list(data) #if you really need a list
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">The files themselves apparently start with "data_", fname was just the var.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">He said to assume one was called "fname", I read to question to mean that he had a bunch of files mixed and wanted to find the fname's.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thanks, I want a unique list of years. E.g. 2000 must not be repeated twice</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That's a set then, you can turn it in to a list if you want, just wrap the set literal with <code>list()</code>.</span>
