<p>I would like to sort the file 'Class1Scores' from highest to lowest. I have used a .txt to save the contents in the following way. </p>
<pre><code>['jim', [0, 0, 8]]
['cllivus', [0, 0, 2]]
['fdfdgfr', [0, 0, 2]]
</code></pre>
<p>When sorted the output should be :</p>
<pre><code>    jim, 8
    cllivus, 2
    fdfdgfr, 2
</code></pre>
<p>Here is the code I have used to develop the task:</p>
<pre><code>from ast import literal_eval
with open("Class1Scores.txt") as f:
    srt = sorted(map(literal_eval, f), key=lambda x:max(map(int, x[1])), reverse=True)
    print(srt)
</code></pre>
<p>I am kind of still confused on how to order this in the same way as the .txt file above?The code works but outputs the data like this:</p>
<pre><code>[['jim', [0, 0, 8]], ['cllivus', [0, 0, 2]], ['fdfdgfr', [0, 0, 2]]]
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I would recommend storing the data in a <em>dict</em> with user as key, their scores as values and to  <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html" rel="nofollow"><em>json</em></a> the data to file but to sort your data in current format you can use <code>ast.literal_eval</code> to get the data back into lists, sort using the max score as the key and specifying <code>reverse=True</code> to sort from highest to lowest:</p>
<pre><code>from ast import literal_eval
with open("in.txt") as f:
    srt = sorted(map(literal_eval, f), key=lambda x:max(map(int, x[1])), reverse=True)
</code></pre>
<p>Which will give you:</p>
<pre><code> [['jim', [0, 0, 8]], ['cllivus', [0, 0, 2]], ['fdfdgfr', [0, 0, 2]]]
</code></pre>
<p>If you want the names sorted alphabetically for a tie you need to change the logic slightly specifying -max and the name as the value to use in a tie removing <code>reverse=True</code> in this case:</p>
<pre><code> key=lambda x: (-max(map(int, x[1])), x[0])
</code></pre>
<p>You should be able to figure the rest out. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">Is there a way to strip it and just take the highest scores for each user?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@joe, the max of each score list is the highest for each user, you already have the data sorted so how do you think you would get what you want?</span>
