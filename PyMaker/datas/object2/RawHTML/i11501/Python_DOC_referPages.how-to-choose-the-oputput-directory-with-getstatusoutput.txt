<p>i am a beginner in programming.
I have to run a program in python and save the output in a concrete folder, but all the output is saved in my home, could anyone tell me how to choose the directory?</p>
<p>i used this command: </p>
<p><strong>commands.getstatusoutput(cmd)</strong></p>
<p>thanks in advance</p>

<p>I'm assuming you want to know how to choose <strong>WHERE</strong> you can write a file to. Let's say you have the output you want already saved in a variable:</p>
<pre><code>my_output_text = "Some interesting text"
</code></pre>
<p>Typically, you should write the output to a place that your program has write-access to. Because you have full write-access to your home directory, that's probably why it is currently pointing there. You can also use a temp directory like <code>/tmp/</code> on most *nix based systems. Simply create a variable to that file like this:</p>
<pre><code>my_preferred_output_file = '/tmp/my_output.txt'  # this can be anywhere your program has write-access to
</code></pre>
<p>Then write code that saves to it. One quick way is you use a <code>with</code> context manager:</p>
<pre><code>with open(my_preferred_output_file, 'w') as outfile:
    outfile.write(my_output_text)
</code></pre>
<p>Another method is to use logging.</p>
<pre><code>import logging
logging.basicConfig(filemode='w', filename=my_preferred_output_file, level=logging.INFO)

log = logging.getLogger('output_log')  # this just names your logger
log.info(my_output_text)
</code></pre>
