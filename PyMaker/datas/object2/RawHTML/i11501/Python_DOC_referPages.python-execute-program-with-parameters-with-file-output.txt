<p>I am trying to use Python to run an executable (Windows 7) with parameters. I have been able to make the program run, but the amount of parameters I can use that will prove the Python script worked with parameters is limited. The best one is formatted like so:</p>
<p>-debugoutput debug.txt</p>
<p>I have tested this using a windows shortcut with an edited target and it works, it creates a debug output in the program directory.</p>
<p>Here is the code I am using:</p>
<pre><code>import subprocess
args = [r"C:\Users\MyName\LevelEditor\LevelEditor.exe", "-debugoutput debug.txt"]
subprocess.call(args)
</code></pre>
<p>This does run the program, but the debug output is not created. I have tried putting an "r" in front of the parameter but this made no difference. I assume it is a simple formatting error but I can't find any examples to learn from that are doing the same thing.</p>
<p>UPDATE:</p>
<p>Thanks for the answers everyone, all the same, simple formatting error indeed.</p>

<p>In-code definition results in invocation of shell command line:</p>
<pre><code>C:\Users\MyName\LevelEditor\LevelEditor.exe "-debugoutput debug.txt"
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, by merging <code>-debugoutput debug.txt</code> to single list element, you explicitly stated that space between them shouldn't be parsed as command line argument separator.</p>
<p>To achieve expected behavior put file name string as separate element to argument list.</p>
<pre><code>[r"C:\Users\MyName\LevelEditor\LevelEditor.exe", "-debugoutput", "debug.txt"]
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>As far as I know you need to split the arguments by the space, so your args would look like:</p>
<pre><code>args = [r"C:\Users\MyName\LevelEditor\LevelEditor.exe", "-debugoutput", "debug.txt"]
</code></pre>
<p>Does that work?</p>

<p>I do not know if it works, but </p>

subprocess.run(args)

<span class="comment-copy">there can be amiguity due to the space, have you tried args = ['"yourpath.exe", "-debugoutput", "debug.txt"] ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I do not know if it works, but <code>import subprocess args = [r"C:\Users\MyName\LevelEditor\LevelEditor.exe", "-debugoutput", "debug.txt"] subprocess.run(args)</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Splitting up the parameter does work, I don't know why I didn't think of trying that.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, that worked. The output is appearing in the wrong folder (I had to search for it), but it is running the program with the parameter.</span>
