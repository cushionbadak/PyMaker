<p>I am making a program that is supposed to encrypt the password you pass in. However, whenever I run it, it raises an error:</p>
<pre><code>Password = float(input('Enter Password: '))

<p>In Python 3.x, <code>input</code> will return a string. You can read about it in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input" rel="nofollow">the PyDocs</a>. When you gave Python the input <code>Banana</code>, it is confused. You can't convert <code>Banana</code> to a <code>float</code> type. If you are looking at converting the string into a set of indexes for your program, you can try this (note the 3 new functions I added and implemented into your code):</p>

<p>Of course, this is a weak encryption, if you want better encryption (the stuff used by professionals), take a look at <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pycrypto" rel="nofollow">pycrypto</a>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">The error is very clear: <code>ValueError: could not convert string to float: 'Banana'</code> You can't convert <code>Banana</code> to a float..</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The answer comes directly from the error message, 'banana' is not a number. Why are you using <code>float</code> in <code>Password = float(input('Enter Password: '))</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Also, it's very wrong to be able to decrypt users passwords . But if it's for fun, then it's okay . As for your problem, as others said, you need to delete the 'float(...)' .</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This was just one of my personal learning projects. I do not intend on doing any illegal activity with this</span>
<span class="comment-copy">People aren't worried that you are going to do anything illegal.  They are worried that you are going to implement this and think that it is "secure" or "safe".</span>
