<p>I have two python scripts, one has all functions I have defined (<strong>functions.py</strong>) and the other only runs those functions (<strong>running_functions.py</strong>).
I imported the functions into <strong>running_functions</strong> script using <code>from functions import*</code> </p>
<p>My problem is when I ran <strong>running_functions</strong> into python console using <code>execfile('running_functions.py')</code> at first worked like a charm, but if I don't close the python session and do some modifications into one function in <strong>functions.py</strong> (for example changing the number of parameters that <code>getLabels()</code> takes (from 4 to 5)) saved then and then I ran again <strong>running_functions.py</strong> with the same comand or when I called <code>getLabels()</code> I get the error: </p>
<p><strong>With execfile()</strong></p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
  File "running_functions.py", line 82, in &lt;module&gt;
    predict_labels = getLabels(pred_labels, ids_tr ,labels_tr,filenames_tr, filenames_ts)
TypeError: getLabels() takes exactly 4 arguments (5 given)
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Calling the function</strong></p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; predict_labels = getLabels(pred_labels, ids_tr ,labels_tr,filenames_tr, filenames_ts)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
TypeError: getLabels() takes exactly 4 arguments (5 given)
</code></pre>
<p>To get it work again I have to close python session and then run again <code>execfile()</code> or rename <code>functions.py</code> or do little pythons scripts with modified function.</p>
<p>This is very annoying because all the code takes around 10 or 15 minutes and I don't like have a lot of little scripts. So, how can I avoid this error?
I wouldn't like to close every time the session and wouldn't like to use in each function pickle module. Is it wrong the way I imported the functions? And why python returns this error? Sorry for this silly questions</p>

<p>I would recommend skimming over <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html">how python imports work</a>.  In general it's considered bad practice to use glob imports like <code>from module import *</code>.  It's not transparent and makes it difficult to take advantage of <code>reload</code>.</p>
<p>I would recommend rewriting your code to do the following :</p>
<pre><code>import functions

functions.getLabels(...)
</code></pre>
<p>and then after you change getLabels or something, you can from the shell run the following :</p>
<pre><code>reload(functions)
</code></pre>
<p>and that will re-import your changes without having to restart the python kernel.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I strongly recommend just restarting Python. There are ways to edit files you've imported and use the changed versions, but they all have caveats and messy edge cases.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">Woa, thanks, @Thomas it works great</span>
