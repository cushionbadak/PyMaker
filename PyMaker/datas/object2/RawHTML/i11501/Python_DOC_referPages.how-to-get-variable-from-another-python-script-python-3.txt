<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have 2 Python 3.5 scripts, boot.py and about.py. Boot.py is located in /os, but about.py is located in /os/bin. Boot.py starts about.py with <code>os.system(/path/about.py)</code>. The problem is that about.py requires variables that are in boot.py, and i dont want to rewrite them all over again. So i need to start about.py in a way that it can read/use the variables in boot.py. If its unclear, i posted the codes down below.</p>
<p>boot.py:</p>
<pre><code>#Boot.py
import os
import subprocess
import socket
import platform
import multiprocessing
import time
import datetime
from random import randint
#Create functions
def cls():
    os.system('cls' if os.name=='nt' else 'clear')
#Set the variables
prj_name = 'boot.py'
prj_build = 1.01
prj_developer = 'RED'
#Bunch of print() and input() commands below
</code></pre>
<p>about.py:</p>
<pre><code>#Somehow get the variables and functions defined in boot.py
print('This project is made by ' + prj_developer)
print('Build: ' + prj_build)
print('Launched by: ' + prj_name)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Simply import the other file.
By doing so the file will be run and the variables defined.</p>
<pre><code>from boot import *
print('This project is made by ' + prj_developer)
print('Build: ' + prj_build)
print('Launched by: ' + prj_name)
</code></pre>
<p>I would also recommend putting all code of the other file, that shouldn't run when imported in a if statement (not necessary in this case though):</p>
<pre><code>if __name__ == "__main__":
    pass # only run if file is executed directly (not from importing)
</code></pre>
<p>If the <code>boot.py</code> file is the directory above you would write (add a . for every parent directory):</p>
<pre><code>from .. import boot.*
</code></pre>
<p>If the <code>boot.py</code> file is the directory above you would write (make sure to put a empty file called <code>__init__.py</code> in any subdirectories you are importing from):</p>
<pre><code>from DIRECTORY.boot import *
</code></pre>
</div>

<span class="comment-copy">Then you need to use relative imports. see <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/72852/how-to-do-relative-imports-in-python" title="how to do relative imports in python">stackoverflow.com/questions/72852/…</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">How do i do that?</span>
