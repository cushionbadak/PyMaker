<p>I am using Python 3.3.5.   I have a pyd file I created in Visual Studio 2015 which is really a C++ dll from what I understand.   How do I export my C++ methods to Python? Can someone please provide a sample or at least point me to the right documentation that describes how to do this?</p>

<p>In given scenario this should be easy, just take a look at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/faq/windows.html#is-a-pyd-file-the-same-as-a-dll" rel="nofollow">this faq question</a> for requirements. If they are met (they should be) then you can just import that module.</p>
<p>If this is not exactly what you are looking for you can look around boost.python library in <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_60_0/libs/python/doc/html/index.html" rel="nofollow">boost.python documentation</a>. There are some easy tutorials there that you can look through to see if this is what you need.</p>
