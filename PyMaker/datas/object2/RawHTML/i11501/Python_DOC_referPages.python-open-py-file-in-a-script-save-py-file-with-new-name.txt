<p>I want to open an existing .py file within a python-script. Then i want to save that file but with a new filename. The result should be 2 identical .py files with different names. Would be great, if somebody could explain me how that works. Thank you</p>

<pre><code>with open('first_file.py', 'r') as input:

<p>The result is two identical files:</p>
