<p>I need to access the <strong>date of creation</strong> of a file using Python.
As suggested in many posts, I am using <code>os.stat(filename)</code> to get such information.
However, the result I get is different from the one I expect.
Here an example:</p>
<pre><code>import os, time
f = 'untitled.ipynb' # Created 30 March 2016 at 15:45
fileStats = os.stat(f)
time.ctime(fileStats.st_ctime)
</code></pre>
<p>The result is :</p>
<pre><code>'Mon May  2 16:04:27 2016'
</code></pre>
<p>Which is incorrect, if I look for it using "Get Info" (in OSX), I get:</p>
<pre><code>"Created: 30 March 2016 at 15:45"
</code></pre>
<p>Does anyone experience the same error?</p>
<p>Do you have any solution to suggest?</p>

<p>accordint to the documentation at <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/os.html" rel="nofollow">https://docs.python.org/2/library/os.html</a>:<br/>
since you are using OSX, what you need is <code>st_birthtime</code> instead of <code>st_ctime</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>st_ctime</code> - platform dependent; time of most recent metadata change on Unix, or the time of creation on Windows.  </p>
<p>On other Unix systems (such as FreeBSD), the following attributes may be available (but may be only filled out if root tries to use them):</p>
<p><code>st_birthtime</code> - time of file creation</p>
