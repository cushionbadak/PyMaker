<p>I'm intrigued by the following statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When a class definition is left normally (via the end), a <em>class object</em> is created. <em>(from the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#class-definition-syntax" rel="nofollow" title="Python tutorial, section 9.3.1. Class Definition Syntax">Python tutorial</a>)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In what other ways can the class definition "be left"? I can think of a <code>SyntaxError</code>. Are there other ways?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Here's another way:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; class A:
...     x = y
... 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 2, in A
NameError: name 'y' is not defined
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I believe the phrase "When a class definition is left normally (via the end)" refers to how Python builds your object class definitions during the first phase of compilation.</p>
<p>Suppose you declare a class:</p>
<pre><code># &lt;--- `Foo` is NOT defined as a class object in this context

class Foo:
  def say_hello(self):
    # Whatever
    pass

  # &lt;--- Interpreter leaves class declaration here

# &lt;--- `Foo` is now defined as a class object in this context

type(Foo)  # Returns `&lt;type 'classobj'&gt;`
</code></pre>
<p>Before you actually execute your program, the Python compiler does a pass through your code to build an index of object and class definitions that will be used as your program runs (often referred to as a "symbol table"). When it reaches <code>class Foo</code> it begins interpreting the following lines as the class definition for <code>Foo</code> until the last indented line is reached and the compiler at which point <code>Foo</code> is now a defined symbol in our index and Python goes on its way running the rest of your program.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Any other exception.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Of course! I was thinking that anything inside the <code>class</code> block would only be executed when I actually built an instance of the class. But statements that are not function definitions get executed right away.</span>
