<p>I have 10 records: </p>
<p>Query Like: <code>result = select * from employee</code>
Here I got 10 records. Then applying slicing on those records to show as per my requirement</p>
<pre><code>r = result[1:3]
</code></pre>
<p>I showing 3 records from index 0 to 2. Here I want to count the number of records r variable contains exactly. At the end I am applying slicing as [9:12]. But it contains only 1 record at the end. So how I can get exact number of records after slicing done to my result set.</p>
<p>I tried with below:</p>
<pre><code>count = r.count()
</code></pre>
<p>Then got the error like below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>AttributeError: 'long' object has no attribute 'count'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Any help help will be appreciated. Thanks</p>

<p>Use the builtin function <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#len" rel="nofollow"><code>len</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>len(r)

<span class="comment-copy">Note that <code>result[1:3]</code> is giving a list with <i>two</i> records with index 1 and 2.</span>
