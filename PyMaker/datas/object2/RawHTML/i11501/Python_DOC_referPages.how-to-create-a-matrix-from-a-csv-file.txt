<p>I have been trying for two hours to create a table of values from a matrix and so far i have been able to create a column from the csv file. I know this is going to be easy for everybody, but when reading from a csv file, i cant seem to phrase it right so would people please put me in the right direction?</p>
<pre><code>import csv

file = open('data.csv', 'rU')
reader = csv.reader(file)

for row in reader:
    print row[0]
</code></pre>
<p>so far I can only print out the first column, any advice guys?</p>

<p>You can do it with a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions" rel="nofollow">list comprehension</a>:</p>
<pre><code>import csv

with open('data.csv', 'rU') as file:
    table = [row for row in csv.reader(file)]

print(table)
</code></pre>
<p>This will create a list of lists where each sublist is a row of the csv file.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>In your code <em>row</em> is a list of all the columns, So:</p>
<p><em>row[0]</em> is the first column, <em>row[1]</em> is the second etc.</p>
<p>you can write:</p>
<pre><code>print(str(row))
</code></pre>
<p>to print all the columns, or iterate over the with:</p>
<pre><code>for column in row:
    print(column)
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">what exactly are you trying to do? print the <code>data.csv</code>? if so, just do <code>print row</code> instead of print <code>row[0]</code></span>
