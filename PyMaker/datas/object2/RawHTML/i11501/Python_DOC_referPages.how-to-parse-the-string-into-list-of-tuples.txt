<p>I have a string of the format -</p>
<pre><code>" ( (4, 4), (11, 23), (8, 2), (12, 4), (7, 9) ) "
</code></pre>
<p>What is the best way in which I will get this string into meaningful integer tuples?
Lets say <code>fun(s)</code> is a function which takes such <code>string</code> <code>s</code> as parameter and returns <code>list</code> of <code>tuple</code> <code>a</code></p>
<p>Ex.</p>
<pre><code>a = fun("( (2, 3), (1, 4) )")
print (a)
&gt;&gt;&gt; [(2, 3), (1, 4)]
a[0]
&gt;&gt;&gt; (2, 3)
a[0][1]
&gt;&gt;&gt; 3
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use Python's built-in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#eval" rel="nofollow">eval()</a> function.</p>
<p>In this case, you can write your code like this:</p>
<pre><code>s = " ( (4, 4), (11, 23), (8, 2), (12, 4), (7, 9) ) "
print(list(eval(s)))
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>For this kind of thing, <code>ast.literal_eval</code> is preferred to just the built-in <code>eval</code>, especially if the string is something that may come from an unknown source. The call interface is the same as <code>eval</code>:</p>
<pre><code>print(list(ast.literal_eval(s)))
</code></pre>
<p>However, <code>ast.literal_eval</code> will guard against code insertions that may call system services (such as those that might delete files, etc.), and only accept literal values.</p>
