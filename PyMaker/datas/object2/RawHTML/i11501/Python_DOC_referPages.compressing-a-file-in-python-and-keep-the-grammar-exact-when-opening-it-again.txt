<p>I'm trying to find some code for my course work and I can't for the life of me find any. I need a piece of code that I can use that will compress a text file in Python, and then can be opened again while keeping all of the grammar in the exact same place? Any help would be great. Thanks :)</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>import zlib, base64
text = 'STACK OVERFLOW'
code =  base64.b64encode(zlib.compress(text,9))
print code
</code></pre>
<p>which gives :</p>
<pre><code>eNoLDnF09lbwD3MNcvPxD1cIHhxcAE9UKaU=
</code></pre>
<p>Now I can copy this code to a different program to get the original program back:</p>
<pre><code>import zlib, base64
s='eNoLDnF09lbwD3MNcvPxD1cIHhxcAE9UKaU='
data = zlib.decompress(base64.b64decode(s))
print data
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>T = 'blah blah blah blah'
S = zlib.compress(T)
with open("temp.zlib", "wb") as myfile:
    myfile.write(S)
</code></pre>
<p>This saves the compressed string in a file called temp.zlib so that program 2 can later retrieve and decompress it.</p>
<p>Program 2:</p>
<pre><code>with open("temp.zlib", "rb") as myfile:
    S = myfile.read()
T = zlib.decompress(S)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks a lot. Hope it works.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">they both work...</span>
