<p>Python variable names can only start with an underscore or letter, not a digit. Digits can be used anywhere else in a name, just not at the start.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#identifiers" rel="nofollow"><em>Identifiers and keywords</em> section</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Within the ASCII range (U+0001..U+007F), the valid characters for identifiers are the same as in Python 2.x: the uppercase and lowercase letters A through Z, the underscore _ <strong>and, except for the first character, the digits 0 through 9.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bold emphasis mine. Python 3 supports Unicode variable names so characters outside the ASCII range can be used. See the above link for the full details.</p>
