<p>i've done a bit of code that basically finds the index of words in a sentence but i don't really understand what i've done and the what is the function of the enumerate ?</p>
<pre><code>    sentence = ['The', 'cat','sat', 'on', 'the', 'mat']
    for index, word in enumerate(sentence):
        print (index, word)
</code></pre>

<p>the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.3/library/functions.html#enumerate" rel="nofollow">documentation</a> will tell you more then you need to know:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Return an enumerate object. iterable must be a sequence, an iterator, or some other object which supports iteration. The <code>__next__()</code> method of the iterator returned by enumerate() returns a tuple containing a count (from start which defaults to 0) and the values obtained from iterating over iterable.</p>
<p>Equivalent to:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>def enumerate(sequence, start=0):
    n = start
    for elem in sequence:
        yield n, elem
        n += 1
</code></pre>
