<p>This is the data I have in my <code>data.txt</code> file</p>
<pre><code>{"setup": "test", "punchline": "ok", "numOfRatings": 0, "sumOfRatings": 0},
{"setup": "test2", "punchline": "ok2", "numOfRatings": 0, "sumOfRatings": 0}
</code></pre>
<p>How would I be able to get only data from every <code>setup</code> in the 
dictionaries using a loop?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>I'm not sure how you're getting the dictionaries into your text file in the first place, but if it's possible to drop the trailing commas, i.e.</p>
<pre><code>{"setup": "test", "punchline": "ok", "numOfRatings": 0, "sumOfRatings": 0}
{"setup": "test2", "punchline": "ok2", "numOfRatings": 0, "sumOfRatings": 0}
</code></pre>
<p>Something like this may work for you:</p>
<pre><code>def dicts_from_file(file):
    dicts_from_file = []
    with open(file,'r') as inf:
        for line in inf:
            dicts_from_file.append(eval(line))
    return dicts_from_file

def get_setups(dicts):
    setups = []
    for dict in dicts:
        for key in dict:
            if key == "setup":
                setups.append(dict[key])
    return setups

print get_setups(dicts_from_file("data.txt"))
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>    f = open('data')
    for line in f:
        d = ast.literal_eval(line)[0]
        print d['setup']
</code></pre>
<p>for this code you need to put ',' after every line because  ast.literal_eval(line) convert line into a tuple.</p>
<p>and if you do not have ',' after every dict then use this </p>
<pre><code>f = open('data')
for line in f:
   d = ast.literal_eval(line)
   print d['setup']
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can try this if the line in your file is standard dict string.</p>
<pre><code>def get_setup_from_file(file_name):
    result = []
    f = open(file_name, "r")
    for line in f.xreadlines():
        # or  line_dict = json.loads(line)
        line_dict = eval(line)  # if line end witch ',', try eval(line[0:-1])
        result.append(line_dict["setup"])
    return result
</code></pre>
<p>Wish this can help you.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>if it is standard dict string, try this:</p>
<pre><code>with open(file,'r') as file_input:
    for line in file_input:
        print eval(line).get("setup")

<span class="comment-copy">Is this data in JSON format? It looks like it. If so, have you tried using the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>json</code></a> module? If it didn't work, what was the error message or problem?
