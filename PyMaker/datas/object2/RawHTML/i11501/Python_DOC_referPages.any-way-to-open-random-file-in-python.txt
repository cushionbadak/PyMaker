<p>So I'm making a sudoku game wherein I should get the board of the game from a file (the given numbers) and there should be many files to choose from. </p>
<p>I can only think of is:</p>
<pre><code>if choice==1:
    sudoku=open(file1, "r+")
</code></pre>
<p>and so on but it would take many lines by just opening a file.
Is there a way to open random file in python3?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you want to open a file based on user input, you are looking to format strings, using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.format" rel="nofollow"><code>str.format</code></a>.</p>
<p>Let's say the user choice is <code>choice</code>, and each file is labeled as <code>game1</code>, <code>game2</code>, <code>game3</code>, etc. That is, the Sudoku game for <code>choice</code> is prepended by <code>game</code>.</p>
<p>To get the path of the file, you want to use</p>
<pre><code>path = "game{number}".format(number = choice)
</code></pre>
<p>Then, just open it as usual. Putting it all together:</p>
<pre><code>choice = int(input("Enter a file number: "))
path = "game{number}".format(number = choice)
sudoku = open(path, "r+")
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You could theoretically put several filenames into a list, then use the random.choice() method. Here's the code:</p>
<pre><code>listOfFiles = [file1, file2, file3]
selectedFile = random.choice(listOfFiles)
</code></pre>
<p>Then you can load and operate on the randomly chosen file.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You want something like <code>sudoku = open("file{}".format(choice), 'r+')</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">use the documentation, this is not a read the documentation for me service.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You should read the documentation on <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.format" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>.format()</code></a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">thank you. it worked</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Read more than the question's title.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you mean open a file by <code>load</code>, that would be a bad choice â€“ you would quickly run out of file descriptors if you had many files. Plus, opening many files, and then picking one out of those, is a lot more expensive than simply picking a random path first and then opening that.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@RushyPanchal Not what I meant, oops. Answer updated.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The question is actually not related to random choices. I recommend giving <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/9731/fastest-gun-in-the-west-problem">this</a> a read.</span>
