<p>I'm using Python 3.x on windows.</p>
<p>Should I use the <code># -*- coding: utf-8 -*-</code> declaration on my files?
I have read many topics and I think the answer is no but i'm not sure.</p>
<p>Btw i'm writing only in english and italian.
Maybe you have to know something else but i don't know what... so ask me</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<p><a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3120/" rel="noreferrer">PEP 3120</a> defines UTF-8 as the default source encoding for Python 3.x. If you save the file as that encoding (or as ASCII, of course) then no encoding declaration is required.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">If you plan write Py2/Py3 portable code, indeed. Btw. <code>-*-</code> sequences are redundant.</span>
