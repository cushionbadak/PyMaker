<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>So I am trying to create a program that has a class called "Loan" which calculates the monthly payment and total payment of a car with data fields. I'm guessing that my error is caused by having a method ( getMonthlyPayment() ) in the method ( getTotalPayment ). How do I put a method inside a method? Or is there another solution to my problem? </p>
<p>Thanks!<br/>
My error is:</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Just like accessing members, you need to prepend all accesses to methods with <code>self.</code>.</p>
<p>Change <code>getTotalPayment()</code> to</p>
<pre><code>return self.getMonthlyPayment() * self.__NumYearsLoans * 12
</code></pre>
<p>Also, take a look at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#property" rel="nofollow"><code>property</code></a> to make getters and setters less painful. However, most of the time, you shouldn't even be defining getters and setters in Python. Private-ness is not usually treated as a concept in idiomatic Python.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Bean-style getters and setters in Python? The horror! Also, you're missing <code>self.</code> before accessing instance methods. Python is explicit.</span>
