<pre><code>import csv
with open('some.csv', 'wb') as f:
    writer = csv.writer(f)
    writer.writerows(someiterable)
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Explanation of the code</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Imports the csv class</li>
<li>Open's the file "some.csv" and gives it a name f we can use to reference it</li>
<li>"wb" is the file mode, write binary. This would be "rb" if we just wanted to read.</li>
<li>We create a new writer object using the csv classes function, writer, passing it in our file</li>
<li>We call write rows on our writer object, passing it in any iterable object</li>
</ol>
<p>An iterable could be a simple list, e.g.</p>
<pre><code>my_iterable = ["Printed to line 1", "Printed to line 2"]
</code></pre>

<p>As you say that you have a stock "list", i would prefer to write to a .csv using pandas. Considering you have a list of stocks named "stock_list"</p>
<pre><code>stock_list = [list of elements]

import pandas as pd
df = pd.DataFrame(stock_list, columns=["whatever name you want to give"])

df.to_csv("path to which you need to save", index=True/False (Depends on whether you need the index or not))
</code></pre>
