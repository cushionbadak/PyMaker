<p>I have something like:</p>
<pre><code>a = [4,3,1,6,3,5,3]
b = [4,2,6]
</code></pre>
<p>and I wanted to remove the 3 elements of b from a.  I was trying to do:</p>
<pre><code>c = a - b
</code></pre>
<p>but I was thinking that the inverse of merge (<code>+</code>) might not be a thing, and was correct:  <em>Unsupported Operand types for -: list and list</em>.  I was contemplating just looping over them, but that just doesnt really sound pythony.</p>
<p>My end state is going to be:  <code>c = [3,1,3,5,3]</code></p>
<p>If you had not noticed, b is not a subset of a and these are unordered.   2 different sets, these sets are not unique either, but only want to remove 1 instance per <code>i in b</code>, not all instance of <code>i in b</code></p>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong> It seems that the current answer does not resolve my question.</p>
<pre><code>a = [1,1,2,2,2,3,4,5]
b = [1,3]
c = [x for x in a if x not in b]
#c result is [2,2,2,4,5]
</code></pre>
<p>I want c to return: <code>[1,2,2,2,4,5]</code></p>
<p>For the sake of speed typing, I just put sorted numbers, but the lists ARE IN FACT unsorted, though for the sake of cleanliness we can sort them.<br/><br/>
They are just unsorted at init.  <em>Since there are duplicates in list items, I can't use a set as per the definition of set.</em></p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>As you noted you only want to remove the items once per occurrence:   </p>
<pre><code>for x in [tmp for tmp in b if tmp in a]:
        a.remove(x)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use the following code:</p>
<pre><code>[x for x in a if x not in b]
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>As input and output lists are unordered, use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.Counter" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Counter</a> is a way to go:</p>
<pre><code>from collections import Counter

a = [4,3,1,6,3,5,3]
b = [4,2,6]
c = list((Counter(a) - Counter(b)).elements())

print(c)
</code></pre>
<p>This solution handles the following case differently than <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/37190134/3077939">ysearka answer</a>:</p>
<pre><code>a = [4,3,1,6,3,5,3]
b = [3]
</code></pre>
<p>Where many answers here leads to <code>c = [4,1,6,5]</code>, the one using Counter will outputs <code>c = [4,1,6,3,3,5]</code>.</p>
<p>This behavior is also implemented by <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/37190200/3077939">DAXaholic answer</a>, but with modification of an existing list, which is not a pythonic way to go, and could be costly on big lists.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>for x in b:
    while x in a:
        a.remove(x)
</code></pre>
<p>Now <code>a</code> is</p>
<pre><code>[3, 1, 3, 5, 3]
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Are these sets or lists?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">lists, sorry, wrong wordage</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Your last paragraph is not clear. If there is a <code>4</code> in list <code>b</code> and there are two occurrences of <code>4</code> in list <code>a</code>, do you want to remove one of the <code>4</code>'s or all of the <code>4</code>'s from <code>a</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><b>For the Record</b>  The duplicates are not the correct answer, nor is ysearka's.....    DAX gave me the correct answer, as i only wanted to remove a particular number of instances, not <i>all</i> of a particular type.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">is it possible to not override a and just do assignment to a new varaible?  Just something like:<code>c = [x for x in a]\n  for x in [tmp for tmp in b if tmp in c]: c.remove(x)</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">You could use e.g. aluriak's answer which has a few more lines but does not mutate your lists.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is what i was thinking of, but couldnt get it down.  For some reason, i kept trying to leverage bitwise operation on the lists.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Fallenreaper: "but only want to remove 1 instance per i in b, not all instance of i in b" -&gt; if this is a working answer then please adjust your question, as currently your last paragraph conflicts with this answer ...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@DAXaholic you are in fact correct.  I ran the code snipperts and noticed this wasnt the answer.</span>
