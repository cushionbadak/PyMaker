<p>I want convert the values into an array in Python and keep the same order (<strong>row and column</strong>). How I can achieve this? </p>
<p>I have tried different functions but ended with error.</p>

<p>You should use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html" rel="noreferrer"><code>csv</code></a> module:</p>
<pre><code>import csv

results = []
with open("input.csv") as csvfile:
    reader = csv.reader(csvfile, quoting=csv.QUOTE_NONNUMERIC) # change contents to floats
    for row in reader: # each row is a list
        results.append(row)
</code></pre>
<p>This gives:</p>
<pre><code>[[0.000264, 0.000352, 8.7e-05, 0.000549], 
[0.00016, 0.000223, 1.1e-05, 0.000142], 
[0.008853, 0.006519, 0.002043, 0.009819], 
[0.002076, 0.001686, 0.000959, 0.003107], 
[0.000599, 0.000133, 0.000113, 0.000466], 
[0.002264, 0.001927, 0.00079, 0.003815],

<p>The <code>csv</code> module was created to do just this. The following implementation of the module is taken straight from the <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/csv.html" rel="nofollow">Python docs</a>.  </p>
<pre><code>import csv 
with open('file.csv','rb') as csvfile: 
    reader = csv.reader(csvfile, delimiter=',', quotechar='|') 
    for row in reader:
        #add data to list or other data structure
</code></pre>
<p>The delimiter is the character that separates data entries, and the quotechar is the quotechar. </p>

<p>If your file doesn't contain parentheses</p>

<span class="comment-copy">what is error? and how are you attempting to read the csv file? are you using the <code>csv</code> module?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">is not a error, I dont know how convert to cvs to array</span>

<span class="comment-copy">Does your CSV file actually contain the parentheses <code>( )</code>? If so, it's not valid CSV. How was the file generated?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MattDMo dont have parathesis, do have any idea how I can convert from cvs to array, keep the same orden</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm assuming the OP wants the original floats, not strings...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, I the original float, one per cell in the array. @MattDMo</span>
