<p>I've been having some trouble installing Python packages and then I noticed that pip and Python were in different spots, which could be the problem. How do I align them back up?</p>
<pre><code>Macintosh:~ Ryan$ which python
/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin/python
Macintosh:~ Ryan$ which pip
/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.5/bin/pip
</code></pre>
<p>And</p>
<pre><code>Macintosh:~ Ryan$ python -V
Python 2.7.11
Macintosh:~ Ryan$ pip -V
pip 8.1.2 from /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.5/lib/python3.5/site-packages (python 3.5)
</code></pre>
<p>I'd like for everything to use 2.7 and hoping that fixing this will stop me from getting so many errors/notifications when I try to install certain packages like this:</p>
<pre><code>Macintosh:~ Ryan$ pip install json
Collecting json
  Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement json (from versions: )
No matching distribution found for json
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you want to set up <code>pip</code> for 2.7, just download <a href="https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py" rel="nofollow"><code>get-pip.py</code></a> and run </p>
<pre><code>sudo /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin/python get-pip.py
</code></pre>
<p>and it will install <code>pip</code> and <code>pip2</code> for you in the same <code>bin</code> directory as the <code>python</code> executable. You should still be able to install packages for Python 3 using <code>pip3</code> or <code>pip-3.5</code>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Well, first off, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>json</code></a> is part of the stdlib, and so not pip-installable.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MattDMo       Thanks -- New to Python, so maybe I just don't know the differences between some of them? Though is it important to get the paths matched back up?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm writing an answer for that. Is there a particular reason you want to use Python 2 for everything?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MattDMo       Not really -- I'm just a beginner and I learned the basics through CodeAcademy and they teach it in Python 2 so I figured that'd be the best bet. Open to using whatever more advanced folks think I should be using -- just didn't want to have things break because of minor changes I don't fully understand.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ok, not sure how you have 2.6 installed. Anyway  I would recommend using virtualenvs, most people coming to python end up with a lot of headaches from having multiple installs and things getting all mixed up,  a virtuaenv is also isolated from your system python which is pretty much essential for a working OS so screwing it up can be pretty costly  <a href="http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs</a>. Also pyenv is another nice option <a href="https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv" rel="nofollow noreferrer">github.com/yyuu/pyenv</a>, its just a matter of activating whichever version you want to use</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks! Do I have to put get-pip.py in that folder first? Right now it's on my desktop. If I run that as is, I get no errors but it still looks like the paths don't match up. Also based on your answer above, I suppose I'm open to making Python match up by using 3 instead?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Ryan You don't have to move <code>get-pip.py</code>, just use Terminal and navigate to your Desktop folder, then run the command above. If you want to use Python 3 as your primary Python version, you shouldn't have to do anything, just remember to write <code>python3 my_file.py</code> when running it in Terminal. <code>pip</code> is already set up for Python 3, as you indicated in your question. It's your choice whether or not to set it up for 2 now, or do it later as you explore the differences between 2 and 3.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks again -- it says <code>UserWarning: Module pip was already imported from /tmp/tmpQS4RbJ/pip.zip/pip/__init__.py, but /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/pip-7.1.0-py2.7.egg is being added to sys.path</code> and when I do <code>which pip</code> it still says <code>/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.5/bin/pip</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Ryan did you use the full command I gave in my answer, or just <code>sudo python get-pip.py</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I went to <code>cd desktop</code> (where my get-pip.py file lives) then ran <code>sudo /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin/python get-pip.py</code> (typed in my password) and sent back some of the message I get back.</span>
