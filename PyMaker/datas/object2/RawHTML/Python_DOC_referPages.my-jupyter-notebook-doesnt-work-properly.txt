<p>It worked well yesterday on Windows.</p>
<p>But in the morning today when I ran Jupyter in my environment and Chrome showed up, it didn't show anything but white.</p>
<p>Like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wbaXT.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Webpage</a> and <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vfojo.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Cmd</a>.</p>
<p>I turned off the firewall, checked my hosts and runned</p>
<pre><code>pip install --upgrade jupyterhub
</code></pre>
<p>But nothing happend.</p>
<p>I'm new so I don't know how to deal with it. I'll appreciate it if someone could help me out.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong><em>I find that I can run my jupyter if I click the shortcut "Jupyter Notebook" but I can't run it in my environment.</em></strong> Why?</p>

<p>I solved this problem. Here is the link</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/4467" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/4467</a></p>
<p>The reason is that I'm using a newer version of Jupyter installed by command</p>
<pre><code>conda install jupyter
</code></pre>
<p>which causes the trouble.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Did you start jupyter with <code>jupyter notebook</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes with cmd in my virtual environment.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Did you try the last link in your cmd image?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Clear the browsing history and cookies in the browser. It'll work.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">that link should look something like <code>http://localhost:8888/?token=[gibberish]</code></span>
