<p>I have little python code to work with date and time and I need to ask  question to modify the script. The script is provided below, </p>
<pre><code>from datetime import date, datetime, timedelta
import random


def perdelta(start, end, delta):
    curr = start
    while curr &lt; end:
        yield curr
        curr += delta

s = datetime.now() - timedelta(days=10)
e = datetime.now() - timedelta(days=8)


# start =  2017-10-01 06:44:00.480208
# end =  2017-10-03 06:44:00.480583


# print "\n"
# print "start = ", s
# print "end = ", e
# print "\n"

dates = []

for result in perdelta(s, e, timedelta(seconds=15)):
    print result
</code></pre>
<p>As I print out the result, I get the values like </p>
<pre><code>2017-10-03 06:49:50.009049
2017-10-03 06:50:05.009049
</code></pre>
<p>How do I keep to the 3 digits after the decimal like <code>2017-10-03 06:49:50.349</code>? </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If youâ€™re just interested in the string keeping only the first 3 digits in the microseconds, you can just use string splicing.</p>
<pre><code>for result in perdelta(s, e, timedelta(seconds=15)):
    print (str(result)[:-3])
</code></pre>
<p>A better method which is what ShadowRanger mentioned in the comments, that uses <code>.isoformat(...)</code> to format directly to ISO 8601 with an additional milliseconds time spec. But unfortunately the <code>timespec</code> argument was only recently added in Python 3.6.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Please ask just one question per question.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">you should include your imports when you upload your code so people can help you easier</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Shadow Ok, I have updated it to only one question. However, is this a rule to the SOF to ask only one question per submission? I though these are relevant to each other</span>
<span class="comment-copy">As of 3.6, you could do: <code>result.isoformat(' ', 'milliseconds')</code>, but <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime.isoformat" rel="nofollow noreferrer">that's 3.6 and up only</a>, and it looks like you're on 2.7.</span>
