<p>I used the following code to do so:</p>
<pre><code>import csv
from random_words import RandomWords
rw = RandomWords()
TRACK_TERMS = rw.random_words(count = 400)
with open('RandomWords.csv', 'w') as f:
    writer = csv.writer(f)
    writer.writerows(TRACK_TERMS)
</code></pre>
<p>there are two problems:
the first is that my result on each row is like: each character takes a cell, so cat would be c  a  t   taking 3 columns. If I change the last row of my code to <code>writer.writerow(TRACK_TERMS)</code>  each word will take a cell, but the results are in different columns rather than different rows.</p>
<p>Another problem is that even though I specified count = 400, I have 700 words in my csv, I don't know why. 
TRACK_TERM should be a list of strings, and I want the length of the list to be 400</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Try using this:</p>
<pre><code>import csv

from random_words import RandomWords

rw = RandomWords()
TRACK_TERMS = rw.random_words(count=400)
with open('RandomWords.csv', 'w') as f:
    writer = csv.writer(f, delimiter="\n")
    writer.writerow(TRACK_TERMS)
</code></pre>
<p>You have to use delimiter. You can find more information <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/csv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a></p>

<span class="comment-copy">What is <code>random_words</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">it is a tool used to generate random_words, if you have better solution to do this please tell me too.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What exactly is the output of <code>rw.random_words(count = 400)</code>?  The shape of that will effect what <code>writerows</code> does according to the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv-fmt-params" rel="nofollow noreferrer">default dialect</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">the output is a list of strings</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.csvwriter.writerows" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>writerows</code></a> takes a <code>list</code> of iterables that themselves contain strings.  Try something like <code>TRACK_TERMS = [(s,) for s in rw.random_words(count = 400)]</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">This gives exactly what I want.</span>
