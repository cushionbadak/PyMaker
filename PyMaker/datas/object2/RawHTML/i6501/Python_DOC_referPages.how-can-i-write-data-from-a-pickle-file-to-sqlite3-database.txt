<p>I have webscraped data into a pickle file and want to write that data into a sqlite3 database. Can anybody help me out with what needs to be done?</p>

<p>You need to create a column of type <code>BLOB</code> (which is a <a href="https://sqlite.org/datatype3.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">supported datatype</a> in Sqlite3).</p>
<p>Then, you can just <code>INSERT INTO data (id, content) VALUES (?, ?)</code> with the binary dump of your pickle object.</p>
<p>Here's a <a href="http://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-insert/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">walk through on Sqlite3 inserts</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html#pickle.dumps" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>pickle.dumps</code></a> will convert the object into a byte-string you can store in the database. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html#pickle.loads" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>pickle.loads</code></a> will turn it back after being <code>SELECT</code>'d from the database.</p>
<p>You can also consider using <a href="https://github.com/uqfoundation/dill" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>dill</code></a> for more complex objects.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Um, what <i>exactly</i> do you want to do?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">are you sure you want this anyway? Why store a blob of data in a data store that is meant to store structured data?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I have data from a recipe website and want to store it in sqlite3 for easy retrieval. We've stored the data in a pkl file, but I'm not sure how the data can be interfaced with a database.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why not use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/shelve.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>shelve</code></a>? It uses <code>pickle</code> to store data.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you want "easy retrieval" it seems odd to store it as a pickle. You appear to be using sqlite as if it was some kind of archive (like a zip file), and not using any of its most powerful features.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I did exactly how you have stated. However when querying from the database, pickle.loads gives EOFError Ran out of input. I checked loads just before inserting to database - it runs fine however after reading the inserted value, it feels. I have no idea why this is happening . Please help.</span>
