<p>Currently, I get a syntax error that I cannot fix, I can't find where I have gone wrong. I would like to use a dictionary to complete my code but I am unsure how to.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>First you have a major error in how you are trying to form a dict. It should be this:</p>
<pre><code>Lessons = {
'Monday':['English','Geography','German','P.E.','Science-C'],
'Tuesday':['Art','Science-B','Maths','ICT','French'],
'Wednesday':['History','English','Drama','Science-B','Maths'],
'Thursday':['P.E.','D&amp;T','HTT','Geography','R.E.'],
'Friday':['German','D&amp;T','Maths','English','Music']
}
</code></pre>
<p>This is a dictionary called Lessons that has Strings as keys (the days of the weeks) and Lists as values (The lists of lessons). To access a list of lessons you would do it like so:</p>
<pre><code>Lessons['Monday']
</code></pre>
<p>Note that this returns a list, if you want it formatted differently, then you can do something like this:</p>
<pre><code>", ".join(Lessons['Monday'])
</code></pre>
<p>This will give you a comma-separated list of lessons.</p>
<p>I am unsure what exactly you are trying to do with books, but if you want to be more specific I will update my answer. However, I can say that if you will be running this program each day, then you will need to store information about the books in a file to maintain their state, otherwise it will be lost when the program ends.</p>
<p>Also, variables should be lower-cased (lessons instead of Lessons), but I kept it how you had it to be consistent.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Notice the colons, not equals sign, in the dictionary. To separate keys and values it's a colon like 'Monday': List, not 'Monday'=List</span>
