<p>While reading some Python training books, I was tinkering a little bit with objects, like printing docstrings for common objects and attributes.</p>
<p>Consider the list of strings returned by:</p>
<pre><code>dir(str)
</code></pre>
<p>I am trying to iterate over the above in order to dynamically print the docstrings of the attributes stored in the dir list with the following loop:</p>
<pre><code>for item in dir(str):
    print(item.__doc__)
</code></pre>
<p>This returns the dir output for the str object and not for its attribute though, which is not what I'm looking for. How can I dynamically print instead the docstring for all the attributes that populate the list produced by the dir method?</p>

Using the word "enumerate" is very misleading, at least to me, so I would say that question is improperly titled in fact I spent a lot of time looking for a solution and no search query ever returned that.</p>

<p>You can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#getattr" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>getattr(obj, attr)</code></a> to get the named attribute from the object.</p>
<pre><code>for item in dir(str):
    print(getattr(str, item).__doc__)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Instead of using <code>dir</code>, which just gives you the names of attributes, use <code>vars</code> - this gives you a dict of names to the actual method objects.</p>
<pre><code>for name, method in vars(str).items():
    print(name, method.__doc__)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>print(len(vars(str))) --&gt; 68</code>, <code>print(len(dir(str)))--&gt;76</code>, this one is more complete</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thanks that did the trick.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thanks this works as well as the reply from khelwood. I find though that there is no need to invoke this dictionary because you get the same results by:  <code>for item in dir(var):     print(item, '\n', getattr(str, item).__doc__)</code>  thanks a lot. this being said, in your opinion, should I still pick the dict way?</span>
