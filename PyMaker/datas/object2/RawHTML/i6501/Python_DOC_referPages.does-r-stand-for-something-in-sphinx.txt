<p>I'm writing my docstring following the numpy docstring guidelines. Then I use sphinx's autodoc to generate my documentation. Within some docstrings I'm using LaTeX formulas (sphinx.ext.mathjax). It seems that <code>\r</code> means something special like a new line. If I have the following command:</p>
<pre><code>"""
This :math:`\langle a, b\rangle` denotes the dot product of a and b
"""
</code></pre>
<p>it doesn't properly render. It puts like angle to a new line and gives me an error: <em>Inline interpreted text or phrase reference start-string without end-string</em>
If I replace the \rangle with \langle everything works fine. How can I fix this?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The solution is to escape with a double slash or place a "r" (without the quotes) in from of the triple quotes, this disables the interpretation of the slashes inside the quotes:</p>
<pre><code>r"""
This :math:`\langle a, b\rangle` denotes the dot product of a and b
"""
</code></pre>
<p>There are several prefixes that influence the definition of string literals, see the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#string-and-bytes-literals" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation of Python</a>.</p>
<p>Relevant excerpts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The backslash () character is used to escape characters that
  otherwise have a special meaning, such as newline, backslash itself,
  or the quote character.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Both string and bytes literals may optionally be prefixed with a
  letter 'r' or 'R'; such strings are called raw strings and treat
  backslashes as literal characters. As a result, in string literals,
  '\U' and '\u' escapes in raw strings are not treated specially.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Not just in Sphinx - <code>\r</code> is the carriage return character in a lot of places.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@planet260 thx for the comment. But how can I then make this work:)</span>

<span class="comment-copy">@planet260: The question is about the Sphinx documentation tool, which is unrelated to the Sphinx search engine.</span>
