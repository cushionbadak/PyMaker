<p><strong>This question was answered/resolved in the comments section.</strong></p>
<p>I am a noob to Python and I wrote the code below thinking it would copy all the rows with "NY" as the state in the state field/column to a new csv file called "Output.csv".</p>
<pre><code>import csv

f = open(r'C:\Users..\input.csv', 'r')
reader = csv.DictReader(f, delimiter=',')
output = open("C:...\Output.csv",'w')
fieldnames = ['firstScan', 'FinalScan', 'City', 'State', 'cld', 'daydiff']
writer = csv.DictWriter(output, fieldnames=fieldnames, delimiter=',')

for row in reader:
    if row['State'] == 'NY':
        writer.writerow(row)
</code></pre>
<p>Everything runs fine but the output csv is completely blank. The first tab is named "Output" but the sheet is blank. If I have it output to txt, that is blank as well. Any suggestions?</p>

<p>Try this instead:</p>
<pre><code>import csv

with open('C:/Users/felasniper/Desktop/input.csv') as f:
    reader = csv.DictReader(f, delimiter=',')
    output = open("C:/Users/felasniper/Desktop/Output.csv", 'w')
    fieldnames = ['firstScan', 'FinalScan', 'City', 'State', 'cld', 'daydiff']
    writer = csv.DictWriter(output, fieldnames=fieldnames, delimiter=',')

    for row in reader:
        if row['State'] == 'NY':
            writer.writerow(row)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">I'll bet the issue is that you aren't closing your file. You should <b>always use a <code>with</code> statement</b> and then you won't have to remember to close your file.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">As @juanpa.arrivillaga wrote, you don't close the file. It might be buffered; and the buffer never gets full or flushed.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@juanpa.arrivillaga Where do I put the {with} statement?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Check out the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">many examples in the docs</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@JohnMinze. Or just put <code>output.close()</code> at the end.</span>
