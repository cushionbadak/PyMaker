<p>I've wrote this code to write headers to a csv file:</p>
<pre><code>    with open(os.path.join(directory, 'UserPass.csv'), 'wb') as csvFile:
    writer = csv.DictWriter(csvFile, fieldnames = ['Username', 'Password'], delimeter = ',')
    writer.writeheader()
</code></pre>
<p>However, it comes up with an error saying that directory is not defined.
Why is this happening, what would I define directory as?
Is there a better way to write headers?
Thank you.</p>

<p>Directory is the location of the directory (aka folder) that you want to save UserPass.csv. See <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html#os.path.join" rel="nofollow noreferrer">os.path.join docs</a> for more info. </p>

<p>Easiest way would be using <code>sed</code> since you mention alternatives, just do,</p>
<pre><code>sed -i '1iUsername,Password' UserPass.csv
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">The error is telling you that you did not assign anything to the <code>directory</code> variable before trying to use it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>delimeter</code> is spelled wrong, but comma is the default anyway.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>with open('UserPass.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvFile:</code> will open the file in your current directory (since you didn't define one) and <code>newline=''</code> is required for correct use with the <code>csv</code> module of Python 3.x.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">sorry, on which line?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">from the command line, if you are not on Windows granted, can someone explain the downvote?</span>
