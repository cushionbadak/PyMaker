<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I am having a hard time figuring out how to return my function with a "%" sign.</p>
<p>Here is what I have: </p>
<pre><code>def calculate(string):
    A = string.count("A")
    D = string.count("D")
    x = A + D
    answer = (x / len(string)) * 100
    return int(answer)
</code></pre>
<p>I want it to return the final answer, but with a percentage sign next to it, like '65%' for example</p>
<p>I tried these:</p>
<pre><code>return int(answer) + "%"
return int(answer) and "%"
</code></pre>
<p>but none of those really worked and it gave me an error.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>For a single returned value: you can't</p>
<p>The problem is that <code>int(answer)</code> is a number and <code>'%'</code> is a string, so you cant combine these in a return value - unless you convert both to the same data type.</p>
<p>Try converting both values to a string:</p>
<pre><code>return "{}%".format(int(answer))
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You could go totally overboard and define your own integer type that displays itself with a percent symbol:</p>
<pre>
class pint(int):
    def __str__(self):
        return super().__str__() + '%'
    __repr__ = __str__
</pre>
<p>You can now make the return value of your function be <code>pint(answer)</code> and reap the benefits of having your number actually be a number while always printing as a percentage.</p>
<p>I don't really recommend this approach for your trivial case, but it could have its uses.</p>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>return str(answer) + '%'</code> or <code>return "{}%".format(answer)</code> or <code>return "%d%%" % (answer,)</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy"><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Read the documentation</a>. It will tell you how to convert numbers to strings. Or how to format string with numeric values.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">YES!, that worked!!!! Thank You so much!!!!!!!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Gin. Glad to see you've made some progress with your homework since yesterday :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">yes I have, Thank you for your help!!!</span>
