<p>So here's what my program does. It takes in a file of emails and checks it one by one to see if it is valid.</p>
<p>The problem is when I load a list with more than one email, the emails after the first all end up saying "The email must not contain any invalid characters in the domain."</p>
<p>Can someone tell me why this happens and how I can fix it?</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>

<p>When reading from a file, your lines will end with a newline character of some sort (<code>\r\n</code> or <code>\n</code>).  If you want to parse it line by line, you should make sure to strip the line of trailing and leading spaces:</p>
<pre><code>emailzero = line.strip().split("@")
</code></pre>
<p>See <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html#string.strip" rel="nofollow noreferrer">string.strip</a></p>

<li>Regarding this snippet:</li>
</ol>
<p>Snippet:</p>
<pre><code>d = dict.fromkeys(string.ascii_letters, 0)
ds = dict.fromkeys(string.digits, 0)
# 2 dictionaries imported, letters and numbers(digits)

f = {**d, **ds, ".":0}
</code></pre>
<p>You could condense all this into a set, like this:</p>
<pre><code>allowed_domain_chars = set(string.ascii_letters) | set(string.digits) | { '.' }
</code></pre>
<ol start="2">
<li><p>At the cost of having less readable error messages, you could condense this into a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">regular expression</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Your parsing does not accept all valid email addresses (such as those that include a <code>+</code> or a <code>.</code> in the left side of the <code>@</code>).  Something like <code>email_regex = re.compile(r'.+@.+\..+')</code> would be a simple regex that covers most use cases (given <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46155/how-to-validate-email-address-in-javascript">the issues with validating email</a>).</p></li>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Starting with the line <code>if "@" not in line:</code>, you need to give everything another indentation, I think.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Please fix the indentation of your code.  As it stands, your code is not valid Python because the indentation is wrong.  (There is a <code>while</code> loop and two <code>for</code> loops where the next line is not indented further.)  If your problem relates to indentation, and the code you've posted above doesn't contain the same indentation as your actual code, we will struggle to help you.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Add print segments to your code for easier debugging. Your for loop/indentation looks wrong. Don't you mean for each line in the file check for all those things that you are checking? Right now it's not doing that.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">As an aside, even if this code was working correctly it will still give incorrect results since some conditions are too narrow and others are missing.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@poisonishere Post code that shows your issue. The code you posted raises <code>IndentationError</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@poisonishere Put some effort in debugging. Just <code>print(repr(line))</code> will show you the answer.</span>
