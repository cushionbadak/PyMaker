<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I am having problems with this bit of code</p>
<pre><code>import csv

print(towns)

eachTown = towns.split("\n")
print (eachTown)

record = eachTown.split(",")

print(newlist)
</code></pre>
<p>It returns this error </p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "N:/Python practice/towns.py", line 10, in &lt;module&gt;
    record = eachTown.split(",")
AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'split'
</code></pre>
<p>Can anyone help me with this </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>eachTown = towns.split("\n")
</code></pre>
<p>This code return list. List don't have attribute split. You should replace </p>
<pre><code>record = eachTown.split(",")
</code></pre>
<p>like this</p>
<pre><code>records = [rec.split(",") for rec in eachTown]
</code></pre>
<p>But better if you start using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">module csv</a> for read this file.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The <code>csv</code> module gives you this text parsing functionality, you do not need to do it yourself.</p>
<pre><code>import csv
with open("townsfile.csv", "r") as f:
    reader = csv.reader(f, delimiter=',')
    towns = list(reader)

print(towns)
</code></pre>
<p>The problem you have is that <code>list.split()</code> does not exist, you are trying to use <code>str.split()</code> but you already split it into a <code>list</code> of <code>str</code>s. You would need to do it for every <code>str</code> in the list.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Because <code>eachTown</code> is a list of towns...</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>eachTown</code> is a list, yes. Why do you have <code>record = each&lt;something&gt;.split(',')</code> three times?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Also, don't re-invent the CSV-reading wheel. Just use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>csv</code> module</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I just love python, the error message is already pretty clear!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What will the script be doing? i.e. what does your CSV look like and what output are your trying to get? Please edit the question to include this.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This does not work? Can you please give me the correct correct that you think will work TypeError:  expected at least 1 arguments, got 0</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sotty I was missing a comma</span>
