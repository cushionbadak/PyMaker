<p>I have the following two dimensional array: </p>
<pre><code>arr = [
["A", "B", "C", "10.03.2030", "14:06"],
["W", "R", "Q", "09.04.2025", "12:06"],
["Y", "X", "V", "11.05.2022", "12:06"],
["Z", "N", "H", "10.03.2030", "14:06"],
]
</code></pre>
<p>I want to sort the array by &amp; time, is there a fast way to do that in python?</p>
<p>thanks in advance </p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can sort by first transforming the dates into ISO8601 format  (as opposed to transforming to actual dates with <code>datetime.strptime</code> which is pretty slow) and then break ties using the already standardised time string:</p>
<pre><code>lst = sorted(arr, key=lambda x: (x[3].split('.')[::-1], x[-1]))
print(lst)
</code></pre>
<p><code>x[3].split('.')[::-1]</code> builds a list of the ISO date from the original date string, bringing the year first, month next and then date.</p>

<pre><code>[['Y', 'X', 'V', '11.05.2022', '12:06'],
 ['W', 'R', 'Q', '09.04.2025', '12:06'],
 ['A', 'B', 'C', '10.03.2030', '14:06'],
 ['Z', 'N', 'H', '10.03.2030', '14:06']]

<p>As mentioned in this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4174941/how-to-sort-a-list-of-lists-by-a-specific-index-of-the-inner-list">answer</a>, you should use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/operator.html#operator.itemgetter" rel="nofollow noreferrer">itemgetter</a> for this purpose.</p>
<p>To sort your data by time, use this:</p>
<pre><code>from operator import itemgetter
print(sorted(arr, key=itemgetter(4)))
[['W', 'R', 'Q', '09.04.2025', '12:06'], 
['Y', 'X', 'V', '11.05.2022', '12:06'], 
['A', 'B', 'C', '10.03.2030', '14:06'], 
['Z', 'N', 'H', '10.03.2030', '14:06']]
</code></pre>
<p>If you need to sort by date (year), you need to define a separate function or use a lamda. I have written both solutions:</p>
<pre><code>def sorting(item):
    return item[3].split('.')[2]

print(sorted(arr, key=sorting))

# using lambda
print(sorted(arr, key= lambda item:item[3].split('.')[2]))

[['Y', 'X', 'V', '11.05.2022', '12:06'], 
['W', 'R', 'Q', '09.04.2025', '12:06'], 
['A', 'B', 'C', '10.03.2030', '14:06'], 
['Z', 'N', 'H', '10.03.2030', '14:06']]
</code></pre>
<p>This way you don't rely on a third party package import.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>very short and neat code than others given above</p>
<pre><code>lst = sorted(arr, key=lambda x: (x[3].split('.')[::-1], x[-1]))
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">I deleted my answer because it was actually wrong. But to answer your question about being downvoted: I didn't downvote (not did I upvote) your question, but those who did likely did so because 1) you haven't shown any effort at accomplishing this yourself and 2) this is not a new problem and could easily be solved with some effort Googling. Good luck.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thank you so much, your answer was the best, for date and time, all other solutions sort only by date and not the time too. I want to ask you something, can you please explain this part: (x[3].split('.')[::-1], x[-1], this will take the date and split it by (dot), for first one  ['2022', '05', '11'] and I dont understand why negative number -1 and not 2 ? and also the x[-1] Please...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">But this doesn't sort the date properly. Year 2025 is first, 2030 is in-between, and 2022 is last.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Mark I just updated my code to sort by the list by year.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Besides not sorting by time, this isn't any different than Moses Koledoye's answer...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">this is not sorting by time, its only by date.</span>
