<p>I met a line in python code:</p>
<pre><code>onevariable for(a,b) in range(1,10)
</code></pre>
<p>Can you help me how it should be 'read'? Couldn't 'google' any example of 'for' with brackets. Very strange line</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Did you try running it to see what happens?</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>for(a,b) in range(1,10)</code> can't work. But you're probably refering to list comprehensions.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@jeanfrancoisefabre but it can't work in a list comp either?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@roganjosh you cannot unpack a&amp;b from a range.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@roganjosh you're not pinging me but you're pinging Jean-Francoise Fabre if this user exists (and is a girl :))</span>
