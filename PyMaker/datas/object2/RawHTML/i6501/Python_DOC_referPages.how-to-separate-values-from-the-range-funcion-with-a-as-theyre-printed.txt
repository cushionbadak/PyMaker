<p>I am new to python and i'm stuck on a simple task. I want to print a range of number on the same line, with a "+" between each of them. This is the best I've been able to do so far, but obviously there is an extra "+" at the end of my line.</p>
<pre><code>for i in range (1,10):
    print (i , end="+")
</code></pre>
<p>Output:
</p>
<pre><code>1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+ 
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Simple one-line solution:</p>
<pre><code>result = "+".join(str(i) for i in range(1, 10))
</code></pre>
<p>You can use the built-in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.join" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>join()</code></a> method to insert a delimiter between each item in a list. In this case, the delimiter is +. We pass the iterable generated by <code>range</code> as the argument, converting each number into a string via the looping construct.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> If you need to use iteration for this, I'd go with the following approach:</p>
<pre><code>result = ""
for i in range(1, 10):
    result += str(i) + "+"
print(result[:-1])
</code></pre>
<p>Basically we create an empty string, append each number and a + sign to it, and then remove the last character using the slice.</p>
<p>If you cannot use <em>anything</em> list-related, then the easiest approach would be to stop the loop before the final number and add it manually.</p>
<pre><code>result = ""
for i in range(1, 9):
    result += str(i) + "+"
print(result + "9")
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you just need to print the values, you could <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.6/tutorial/controlflow.html#unpacking-argument-lists" rel="nofollow noreferrer">unpack</a> the sequence returned by <code>range()</code> and pass a custom separator to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>print()</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print(*range(1, 10), sep="+")                     
1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Shortest and arguably most-readable snippet I can think of:</p>
<pre><code>print('+'.join(map(str, range(1, 10))))  # -&gt; 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">A common pattern I've adopted for concatenating potential non-strings is: <code>'+'.join(map(str, iterable))</code> .. which is more efficient for large sets than constructing list comprehension. (out of scope for beginner question)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@blakev <code>join</code> has to fully instantiate the list to determine the size of the result anyway.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you for your great anwser, However i forgot to say but i can't use list for this problem</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@JeffPetry Check out the edit. I added a few additional ways using iteration.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@chepner a naive list comprehension is the slowest way to build strings in Python. See: <a href="https://waymoot.org/home/python_string/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">comprehensive tests</a>, <a href="https://gist.github.com/blakev/250633fb7a8d148c6594684c097f13cb#file-map_join_str-py" rel="nofollow noreferrer">quick and simple</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes i only have to print, but there are some condition between my range function and my print, so it does'nt seem to work this way</span>
