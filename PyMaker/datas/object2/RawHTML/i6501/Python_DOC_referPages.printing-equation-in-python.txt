<p>I want to print an equation in python which will show up like math mode in latex.
I have written-</p>
<pre><code>b = (3**2 + 5**2)**(1/3)
print ((3**2 + 5**2)**(1/3), '=',b)
</code></pre>
<p>And want it to first print the equation and then the answer, however it prints the answer = the answer.
Is there a way of changing this?</p>

<p>You could keep the expression in string and use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#eval" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>eval</code></a> to calculate it:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; b = "(3**2 + 5**2)**(1/3)"
&gt;&gt;&gt; print (b, '=',eval(b))
(3**2 + 5**2)**(1/3) = 3.239611801277483
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>print("(3**2 + 5**2)**(1/3) = ", b)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Additional to the above answers you could also print the question like this.</p>
<pre><code> print("(3**2 + 5**2)**(1/3) = " + str(b))
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">It would be hard, not feasible, needless to print latex format output in terminal, However you may try replacing <code>(3**2 + 5**2)**(1/3)</code> with <code>"(3**2 + 5**2)**(1/3)"</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Use sympy, has pretty printing for terminal, and mathjax for html environments.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">there's a simpleeval module which works well...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I was about to comment something along the lines of "<code>eval is evil!</code>" but then I realized the program isn't <code>eval()</code>'ing inputs, so this is a really good application for the <code>eval()</code> method.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">anyway, if you want to avoid <code>eval</code> there's a simple <code>simpleeval</code> third party which works really well.</span>
