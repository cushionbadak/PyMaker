<p>How can I make sure that a connection to an SQLite database fails if I try to make a connection to a database which doesn't exist, or an error is thrown in the code to show that this db did not prior exist?</p>
<p>I'm currently using Python3 to connect to my SQLite database, however, if I use a path to a db which doesn't exist, SQLite creates a database of that name and forms a connection to it.</p>
<p>I can see why this would be helpful in most cases. However, I can't test to see if SQlite has made a proper connection as no error is thrown when this situation occurs. </p>

<p>In Python 3.4 or later, the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#sqlite3.connect" rel="nofollow noreferrer">connect() function</a> accepts URI filenames, which allow to <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/uri.html#recognized_query_parameters" rel="nofollow noreferrer">specify a different open mode</a>:</p>
<pre><code>db = sqlite3.connect('file:/some/where/stuff.db?mode=rw', uri=True)
