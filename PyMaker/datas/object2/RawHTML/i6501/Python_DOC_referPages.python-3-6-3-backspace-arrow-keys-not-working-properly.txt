<p>In shells like the interactive python shell, you can usually use the arrow keys to move around in the current line or get previous commands (with arrow-up) etc.</p>
<p>But after I ssh into another machine and start <code>python</code> there, I get sessions like:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import os 
&gt;&gt;&gt; ^[[A    
</code></pre>
<p>where the last character comes from arrow-up. Or, using arrow-left:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; impor^[[D
</code></pre>
<p>How can I fix this?</p>
<p>In the regular bash, arrow keys work fine. The weird behavior is just in the interactive python (or perl etc.) shell.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Looks like readline is not enabled. Check if <code>PYTHONSTARTUP</code> variable is defined, for me it points to <code>/etc/pythonstart</code> and that file is executed by the python process before going interactive, which setups readline/history handling.</p>

<p>Did you call ssh with the <em>-t</em> parameter to tell ssh to allocate a virtual terminal for you?</p>
<p>From the man page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>-t<br/>
   Force pseudo-tty allocation. This can be used to execute arbitrary screen-based programs on a remote machine, which can be very useful, e.g. when implementing menu services. Multiple -t options force tty allocation, even if ssh has no local tty.</p>

<p>Additionally you may also have to set the <em>TERM</em> environment variable on the server correctly as suggested in another post.</p>

<li>install gnureadline using <code>pip install gnureadline</code></li>

<p>now you can either do <code>import gnureadline</code> (a step omitted in many tutorials) and arrow keys should work as expected. To make them work automatically follow the following steps:</p>

<p>I was trying build Python 2.7 on Ubuntu 14.0. You will need libreadline-dev. However, if you get it from apt-get, the current version is 6.3, which is incompatible with Python 2.7 (not sure about Python 3). For example, the data type "Function" and "CPPFunction", which were defined in previous versions of readline has been removed in 6.3, as reported here:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv/issues/126" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv/issues/126</a></p>
<p>That is to say you need to get the source code of an earlier version of readline. I installed libreadline 5.2 from apt-get for the library, and get the source code of 5.2 for the header files. Put them in /usr/include. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">Smells of termtype problem.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I think this belongs on server-fault. This is caused by an incorrect terminal type.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">After some googling it seems python on that system might have to be recompiled, after installing readline-devel.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes you will have to recompile.</span>
