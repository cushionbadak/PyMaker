<p>Hello whoever is reading this.
I am having trouble taking a python function from an excel spreadsheet and then running it in python.
I'd like to stress on the fact that I actually defined my function in python, and it's not an excel function.</p>
<p>Please note that this is my second time questioning and have only ever done coding as a hobby.</p>
<p>Here is an example of what I want to take:
<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7Zc5c.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer">heal(2,c)</a></p>
<p>I am using xlrd to analyze data on the spreadsheet.
Here is a chunk from my code.</p>
<pre><code>    e = worksheet.cell(rowidx,colidx+1)
    f = str(e).replace("'","")
    g = f.replace("text:","")
</code></pre>
<p>This chunk focuses on converting the 'cell object' to a 'string' and making it look like the function required.
The end result is this: </p>
<pre><code>    g = heal(2,c)
</code></pre>
<p>My problem is that I cannot seem to activate this function.
I have also tried doing "g()" but it came up with the error message:
<em>File "C:\Users\Alexander\Dropbox\Documents\Python\Hearthstone\Hearthstone.py", line 18, in play
    g()
TypeError: 'str' object is not callable</em></p>
<p>I do not mind if you tell me a way to activate "g" or just directly run it from the spreadsheet.
Please let me know if you need any more information.
Thank you for you time.</p>

<p>You can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#eval" rel="nofollow noreferrer">eval</a> for same. Here, I am considering that funciton is defined in current file only.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>eval('heal(2,c)')
</code></pre>
<p>If function is defined in other file i.e. "file",import it and call using:</p>
<p>Example:
import file</p>
<pre><code>eval('file.heal(2,c)')
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">heal() function is in current file or from function is defined in some other file?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thankyou! The eval function seems to suit its purpose.</span>
