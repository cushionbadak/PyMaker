<p>Just started learning python. And it looks to me that <strong>rjust()</strong> method is counting string that I'm trying to justify in justifying length. </p>
<p>Let me clarify a little bit, the book I'm using to study python had this type of small program:</p>
<pre><code>order = "First\nSecond\nThird"
print("The order is: ", order)
</code></pre>
<p>Whose output is:</p>
<pre><code>The order is: First  
Second  
Third
</code></pre>
<p>And I thought what could I change to make output as (<strong>desired output</strong>),</p>
<pre><code>The order is: First   
              Second   
              Third  
</code></pre>
<p>Well <em>there may be very easy way to solve this</em> but bear in mind I just started learning python. I tried formatting to no avail. After learning about list I came up with this solution,</p>
<pre><code>order = "First\nSecond\nThird"

listed_order = order.split("\n")
length_of_list = len(listed_order)

print_line = "The order is: "
length = len(print_line)

print(print_line + listed_order[0])
for i in range(1, length_of_list):
    print(listed_order[i].rjust(length))
</code></pre>
<p>But the output is,</p>
<pre><code>The order is: First
        Second
         Third
</code></pre>
<p>That means rjust() method is counting Second and Third to make justified length of 14, while I wanted them to start from 14. Second has 8 spaces in front of it to make justified length of 14, while Third has 9 spaces.</p>
<p>So, <em>what can I do to get my desired output?</em> If there is another way to solve this let me know.</p>

<p>What you describe is <em>left</em>-justified, but with an additional offset (also known as <em>indentation</em>).</p>
<p>Instead of</p>
<pre><code>print(listed_order[i].rjust(length))
</code></pre>
<p>simply do</p>
<pre><code>print(' ' * length + listed_order[i])
</code></pre>
<p>If there is nothing to the right of <code>listed_order[i]</code>, you don't need to use <code>ljust</code> either.</p>
<p>You might want to take a look at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/textwrap.html#textwrap.indent" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>textwrap.indent</code></a>, which lets you indent whole blocks of text without splitting the lines manually.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You don't have to do such things: <code>length_of_list = len(listed_order)</code>. You can run your loop without checking length of the list:</p>
<pre><code>for i in listed_order:
    print(i.rjust(length))
</code></pre>
<p>EDIT:
As pointed in the comments, this would also print first element which we want to skip. You can do it by telling python to process from second element by adding <code>[1:]</code>, which means <code>from element of index 1 (which is second after index 0) untill end)</code>, so:</p>
<pre><code>for i in listed_order[1:]:
    print(i.ljust(length))
</code></pre>
<p>Now to the core.</p>
<p>What you need is the number of whitespaces. You can get it by running this:</p>
<pre><code>number_of_whitespaces = len("The order is: ")
</code></pre>
<p>And then print it out before each line:</p>
<pre><code>print(' ' * number_of_whitespaces, end='')
</code></pre>
<p>Full solution here:</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python3

order = "First\nSecond\nThird"
print("The order is: ", order)

orders = order.split()
whitespaces = len('The order is: ')

print('The order is: {}'.format(orders[0]))
for o in orders[1:]:
    print(' ' * whitespaces, end='')
    print(o)
</code></pre>
<p>EDIT2: Added missing colon, Changed rjust to ljust
EDIT3: Added full solution</p>

<span class="comment-copy">If there is anything that I could do to improve my question please let me know.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You actually want to <b>left</b> justify your strings at a given position</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@schwobaseggl Sir left justifying gives first output maybe I misunderstood your comment.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Your method nearly works (also not the simplest), you should just use <code>length = len(print_line + listed_order[0])</code> as this is the line size you want.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@RamchandraGiri That's why I said "at a given position". Look at the words you want to align: Are they aligned on their left or on their right?</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>for i in listed_order</code> would go through all items in the list, but the first one must be excluded.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@gonczor First of all that for statement is missing colon and secondly am I missing something cause this is not giving expected output.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I have added the colon. And this was not meant to be antire answear, I've just described a few mechanisms you could find useful. What particularily is not working?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sir you need to change rjust to ljust to give expected output otherwise everything is good. Thanks.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You're welcome. I've also uploaded my full solution for this task. Just in case.</span>
