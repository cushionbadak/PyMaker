<p>please can someone clarify to me what would be the best way to take some text from a log line and insert it in front of the line in python.</p>
<p>Ex.
Input</p>
<pre><code>&lt;02&gt;Jan  1 00:12:08 15.27.05.42 1,2017/09/07 00:12:08,......

<p>Output</p>
<pre><code>15.27.05.42,&lt;02&gt;Jan  1 00:12:08 15.27.05.42 1,2017/09/07 00:12:08,......

<p>many thanks</p>

<p>You can use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer" title="re">re</a> module.
If the pattern you want to prepend is unique, then it will be something like:</p>
<pre><code>import re
in_ = "&lt;02&gt;Jan  1 00:12:08 15.27.05.42 1,2017/09/07 00:12:08"
pattern = re.compile(r'\d+\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+')
res = re.search(pattern, in_)
if res:
    out_ = "{},{}".format(res.group(), in_)

# '15.27.05.42,&lt;02&gt;Jan  1 00:12:08 15.27.05.42 1,2017/09/07 00:12:08'
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>For 2 strings to connect  "+" operator is good enough, but for 3 or more parts strings I recomend using join() method:</p>
<pre><code>log = "02&gt;Jan  1 00:12:08 15.27.05.42 1,2017/09/07 00:12:08"

log = "5.27.05.42," + log
</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code>log = "".join("5.27.05.42," + log)
</code></pre>
<p>About exporting log into string there are many methods, all depends on what form and where you have wrriten log.</p>
<p>Also as @RomanPerekhrest mentions, it is unclear what you want to put before log, if it is something inside log, you will have to use regular expressions.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You should first split text with <code>.split(" ")</code> then you your log file will converted to list then you can use <code>log_elements[index]+log</code> to concate them together. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">it's unclear where does this <code>15.27.05.42,</code> come from?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hi RomanPerekhrest, the ip number comes from the firewall that sends its log.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thank you so much for the help. I think that unfortunately the log can have a different pattern. At least as far as the ip goes, that shouldn't change.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for the information. I wonder if, in case I have to use regular expressions, just writing the starting pattern will be enough. I say this mostly because some of the following in the log can vary</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thank you for your input. I will study in more detail what he says to me.</span>
