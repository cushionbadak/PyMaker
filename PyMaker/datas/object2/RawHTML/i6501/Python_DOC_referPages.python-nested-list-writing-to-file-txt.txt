<p>i have made a nested list and it works a print i need to write it to a text file but dont understand how to and have tried to do research and not found anything anyone help?</p>
<pre><code>nestedList = [["Judge","01","02","03","04","05"],
             ["Couple A","10","06","03","04","05"]]
file = open("NewFile.txt","w")

for item in nestedList:
    print(":",item[0]," "*(8-len(item[0])),":",
          item[1]," "*(0-len(item[1])),":",
          item[2]," "*(0-len(item[2])),":",
          item[3]," "*(0-len(item[3])),":",
          item[4]," "*(0-len(item[4])),":",
          item[5]," "*(0-len(item[5])),":")

file.close()
</code></pre>
<p>Edited:</p>
<p>I've changed code to this:</p>
<pre><code>    nestedList = [["Judge","01","02","03","04","05"],
             ["Couple A","10","06","03","04","05"]]
with open("NewFile.txt",'w') as outfile:
    for item in nestedList:
        (":",item[0]," "*(8-len(item[0])),":",
              item[1]," "*(0-len(item[1])),":",
              item[2]," "*(0-len(item[2])),":",
              item[3]," "*(0-len(item[3])),":",
              item[4]," "*(0-len(item[4])),":",
              item[5]," "*(0-len(item[5])),":")
outfile.close()
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The following code can help you write to file. Not sure what the expected output is. You can modify the write statement to print anything you like.</p>
<pre><code>nestedList = [["Judge","01","02","03","04","05"],
             ["Couple A","10","06","03","04","05"]]

with open("myfile.txt",'w') as outfile:
    for i in nestedList:
        outfile.write(str(i))
</code></pre>
<p>UPDATE:
The following code below writes to the file. (Writes everything after the print as wanted)</p>
<p><code>,</code> is not accepted as it sees as multiple arguments. Instead <code>+</code> is used to concatenate strings, which then can be written.</p>
<pre><code>nestedList = [["Judge","01","02","03","04","05"],
             ["Couple A","10","06","03","04","05"]]

with open("myfile.txt",'w') as outfile:
    for item in nestedList:
        outfile.write(":"+item[0] + " "*(8-len(item[0]))+":"+
          item[1]+" "*(0-len(item[1]))+":"+
          item[2]+" "*(0-len(item[2]))+":"+
          item[3]+" "*(0-len(item[3]))+":"+
          item[4]+" "*(0-len(item[4]))+":"+
          item[5]+" "*(0-len(item[5]))+":")
</code></pre>
<p>UPDATE 2:</p>
<p>If you want to format the code, you might want to look into formatting but here is a an example to make it look similar</p>
<pre><code>nestedList = [["Judge","01","02","03","04","05"],
             ["Couple A","10","06","03","04","05"]]

with open("myfile.txt",'w') as outfile:
    for item in nestedList:
        outfile.write("\n:\t"+item[0] + " "*(8-len(item[0]))+":"+
          item[1]+" \t"*(0-len(item[1]))+":\t"+
          item[4]+" \t"*(0-len(item[4]))+":\t"+
          item[2]+" \t"*(0-len(item[2]))+":\t"+
          item[3]+" \t"*(0-len(item[3]))+":\t"+
          item[5]+" \t"*(0-len(item[5]))+":\t")
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">what is your expected output?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I need where I just edited and put print to write to a file what it prints in shell?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I've edited and shown what I've done to use your code but I can't see anything to write to a file?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@GraphicsLab, If I understood it correctly, you want to write everything after <code>print</code> to a textfile.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">yeah in the format running with print so what comes out in the shell a table looking thing i want it to look like the table in the text doc</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@GraphicsLab, check the 2nd update.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">there a error on where the + is can you check please?</span>
