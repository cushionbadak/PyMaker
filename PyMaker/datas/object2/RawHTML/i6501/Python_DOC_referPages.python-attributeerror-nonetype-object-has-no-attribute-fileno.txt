<p>as I am trying to print financial data:</p>
<pre><code>import datetime as dt
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib import style
import pandas as pd
import pandas_datareader.data as web
import numpy as np
style.use('ggplot')
start=dt.datetime(2000,1,1)
end=dt.datetime(2016,12,31)
df= web.DataReader('ERIE', 'google', start, end)
print(df.head())
</code></pre>
<p>I get the error that df does not exist, or more specifically:</p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):

<p>I have no clue how to fix this, as this code seems to be working with everyone else who is trying it. I am just a beginner, so any help would be really appreciated.
Thank you!

<p>It is known bug in <code>shutil</code> library:</p>
<p><a href="https://bugs.python.org/issue24920" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://bugs.python.org/issue24920</a></p>

<p>It seems, you should change the way you started you code (from GUI or from shell and similar)</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This is not a full solution, but at least a workaround.</p>
<p>You can use shutil's <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html#shutil.get_terminal_size" rel="nofollow noreferrer">get_terminal_size()</a> instead. There's also a <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/backports.shutil_get_terminal_size" rel="nofollow noreferrer">backport</a> available for python 2.</p>

<p>I faced the same problem with the code below:</p>
<pre><code>import pandas as pd
dict = {
"country" :["Brazil", "Russia", "India", "China", "South Africa"],
"capital" :["Brasilia", "Moscow", "New Delhi", "Beijing", "Pretoria"],
"area" : [8.516, 17.10, 3.286, 9.597, 1.221],
"population" : [200.4, 143.5, 1252, 1357, 52.98] }

brics = pd.DataFrame(dict)

brics

<p>An easy hack would be to shift your work to the Python shell, instead of IDLE (in my case, working on IDLE was the problem, but this same code ran perfectly on the Python Shell)</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Looks like <code>sys.__stdout__</code> is <code>None</code> in this case.  Not sure why...  What if you add <code>import sys</code> to your header?  Same issue?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Worked! Thank you.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Please, accept answer )</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@RomanMindlin Would you explain more on your answer? I don't understand what you mean by "you should change the way you started you code (from GUI or from shell and similar)".</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@BsHe You should try to change environment for you code, execute it from shell, not from IDLE. Also, try to update python version, this issue was fixed in 3.5</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@RomanMindlin I also noticed executing from shell solved the problem. I am using version 3.5. The problem can be solved by defining sys.__stdout__ variable <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45126368/nonetype-object-has-no-attribute-fileno">link</a></span>
