<p>I'm stuck on this problem. How can I create a program that adds 1 randomly to a list of [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. And I wanted to keep it going until all the numbers in the list is at least &gt; 0.</p>
<p>I have three problems in my code and I don't know what it is. This my code and the list Votes = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>It stops printing after the 7th time</p></li>
<li><p>Sometimes it’s starts with more than 1 in an item</p></li>
</ol>
<p>I want it to start it with an just 1 in a list and from there add 1 randomly to a item in the list.</p>
<p>So I want at least one of each in the list which would be greater than 0.</p>
<p>My code is</p>
<pre><code>Def get_all_prizes():
       For items in votes:
              Items = random.radiant(0, 5)
              Votes[items] + = 1
               If items == 0:
                    False
               Else:
                    Print(votes)
</code></pre>
<p>This is what is printed </p>
<pre><code>[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]
[0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]
[0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0]
[0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 0]
[0, 1, 3, 0, 1, 0]
[0, 1, 3, 1, 1, 0]
</code></pre>
<p>It only does 6 times, and sometimes it starts like this. I wanted it to start just by having just 1 number in the list like the previously printed stuffs </p>
<pre><code>[0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 0]
[0, 1, 3, 0, 1, 0]
[0, 1, 3, 1, 1, 0]
</code></pre>

<p>If I understand your problem correctly, you could use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#all" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>all</code></a> to check if every element is larger than 0 and keep looping with <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/WhileLoop" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>while</code></a> until this condition is fullfilled:</p>
<pre><code>import random
n = 6
votes = [0] * n

while not all(votes):
    i = random.randrange(0, n)
    votes[i] += 1
    print(votes)

#   [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]
#   [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]
#   [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]
#   [1, 0, 2, 0, 1, 0]
#   [1, 0, 2, 0, 1, 1]
#   [1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1]
#   [1, 0, 2, 2, 1, 1]
#   [1, 0, 3, 2, 1, 1]
#   [2, 0, 3, 2, 1, 1]
#   [2, 0, 3, 3, 1, 1]
#   [2, 0, 3, 4, 1, 1]

#   [4, 0, 3, 6, 4, 1]
