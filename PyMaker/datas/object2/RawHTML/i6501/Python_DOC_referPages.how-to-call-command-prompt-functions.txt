<p>The python documentation for this is very dry, I was wondering if you guys could help me.</p>
<p>My goal is to make python execute commands that I would normally execute in the command prompt. (I'm running windows)</p>
<p>If I run</p>
<pre><code>import subprocess
proc = subprocess.Popen("C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe")
</code></pre>
<p>It opens the command prompt. Is there a way to get the program to write in something like "dir C"?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use the os library:</p>
<pre><code>import os
os.system('dir C')
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to open a new command prompt and run a command in it, then I can't help you there. I tried to figure that out for macOS a while ago to no avail.</p>
