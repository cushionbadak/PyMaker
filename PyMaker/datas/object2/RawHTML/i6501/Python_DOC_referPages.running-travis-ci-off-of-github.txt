<p>I have a Windows machine so I' trying to have Travis CI run my python scripts directly from github. Is it possible to run Travis CI python scripts directly from my github and not from my local repository?</p>

<p>You can integrate <a href="https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/getting-started/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">TracisCI to your GItHub repo</a></p>
<p>That way, on each push, your associated TravisCI job will run and execute what you have specified.</p>
<p>Regarding your <code>travis.yaml</code>, it has to respect the <a href="http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/YAMLSyntax.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">yaml syntax format</a>:</p>
<pre><code>language: python 
sudo: enabled
python:
  -"3.5"  &lt;========= incorrect: must be - "3.5"
</code></pre>
<p>See <a href="https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/python/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Building a Python Project</a>: you will see a space between <code>-</code> and <code>"x.y"</code> version.</p>
<p>Regarding the <code>unittest</code> error, see "<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/46133353/6309">unittest installation error Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement</a>"</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><strong><code>unittest</code></strong></a> is a standard module, which you don't need to install.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">@MatthewAnderson That is an entirely different question: I have resolved your initial question</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MatthewAnderson meaning read <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/someone-answers">stackoverflow.com/help/someone-answers</a> (and I have adressed your second error message). It would help if you edit your question though.</span>
