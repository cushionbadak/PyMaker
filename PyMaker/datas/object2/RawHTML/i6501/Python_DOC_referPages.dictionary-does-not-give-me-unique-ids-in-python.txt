               },
               .... and the list goes on with a bunch of other items ....
</code></pre>
<p>From all of these nodes I was interested in Unique _Ids, title, and description. So, I created a dictionary and extracted the parts that I was interested in using json. Here is my code:</p>
<pre><code>import json
s={}
d=open('local file','w')
with open('localfile', 'r') as ready:
    for line in ready:
        test=json.loads(line, encoding='utf-8')
        for i in (test['hits']['hits']):
             for x in i:
                  s.setdefault(i['_id'], [i['_source']['dataset']
                  ['description'], i['_source']['dataset']['title']])
        for k, v in s.items():
        d.write(k +'\t'+v[0] +'\t' + v[1] + '\n')
d.close()
</code></pre>
<p>Now, when I run it, it gives me a file with duplicated _Ids! Does not dictionary suppose to give me unique _Ids? In my original output file, I have lots of duplicated Ids that I wanted to get rid of them.
Also, I ran set() only on _ids to get unique number of them and it came to 138. But with dictionary if i remove generated duplicated ids it comes down to 17! 
Can someone please tell me why this is happening?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you want a unique ID, if you're using a database it will create it for you. If you're not, you'll need to generate a unique number or string. Depending on how the dictionaries are created, you could use the timestamp of when the dictionary was created, or you could use uuid.uuid4(). For more info on uuid, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/uuid.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here are the docs</a>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I might be misunderstanding something, but your question seems to be "Do Python dictionaries always have unique ids?" The answer is no. A dictionary is just an associative array and they have no idea what the id is in any other dictionary.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks @Jason Fry Then if I want to have unique Ids  along with title and description, what is the best way to do it? Is it ever possible to do that?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why are you processing the output line by line? I would think you want to read the entire thing as one JSON object, something like <code>with open('localfile') as inp: d = json.load(inp)</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@chepner thanks for your comment. But I need to do this because otherwise python generates an error: TypeError: the JSON object must be str, bytes or bytearray, not 'TextIOWrapper'. But when I read it line by line. it is working.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Are you using <code>loads</code>, or <code>load</code>?</span>
