<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have this program:</p>
<pre><code>print('~Find and Replace~\n')

phrase = input('Enter a phrase:')
find = input('Enter a letter to find:')
end = input('Enter a letter to replace:')

for j in phrase:
    j = phrase.count(find)
    print(j)
</code></pre>
<p>and it came out like this:</p>
<pre><code>~Find and Replace~

Enter a phrase:pythop
Enter a letter to find:p
Enter a letter to replace:x
2
2
2
2
2
2
</code></pre>
<p>what should I do to make it print only once with the for loop?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Just get rid of the <code>for</code> loop. Why do you have it? (What are you trying to repeat?)</p>
<pre><code>print('~Find and Replace~\n')

phrase = input('Enter a phrase:')
find = input('Enter a letter to find:')
end = input('Enter a letter to replace:')

j = phrase.count(find)
print(j)

<p>If you want to replace letters in a string, then use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.replace" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>str.replace()</code></a> function. There is no need for a for-loop.</p>
<pre><code>phrase = input('Enter a phrase:')
find = input('Enter a letter to find:')
end = input('Enter a letter to replace:')

print(phrase.replace(find, end))

<span class="comment-copy">I suspect the goal is to count and replace on a per-word basis (since the prompt is for a phrase, even if they only provide one word), but yeah, the question is not clear, and they made no effort to split from a string to a list of words.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'd suspect OP wants to loop accordingly to the letter count, as ShadowRanger has also suggested this is one possibility.</span>
