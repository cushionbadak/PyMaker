<p>I am new to python, I need help with how can I get the returning values from a function call.
I tried doing this which is apparently wrong I need to assign the returning values to the mentioned variables and I cant make changes on how I return the values from the function as that is what is needed in the question.</p>
<pre><code>((cross_low,cross_high),cross_sum)=find_maximum_crossing_subarray(A,low,mid,high)
</code></pre>
<p>I am returning this type of value from the <code>find_maximum_crossing_subarray</code> function:</p>
<pre><code>tup=(max_left,max_right)
tup1=(tup,left_sum+right_sum)
return tup1
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Just drop the outside enclosing parenthesis:</p>
<pre><code>(cross_low, cross_high), cross_sum = find_maximum_crossing_subarray(A,low,mid,high)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>That's really strange syntax, but basically you're being shown the return signature from <code>find_maximum_crossing_subarray(..)</code>.</p>
<p>You can see a simplified version,</p>
<pre><code>def some_function():
    return (1, 2), 3

x = ((a, b), c) = some_function()

print(x, a, b, c)

...
... output:
((1, 2), 3) 1 2 3
</code></pre>
<p>Notice how I still had access to <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, and <code>c</code>. Similarly, you will have access to your <code>cross_*</code> variables.</p>
<p>If you need to find the max of something, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#max" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>max</code></a> is a built-in function, and so is <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#sum" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>sum</code></a>.</p>
<hr/>
<p>If you can change the return signature of <code>find_maximum_crossing_subarray(..)</code> I would do this instead:</p>
<pre><code>    # ..
    return max_left, max_right, left_sum + right_sum


results = find_maximum(A, low, mid, high)

cross_low, cross_high, cross_sum = results
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">What is the value of left_sum and right_sum? When I write some test code where max_left, max_right, left_sum, and right_sum are floats, I get no error and it all works fine. What happens when you run the code? Do you get an error?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">can you provides some sample data, some inputs and outputs you would expect. Especially the format of the output ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">please wrap your code in a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve">Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example</a>. probably a typo somewhere</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Dropping those parentheses makes no difference in my own test code.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">it's not the issue at all. those parens aren't needed but also not a problem</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This doesn't really answer their question. Granted, there isn't enough information given currently to actually answer their question.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Well, what is the question? He needs access to <code>cross_low</code>, <code>cross_high</code> and <code>cross_sum</code>...the first example shows that he has access all along. He also implies he can't change the return signature, which is somewhat irrelevant.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What is the question is a good question. Like I said, he hasn't given us enough information. All we know is "this which is apparently wrong", but the code as it is looks like it should run. We don't have enough information to debug why this code isn't working.</span>
