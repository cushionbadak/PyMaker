<p>My code is not working, I want the code to allow me to enter a word and find if it is in a csv file, then it should tell me if it is or if it isn't.</p>

<pre><code>import csv

</code></pre>
<p>This code won't work because you have an undefined 'count'. Also you need the program to be able to read the file and you missed that little bit of code. Also because you have columns that you are reading from you should have a </p>
<pre><code>for column in read:
count = count + 1
</code></pre>
<p>Don't forget to set 'count' as a variable in itself.
Good luck</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>There are a few fundamental problems in your code. </p>
<ol>
<li>You never use your import csv</li>
<li>You never define the <code>count</code> variable</li>
<li>You never define the <code>column</code> list</li>
<li>You never read any data from the file</li>
<li>You never close the file</li>
</ol>
<p>I hate to completely rewrite someone's code, but your code needs a bit of help. This code will accomplish what you want it to:</p>
<pre><code>word = input("Please enter a word: ")
delimiter = ","

with open("TEST.csv", 'r') as file:
    content = file.read().replace('\n', '').split(delimiter)

if word in content:
    print("The word you entered is in row {}".format(content.index(word)))
else:
    print("The word you enterd is NOT in the file")
</code></pre>
<p>Let me walk you through what this code does and how. </p>
<ol>
<li>We get our input like you were, with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>input()</code></a></li>
<li>We use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-with-statement" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>with</code></a> to open our file and automatically close it when we are done </li>
<li>We <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">read</a> the file as one big string, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.replace" rel="nofollow noreferrer">replace</a> all the line breaks ("\n") with empty strings and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.split" rel="nofollow noreferrer">split</a> the string on commas. We split the string into a list on commas because this is a csv file, meaning everything is separated by commas. If you use a different delimiter, just change the delimiter variable.</li>
<li>Test if the word appears anywhere in the list.</li>
<li><p>(a) If it does appear, print that it does, along with it's index (it's row)</p>
<p>(b) If it does not appear, print that it does not</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">You never define the column variable or close the file, or read data from the file.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Damn, I was ninja'd</span>
<span class="comment-copy">lol. I am still in year 11 haha so the code is newer to me</span>
