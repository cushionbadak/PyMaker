<p>Can't think of a fitting title for my question.</p>
<p>So anyway, I've been looking for an algorithm to find out if a list is balanced or not and I've came across this question: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16430702/algorithm-for-finding-if-an-array-is-balanced">Algorithm for finding if an array is balanced</a> </p>
<p>One of the answers is spot-on to what I need to accomplish. I would however, like to understand what happens if I change line 2 from the below code.</p>
<pre><code>def balanced(numbers):
    left_total, right_total = 0, sum(numbers)
    for pivot, value in enumerate(numbers):
       if left_total == right_total:
        return pivot
    left_total += value
    right_total -= value
    return None
</code></pre>
<p>I would like to know why it throws a <strong>TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable</strong> if I do this to line 2:</p>
<pre><code>left_total = 0
right_total = 0
sum(numbers)
</code></pre>
<p>Hope someone can help me understand.
Thanks! </p>

<p>The "numbers" variable you're passing in is an int.</p>
<p>You can't do sum(1) for example but you can do sum([1,2]) or sum((1,2))</p>
<p>The variable you pass to balanced must be an iterable type.  AKA a list, a tuple, a set, etc.</p>
<p>Unrelated to your error: </p>
<p>You should not be doing </p>
<pre><code>left_total = 0
right_total = 0
sum(numbers)
</code></pre>
<p>but rather </p>
<pre><code>left_total = 0
right_total = sum(numbers)
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to mimic what the function was doing.</p>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>right_total</code> is being assigned with the value of <code>sum(numbers)</code>. Not 0</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Those three lines <i>won't</i> throw that error. They also don't do the same thing as the one they're replacing.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">and numbers is a list , that's what the error is saying</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>left_total, right_total = 0, sum(numbers)</code> will assign <code>left_total</code> -&gt; 0 and <code>right_total</code> -&gt; sum(numbers)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I wasn't actually asking about the TypeError but rather the way the variables were declared. My assumption was:  <code>left_total, right_total = 0, sum(numbers)</code>  Is equivalent to:  <code>left_total = 0 right_total = 0 sum(numbers)</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you, this is what I wanted to ask but I wasn't sure how to phrase my question. :)</span>
