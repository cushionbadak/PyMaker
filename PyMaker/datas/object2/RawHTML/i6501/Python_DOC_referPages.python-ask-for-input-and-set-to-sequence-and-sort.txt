<p>I was assigned to complete a short program and as a beginner, this is harder than what I know. Please help!</p>
<ol>
<li>Get input from user to enter into a sequence of first and last names - with a space between</li>
<li>Put the inputted names into a list called 'full_names'</li>
<li>Copy list to another 2d list called 'other_list' that has first name and last names in separate columns</li>
<li>Sort that 'other_list' ascending order of 1st name</li>
<li>Make a new 2d list named 'rank' w/ sorted first and last name and their index in 'full names' list</li>
</ol>
<p>If someone can even tell me where to begin that would be great! </p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Start with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python's built-in functions</a>.</p>
<p>Notably, for this problem you'll want to use:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>input</code></a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#sorted" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>sorted</code></a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#max" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>max</code></a> / <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#min" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>min</code></a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>You've already broken the problem down into steps, you'll probably find all the functions you need on that page. Good luck!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Get input from user to enter into a sequence of first and last names -
  with a space between :</p>
</blockquote>
<p>First take input from user in sequence :</p>
<p>Generally we take input as :</p>
<pre><code>user_input=input()
</code></pre>
<p>But in your problem you want to take input in sequences so:</p>
<pre><code>user_input=str(input().split())
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Put the inputted names into a list called 'full_names'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>User_input will store in a list format so instead of using user_input variable name use full_names :</p>
<pre><code>full_names=str(input().split())
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Copy list to another 2d list called 'other_list' that has first name
  and last names in separate columns</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>other_list=full_names[:]
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Sort that 'other_list' ascending order of 1st name</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can use sorted() in-built function:</p>
<pre><code>sorted(other_list)
</code></pre>
<p>I didn't understand last part what you want there. </p>
