<p>Im trying to reach elements of two lists who both are within a list. And this last list (containing the other two lists) is in a file. </p>
<p>When I print the big list from my file, it looks like: ['[0,1],[2,3]'] and it is called rader.</p>
<pre><code>rader = ['[0,1],[2,3]'] 
</code></pre>
<p>I'm trying to print the elements in the big list with the following command:
<code>print(rader[0][0])</code> which should give me the number 0 right? But when I do this I get an error: 'IndexError: list index out of range'.</p>
<p>I think that the problem is that when I open my txt.file with the list in it and read from it <code>(file = open('eddie.txt','r'))</code>, it interprets the whole thing as a String! Is that why I cant reach the elements in the list?</p>
<p>I want it like [[0,1],[2,3]] and not ['[0,1],[2,3]'] from the txt.file(I think?) 
How do I do this? </p>
<p>Here is my code:</p>
<pre><code>from Tv_LABB2 import *


fil = open('edvin.txt','r', encoding = 'UTF-8')

rader = []

rad = fil.readline()

while rad !='':

    rader.append(rad)
    rad = fil.readline() 

fil.close()

fil = open('edvin.txt')

print(rader) (this is == ['[0,1],[2,3]'])

fil.close()



tv1 = TV('VardagsrumsTV',str(rader[0]),str(rader[1]))               

tv2 = TV('KöksTv',str(rader[2]),str(rader[3]))
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see Im importing some functions from another file, this code doesn´t run without it, but I think you understand my question!</p>

<p>You need to make <code>rader</code> a list of lists not a list of a string</p>
<p>Use <code>rader = [[0,1],[2,3]]</code> not <code>rader = ['[0,1],[2,3]']</code> </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can convert using <code>ast</code>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; rader = ['[0,1],[2,3]'] 
&gt;&gt;&gt; import ast
&gt;&gt;&gt; r = list(ast.literal_eval(rader[0]))
&gt;&gt;&gt; r
[[0, 1], [2, 3]]
&gt;&gt;&gt; print r[0][0]
0
</code></pre>

<p>Reading a file always produces byte or character strings.  If you want Python data structures, you have to make them.  Obviously, there are many tools already made to do this: the simplest (but <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1832940/why-is-using-eval-a-bad-practice">usually inadvisable</a>) is <code>eval</code>.  There is a safer variant called <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>ast.literal_eval</code></a>.</p>
<p>Yet other choices involve changing the on-disk format.  You can just use whitespace to separate your values and use things like <code>str.split</code> to make lists, or you can (if your data came from another Python process) use <code>pickle</code>.</p>
<p>Also, a simplification: <code>rader=list(fil)</code> is all you need to read text lines.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Did you create this file originally? In which case, you could eliminate the problem at its source.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">can you show us what the content of the file looks like? My guess is that a typical line looks like... <code>[0,1],[2,3]\n</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, I did!  When I open my txt-file, it contains the following [[0,1],[2,3]] and not ['[0,1],[2,3]']. Otherwise I would erase the ' ', or what do you mean? - @roganjosh</span>
<span class="comment-copy">In which case, you probably want something like the <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/pickle.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">pickle</a> module to write your list to file, rather than a text file. Then this problem will go away.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I mean: did you <i>write</i> the contents of this file or did someone else <i>write</i> the contents? I'm not asking how it looks in a text editor.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The question is ambiguous but i think that was illustrating the output of <code>print</code> and not how the OP created the list.</span>
