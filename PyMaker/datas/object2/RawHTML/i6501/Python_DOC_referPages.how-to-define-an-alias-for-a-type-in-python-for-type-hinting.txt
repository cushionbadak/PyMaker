<p>How to define an alias for a type to use type hint:</p>
<pre><code>import typing
type Ticker str # How to do this? I used golang notation. How do you do it in python?
Report = typing.Dict[Ticker, typing.List] 
</code></pre>
<p>Which means Ticker is a type of string and Report is a dict from Ticker to a list. Thank you. 
The good thing about this aliasing is that anyone knows that it is a ticker. Much clear and more readable than writing Report = typing.Dict[str, typing.List]</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>As you do with all other names that you bind to objects:</p>
<pre><code>Ticker = typing.Text
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">There's no such type as "a string of five characters" in Python. Strings can be any length. So you can't do that.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">OK. I changed it to make it just str. How do you define a new type Alias to str or any other type?</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>Ticker = str</code>?</span>
