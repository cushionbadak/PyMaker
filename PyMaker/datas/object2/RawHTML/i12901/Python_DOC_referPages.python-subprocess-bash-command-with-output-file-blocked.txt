<p>I have the following code that runs <code>LM_CMD</code> program and writes the output into file <code>fp_arpa</code>. Right after that I have another function that reads and processes that file (<code>fp_arpa</code>). However, according to the function the file is empty, while in the file system it is not. I am guessing subprocess locks the file pointer until the whole Python program finishes (I might be wrong though). How can I avoid this problem?</p>
<pre><code>base_cmd = '%s -lm %s' % (LM_CMD, fp_arpa)
subprocess.Popen([base_cmd], shell=True)
some_function_that_processes(fp_arpa)
</code></pre>

<p><code>subprocess.Popen</code> returns immediately as soon as the process is started. It doesn't wait for the process to finish. Call <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.check_call" rel="nofollow"><code>subprocess.check_call()</code></a> instead:</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python
import subprocess

subprocess.check_call([LM_CMD, '-lm', fp_arpa])
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks a lot. For some reason I thought a program will wait until subprocess.Popen finishes.</span>
