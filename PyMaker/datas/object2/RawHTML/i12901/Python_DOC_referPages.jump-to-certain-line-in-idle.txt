<p>I use IDLE when I'm coding in Python and really enjoy it's simplicity.  One thing I don't like though is when you need to navigate to a certain line and have to scroll around the place, haphazardly guessing how far you have to go to reach it.  So, my question is <strong>is there a way to jump to a certain line number in IDLE for Windows?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Kudos to @MayurKoshti</strong></p>
<p>As explained in the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/idle.html" rel="nofollow">IDLE Documents</a>, if you go <em>Edit</em> -&gt; <em>Go to Line</em>, a box appears in which you can enter a line number to jump to.  The shortcut for this is <strong>Alt + G</strong></p>

<p>Edit then go to line :D
or Alt + G</p>

<span class="comment-copy">@MayurKoshti can't believe I didn't see this!  Thanks so much</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You can use <code>ALT+G</code> to go on specific line. The line number is displaying at right-bottom of the IDLE.</span>
