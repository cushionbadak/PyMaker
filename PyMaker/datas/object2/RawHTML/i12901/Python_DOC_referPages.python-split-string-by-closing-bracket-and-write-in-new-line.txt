<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have a text file that looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>This is one sentence()This is another sentence()This is a full sentence at all)Maybe this too)This is the last sentence()
</code></pre>
<p>I need to split the parts that the text looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>This is one sentence()
This is another sentence()
This is a full sentence at all)
Maybe this too)
This is the last sentence()
</code></pre>
<p>I tried it with regex and the help of <a href="https://regex101.com/r/sH8aR8/5#python" rel="nofollow">https://regex101.com/r/sH8aR8/5#python</a> but I can't find any solution. Any ideas?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You don't need a regex just <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.replace" rel="nofollow"><code>str.replace</code></a> any closing paren with a closing paren followed by a newline:</p>
<pre><code>s="This is one sentence()This is another sentence()This is a full sentence at all)Maybe this too)This is the last sentence()"

print(s.replace(")",")\n"))
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>This is one sentence()
This is another sentence()
This is a full sentence at all)
Maybe this too)
This is the last sentence()
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can search using this lookbehind regex:</p>
<pre><code>r'(?&lt;=\))'
</code></pre>
<p>and replace by <code>"\n"</code></p>
<p><a href="https://regex101.com/r/sH8aR8/76" rel="nofollow">RegEx Demo</a></p>
<p><strong>Code:</strong></p>
<pre><code>input = u"This is one sentence()This is another sentence()This is a full sentence at all)Maybe this too)This is the last sentence()"

result = re.sub(ur'(?&lt;=\))', "\n", input)
</code></pre>
