<p>I have a 130 excel files all called cplt.csv each stored under two subfolders under the folder BM. i.e. BM/1/1/cplt.csv BM/2/2/cplt.csv and so on</p>
<p>I need to read each of these csv files and change it from 7 columns to 5 columns. The order in which I need the columns are 7th, 3rd, 2nd, 1st and 6th.</p>
<p>The 1st column is the datetime field which currently looks like 8/22/2015 1:19:01 AM
I need it to look like this -&gt; 22-Aug-2015 01.19.01 or follow the ISO format ("yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ssZ").</p>
<p>I've got two problems the way I see it, 
1) I am currently unable to access all the cplt.csv files under my BM folder. 
2) I am not sure how to change the date time to the ISO format I need it to be and to output it back to the same csv file.</p>
<p>The code I've currently got is as follows:</p>
<pre><code>import sys, argparse, csv, os

for file in os.listdir("BM"):
    if file.endswith(".csv"):
        with open(file, 'rb') as csvfile:
            for line in csvfile.readlines():
                array = line.split(',')
                newline = array[6] + "," + array[2] + "," + array[1] + "," + array[0] + "," + array[5]
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Iterate over each directory and run this function on each file, 
<code>datetime.strptime</code> will parse your dates and convert to <code>isoformat</code>, <code>itemgetter</code> pulls whatever columns you want to keep, we write to a tempfile using a <code>NamedTemporaryFile</code> and after after we have written the new content we replace the original file with <code>shutil.move</code>:</p>
<pre><code>def change_file(in_file,cols):
    with open(in_file) as f, NamedTemporaryFile("w", dir=".", delete=False) as tmp:
        r = csv.reader(f)
        wr =  csv.writer(tmp)
        for row in r:
            new = [datetime.strptime(dt, "%m/%d/%Y %H:%M:%S %p").isoformat() for dt in itemgetter(*cols)(row)]
            wr.writerow(new)
        move(tmp.name, in_file)
</code></pre>
<p>Now to find the csv files nested in the subdirectories we can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html" rel="nofollow">pathlib</a>:   </p>
<pre><code>from pathlib import Path
for fle in Path('./BM').glob('**/*.cplt.csv '):
    change_file(str(fle), (7, 3, 2, 1, 6))
</code></pre>
<p>using the same structure and a couple of test files:</p>
<pre><code>In [41]: ls
BM/  test.py  

In [35]: ls BM
1/  2/

In [36]: ls BM/2/
2/

In [37]: ls BM/2/2/
file2.csv

In [38]: cat BM/2/2/file2.csv

<span class="comment-copy">Do you want to change the original file?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@PadraicCunningham - yes please</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I added the code that will do the changes I am just a little confused by your decsription of where the files are, <i>I have a 130 excel files all called cplt.csv each stored under two subfolders under the folder</i>, I cannot see the logic in that, <code>BM/1/1/cplt.csv</code> would be a subfolder under another subfolder, if you have arbitrary nesting then you need to os.walk BM</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@PadraicCunningham - Basically in the same directory as my project I have a folder called BM in which there are 130 folders. Each of these folders have another folder in which the csv file exists.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">so there is <code>BM/folder/csvfile</code>?</span>
