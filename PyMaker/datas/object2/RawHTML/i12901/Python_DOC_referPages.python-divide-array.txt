<p>Lets say i have array like this :</p>
<pre><code> d= [[1.254,3.458,9.874][5.32,3.35,4.54][1.121,8.121,9.45][7.1215,9.454,8.14].... and etc.]
</code></pre>
<p>How i can divide d[0] [2] element with d[0] [2], d[1] [2],d[2] [2], d[3] [2] ....... and etc?
I will explain it by using numbers:</p>
<pre><code>  9.874(d[0] [2])/9.874(d[0] [2])
  9.874(d[0] [2])/4.45(d[1] [2]) 
  9.874(d[0] [2])/9.45(d[2] [2])
  9.874(d[0] [2])/8.14(d[3] [2]) ........ and etc.
</code></pre>
<p>And i want that my result would be in array :</p>
<pre><code>  Result  = [1,2.21,1.04,1.21,... and etc.] 
</code></pre>
<p>Or (if its easier) result can be added to current array : </p>
<pre><code>  d= [[1.254,3.458,9.874,1][5.32,3.35,4.54,2.21][1.121,8.121,9.45,1.04][7.1215,9.454,8.14,1.21].... and etc.]
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see result is the last array of array element: </p>
<pre><code>  d[0] [3] = 1, d[1] [3] = 2.21, d[2] [3]=1.04, d[3] [3]=1.21
</code></pre>
<p>If anyone need more explanation please write in a comment section dont add -1 :( </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This should work for your example:</p>
<pre><code>result = [d[0][2]/dx[2] for dx in d]
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you just want the last element of each inner list you could do</p>
<pre><code>d= [[1.254,3.458,9.874,1],[5.32,3.35,4.54,2.21],[1.121,8.121,9.45,1.04],[7.1215,9.454,8.14,1.21]]

for i in d: print i[-1]

1
2.21
1.04
1.21
</code></pre>
<p>and if you want it as a list you can use list comprehension </p>
<pre><code>l = [i[-1] for i in d]
print l

[1, 2.21, 1.04, 1.21]
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you're using Numpy, you can add a column to your array and fill it with the results of your division:</p>
<pre><code>1: a = np.array([[1.254,3.458,9.874],[5.32,3.35,4.54][1.121,8.121,9.45],[7.1215,9.454,8.14]])
2: b =np.hstack((a, np.zeros((a.shape[0],1))))
3: b[:,3] = b[0,2]/b[:,2]
4: b
array([[ 1.254     ,  3.458     ,  9.874     ,  1.        ],
   [ 5.32      ,  3.35      ,  4.54      ,  2.17488987],
   [ 1.121     ,  8.121     ,  9.45      ,  1.04486772],
   [ 7.1215    ,  9.454     ,  8.14      ,  1.21302211]])
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The simpler would be to compute a list comprehension (solution proposed by @elzell) <code>result = [d[0][2]/dx[2] for dx in d]</code></p>
<p>You can also add the resul as last element of each sublist (array in numpy is a different animal)</p>
<pre><code>for dx in d:
    dx.append(d[0][2]/dx[2])
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Well, it's a pretty unclear question.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">what section is unclear i can fix it</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Are you trying to do matrix arithmetic?   Some of the aspects that are unclear: division is not defined for arrays, <code>0 2</code> is a syntax error, not a valid array index, and numbers are not functions that can be called.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">Saved my life :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Srr added answered for @elzell :) it was his idea first :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user5568235: I was about to suggest it to you. That's the reason why I had explicitely given him credit for his answer. Mine was to show the possibility of changing the array. I had already upvoted his answer :-)</span>
