<span class="comment-copy">The problem is with the <code>cipher(A)</code> part on the second to last line. the <code>cipher</code> variable is a string and can't be called like a function. Are you trying to call the <code>.index()</code> method instead?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm not sure. What would you change it to?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You might want to consider using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#enumerate" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>enumerate()</code></a> instead of calling the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>.index()</code></a> method on the string itself.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That didn't work sorry</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What's the purpose of the <code>cipher(A)</code> call on the second to last line?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">When I run the code, the error message - "NameError: name 'raw_input' is not defined" - appears. Can you give me any suggestion on what to do please?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@BigTommyVernon It means you are using python-3.x . I have updated the answer.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you very much.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You're a top geezer</span>
