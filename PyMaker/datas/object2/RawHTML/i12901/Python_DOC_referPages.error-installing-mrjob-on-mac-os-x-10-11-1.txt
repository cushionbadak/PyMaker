<p>How do I successfully install?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Between <a href="https://github.com/Yelp/mrjob/pull/973" rel="nofollow noreferrer">March 2015</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Yelp/mrjob/pull/1007" rel="nofollow noreferrer">May</a> 2015, the <code>mrjob</code> <code>setup.py</code> used the Python-2 only built-in function <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#execfile" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>execfile</code></a>, which was removed from the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python 3 built-in functions</a>.</p>
<p>The <code>NameError</code> you encountered strongly suggests that the problem was due to using the Python 3 interpreter.</p>
<p>The project had a <a href="https://github.com/Yelp/mrjob/issues/1124#issuecomment-138605770" rel="nofollow noreferrer">similar bug</a> raised in September 2015, and the fixed <code>setup.py</code> had not yet been released at that time.  It appears that this bug was fixed in <a href="https://github.com/Yelp/mrjob/releases/tag/v0.5.0" rel="nofollow noreferrer">v0.5.0</a>, released 28 March 2016.</p>
<p>To install, use a version criteria:</p>
<pre><code>pip install --user "mrjob&gt;=5"
</code></pre>
<p>Also probably upgrading pip might solve the problems you mention wrt <code>sudo</code>, but that seems like an unrelated problem best addressed in a separate question.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I couldn't replicate on OsX 10.11.1 =(</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I believe that I had updated my Python interpreter to Python 3 before I attempted this install. Thanks!</span>
