<p>The following code, is the one I want it to be capitalized. Meaning once the user inputs their answer to the licence plate, I want it to be outputted in capitals:</p>
<pre><code>ask2 = ""
    plate = ""
    if int(ask) == 1:
        stop = False
        time.sleep(0.5)
        print("========================================================================")
        while not stop:
            ask2 = input("Please enter it in such form (XX00XXX): ").lower()
            valid = re.compile("[a-z][a-z]\d\d[a-z][a-z][a-z]\Z")
                                # b will start and end the program, meaning no more than 3-4 letters will be used.
            # The code which tells the user to enter the right format (keeps looping)
            # User can exit the loop by typing 'exit'
            # This is the default exit_message
            exit_message = "Verification Failed!"
            while (not valid.match(ask2)) and (ask2 != 'exit'):
                time.sleep(0.5)
                print("========================================================================\n", exit_message,
                      sep="")
                print("You can exit the validation by typing 'exit'.")
                time.sleep(0.5)
                print("========================================================================")
                time.sleep(0.5)
                ask2 = input("Or stick to the rules, and enter it in such form (XX00XXX): ").lower()
                if ask2 == 'exit':
                    exit_message = "Verification Stopped!"
                    stop = True
                    break
</code></pre>
<p>I already have constructed a code to make it capitalized, this is it; however I have no idea where to put it:</p>
<pre><code>var = input("no caps: ")
def isvalid(s):
    for i in s:
        if i in "ABC...XYZ":
            return False
    return True

while not isvalid(var):
def isvalid(s):
    for i in s:
        if i in "ABC...XYZ":
            return False
    return True
</code></pre>
<p>Thank you for the help. </p>

<p>Simply use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.upper" rel="nofollow"><code>upper()</code></a> method.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; "hello".upper()
'HELLO'
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">do you mean <code>"hello world".capitalize()</code> or <code>"hello world".upper()</code> ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">In a way yes; however, I am trying to make sure the inputted answer comes out as capital letters. Keep in mind the user is inputting the answer.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>"hello world".isupper()</code> ? <code>while not var.isupper()</code> ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Problem is, I am not capitalizing one word. Rather a whole input that the user inputs, I've no idea what it will turn out to be.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That doesn't work, unfortunately. The code I've provided will work on the other hand, I simply want to know where I place it. I am a little confused by all the loops.</span>
