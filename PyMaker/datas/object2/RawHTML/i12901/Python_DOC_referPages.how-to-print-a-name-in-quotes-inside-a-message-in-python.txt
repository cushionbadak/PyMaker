<p>I started this Python course today with no programming experience, and I can't figure this out (it's so easy but I can't seem to figure it out).</p>
<p>This is what the program should look like in the end:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is your name? 3von</p>
<p>So you call yourself '3von' huh?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is how I wrote it: </p>
<pre><code>name = input("What is your name? ")

print('So you call yourself', (name), "huh?")
</code></pre>
<p>What I can't figure out is how to get the ' ' around the (name) without it turning into a string.</p>
<p>Any help is appreciated!</p>
<p>P.S. What are the (name) things called?</p>

<p>You need to either enclose the other strings with different quotes, or escape them. Also, the default separator for <code>print()</code> is a space, which you don't want in between the quotes and <code>name</code>. Use <code>+</code> to concatenate it together, and keep in mind that this means you'll need to add the necessary spaces explicitly.</p>
<p>Different quotes:</p>
<pre><code>print("So you call yourself '" + name + "' huh?")
</code></pre>
<p>Escaped:</p>
<pre><code>print('So you call yourself \'' +name + '\' huh?')
</code></pre>
<p>String formatting is also a good approach, although you'll still need to mind your quotes or use escapes:</p>
<pre><code>print("So you call yourself '{}' huh?".format(name))
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>{}</code> will be replaced with <code>name</code>. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#formatspec" rel="nofollow">String formatting has a powerful mini language</a> and is a great tool to learn.</p>

<p>Assuming I'm reading your question correctly, you want the output to look like this:</p>
<pre><code>So your name is '3von' huh?
</code></pre>
<p>To do this, you need to both contain your single quotes within double quotes and concatenate your strings using +, like so:</p>
<pre><code>print("So your name is '" + name + "' huh?")
</code></pre>
<p>(name) is a variable, although I'm not sure that was what you were asking. And you don't need to put it in parentheses.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>name</code> here is what is called a "variable".</p>
<p>To substitute a variable into a string, the best thing to use is the <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html#format-examples" rel="nofollow"><code>format</code></a> method on strings. See the examples in the documentation, linked above. </p>
<p>In your case, you'd use:</p>
<p><code>print "So you call yourself '{}' huh?".format(name)</code></p>
<p>The <code>{}</code> inside the string indicate the place where the substitution goes, and the arguments to <code>format</code> are the variables to put in that place. </p>
<p>Note that the quotes around the outside of the string here are double quotes, and the ones inside, which you want printed, are single quotes.  Inside a double quoted string, single quotes are treated as part of the string, and vice-versa. </p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use string formating.  </p>
<pre><code>name = input("What is your name? ")

print("So you call yourself '%s' huh?" % name)
</code></pre>

<p>Try this , Are you looking for this       </p>
<p><code>print('So you call yourself '+name+ " huh?")</code></p>

<span class="comment-copy">@AndrésPérez-AlbelaH., <code>name</code> is not a tuple. <code>name</code> in this case is a string. <code>(name)</code> is also a string.  The OP is probably looking for the word "variable", however.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What's with the downvotes?  This is a perfectly legitimate question.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Oh wow, thank you! Very informative.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you so much!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You are very welcome. Glad I could help. ^^</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That is not going to get the quotes around the name.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you but it didn't work.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You want the quotes ? This will print like this      <code>So you call yourself hello huh?</code> <code>hello</code> is the name</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This doesn't work. The whole point was to get quotes around the name, e.g. <code>So you call yourself 'hello' huh?</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>print('So you call yourself '+"'"+name+"' huh?")</code></span>
