<p>I've been trying to install numpy and pandas for python 3.5 but it keeps telling me that I have an issue. </p>
<p>Could it be because numpy can't run on python 3.5 yet? </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This is as a result of a Numpy distutils bug (which is already fixed in the development branch).</p>
<p>If you have brew:</p>
<pre><code>brew install homebrew/python/numpy --with-python3
</code></pre>
<p>If you don't:</p>
<pre><code>pip3 install git+https://github.com/numpy/numpy.git
</code></pre>

<p>I was corresponding with some ppl at python.org and they told me to use</p>
<p><code>py -3.5 -m pip install SomePackage</code></p>
<p>This works. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">I tried typing this into the cmd. But it nothing happens. It just stays there and do nothing. How else can i install it?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Or should I just wait for numpy 1.10.2 to be released before trying to install it??</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@jakewong apologies, I do not know why I automatically assumed you used a Linux/Unix based system. The second command should work on Windows. The first is Mac specific.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I tried <code>pip3 install git+https://github.com/numpy/numpy.git</code> in cmd, but it doesnt collect numpy. Not sure if there is anything wrong during my python installation, but when I use cmd to <code>pip install SomePacket</code> nothing happens. No additional message or anything.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This works for Windows. For Linux this command  <code>python3.4 -m pip install SomePackage</code> should work. More information is here <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/installing/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/installing</a></span>
