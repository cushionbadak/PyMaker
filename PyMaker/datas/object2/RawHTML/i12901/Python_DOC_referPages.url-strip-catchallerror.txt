<p>You can see my whole program at <a href="https://ghostbin.com/paste/ypdmd" rel="nofollow">https://ghostbin.com/paste/ypdmd</a>.    </p>
<p>You can see that if condition should be pass but it's not. To include target list go to <a href="https://ghostbin.com/paste/pjuox" rel="nofollow">https://ghostbin.com/paste/pjuox</a> and download target list and other information. </p>

<p>You are mixing tabs and spaces. This confuses Python* and may cause unexpected behavior.</p>
<p>Use only tabs or only spaces, not both. Spaces is preferable.</p>
<p><sub>(*well, not really. Python knows exactly how to handle tabs; it just does so in a way that is very surprising to most users. In particular, one tab is <em>not</em> equivalent to 4 spaces, or 8, or whatever it looks like in your text editor. See <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#indentation" rel="nofollow noreferrer">2.1.8 - Indentation</a> for more information.)</sub></p>

<span class="comment-copy">If you get an error, you should <i>post it here</i>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Also, please don't use irrelevant tags.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm personally surprised you got help at all (good for you!), but in the future please read the help topics and guidelines on how to ask a good question. Posting a giant wall of code with no context and a bit of "Please help it's not doing what I want HALP" doesn't help anyone, including you.</span>
