<p>This is a part of the code that is relevant:</p>
<pre><code>if msgheader.startswith("Election"):
    electionMessage = msgheader.split()
    electionMessage = electionMessage[1]
    print "---My iD: %s Incoming Message: %s" %(iD, electionMessage)

    sleep(5)
    print "this is the result: " + str(float(iD) - float(electionMessage))
    if iD == electionMessage: #This is the actual code that i want to run but 
#never runs so i tried the test above to subtract the float values.
</code></pre>
<p>This is the result that i get from the code above:</p>
<pre><code>---My iD: 0.716176767833 Incoming Message: 0.716176767833
this is the result: 4.5263792714e-13
</code></pre>
<p>How is this possible? As described in the code i want to compare if iD equals to electionMessage but it never entered that if statement so i started testing with outputs and subtracting and now i get this? Anyone knows why? </p>

<p>"It’s easy to forget that the stored value is an approximation to the original decimal fraction, because of the way that floats are displayed at the interpreter prompt. Python only prints a decimal approximation to the true decimal value of the binary approximation stored by the machine"</p>
<p>So i guess the numbers are not really equal, they just seems to be on the prompt</p>
<p>I suggest np.isclose() from numpy</p>
