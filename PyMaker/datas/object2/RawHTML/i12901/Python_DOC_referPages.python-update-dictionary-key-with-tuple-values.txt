<p>I have a dictionary that has keys with two values each. I need to update the second value as pass duplicate keys. 
Clearly what I'm trying isn't working out. </p>
<hr/>
<pre><code>if value1 not in dict.keys():
    dict.update({key:(value1,value2)})
else:
    dict.update({key:value1,+1)})
</code></pre>
<p>this just returned a diction with 1s for value 2 instead of incrementing by 1</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The expression <code>+1</code> doesn't increment anything, it's just the number 1</p>
<p>Also avoid using <code>dict</code> as a name because it's a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html" rel="nofollow">Python built-in</a></p>
<p>Try structuring your code more like this:</p>
<pre><code>my_dict = {} # some dict
my_key = # something

if my_key not in my_dict:
    new_value = # some new value here
    my_dict[my_key] = new_value
else:
    # First calculate what should be the new value

    # Here I'm doing a trivial new_value = old_value + 1, no tuples
    new_value = my_dict[my_key] + 1
    my_dict[my_key] = new_value

    # For tuples you can e.g. increment the second element only
    # Of course assuming you have at least 2 elements,
    # or old_value[0] and old_value[1] will fail
    old_value = my_dict[my_key] # this is a tuple
    new_value = old_value[0], old_value[1] + 1
    my_dict[my_key] = new_value 
</code></pre>
<p><sub> There may be shorter or smarter ways to do it, e.g. using the operator <code>+=</code>, but this snippet is written for clarity </sub></p>

<span class="comment-copy">It's not quite clear from your question what your intended result is - what should happen when <code>value1</code> is already a key in <code>dict</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">value1 I want to stay the same. I just want to increment value 2. Value2 is just a counter for how many times that the key is compared to dictionary when the key already exists</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If I were able to just grab the tuple of the key im checking. Would i be able to just increment the second value and then update the dictionary?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes I just had read your comment in the question, see the example that increments the second element in the tuple :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">oh yea that worked out great. Thank you</span>
<span class="comment-copy">seems like a dumb question I should know the answer to, but how do I accept the answer...nevermind got it.</span>
