<p>I want the user to input numbers in the python shell. These numbers will then be put in a list. The user is allowed to input letters into the list as well. Once all of these are in the list, I want to be able replace all the letters in the list with 0.0. How would I do this?</p>

<p>You could try using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#list" rel="nofollow"><em>list comprehension</em></a> and the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.isalpha" rel="nofollow"><code>isalpha()</code></a> method of a string instance:</p>
<pre><code>[0.0 if str(element).isalpha() else element for element in yourList]
</code></pre>
<p>For instance:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; yourList = [1, 4, "s", "g", 5.6, "u"]
&gt;&gt;&gt; [0.0 if str(element).isalpha() else element for element in yourList]
    [1, 4, 0.0, 0.0, 5.6, 0.0]
</code></pre>
