<p>I have a Python3 script that I would like to call from my webpage. My webhost says they will not add Python3 to their site (their version of python is 2.6.6).</p>
<p>Is there anyway I can run a Python3 script from my webpage if I do not have Python3 installed? I can use Perl to run Python if it would be possible.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You cannot run it as it is, obviously, without the python3 interpreter.</p>
<p>You can compile it though (<a href="http://www.pyinstaller.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.pyinstaller.org/</a>) and run that from php.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Will this be able to compile and be ran from php?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, you compile it (see <a href="http://www.pyinstaller.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">pyinstaller.org</a>) and use it with shell_exec from php (<a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.shell-exec.php" rel="nofollow noreferrer">php.net/manual/en/function.shell-exec.php</a>).</span>
