<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I am printing a few variables in a row. One of the variables is a very long string that I want to wrap the text (currently it's printing half a word at the end of a line if it has to) so I would like the whole word to start on the next line if all of it will not fit o nthe previous line.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>print(item.name,":",item.description,"\n\nValue :",item.value)
</code></pre>
<p>I need item.decription to wrap. I can wrap the whole lot if that helpds, but I don't want to end up with characters left on the screen fro mthe wrap operation in any case. I tried:</p>
<pre><code>import textwrap
print(item.name,":",textwrap.wrap(item.description),"\n\nValue :",item.value)
</code></pre>
<p>but this doesn't work. The words don't wrap and I get square bracket characters and random commas instead in the output. How should I accomplish what should be a pretty simple wrap?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Use <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/textwrap.html#textwrap.fill" rel="noreferrer"><code>textwrap.fill()</code></a> instead, it joins the lines with newline characters:</p>
<pre><code>print(item.name, ":", textwrap.fill(item.description), "\n\nValue :", item.value)
</code></pre>
<p><code>textwrap.wrap()</code> returns a <em>list</em> of wrapped lines.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Currently this is yielding unexpected results. I'll update the question</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Please do; but note that the immediate problem you had was that <code>.wrap()</code> returns a list, while <code>.fill()</code> joins that list into one string with newlines. If you then run into other problems, that might be a <i>new</i> question you could post.</span>
