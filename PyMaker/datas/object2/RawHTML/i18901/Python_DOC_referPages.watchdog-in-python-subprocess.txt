<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I'm looking to execute an application that then binds to a defined port if successful, and then poll it over http, if it fails, restart it (pretty much a single-process simple watchdog). Looking at <a href="http://docs.python.org/3.3/library/subprocess.html#module-subprocess" rel="nofollow">subprocess</a>, but a bit unsure as to how to continue. Can anyone point me on a path or something?</p>
<p>The process has no stdin, no stdout, and no stderr (all can be discarded). Just pretty much a loop that checks if it responds (via urllib/Requests?) then sleep 30 seconds.</p>
