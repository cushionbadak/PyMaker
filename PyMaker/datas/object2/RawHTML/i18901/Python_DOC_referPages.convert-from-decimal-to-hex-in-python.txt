<p>I have a simple task, I'm requesting for user input for a 16 digit HEX number, but if the user enters a decimal number I'd like to convert it for them.
  I have the code written to re-ask for the input if it's not 16 digit HEX, but I'd like to add in the conversion from Decimal to HEX, and then validate that it's a 16 digit HEX number.</p>
<p>I guess I just need a shove in the right direction for the conversion.</p>
<p>thanks all!</p>

<p>You can just use the <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#hex" rel="nofollow"><code>hex()</code></a> builtin:</p>
<pre><code>In [23]: hex(187)
Out[23]: '0xbb'

In [24]: hex(123456789)
Out[24]: '0x75bcd15'

In [25]: len(hex(123456789)[2:])
Out[25]: 7

In [26]: len(hex(123456789)) - 2
Out[26]: 7
</code></pre>
<p>It returns a string prefixed with <code>0x</code>, so you'll need to either slice off the first two characters or check that the length is 16 + 2.</p>
<p>Also, if your user's input isn't already an integer, you'd need to convert it. Here's how I'd write the whole thing:</p>
<pre><code>def your_function(dec, length=16):
    try:
        # Converts the string into an integer
        # If dec is already an integer, it won't throw any errors
        n = int(dec)

        return len(hex(n)[:2]) == length
    except ValueError:
        # int(dec) raised the error. It's not a number.
        return False
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Use the <code>hex()</code> built-in:</p>
<pre><code>def check_hex_length(decimal_number):
  hex_number = hex(decimal_number) # hex_number now contains your number as hex.
  return (len(hex_number) - 2) == 16
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">If the hex result has a leading zero you'll never be able to know that it's 16 digits.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MarkRansom: Presumably he wants to reject decimals that would require leading 0's to take up all 16 digits. And if not, it's just a matter of checking <code>&lt;= 16</code> instead of <code>== 16</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">How can you tell the difference between a decimal and hex input if none of the digits are greater than 9?  Can you give some example inputs and their types?  Do you want just a string representation of a hex number as the output?</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>decimal</code> is the name of a stdlib class (which is why SO blued it), so may be slightly confusing as the name of your parameter.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@abarnert: I couldn't really think of a better name. Any suggestions?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Maybe something longer, like <code>decimal_numeral</code> or <code>decimal_string</code>? Kind of ugly and verbose, but it's clear and explicit. (In my own code, I would almost certainly use <code>dec</code> without thinking, and then wake up in the middle of the night with Forth nightmares where the symbol <code>dec</code> is ambiguous with the hex numeral <code>dec</code>â€¦)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Right, fixed that</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Since <code>decimal_number</code> is a string from some input function, you need one more step here.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Nope, you change types when you call the function, matey</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I don't know exactly what you mean, but calling your function with a string user input will raise a <code>TypeError: 'str' object cannot be interpreter as an integer</code> (or the same thing with slightly different wording, in earlier Python).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">So you call it as <code>check_hex_length(int(yourNumber))</code></span>
