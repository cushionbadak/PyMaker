<p>According to what I've read, sys.path should be set by PYTHONPATH. In Python, it works that way, but not in Jython. I can circumvent with <code>-Dpython.path=...</code> but I'd like to know why Jython isn't playing nicely.</p>

<p>Jython does not use PYTHONPATH: you can see <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/jython/mailman/message/11533957/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a> a discussion.</p>
<p>From 2.5 onwards there is a variable that does the same: JYTHONPATH. Before that you can use the trick you already know.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Note that you're mixing up "Python" the language with "CPython" the implementation of it. See <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/reference/introduction.html#implementations" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>. <code>PYTHONPATH</code> is a feature of CPython, as you can see <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html?highlight=pythonpath#PYTHONPATH" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>. Of course it's also a feature of PyPy and IronPython, but that still doesn't make it a feature of Python.</span>
