<p>I am trying to find a quicker way to find the closest match of Latitude &amp; Longitude in a list of Lat/Longs from a massive file where I have to open a csv file, convert it to the correct format. Choose the columns my lat and long are located and then plug them into my eqation...if it works. 
This is what I have so far...I keep getting</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>TypeError:</strong> <code>float</code> object is not subscriptable</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>def menu3(data):
    lat2 = 47.488611
    long2 = -117.578611
    data = open('eqdata.csv', 'r')
    reader = data.readlines()
    for line in reader:
        lat1 = line[4]
    for line in reader:
        long1 = line[5]
    for ix in range(len(long1)):
        lat1[ix][5]=int(long2[ix][5])

    for ix in range(len(lat1)):
        lat1[ix][4]=int(lat1[ix][4])

    distance =int((lat2-lat1)**2)**.5+int((long2-long1)**2)
    distanceSq = distance**2
    print (distanceSq)

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>reader = data.readlines()</code> reads all the lines of the file into a a list of strings.</p>
<p>These lines:</p>
<pre><code>for line in reader:
    lat1 = line[4]
</code></pre>
<p>assign <code>lat1</code> to the 5th character of each line...but it loops until the last line, resulting in <code>lat1</code> being the 5th character of the last line in the file...probably not what you want.</p>
<p>This doesn't even seem to be the code that gives you that error message, because given an input file this line:</p>
<pre><code>    lat1[ix][5]=int(long2[ix][5])
</code></pre>
<p>Since <code>lat1</code> is a single character, should give:</p>
<pre><code>IndexError: string index out of range
</code></pre>
<p><code>long2</code> is a float value assigned earlier, so indexing it would fail as well.</p>
<p><strong>Update your question with the actual source, sample input and a full traceback of the error message for better help.</strong></p>
<p>There is also a <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html" rel="nofollow">csv</a> module that helps process <code>.csv</code> files, but still need some sample input.</p>
<p>Also I suggest using a debugger, or at least some print statements, to see what your variables are doing.</p>
