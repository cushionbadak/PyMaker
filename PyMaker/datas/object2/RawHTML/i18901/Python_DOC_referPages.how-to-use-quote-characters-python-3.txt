<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I am currently opening CSV files using the following:</p>
<pre><code>with open('cweapons.csv', 'r') as csvfile:
    COMMONWEAPONS = list(csv.reader(csvfile))
</code></pre>
<p>One of the fields contains commas which are to be printed and not seen as the start of a new set of data. For example:</p>
<pre><code>Sword,1,2,"A really, Really big sword"
</code></pre>
<p>This gives 4 sets of data. I know I'm supposed to used quotechar='"' but I'm unsure of the syntax or where to put it. Where/how should I specify the quote character to get the desired result? Does the system see " as a quote character by default? If not, what does it use by default?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Yes, it <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.Dialect.quotechar" rel="nofollow">defaults</a> to <code>"</code>. If you want to change it, use keyword arguments (like this example from the <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.reader" rel="nofollow">docs</a>):</p>
<pre><code>spamreader = csv.reader(csvfile, delimiter=' ', quotechar='|')
</code></pre>
<p>Note you'll also want <code>newline=''</code> in the event there are newlines in the quotes (as per <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#id3" rel="nofollow">this footnote</a>).</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">You should use <code>newline=''</code>, but <i>normally</i>, the <code>csv.reader()</code> comes configured to recognize quoted values like that ootb.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The default dialect is <code>excel</code>, which should work just fine.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Excellent, thanks for your help!</span>
