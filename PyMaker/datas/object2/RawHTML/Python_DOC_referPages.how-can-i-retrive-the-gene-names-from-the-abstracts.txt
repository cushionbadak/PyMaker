<p>regulator of the aging process, from rodents to humans. However, given the
pleiotropic actions of IGF1, its role in the aging brain remains complex and
controversial. While IGF1 is clearly essential for normal development of the
central nervous system, conflicting evidence has emerged from preclinical and
human studies regarding its relationship to cognitive function, as well as
cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative disorders. This review delves into the
current state of the evidence examining the role of IGF1 in the aging brain,
encompassing preclinical and clinical studies. A broad examination of the data
indicates that IGF1 may indeed play opposing roles in the aging brain, depending 
on the underlying pathology and context. Some evidence suggests that in the
setting of neurodegenerative diseases that manifest with abnormal protein
deposition in the brain, such as Alzheimer's disease, reducing IGF1 signaling may
serve a protective role by slowing disease progression and augmenting clearance
of pathologic proteins to maintain cellular homeostasis. In contrast, inducing
IGF1 deficiency has also been implicated in dysregulated function of cognition
and the neurovascular system, suggesting that some IGF1 signaling may be
necessary for normal brain function. Furthermore, states of acute neuronal
injury, which necessitate growth, repair and survival signals to persevere,
typically demonstrate salutary effects of IGF1 in that context. Appreciating the 
dual, at times opposing 'Dr Jekyll' and 'Mr Hyde' characteristics of IGF1 in the 
aging brain, will bring us closer to understanding its impact and devising more
targeted IGF1-related interventions.

<p>This is my text file abtract of pubmed. this abstract contains some gene names. how can I retrive gene names </p>

<p>This should work, although it will be case sensitive.</p>
<p>First, you need to rename the abstract variable (it can't end in .txt and be considered a string):</p>
<pre><code>abstract_text =  "The insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) signaling pathway has emerged..."
</code></pre>
<p>Then you NEED a list for all the genes you want to search for:</p>
<pre><code>genes = ["IGF1"]
</code></pre>
<p>Then you can search for all the genes.</p>
<pre><code>from collections import Counter
import pandas

genes_dictionary = {}

for i in genes:
   if i in abstract_text:
      genes_dictionary[i] = 1
</code></pre>
<p>Convert the dictionary to a table and print it.</p>
<pre><code>table = pandas.Series(genes_dictionary, name = 'Count')
table.index.name = 'Gene'
table.reset_index()
</code></pre>
<p>Output: 
<code>
   Gene  Count
0  IGF1      1</code></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>usually you could do this with table(), but first some preparations:</p>
<pre><code>mytxt&lt;-"I am venkatarao.studying matsers. I am going to complete masters. my friends are venkatarao. Naveen, reddy. all are studying masters."

#remove punctations
gsub('[[:punct:]]',' ',mytxt)

#separate words
mytxt&lt;-strsplit(mytxt," ")[[1]]

#frequencies
table(mytxt)
</code></pre>
<p>However, you wanted only names and there is no way you can do this without predefining what the names are... Or getting a definitionn elsewhere. So taking your definition you could do something like this:</p>
<pre><code>find_names&lt;-c("venkatarao","Naveen","reddy","masters")
mytxt[mytxt%in%find_names]
</code></pre>
<p>Of course this doesn't find names if they are spelled incorrectly ;-)</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Using your sample data set, we can do the foloowing:</p>
<pre><code>data.txt = "I am venkatarao.studying matsers. I am going to complete masters. my friends are venkatarao. Naveen, reddy. all are studying masters."

# Isolate words by space, remove periods and commas.
all.words = unlist(strsplit(data.txt, " "))
all.words = unlist(strsplit(all.words, "\\."))
all.words = unlist(strsplit(all.words, "\\,"))

count.table = table(all.words)

# Specify Names you are interested in
&gt; count.table[names(count.table) %in% c("venkatarao", "Naveen")]
all.words
   masters     Naveen      reddy venkatarao

<span class="comment-copy">@Venkat You must review SO's guidelines on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask">how to ask questions</a>; amongst other things, you should always ask one question at a time; fundamentally changing the question after you've already gotten answers is considered very poor form, as it renders existing questions seemingly useless. Don't keep asking follow-up questions once you've received an answer. Spend time understanding solutions, do research yourself, and if you have a <i>new</i> issue ask a <i>new</i> question.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">thanks for your response arranjdavis. now I want to write this as a table format the column names are name and frequency. this is the small example I have created  for my problem sir. my problem is  I am having a bunch of abstracts where I have been collected from pubmed. now from this abstracts I need to retrive the gene names. can  I know how can I write a code to retrive the gene names from abstracts.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you want to make it case insensitive then you could convert both the text and the name to lower case:   names_dictionary[i] = text.lower().count(i.lower())</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thanks sir. now my requirement is about not case sensitive sir.          I am having a abstracts related to lung cancer. in that abstracts gene names are avilable. now I need to get gene names from this abstracts text file.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Okay I have updated my answer to what I think you are looking for. Let me know if that works, please.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It is not acceptable to completely change a question when editing it, because all previous answers become invalid.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thank you for your response.              my aim is I am not going to give the find_names file but result I need to get the all people names what all names avilable in the text file.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">yes Nishan thankyou. its good this is ok for this example. like this I am having a bunch of abstracts where I have extracted from pubmed. from this abstracts I need to retrive gene names alone. is it possible Nishan. the .txt file contains 300 article abstracts related to diseases. now I want to extract gene names that are included in the .txt  abstracts file.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Venkat you can create a vector of all gene names and then see which ones are in the text file. if <code>gene.names</code> is your vector, then change the code to <code>count.table[names(count.table) %in% gene.names]</code></span>
