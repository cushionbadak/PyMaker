<p>I need to drag this scale <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FORGS.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img alt="enter image description here" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FORGS.png"/></a> and when I run this code:</p>
<pre><code>HandScale = browser.find_element_by_xpath('//*[@data-xform="scale"]')
GridLineX = browser.find_element_by_class_name('outlined')
bottomLeft = browser.find_element_by_class_name('bottomLeft')
print GridLineX.size
action_chains = ActionChains(browser)
action_chains.drag_and_drop_by_offset(HandScale, 30, 30).click_and_hold(HandScale).perform()
</code></pre>
<p>It still has the grabbing effect Shown here:
<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/iq5nt.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img alt="enter image description here" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/iq5nt.png"/></a></p>
<p>Is there anyway to remove this effect before running the other part of my script?</p>

<p>I think you just need the <code>release()</code> function in <code>action_chains</code> which is designed to do exactly that. The line to add at the end of your current file would be:</p>
<pre><code>action_chains.release().perform()
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Edit after feedback that this didn't work:</strong> what if you do the <code>release()</code> inside your existing <code>action_chains</code>, and simply add a <code>pause()</code> after your <code>click_and_hold(HandScale)</code> so that the click is actually held and not immediately released.  Finally, since you use a webelement argument in <code>click_and_hold(HandScale)</code> I would try to release on that element with <code>release(HandScale)</code>. So, your <code>action_chains</code> might do what you want if you use the following:</p>
<pre><code> action_chains.drag_and_drop_by_offset(HandScale, 30, 30).click_and_hold(HandScale).pause(5).release(HandScale).perform()
</code></pre>
<p>If <strong>THAT</strong> doesn't work, the WebDriver API has a method called <code>reset_actions()</code> that, according to the documentation "Clears actions that are already stored locally and on the remote end".  I would add this under your current <code>action_chains</code>, but you could try inserting it before <code>perform()</code> in your current code. The line to add would just look like this:</p>
<pre><code>action_chains.reset_actions().perform()
</code></pre>
<p>If none of this works for you, you could try </p>
<pre><code>driver.execute_script("arguments[0].removeAttribute('cursor')", element")
</code></pre>
<p>If you need I think can help you figure out what to execute if none of the above works.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">So your question is how to release or "drop" the page after grabbing it?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Would action_chains.release() work?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks man! I’ll try it when I have the chance I’ll let you know.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It still hasn't worked any other ideas?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Alright I’ll try in when I have the chance thanks very much.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It still hasn't worked any other ideas?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">When you say it hasn't worked, you mean that element still has <code>cursor: grabbing</code> on that div?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@AliAl-Jabur Take a look at the edits I've made to my answer and see if you can get the mouse to release.  Let me know how it goes!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Alright thanks a lot man I’ll give it a look when I have some time means a lot.</span>
