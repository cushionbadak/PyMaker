<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I wanted to combine two .txt files into another self-generated .txt file   </p>
<p>Example:-  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Contents of File 1</p>
</blockquote>
<p>abcdefg  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Contents of file 2</p>
</blockquote>
<p>123456  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Self-generated .txt File in the output folder</p>
</blockquote>
<p>abcdefg<br/>
123456  </p>
<pre><code>filenames = [fname1, fname2, fname3]
with open('H:\output\output.txt', 'w') as outfile:
    for fname in filenames:
        with open(fname) as infile:
            for line in infile:
                outfile.write(line)  
</code></pre>
<p>i use this code where it can combine both and write the output but the problem is it is not auto-generated file, we have to personally create an output file</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This works perfectly â€“ just change the <code>file1.txt</code> and <code>file2.txt</code> lines to fit the filenames of your two files if you'd like:</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code># Open both .TXT files
file1 = open("file1.txt", "r")
file2 = open("file2.txt", "r")

# Read both .TXT files and put contents into variables
file1Contents = file1.read()
file2Contents = file2.read()

# Close both files
file1.close()
file2.close()

# Open new .TXT file for the resulting concatenated file
resultFile = open("result.txt","w")

# Write concatenated contents to resulting file
resultFile.write(file1Contents + file2Contents)

# Close resulting file
resultFile.close()
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">I suggest you break the problem down into smaller parts. For example, to accomplish this task, you need to open a file and read from it. You also need to open another file and write to it. If you don't know how to do either of these in Python, then you should google something like "read file python" or "write file python" for more information.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Code-Apprentice no that is not the case, I have to generate a new text file by itself by adding the contents of both the file, I lack in knowledge of generating a new file by itself by adding contents of those two files</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Had you done the research that Code-Apprentice suggested, you would have found your problem entirely solved by opening a file in write mode. There is nothing different about your question that cannot, unless you're missing details, be solved by that approach.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Appries what do you mean by generating a new file by itself? You mention auto-generating a file, is that any different? Do you want your program/script to know the name of the output file?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Although I have answered my own question... I'll try this</span>
<span class="comment-copy">this code is not working</span>
<span class="comment-copy">in what way is it not working?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">it is creating the file but not adding contents</span>
<span class="comment-copy">hmmm... it seems to be working on my machine</span>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>file = open("output.txt", "w") </code> serves no purpose. It's just an open file object which does exactly what <code>with open('output.txt', 'w') as outfile:</code> would do anyway</span>
