<p>Is it necessary to check if a list is empty before using a loop?</p>

<span class="comment-copy">if the list is empty, it simply wont execute the loop body,, TLDR no need to check if list is empty</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Well that of course depends on what you want to do. Do you need to know whether it is empty or not for some other step, or <code>else</code> statement?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The preferred way to check if a list is non-empty is <code>if list:</code>. But as this is no cheaper than simply getting a list iterator, you needn't bother with the check.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">I think checking for the length of the list could serve the opposite purpose for the reader - suggesting that the writer isn't confident in the workings of the <code>for</code> loop, and casting into doubt other basic things they may have misunderstood.</span>
