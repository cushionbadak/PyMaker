<p>I am trying to determine best way to search the values of my dictionary keys. </p>
<p>I cant seem to find a function that will allow me to search for specific strings within a list of lists.  I am trying to get the program to display semesters that a certain class type was taken. </p>
<p>i.e. input "ENGR" and have it return that it shows up in "fall14","fall15", and "spring16". </p>
<p>Can someone point me in the right direction regarding the pulling of data from a list within a list? I am thinking I may need to restructure the way I defined my keys.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Thank you very much.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Since you are already iterating using <code>dict.items()</code>, you should replace <code>Classes[semester]</code> with <code>information </code></span>
