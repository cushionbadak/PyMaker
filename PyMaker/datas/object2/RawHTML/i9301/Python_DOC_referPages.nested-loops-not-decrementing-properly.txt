<p>Here is my code</p>

<p>This is what I am getting. The j value on the right should decrement from 5 to 4 after the first complete loop. View code for further explanation</p>

<p>Without knowing what it is you're actually trying to accomplish, it's a little hard to answer. </p>
<p>However, this should work:</p>
<pre><code>for i in range(6, 3, -1):
    for j in range(i):
        print("[{}][{}]".format(j, i-j-1))
    print
</code></pre>

<p>I would hazard a guess that when you return to external loop statement, <em>j</em> receives its value from <em>range</em> generator - as it should, overwriting meaningless manipulations.</p>
<p>And since value of <em>i</em> (one more reason to hate one-letter variable names) returns to 0 - again, by loop - and <em>j</em> is incremented to 6, the result is obvious.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You should never modify a loop variable this way. I think every new loop resets the variable. It seems you want sort of combination of two numerical numbers. Use itertools instead. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">The 'i' and J can't be swapped around. It has to be 'i' then 'j'</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Then go ahead and swap the i's and j's in the code I listed for you: their order makes no difference (although it is custom to use i for the outer loop and j for the inner one).</span>
