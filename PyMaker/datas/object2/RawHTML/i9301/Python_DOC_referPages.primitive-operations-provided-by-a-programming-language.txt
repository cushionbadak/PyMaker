<p>I am doing MIT6.00.1x course from edX and in it, Professor Grimson talks about primitives of a programming language.</p>
<p>What does it actually mean and secondly, how it is different from the <em>tokens</em> of a programming language?</p>
<p>Please answer with reference to Python language. </p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>It depends on the context, but usually:</p>
<ul>
<li>primitives refers to built in data types of a language, that is, types that you can represent without creating an object. In python (and most other languages) such types are booleans, strings, floats, integers</li>
<li>tokens refers to a "word" (anything between spaces): identifiers, string/number literals, operators. They are used by the interpeter/compiler</li>
</ul>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">You are referring to the primitive data type but my context is related to the PRIMITIVE OPERATIONS. See this link - <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5069840/how-many-primitive-operations-in-a-simple-loop" title="how many primitive operations in a simple loop">stackoverflow.com/questions/5069840/â€¦</a>  Now may you tell me about primitive operations w.r.t. programming? I am a noob.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sorry, then it probably means that even a single statement like <code>a = 1</code> is broken down to a number of primitive (assembly-level) operations (move register to some position in memory, load the value, move to some other, store the value, etc). But this is too low-level and architecture specific, I don't know where you can find a description about how python statements map to assembly</span>
