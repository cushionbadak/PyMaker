<p>this script is meant to parse Bloomberg finance to find the GBP value during the day, this following script does that however when it returns you get this: </p>
<p>{'dateTime': '2017-01-17T22:00:00Z', 'value': 1.6406} </p>
<p>I don't want the dateTime, or the value text there. I don't know how to get rid of it. and when I try it gives me errors like this: list index out of range.</p>
<p>any answers will be greatly appreciated. here is the script (in python3): </p>
<pre><code>import urllib.request
import json 

htmltext = urllib.request.urlopen('https://www.bloomberg.com/markets/api/bulk-       time-series/price/GBPAUD%3ACUR?timeFrame=1_DAY').read().decode('utf8')  

data = json.loads(htmltext)  

datapoints = data[1]['price'] 

print(datapoints)  
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This should work for you.</p>
<pre><code>print (data[0]['price'][-1]['value'])
</code></pre>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> To get all the values,</p>
<pre><code>for data_row in data[0]['price']:
    print data_row['value']   
</code></pre>
<p><strong>EXPLANATION</strong>: <code>data[0]</code> gets the first and only element of the list, which is a dict. <br/> <code>['price']</code> gets the list corresponding to the price key. <br/> <code>[-1]</code> gets the last element of the list, which is presumably the data you'll be looking for as it's the latest data point.
<br/> Finally, <code>['value']</code> gets the value of the currency conversion from the dict we obtained earlier. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">First of all, the example data you provided does not contain <code>price</code>, so that should throw you an exception. Also <code>dict</code> objects are not indexable, meaning you can't do <code>[1]</code>. Try, <code>print(data['value'])</code>. Basically JSON data is nearly identical to what python calls <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries" rel="nofollow noreferrer">dictionaries</a> - And they are not indexable, they're accessed via the key value, in your example above that would be either <code>'dateTime'</code> or <code>'value'</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">how would i get all elements ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">when i try that for the dateTime value, i get an error which reads 'TypeError: 'float' object is not subscriptable'. What does this mean? and can you help me with it ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Also thankyou so much, for helping me out!</span>
