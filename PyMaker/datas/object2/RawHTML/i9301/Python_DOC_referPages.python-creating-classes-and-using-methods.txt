<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have two python files. I would like to use variables created in file2.py and print them in file1.py</p>
<p>file1.py</p>
<pre><code>print 'Hello world'
print x
</code></pre>
<p>file2.py</p>
<pre><code>x = 2
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can also access methods from the file you've imported with the import statement.</p>
<p><code>import file2 as file
print(file.getValueOfX())</code></p>
<p>This works if you have a method in file2 as such:</p>
<pre><code>def getValueOfX():
   return x
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can import the file 2 into the file 1 like this:</p>
<pre><code>import file2 as file
print file.x
</code></pre>
<p>This will help you</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Maybe you want to reread the chapter about <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Modules</a> in the Python Tutorial.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">You used <code>import</code> with a capital letter and used a function that was not defined.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Or you know, <code>from file2 import x; print(x)</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thought I'd give him/her a way to use methods as well since it was written in the title.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">'Creating classes' was also in the title. I just think OP had no idea what they were doing.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Actually this is very helpfull as I wanted to work with methods as well</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Actually he wants to import file2 in file1, although that is of course a minor detail.</span>
