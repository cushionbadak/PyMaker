<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>With this code I am trying to generate simple multiplication tables. The program should ask for input and multiple that number in a range up to 15 and the generate the multiplication table for the number. After the if_name_ == '<em>main</em>':      line I end up with a syntax error after the colon. I normally program in python 2, so python 3 is a bit new to me but I'm not sure what the difference is. Below I have listed the short but full code. Any help would be much appreciated. </p>
<pre><code>'''Multiplication Table'''

def multi_table(a):
    for i in range(1,16):
        print(' {0} x {1} = {2} '.format(a, i, a*i))



if_name_ == '_main_':
    a = input('Enter a number: ')
    multi_table(float(a))
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>As @Maroun Maroun said right, it has to be <code>if __name__ == "__main__"</code> . But you wont need it. Just write it at the bottom : </p>
<pre><code>'''Multiplication Table'''

def multi_table(a):
    for i in range(1,16):
        print(' {0} x {1} = {2} '.format(a, i, a*i))

a = input('Enter a number: ')
multi_table(float(a))
</code></pre>
<p>Should work, too.</p>
<p>EDIT: In the official docs :</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/__main__.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/<strong>main</strong>.html</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>if __name__ == "__main__":</code></p>

<pre><code>if_name_ == '_main_':
    a = input('Enter a number: ')
    multi_table(float(a))
</code></pre>
<p>should be :</p>
<pre><code>if __name__ == "__main__":
    a = input('Enter a number: ')
    multi_table(float(a))
</code></pre>
<p>Notice that both variable <code>__name__</code> and <code>__main__</code> has two underscores around them and that there must be a space between the if keyword and the start of the condition.</p>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>if_name_</code> ? Did you mean <code>if __name__ == "__main__"</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Well yes, but I get the error right after the colon.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You get the error at the colon because you don't have a proper <code>if</code> statement. Your syntax is wrong, hence the <i>syntax</i> error.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The downside of this is that if you later want to <code>import</code> the <code>multi_table</code> function for use somewhere else, it will block on input. See e.g. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/419163/3001761">*"What does <code>if __name__ == “__main__”:</code> do?"</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thats true, @jonrsharpe , but if it should be a library, he wouldnt have put it in the same file as the input</span>
<span class="comment-copy">So it did work just fine without that line, but even when I did change the line to have two underscores I still had a syntax error. I'm trying to understand why.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">But even in the official docs its with two underscores.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Bbrown Did you carefully check that there were two underscores before <i>and</i> after both <code>name</code> and <code>main</code>? And you did remember to add the space after <code>if</code> too, yes? If your new version is still not working, perhaps paste it in as another example of a non-working syntax, in your question text. The SyntaxError was because of the missing space; the other two problems would have created different errors (such as NameError for <code>_name_</code>).</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>== '__main__':</code> - note # of underscores</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, i was still editing my answer.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><i>both variable <code>__name__</code> and <code>__main__</code></i> I doubt <code>__main__</code> is a variable.</span>
