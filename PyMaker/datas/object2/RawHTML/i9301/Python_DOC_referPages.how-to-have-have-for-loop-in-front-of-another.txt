<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Lets say you're cycling through a string like "hello" and need a nested for loop.</p>
<p>So you say something like:</p>
<pre><code>for i in str:
    for j in str:
</code></pre>
<p>But you want the j loop to start one position in front of the i loop.</p>
<p>So the i loop will start at "h" and the j loop will start at "e"</p>
<p>I thought it would be something like:</p>
<pre><code>for i in str:
    j = i + 1
    for j in str:

Error:cannot concatenate 'str' and 'int' objects 
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Just slice the string where you want to start off with, now <code>j</code> starts at <code>'e'</code> and <code>i</code> starts at <code>h</code></p>
<pre><code>x = 'hello'

for i in x:
    for j in x[1:]:
        print(i,j)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#enumerate" rel="nofollow noreferrer">enumerate</a> with slices.</p>
<pre><code>for i, char in enumerate(s, 1):
    for other_char in s[i:]:
        ....

</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Iterate over a <code>range</code>:</p>
<pre><code>my_string = "hello"

for i in range(len(my_string)):
    j = i - 1 # i-1 is the index before, i+1 would be the position after
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">you try do <code>j = "h" + 1</code> so you get error.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">you need to enumerate an integer range not characters..</span>
<span class="comment-copy">it doesn't work as  OP expects. <code>j</code> always starts at <code>e</code> but it have first start at <code>e</code>, later at first <code>l</code>, later at second <code>l</code>, etc.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@furas eh OP was very unclear, wait where does it says he wants the inner loop the be advanced o.o</span>
<span class="comment-copy">the only one which works as OP expects.</span>
