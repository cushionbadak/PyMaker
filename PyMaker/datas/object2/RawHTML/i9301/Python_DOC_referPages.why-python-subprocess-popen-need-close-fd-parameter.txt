<p>Creating a subprocess seems to need to close some fd from caller, e.g., if caller opened fd 0,1,2(stdin,out,err) and fd=3(file named "a.txt"), and subprocess.Popen sets "close_fd=True", like</p>
<pre><code>p=subprocess.Popen(cmd,shell=True,close_fds=True,stdout=None...
</code></pre>
<p>Does it mean:</p>
<p>(1) fd 0-3 are closed in subprocess?</p>
<p>(2) if fd 0-3 are closed, how could subprocess print lines to screen, or communicate its input/output with caller by :</p>
<pre><code>p.communicate()
</code></pre>
<p>Just a bit confused. Explanations? </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Only <code>3</code> is closed. From the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Popen docs</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If close_fds is true, all file descriptors except 0, 1 and 2 will be
  closed before the child process is executed. (POSIX only).</p>
