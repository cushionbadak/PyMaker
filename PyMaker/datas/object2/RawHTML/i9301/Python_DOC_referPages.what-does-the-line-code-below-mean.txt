<p>For a task in school we have to develop a programme that will take a piece of text from the user turn this to a list and then find all positions of a word that the user has searched for within the text.</p>
<p>I have found multiple ways to nearly do this but they all have a slight downfall somewhere along the line. Apart from one but this has one line I do not understand and therefore I was wondering if anyone could explain this to me.</p>
<p>The line of code is <code>position = [I for I, x in enumerate(text2) if x == (word)]</code></p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The <code>enumerate</code> function creates the indices corresponding to the position of an element in a sequence.</p>
<p>So if you have the list <code>l = ['this', 'is', 'a', 'text']</code>, enumerate would generate <code>[(0, 'this'), (1, 'is'), (2, 'a'), (3, 'text')]</code> (actually it creates a generator, but that's not really important for now).
According to the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#enumerate" rel="nofollow noreferrer">python docs</a>, enumerate is equivalent to:</p>
<pre><code>def enumerate(sequence, start=0):
    n = start
    for elem in sequence:
        yield n, elem
        n += 1
</code></pre>
<p>The tuples are then unpacked into <code>I, x</code>. If x is equal to the <code>word</code>, <code>I</code> is added to the list.</p>
