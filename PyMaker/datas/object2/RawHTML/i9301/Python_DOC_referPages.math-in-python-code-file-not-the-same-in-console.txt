<p>I'm trying to find out what's going on here. I'm running through <a href="https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex3.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Learn Python the Hard Way</a> book, and it got to the point where it wanted me to type out complex math: like those speed-math problems you may have gotten in elementary school. The problem is when I run the problem in the file from console, it produces an answer different than what you would find if you typed the problem into the console directly.</p>
<p>My example being thus:</p>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZdSvX.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img alt="enter image description here" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZdSvX.png"/></a></p>
<p>The first line is the problem with the result that comes from the file being the following line. Then I replicate the <em>exact same</em> problem within the console to get the following result.</p>
<p>The site is insinuating that one would assume to see the number round down, while the author says it's truncating the number, or <a href="https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex3.html#common-student-questions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">"dropping the fractional part after the decimal"</a>. I see neither of those things happening.</p>
<p>Can anyone tell me what's going on here? I currently have Python 2.7 installed.</p>

<p>Both operands in <code>1/4</code> are integers. Python doesn't auto-convert the result of that operation to float. PowerShell does. Hence Python subtracts 0, whereas PowerShell subtracts 0.25.</p>
<p>Change the Python statement to this:</p>
<pre class="lang-python prettyprint-override"><code>3 + 2 + 1 - 5 + 4 % 2 - 1.0 / 4 + 6                           # returns 6.75
</code></pre>
<p>and you'll get the same result as in PowerShell.</p>
<p>For PowerShell to give the same result as Python you need to <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee176879.aspx" rel="nofollow noreferrer">emulate an integer division</a>:</p>
<pre class="lang-bsh prettyprint-override"><code>3 + 2 + 1 - 5 + 4 % 2 - [Math]::Floor([int]1 / [int]4) + 6    # returns 7
</code></pre>

<p>In the first example, you are performing arithmetic in Python. In the second, you are using the Windows console. They use different rules to evaluate such expressions -- notably the <code>1/4</code> portion (Python does not use floats unless you tell it to, so the result is <code>0</code>).</p>
<p>I get the same answer when I compare a Python script vs the Python console:</p>
<pre><code># Python script.
$ python -c 'print 3 + 2 + 1 - 5 + 4 % 2 - 1 / 4 + 6'
7

# The Python console.
$ python
Python 2.7.11 (default, Jul 30 2016, 18:49:54)
&gt;&gt;&gt; print 3 + 2 + 1 - 5 + 4 % 2 - 1 / 4 + 6
7

<span class="comment-copy">And this is one of many reasons why you shouldn't use LPTHW, chief among them being that Zed thinks Python 3 is an untested fad. He's wrong. Install the latest version of Python 3, then take the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">official tutorial</a> on python.org. After that, check <a href="http://sopython.com/wiki/What_tutorial_should_I_read%3F" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a> for other tutorials and educational material. Reddit's <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/python" rel="nofollow noreferrer">r/python</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/index" rel="nofollow noreferrer">r/learnpython</a> groups have lots of tutorial and other info on their sites as well.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MattDMo: Zed said you would say that...but I'll take a look anyway.</span>
