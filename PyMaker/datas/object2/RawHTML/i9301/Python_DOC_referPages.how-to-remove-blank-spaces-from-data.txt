<p>I am a new python developer and I having a bit of an issue with dictionaries. When I attempt to scrape the data for the dictionary from a website there is blank spaces in the data, such as <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cMfSN.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this code snippet, showing the data with the space</a>, just to clarify I am trying to grab the number before 'ref'</p>
<p>So my question is how do i remove the blank spaces before and after the 'a' classes text</p>

<p>Your PNG shows that the space is in a URL. I would use</p>
<p>urllib.unquote(string)</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Have you tried <code>strip()</code> and then <code>split()</code> ?</span>
