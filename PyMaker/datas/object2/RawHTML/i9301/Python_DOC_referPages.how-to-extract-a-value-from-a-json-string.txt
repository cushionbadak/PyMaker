<p>Im having to use this json module for an assignment for python <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html#module-json" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html#module-json</a>
And I can't figure out how to extract the "llcontinue" value from something like  this example string <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=query&amp;format=json&amp;prop=langlinks&amp;list=&amp;titles=tallinn&amp;lllimit=10" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=query&amp;format=json&amp;prop=langlinks&amp;list=&amp;titles=tallinn&amp;lllimit=10</a></p>
<p>The idea is to get it and then run a function again and from that json string to get the language values.</p>

<p>@Hope, you're right, <code>json.loads()</code> works in your example, though I'm not sure how the <code>object_hook</code> option works or if it would even be necessary. This should do what your asking:</p>
<pre><code>import urllib, json
url = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=query&amp;format=json&amp;prop=langlinks&amp;list=&amp;titles=tallinn&amp;lllimit=10'
response = urllib.urlopen(url)
data = json.loads(response.read())
print data['continue']['llcontinue']
</code></pre>
<p>output:<br/>
<code>31577|bat-smg</code></p>
<p>With this you should be able to get the language values you're after.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Include your attempt and error that you got in the question. Hint: You should use <code>json.loads()</code>. And read <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/how-to-ask">How to Ask</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Can you edit your question to include some code using the module and explain what, if any, errors you're getting?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Might also be worth having a look at the tour (<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/tour">stackoverflow.com/tour</a>) for guidance on what to include in a question.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I really dont know where to even start, how does json.loads() work? Like if I gave it the string as a param aka something like json.loads(theLongString, object_hook="llcontinue")? Which just gives a "'str' object is not callable" error since it's not actually an object..</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yup that's it, was just really confused, didn't realise that what you get from json.loads() is a dict and then it was just a matter of looking up nesting dictionaries. Thanks</span>
<span class="comment-copy">cool, i'm glad you figured it out, cheers!</span>
