<p>I have a couple of python scripts running in the .openshift/cron/[hourly|minutely|etc] directories.</p>
<p>Problem is, .pyc files are being generated and cron is trying to run those as well.</p>
<p>Is this something that can be managed through openshift, limiting the extensions it attempts to run or would I be better off just adding the following to the top of each .py file?</p>
<pre><code>import sys
sys.dont_write_bytecode = True
</code></pre>

<p>You can set environment variable <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE</a> to something that is non empty string.  </p>
<p>Note that cron runs its own shell,  so you should either set it in the beginning of crontab or in /etc/default/cron</p>
