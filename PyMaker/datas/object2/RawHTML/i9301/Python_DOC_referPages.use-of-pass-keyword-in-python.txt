<p>What is the use of the "pass" keyword in Python? I don't know why or in what instance you would need to use it, since it literally does nothing. Can anyone give me a reason to use these other than for testing? It serves as a good placeholder, true, but does it have any other uses?</p>

<p>For example you can use <code>pass</code> as placeholder for code, which you want to write later and syntactically you need some statement there.</p>
