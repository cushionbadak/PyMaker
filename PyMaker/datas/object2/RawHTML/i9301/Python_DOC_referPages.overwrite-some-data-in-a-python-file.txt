<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I was hoping someone could help me, I am currently trying to add some data into a text file, however the way I am doing it isnt giving me what I want. I Have a file with 20+ lines in it with text and want to overwrite the first 30 characters of the file with 30 new characters. The code I have deletes all the content and adds the 30 characters only. Please help :)</p>
<pre><code>file=open("text.txt", "w")
</code></pre>
<p>is there something wrong with this to why its reoving all of the original data too instead of simply overwriting over it?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>One way is to read the whole file into a single string, create a new string with first 30 characters replaced and rewrite the whole file. This can be done like this:</p>
<pre><code>with open("text.txt", "r") as f:
    data = f.read()

new_thirty_characters = '&lt;put your data here&gt;'

new_data = new_thirty_characters + data[30:]

with open("text.txt", "w") as f:
    f.write(new_data)
</code></pre>
<p>Ideally, you have to check that file contains more than 30 characters after it's read. Also, do not use <strong>file</strong> and other reserved names as variable names.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">When in doubt, read the documentation of <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>open</code></a>: "<code>"w"</code> open for writing, truncating the file first".</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thats a really good way to get around that thank you I will try it</span>
