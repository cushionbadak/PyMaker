<p>I'm writing some unit tests for a server program which catches most exceptions, but logs them, and would like to make assertions on the logged output. I've found the <a href="https://github.com/Simplistix/testfixtures" rel="nofollow noreferrer">testfixtures</a> package useful to this end; for example:</p>
<pre><code>import logging
import testfixtures

with testfixtures.LogCapture() as l:
    logging.info('Here is some info.')

l.check(('root', 'INFO', 'Here is some info.'))
</code></pre>
<p>Following the <a href="http://testfixtures.readthedocs.io/en/latest/logging.html#the-context-manager" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation</a>, the <code>check</code> method will raise an error if either the logger name, level, or message is not as expected.</p>
<p>I would like to perform a more 'flexible' kind of test in which I make assertions on the message using a wildcard for the other elements of the tuple. This less stringent assertion would look something like</p>
<pre><code>l.check((*, *, 'Here is some info.'))
</code></pre>
<p>but this is not valid syntax. Is there any way to specify a 'wildcard' in the <code>check</code> method of the <code>testfixtures.logcapture.LogCapture</code> class?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The way to check messages only (which, as pointed out to me by the author, is actually described in the <a href="http://testfixtures.readthedocs.io/en/latest/logging.html#inspecting" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation</a>) is to use the <code>records</code> attribute of the <code>LogCapture</code> class, which is a list of <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/logging.html#logrecord-objects" rel="nofollow noreferrer">logging.LogRecord</a> objects. So the appropriate assertion is:</p>
<pre><code>assert l.records[-1].getMessage() == 'Here is some info.'
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Incidentally, in Python 3 there is also the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestCase.assertLogs" rel="nofollow noreferrer">assertLogs</a> method, of which the <code>output</code> appears to be a string consisting of the same tuple (logger name, level, and message) concatenated with colons (<code>:</code>).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Actually, I was referring to the <code>attributes</code> parameter as documented here: <a href="http://testfixtures.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#testfixtures.LogCapture" rel="nofollow noreferrer">testfixtures.readthedocs.io/en/latest/…</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">I also hate asserts, would always recommend compare instead: <a href="http://testfixtures.readthedocs.io/en/latest/comparing.html#the-compare-function" rel="nofollow noreferrer">testfixtures.readthedocs.io/en/latest/…</a></span>
