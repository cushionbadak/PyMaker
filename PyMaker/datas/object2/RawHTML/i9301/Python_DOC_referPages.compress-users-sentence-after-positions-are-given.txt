<p>I done this code below and had some help with the compression part. The code is not working and I don't understand how to fix it. In my class we are still beginners so i'm not too good. Also when its asking the user for a sentence, why is it stating as b'_' instead of Please enter a sentence?</p>
<pre><code>import gzip
File = open('Users Sentence.txt', 'w') 
Sentence = input(b"Please input a sentence ")                                                                
print (Sentence)                                                                                            
varNameIn = Sentence.encode('utf8')
Lower = Sentence.lower()                                                                                    
Splitsentence = Lower.split()                                                                                                                                                              

Userfile = File.write(Sentence)                                                                             
varNameIn = Splitsentence 
varNameOut = gzip.compress(varNameIn)
print(varNameOut)

varNameDecon = gzip.decompress(varNameOut)
print(varNameDecon.decode('utf-8'))

positions = {Splitsentence:index for index, Splitsentence in reversed(list(enumerate(Splitsentence, 1)))}   
fileposition = (' '.join(str(positions.get(word)) for word in Splitsentence))
print (fileposition)

File.close()

<p>it gives me this error message and I don't understand it:</p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "\\USER-PC\Users\user\Documents\homework\CW Computing\2.py", line 11, in &lt;module&gt;
    varNameOut = gzip.compress(varNameIn)

    f.write(data)

<p>Your code with my annotations:</p>
<pre><code>Sentence = input(b"Please input a sentence ") # Sentence is type str
print (Sentence)
varNameIn = Sentence.encode('utf8') # not used

Splitsentence = Lower.split() Splitsentence is a list of str objects

<p>You need to rethink what/why you wish to do data compression ...</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Wild guess: you can't compress a list. Try compressing something else, such as a string.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I think you can only compress <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bytes" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>bytes</code></a>-like objects, though the docs are a little unclear</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You might want to combine <code>pickle</code> with <code>gzip</code> to compress a <code>list</code></span>
