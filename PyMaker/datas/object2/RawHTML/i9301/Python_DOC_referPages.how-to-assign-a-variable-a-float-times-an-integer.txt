<p>Q1 should be able to contain 1.602*10^-19 and Q2: -1.602*10^-19
Instead it gives me a value error: ValueError: invalid literal for float().
What am I doing wroing. I am a beginner by the way.</p>
<pre><code>import os
Clear = lambda: os.system("cls")
Clear()
Q1 = float(raw_input("What's Q1?\n"))
Q2 = float(raw_input("What's Q2?\n"))
r = float(raw_input("What's radius?\n"))

    k = 8.99*10**9
    return((k((Q1) * Q2))/r**2)
print(calc(Q1, Q2, r))

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You did not say what input you are using or what line you are getting the error, so I am going to assume you are trying to do <code>float("1.602*10^-19")</code>.</p>
<p>This is not a valid argument, to need to use a different notation to meet the required format:</p>
<pre><code>float("1.602e-19")
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Did you input <code>1.602*10^-19</code>?
If so, please note the correct format is  <code>1.602e-19</code></p>

<span class="comment-copy">While you're playing with numbers, if you are beginning, perhaps <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/floatingpoint.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">some background concerning floating points</a> could come in handy now or later on.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks I'll check it out! :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I did input the wrong value, but not even 1.602*10 works.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ok hold on, I'm dumb, 1.602e-19 is the same thing as 1.602*10^-19. But now there's another problem. I can asign a value to Q1 and Q2 but when I asign the value 0.051 to r it gives me the error float object is not callable</span>
<span class="comment-copy">First of all, that would be a different question. Second of all, are you sure you're even typing <code>0.051</code> when you're asked the radius?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ye that's another question I guess, ok well thanks a lot I just didn't know how to asign the value correctly. Thanks a lot!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I did not thanks a lot, but there's another problem not even 1.602*10 works.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Snase and when were you even told you should use <code>1.602*10</code>? Are you even reading the answers?</span>

<span class="comment-copy">Ok well it works now so thanks a lot for your answers.</span>
