<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>{"python":[
  {"name":"achname","points":9999, "description":"The best achievement ever"}
]}
</code></pre>
<p>I want to delete the achievement <code>achname</code> from the list - but I don't know the category name(<code>python</code>). The achievement will always be one level down, but maybe in a different category other that python. How can I do this?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>What about using del, and the .keys() method?  I don't know how your dictionary is going to be structured, but assuming that "name" will always refer to the achievement you want to delete:</p>
<pre><code>for key in foo.keys():
    if "name" in foo[key]:
        del foo[key]["name"]
</code></pre>
<p>Unfortunately, you will need to iterate over every top-level element in the dictionary, to search through all the sub dictionaries.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">You will have to search through all keys in the outer dictionary, then through each list value until you find one with the right name. See e.g. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html</a> for working with dicts and lists.</span>
