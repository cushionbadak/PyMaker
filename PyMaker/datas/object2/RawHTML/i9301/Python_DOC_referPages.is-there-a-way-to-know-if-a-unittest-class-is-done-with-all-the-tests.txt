<p>I have a class that implement unittest.TestCase; I would like to know when all the tests has been executed; and perform some operation.</p>
<p>Although I can't see how can I get this info; the class does not seem to have a clue about the number of tests, or at least I was not able to find out where this info is hidden.</p>
<p>I would like to do a simple check, so I can trigger another class in the same file, to perform some analysis and formatting data. Am I looking for something that in fact is not possible?</p>

<p>There is a special class method for that - <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestCase.tearDownClass" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>tearDownClass()</code></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A class method called after tests in an individual class have run.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>import unittest

class MyTestCase(unittest.TestCase):
    @classmethod
    def tearDownClass(cls):
        print("All the tests in this class are done")

    def test_something(self):
        self.assertTrue(True)

    def test_something_else(self):
        self.assertFalse(False)

<span class="comment-copy">I see, so there is a teardown(), called after each test, and a teardownclass() that is used for the class itself; thanks!</span>
