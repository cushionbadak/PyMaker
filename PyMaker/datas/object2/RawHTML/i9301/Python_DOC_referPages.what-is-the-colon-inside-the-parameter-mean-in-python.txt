<p>What does the colon on words_pron_dict:str mean? I am getting syntax error on python 2.7. Is it python 3? How can i use it?</p>
<pre><code>class TextToSpeech:

    CHUNK = 1024

    def __init__(self, words_pron_dict:str = 'cmudict-0.7b.txt'):
        self._l = {}
        self._load_words(words_pron_dict)
