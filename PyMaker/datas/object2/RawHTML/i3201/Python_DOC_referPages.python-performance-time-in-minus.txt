<p>I used to use the same method but I get the performance time in seconds (e.g., 0.0003). This time I do not know why I am getting the time in minus. I used to use the same device. I use Linux Ubuntu 18. This is an example:</p>
<pre><code>import time 
import datetime

start = time.perf_counter() 
print("something")
duration = time.process_time() - start
print("performance time: ", duration, "sec.")
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>performance time:  -30559.147778458 sec.
</code></pre>
<p>Is there anything wrong? how to get perf. time in positive values?</p>

<p><code>time.perf_counter()</code> and <code>time.process_time()</code> don't return the same data... You cannot subtract one from the other and expect anything but garbage.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.perf_counter" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>time.perf_counter()</code></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Return the value (in fractional seconds) of a <strong>performance counter</strong>, i.e. a clock with the highest available resolution to measure a short duration. It does include time elapsed during sleep and is system-wide. <strong>The reference point of the returned value is undefined, so that only the difference between the results of consecutive calls is valid.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.process_time" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>time.process_time()</code></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Return the value (in fractional seconds) of <strong>the sum of the system and user CPU time of the current process</strong>. It does not include time elapsed during sleep. It is process-wide by definition. <strong>The reference point of the returned value is undefined, so that only the difference between the results of consecutive calls is valid.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<hr/>
<p>Pick either <code>time.perf_counter()</code> or <code>time.process_time()</code> - but don't confuse the returned values.</p>
<p>I suspect you'll want to use <code>time.process_time()</code>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks. That's was a typo.</span>
