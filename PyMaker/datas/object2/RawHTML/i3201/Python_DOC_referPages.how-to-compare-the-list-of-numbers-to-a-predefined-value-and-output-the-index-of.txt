<p>I have 2 lists, <code>A= [ 18.0, 25.6, 35.6, 36.6,2.0]</code> and <code>B=[ root, init, top, cpu, mem]</code> both are of length 5.</p>
<p>I want to compare the elements of A are greater than 30.0 or not.
And want to output all the elements which are greater than 30 in A.
Also output the index of those elements along with the entry at same index number in B</p>
<p>I am new to python and hence want to learn how to compare elements of list to a number..
If i am using</p>
<pre><code>For i in A:
       If i &gt; 30
      print A[i]
</code></pre>
<p>But its showing me syntax error.</p>
<p>Please help me with the code.</p>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>for</code> and <code>if</code> are lowercase and you need a colon after 30, and further indentation of <code>print</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">In python u dont require colons right?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Where did you get that idea from?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">On further though, I think you might be referring to <i>semi-colons</i> which are not required at the end of lines, but you still require colons at the end of <code>for</code> and <code>if</code> statements.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It doesn't show the output which u have mentioned. Its just displaying the combination of 2 lists.  it is not comparing it to.30.  It prints every entry</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Well, then you must have made some mistake copy/pasting my code. Just try it a it is, it works.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@LutzHorn my only guess is that they are actually running P2.7 and the list contains strings, not floats. The example list of strings is also missing inverted commas.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@roganjosh Well, the list <code>B</code> from the question contains names. But I am not inclined to guess.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@AnketPadwalkar there is no way you could get a syntax error on that if you copied it correctly. I really don't think we're going to be able to solve this issue for you.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">"output the index of those elements"</span>
<span class="comment-copy">While this works, it is not very Pythonic. Iterating over the index of a list is something done in C.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is just printing the same list.  Its nore comparing whether its greater than 30 or not.. Below 30 values are also printed</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@AnketPadwalkar Are you kidding? There is a big comparison <code>&gt; 30</code> which is what you want. Are you sure you run the code of Ira?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No i have copied the same code.. It is printing all the values of A and all the values of B aswell</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>zipped</code> is what? And using a loop index <code>i</code> is not Pythonic.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@LutzHorn True, but knowing why it should be Pythonic takes time</span>
