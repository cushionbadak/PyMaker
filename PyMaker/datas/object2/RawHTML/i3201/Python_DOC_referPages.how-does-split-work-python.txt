<p>In the following examples, I am splitting an empty string by a space. However, in the first example I explicitly used a space and in the second example, I didn't. My understanding was that <code>.split()</code> and <code>.split(' ')</code> were equivalent. </p>
<p>Why do these two examples give different outputs?</p>
<pre><code>In [1]: "".split(' ')
Out[1]: ['']

In [2]: "".split()
Out[2]: []
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
<p>If sep is not specified or is None, a different splitting algorithm is applied: runs of consecutive whitespace are regarded as a single separator, and the result will contain no empty strings at the start or end if the string has leading or trailing whitespace. Consequently, splitting an empty string or a string consisting of just whitespace with a None separator returns [].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sep is the separator. What it says is if we don't pass anything to split, <strong>whitespaces</strong> are considered as separators, it will <strong>apply a different algorithm</strong> to split strings and will return us a <code>[]</code> but since <strong>you passed a sep</strong>, it will <strong>not apply this algorithm</strong></p>
