<p>Is there a python or numpy function that returns the argument or index of some value (or set of values) that exists in an iterable? I want something that is similar to the functionality of:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;c= np.array([1,2,3])
&gt;&gt;np.argmin(c)
0
</code></pre>
<p>but is able to do:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;c.*somefunction*(2)
1
</code></pre>
<p>In the pandas library, you can create a boolean mask that returns only the values that match the condition, and from there you can return the indices of these values. But how might this be done without pandas?</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Your question doesn't make sense. Most iterables <i>don't have indices</i>, those that do, frequently provide such a functionality as methods on those objects or, in the case of <code>numpy</code>, you can use <code>numpy.where</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">The answer to the other question only returns the first index. For all the indices, you can do <code>[index for index,value in enumerate(c) if value == target]</code>. Note that this will return a list, even if there is only one such value.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Most of the answers in the duplicate are for a list, which has an <code>index</code> method.  But <code>c</code> is a numpy.  <code>np.where(c==2)[0]</code> a widely used equivalent for arrays.  <code>c==2</code> is the boolean mask, and where returns a tuple of indices where that is true.</span>
