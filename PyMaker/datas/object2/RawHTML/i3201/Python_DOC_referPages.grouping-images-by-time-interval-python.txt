<p>I have a script with taking out exif data from images, and putting it into to the list, I sort my list after and that's what i have its a list of lists, on first position its a image time in seconds and 2nd place its a image path, its my list,  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>[[32372, 'F:\rubish\VOL1\cam\G0013025.JPG'], [32373, 'F:\rubish\VOL1\cam\G0013026.JPG'], [32373, 'F:\rubish\VOL1\cam\G0013027.JPG'],.... etc etc etc</p>

<p>That a script with grouping my images made by @blhsing , with works great, but I want to start my grouping , not from first image , start grouping by given position
That a script: </p>
<pre><code>groups = []
for r in img:
    if groups and r[0] - groups[-1][-1][0] &lt;= 5:
        groups[-1].append(r)
    else:
        groups.append([r])
for g in groups:
    print(g[0][1], g[0][0], g[-1][0], g[-1][1])
</code></pre>
<p>And that what I have and , its does not work well , its taking only one image, , does no create a group , did somebody can help me please to fix it ??</p>
<pre><code>groups = []
print(iii, "iii")
#print(min_list, " my min list ")
img.sort()
cnt = 0
mili = [32372, 34880]

for n in min_list:
    #print(n, "mili")
    for i in img:
        #print(i[0])
        if n == i[0]:
            if groups and i[0] - groups[-1][-1][0] &lt;= 5:
                groups[-1].append(i)
            else:
                groups.append([i])
    for ii in groups:
        print(ii[0][1], ii[0][0], ii[-1][0], ii[-1][1])
</code></pre>
<p>Over here I have my min_list with 2 position means I want to create only 2 groups , and classifier only images starting from those 2 position , with interval as before 5 seconds.   </p>

<p>Since your <code>img</code> list is sorted by time already, you can iterate through the records and append them to the last sub-list of the output list (named <code>groups</code> in my example code) if the time difference to the last entry is no more than 5 seconds; otherwise put the record into a new sub-list of the output list. Keep in mind that in Python a subscript of <code>-1</code> means the last item in a list.</p>

for r in img:
    if groups and r[0] - groups[-1][-1][0] &lt;= 5:

        groups.append([r])

    print(g[0][1], g[0][0], g[-1][0], g[-1][1])

<p>Sure! I just actually wrote this same algorithm the other day, but for JavaScript. Easy to port to Python...</p>

<p>Basically the <code>predicate</code> is a function that should return <code>True</code> if <code>b</code> belongs in the same group as <code>a</code>; for your use case, we look at the (absolute) difference of the first items in the tuples/lists, which is the timestamp.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Please, provide your desired output to see clearly what do you want.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Can You explain me whats thats mine all [0], [-1], groups[-1][-1][0],g[0][1] etc please, working great thank You a lot :-), and @AKX thank You too :-)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">And we can take only image name from the path ??</span>
<span class="comment-copy">why if groupes and r etc ???...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html#os.path.basename" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>os.path.basename</code></a> to obtain the image name from the path. I'll add comments to my answer to explain the logic in a moment.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank You for explication @blhsing</span>
