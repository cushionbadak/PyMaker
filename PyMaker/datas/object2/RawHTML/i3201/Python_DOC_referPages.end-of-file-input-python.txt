<p>I am trying to solve Kattis problem. The full problem is found in the link: <a href="https://open.kattis.com/problems/addingwords" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://open.kattis.com/problems/addingwords</a></p>
<p>The part of the problem that I'm confused with is : "Input is a sequence of up to 2000 commands, one per line, ending at end of file."</p>
<p>What would be the code for this input? I tried doing this: </p>
<pre><code>import sys

for line in sys.stdin.readlines():
    #print('something')
</code></pre>
<p>After this, I continued the program as normal within the indentation from above. My question is, how would I test whether the program is working in cmd? I want to test a few cases, but when I input something, the command prompt keeps waiting for other results instead of printing anything out. And when I press control C the program ends abruptly. How are we supposed to check whether the program is working while taking in user input till end of file? </p>

<p>The problem here is that <code>readlines()</code> is eager not lazy. That means it will read the entire file into memory (until EOF) and then split it into lines and return a list of those lines. So when working with interactive stdin, <code>sys.stdin.readline()</code> will wait until the end of stdin (Ctrl-D on linux/macOS, Ctrl+Z on windows).</p>
<p>But there is no need for <code>readlines()</code> (and in fact, <a href="https://stupidpythonideas.blogspot.com/2013/06/readlines-considered-silly.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">you almost should never use it</a>). Iterating over a file object by default does so by lines:</p>
<pre><code>for line in sys.stdin:
    print('got line!')
</code></pre>
<p>The docs even <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.IOBase.readlines" rel="nofollow noreferrer">admit that you should do this</a>. If you do need all lines in a list, then just do <code>list(sys.stdin)</code>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">so after writing a few input commands in cmd and pressing Ctrl-D, the output should be displayed?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes if you use <code>readlines()</code> (or <code>list(sys.stdin)</code>). But don't do that!</span>
