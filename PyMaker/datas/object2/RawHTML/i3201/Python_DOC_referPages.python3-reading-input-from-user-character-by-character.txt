<p>I'm trying to build a small Python program that reads the input from the user, but does not wait for the new line character.</p>
<h3>working with Python 3.7</h3>
<p>My requirements are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Easy to run (No need for Sudo)</p></li>
<li><p>Can take every keyboard input (Including Fn or any available button)</p></li>
<li><p>Can work on OSX, Windows and Linux</p></li>
<li><p>Every keyboard input is received immediately</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I took a look at several options, but every one of them had at least one requirement it did not fulfill:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html</a> - Needs line ending.</li>
<li><a href="https://pythonhosted.org/pynput/keyboard.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://pythonhosted.org/pynput/keyboard.html</a> - Needs Sudo.</li>
<li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12183472/how-to-read-keyboard-input-one-char-at-a-time-with-a-timer-with-python">How to Read Keyboard Input One Char at a time with a timer with Python</a> - Not working, I think it is due to the Python version I'm using.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any suggestion would be highly appreciated </p>

<p>for command line arguments maybe module argparse (e.g. you can control command line arguments for your scripts):

<p>and for key events maybe pynput will be useful for you (problably without sudo (except MacOS)):
<a href="https://pypi.org/project/pynput/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://pypi.org/project/pynput/</a>
or use TkInter or PyGames</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Are you looking for "a small Python program" just to read one keypress, or for a library/module, or for code? The first is overkill, the second is off-topic for this site, and the third seems unlikely to be do-able in relatively few lines given all your requirements (especially working in three different operating systems). Also, do you want the kepresses in a buffer or just a note if the key is currently pressed? Do you want key releases to be noted?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@RoryDaulton - Option 3 is what I aim at.I don't mind writing a lot of code for this.  I would like to get it without a buffer, every key press.  And as a start, lets say I don't care about key releases, only key press (Which ever option that makes it easier)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I need to get the input while the program is running, I don't have it as an input when starting it. How would argparse solve this?  I've looked at pynput, but due to the sudo on MacOS, it won't work for me</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I think TkInter might be a good solution for me. Lets me try it later toady. Will update later today</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It seems like TkInter might work. Thanks!</span>
