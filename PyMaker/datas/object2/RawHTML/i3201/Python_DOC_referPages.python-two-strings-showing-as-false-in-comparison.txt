<p>I have two characters: <code>⼔</code> and <code>匕</code>, which from now on I'll define as <code>char1</code> and <code>char2</code> from now on. In the python console, when I run <code>char1 == char2</code>, I get <code>False</code> as a result. When I run <code>char1 is char2</code>, I still get <code>False</code> as a result.</p>
<p>I tried to find the encoding with it, because I think it might be returning <code>False</code> because the encoding is different, but when I do <code>char1.encode("utf-8") == char2.encode("utf-8")</code> and same with the <code>is</code> command, it returns <code>False</code>.</p>
<p>How do I get it to recognize that these are the same characters?</p>

<p>⼔ and 匕 aren't the same character </p>
<ul>
<li><p>⼔ is a radical for spoon <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E2%BC%94" rel="nofollow noreferrer">(see wiki)</a>. Here you have <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Index:Chinese_radical/%E5%8C%95" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the chinese word using 匕 radical</a></p></li>
<li><p>匕 is a kanji <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%8C%95" rel="nofollow noreferrer">(see wiki)</a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>That's why there are different</p>

<span class="comment-copy">They're not the same character. One is a <code>KANGXI RADICAL SPOON</code>, the other is a <code>CJK UNIFIED IDEOGRAPH-5315</code>. You can see for yourself with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unicodedata.html#unicodedata.name" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>unicodedata.name</code></a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Certain characters have very similar or identical appearances but are encoded differently. There is a Latin, Cyrillic, and Greek versions of A - all three are encoded differently.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You haven't adequately explained how your code works. Also, for "chapter 2.3" is it in the python documentary or is it about the unicode chapter 2.3 which is about compatibility. I have temporarily deleted my post to address your criticism - I will edit it soon.</span>
