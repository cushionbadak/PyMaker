<p>I am just beginning with python and I'm trying to place a file inside a directory. The directory has a name with a number behind it that changes depending on the creation date. The function I'm using for placing the file takes only the directory + the file as an argument. So an argument for the function could be: <code>C:\Program Files\example241\file.txt</code>,  <code>C:\Program Files\example948\file.txt</code> etc. How would I place the file in that folder no mather what number it has? Could I use a wildcard?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>you can use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/glob.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>glob</code></a> module </p>
<pre><code>from glob import glob
# this gives all the folders that answer to this pattern 
folders = glob(r'C:\Program Files\example*')  
folder = folders[0]  # pick the first one
</code></pre>
<p>append the desired file name with the os module</p>
<pre><code>import os
file_name = 'file.txt'
file_path = os.path.join(folder, file_name)
</code></pre>
<p>and then save the file to <code>file_path</code> </p>

<span class="comment-copy">The question is not clear. Do you want to move a file from a particular directory to the directory corresponding to today's date?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">do you know the number or is there only one <code>exampleN</code> directory?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm sorry I was not clear. I am basically trying to place a file in whatever directory exists on that persons pc that begins with a certain word. So if the directory example827 exists, place the file in there and do the same if the folders name ends with 382 or 230 or 132 etc.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You can use <code>os</code> to get a list of all files in your current directory, and then you can search the list to find where you want to move/copy the file. When you have a list of the directories where you want to place the files, you can easily copy the source file to the destination(s) using <code>shutil.copyfile()</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">In order to extract the names of the directories, you can simply iterate over the list of all files, you get from <code>os.listdir()</code>, and then search for the keyword, which in your case is - example.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks! This works perfectly.</span>
