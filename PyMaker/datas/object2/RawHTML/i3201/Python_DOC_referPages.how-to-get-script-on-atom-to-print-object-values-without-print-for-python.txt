<p>I'm getting acquainted with Atom and its script package so I can run commands off the go. Right now I'm trying to run this code:</p>
<pre><code>data = ['ACME', 50, 91.1, (2012, 12, 21)]
name, shares, price, date = data
print(name)
</code></pre>
<p>However, the book can get the value of name to print just by typing:</p>
<pre><code>name
</code></pre>
<p>I would like to be able to do this, because when I run the book's code, script runs the code with no output. Also, is there a way to get script to run each single line I'm currently on when pressing Ctrl+Shift+B (like Ctrl+Enter in R Studio?)</p>

<p>Your book is probably running Python in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/interpreter.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">interactive mode</a>, you can access it by typing <code>python -i</code> or just <code>python</code> in your terminal. </p>
<p>The reason typing <code>name</code> works in interactive mode is because in that environment, the Interpreter prints the <code>repr</code> of each line, nothing if it returned <code>None</code>. </p>
<p>If you already wrote your code into a file, you can still run it using interactive mode by running the following:</p>
<pre><code>python -i &lt; file.py
</code></pre>
<hr/>
<p>When you actually want to see the data, you should use <code>print()</code> as it outputs the <code>str</code> of the value and Python files are not automatically ran in interactive mode.</p>
<p><sub>I don't use Atom so I can't suggest an "Atomic" solution.</sub></p>

<span class="comment-copy">change it to tuple. <code>data = ('ACME', 50, 91.1, (2012, 12, 21))</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">I decided to use a terminal package with atom, and it works real nicely. Thanks!</span>
