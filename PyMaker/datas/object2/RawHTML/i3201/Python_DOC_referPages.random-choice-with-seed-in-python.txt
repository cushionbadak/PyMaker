<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have two lists a and b with same length as below</p>
<pre><code>a = [1,2,3,4,5]
b = [11,22,33,44,55]
</code></pre>
<p>How can i choose elements in a using random.choices such that exact corresponding items in b are also picked. </p>
<p>Both a and b will always be of same length. and both the elements of a and b are related based on index. so, in short, what i am trying to do is randomly select an element in a and then be able to pick the corresponding  element in b. One thing is that the elements might be repeated. </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The better option would be to put your lists into one list:</p>
<pre><code>a_b = list(zip(a, b))
</code></pre>
<p>then pick from that with <code>random.choice()</code>.</p>
<p>Failing that, use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.randrange" rel="noreferrer"><code>random.randrange()</code></a> to pick an index at random:</p>
<pre><code>ridx = random.randrange(len(a))
aval, bval = a[ridx], b[ridx]
</code></pre>
<p>The implementation for <code>random.choice()</code> uses the exact same codepath to pick a random index as what <code>randrange()</code> with a single argument uses to determine a random integer within the range.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You can't put the elements into <i>one</i> list with tuples or 2-element lists?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">i can, but the problem is the number of elements in a and b are in millions</span>
<span class="comment-copy">is there a better way to do this?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sounds like you should really be using a different storage altogether. Like a numpy array perhaps.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If <code>A</code> is a multidimensional numpy array and numpy is imported as <code>np</code>, then <code>A[np.random.randint(A.shape[0])]</code>  gives you a random row in that array.</span>
