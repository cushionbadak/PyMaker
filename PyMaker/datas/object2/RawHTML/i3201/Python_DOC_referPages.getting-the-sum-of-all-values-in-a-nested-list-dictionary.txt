<p>I would like to get the value sum of the total deposit made in all the 3 months. However I was returned with this error: </p>
<pre><code>TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'list'
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The more intuitive way would be to do a nested sum:</p>
<pre><code>sum(sum(x) for x in Banking_Deposits.values())
</code></pre>
<p>You can also use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#sum" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>sum</code>'s</a> <code>start</code> parameter to join the lists first:</p>
<pre><code>sum(sum(Banking_Deposits.values(), []))
</code></pre>
<p>The default value for <code>start</code> is 0, which is why you get the error: <code>0 + [...]</code> does not compute. Not to mention that your original sum would yield a very long list instead of a number, since that's what you get from adding lists together.</p>
<p>A better way to chain the lists would be using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.chain.from_iterable" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>itertools.chain.from_iterable</code></a>, which wouldn't allocate multiple lists as byproducts:</p>
<pre><code>sum(chain.from_iterable(Banking_Deposits.values()))
</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/51345317/2988730">@Primusa's answer</a> suggests an equivalent and more intuitive method for flattening the values that I highly recommend.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>At the moment <code>sum()</code> isn't looping through each deposit in the dictionary, it's looping through each list inside of <code>Banking_Deposits.values()</code>. Since the initializer for sum is 0, which is an int, you're getting the error when sum tries to add each list to 0. A solution would be to flatten the lists first before taking the sum:</p>
<p><code>sum(val for value in Banking_Deposits.values() for val in value)</code></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Just iterate through the dictionary, get their values by assigning the key, and sum it. Like this:</p>
<pre><code>Banking_Deposits = {'January':[15000,9800,10100],  'Feburary':[2500,1400,14100], 'March': [20000,78366]}
store_1 = []
for x in Banking_Deposits:
    store_1.append(sum(Banking_Deposits[x]))
print(sum(store_1))
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">noted and edited :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You aren't summing the total and your loop does an unnecessary lookup since you can iterate over the values instead of the keys.</span>
