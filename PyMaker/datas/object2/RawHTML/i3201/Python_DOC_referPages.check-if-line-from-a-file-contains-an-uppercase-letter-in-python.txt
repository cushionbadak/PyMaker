<p>I am reading a file line by line and let's say I don't care about anything except "if" this line of the file contains an upper case letter. Because if it does I want to use it. I don't want to use the this line of the file if it does not.</p>
<p>Could I use just an if statement for this? or do I have to use a for loop. I already have two nested statements.</p>
<p>My code:</p>
<pre><code>with open(var) as config_file: #open file
for line in config_file: #line by line reading of file
    #if "description" and capital letter is contain in line:
        line = line.replace('\n' , '').replace('"' , '').replace(']' , '') #removes all extra characters
        i = "| except " + (line.split("description ", 1)[1]) + " " #split the line and save last index (cust name)
        cus_str+=i #append to string
config_file.close()
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Yes.  The built-in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#any" rel="noreferrer"><code>any</code></a> function makes this simple:</p>
<pre><code>with open(filename) as f:
    for line in f:
        if any(letter.isupper() for letter in line):
            print(line)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>A regular expression is probably overkill for this, but it's extremely simple:</p>
<pre><code>import re
if re.search('[A-Z]', line):
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>with open(var) as config_file :
    data = [i.strip() for i in config_file.readlines() if any(j != j.lower() for j in i)]
</code></pre>
<p><code>data</code> will contain only strings with uppercase characters.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">can u share a sample from your file ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">To add on to Patrick's answer, you could also have used <code>if any(letter in string.ascii_uppercase for letter in line):</code>, assuming the <code>string</code> module has been imported and you're more comfortable with that.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you so much! follow up question because I have some strange cases. After the substring "description_" of the line, if the next <i>letter</i> found after that is uppercase...print this line. How would I do that?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That's probably easiest to express as a regular expression <code>re.search(r"description_[A-Z]", line)</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">This does not do what OP asked. They want to know which lines contain an uppercase, not remove them.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@JoshJ thanks for the correction, missed that part, fixed now.</span>
