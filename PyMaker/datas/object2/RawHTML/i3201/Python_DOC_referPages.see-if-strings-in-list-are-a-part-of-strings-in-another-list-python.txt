<p>I'm trying to find out if a list of strings are also part of strings in another list.</p>
<p>I've found this so far but I'm not able to get what I actually want.</p>
<pre><code>a = ["car", "book","chair"]
b = ["car", "oldbook", "bluechair"]
c = [elem for elem in a if elem in b]
print(c)
</code></pre>
<p>this will print ['car'].</p>
<p>I would like to have a way to print 'book' and 'chair' as well because 'book' is a part of 'oldbook' and 'chair' of 'bluechair'.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>You can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#any" rel="noreferrer"><code>any()</code></a> here:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = ["car", "book","chair"]
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = ["car", "oldbook", "bluechair"]
&gt;&gt;&gt; [elem for elem in a if any(elem in x for x in b)]
['car', 'book', 'chair']
</code></pre>
<p>This works since it keeps strings in <code>a</code> that exist in any string in <code>b</code>. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">This works great. Thanks!</span>
