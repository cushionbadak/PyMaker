<p>The documentation for the Python <code>os</code> module provides a set of exit statuses available on Unix. </p>
<p>macOS is Unix.</p>
<p>However, <code>os.EX_NOTFOUND</code> returns</p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;input&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'EX_NOTFOUND'
</code></pre>
<p>What's going on here? More specifically, what should be the value of this constant? My guess is that it should be <code>79</code> but I don't know.</p>

<p>At the top of the exit codes section, right above <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.EX_OK" rel="nofollow noreferrer">os.EX_OK</a> it says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some of these may not be available on all Unix platforms, since there
  is some variation. These constants are defined where they are defined
  by the underlying platform.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the MacOS platform does not implement it. Neither does Linux as it seems. I found it on a Solaris and there it has the expected value of 79</p>
