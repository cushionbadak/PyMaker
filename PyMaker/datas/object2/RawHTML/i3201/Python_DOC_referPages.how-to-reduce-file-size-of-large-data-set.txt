<p>I am new to python and working on a matrix of dimension 20000x20000. Now I need to store elements of matrix in a file in form of set {i,j,value}, with one set per line. I tried "file.write" function to store all elements into a text file by converting each set to a string but by doing this file size is becoming around 6GB. 
I want to know is there any way to reduce file size or size of the set so that overall size can be reduced?</p>

<p>You can try compressing the file. Example of <code>gzip</code> compression from <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/gzip.html#examples-of-usage" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the docs</a></p>
<pre><code>import gzip
content = b"Lots of content here"
with gzip.open('/home/joe/file.txt.gz', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(content)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">What are the types of <code>i</code>, <code>j</code>, and <code>value</code>? Integers, strings, ...?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">"i" and "j" are the index values of the matrix thus are integers and "value" is of double type.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If one special value is expected to be very frequent in the matrix, you can omit it from the file. For example, if many cells are 0., this will give you a sparse matrix representation. And if the matrix is not sparse, you can omit the <code>i</code> and <code>j</code> index from each line and deduce them from the line number. Posted as a comment because I don't know whether this really addresses your problem...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Isn't there any other way except compression like using different data structure or different file type?</span>
