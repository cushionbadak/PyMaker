<p>I am working on this code and I cannot get the "removeLetter" to delete the letter the user chooses from the "chosen" list. I figured out I can't use list functions with strings, but I don't know how to go about making the 
start.remove() code to work without converting the user's string input to match the item he/she would like to be removed from the "chosen" list. Can someone help me please?</p>
<pre><code>import random

oneList = "a ", "b ", "c "
twoList = "d ", "e ", "f "
threeList = "g ", "h ", "i "
fourList = "j ", "k ", "l "

# Selects a letter at random from each list
oneRandom = random.choice(oneList)
twoRandom = random.choice(twoList)
threeRandom = random.choice(threeList)
fourRandom = random.choice(fourList)

# Displays chosen letter from each list
print("These are your letters.")
chosen = oneRandom + twoRandom + threeRandom + fourRandom
print(chosen)

# First user input
start  = input("Would you like to remove a letter? y or n? ")

# If start = yes then do this.
if start == 'y':
    removeLetter = input("What letter would you like to remove? ")

    # Removes user's chosen letter.
    keptLetters = chosen.remove(removeLetter)

    # Displays kept letters.
    print(keptLetters)

<p>You have a few issues in your code. I took the liberty to make it more pythonic for you.</p>

<li>Having multiple lists, and repeating your code is not very pythonic. So I've made the "lists" as a tuple of tuples (since you may not plan on modifying this). If so, then change to lists by denoting them with square brackets <code>[]</code> instead of parentheses <code>()</code>.</li>
<li>Since you're performing the same operation on multiple lists, you can use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#map" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>map()</code></a> function to get the results from all of them into a list.</li>
<li><code>chosen</code> should remain a list, instead of a string, since you'll be manipulating it in the future by removing a letter.</li>
<li>You can easily <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.join" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>join()</code></a> all the items in a list together as a string separated by a single space <code>" "</code>.</li>
<li>Since <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.1/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>list.remove()</code></a> can send back a <code>ValueError</code> if the value isn't in the list, you'll want to handle that in a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.3/tutorial/errors.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>try..except</code></a> block.</li>
<li>Can surround your logic with a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#while" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>while</code></a> loop to keep asking for a letter to remove if the previous attempts failed.</li>
<li><code>chosen.remove</code> changes the original array, so you don't need to save it into <code>keptLetters</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>I hope this helps you out!</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Added equivalent Python 2 code</p>

<p>You have an error in your code specifically in this line:</p>
<pre><code>keptLetters = start.remove (removeLetter)
</code></pre>
<p>You are calling the variable <code>start</code> but the variable <code>chosen</code> is the one with the list of letters. So this should work:</p>
<pre><code>keptLetters = chosen.remove (removeLetter)

<span class="comment-copy">You might be getting tripped up because <code>oneList</code> through <code>fourList</code> aren't lists, they're tuples. Importantly, lists can be mutated (for example, items can be removed from them), and tuples can't.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">lists are surrounded by <code>[]</code>, try running <code>type()</code> and you will see what @Kevin is saying</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Also, instead of doing <code>start.remove</code>, you probably want to slice out from <code>chosen</code> instead.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I appreciate this and think I understand what you are saying. However, I get this error with your code. Traceback (most recent call last):   File "G:\lettersTwo.py", line 25, in &lt;module&gt;     removeLetter = input("What letter would you like to remove?")   File "&lt;string&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt; NameError: name 'b' is not defined</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Are you <i>sure</i> you copied the code correctly? I assume you're running Python 3. I made a <a href="https://repl.it/repls/BiodegradableSpryConference" rel="nofollow noreferrer">repl</a> for this.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Alright, I am sorry. I was actually running Python 2. I don't know why I still have it. I do have 3 installed though. Your program worked thank you!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@NickAndrulewicz, I updated my answer for Python 2. <code>map</code> result is a bit different, and <code>input</code> does as well. You can see in this <a href="https://repl.it/repls/WorseScholarlyIntercept" rel="nofollow noreferrer">repl</a>. Please accept the answer if you feel like it has helped!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">There's more issues than that. Especially since <code>chosen</code> is a string.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Anderson Although that was a valid error you pointed out along with, I am still having trouble. I should've realized that I am also using tuples like others have said .Do you have any other suggestions?</span>
