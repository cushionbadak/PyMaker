<p>How can i debug my python code step by step if i want to by placing the <code>red dots</code> from terminal as i used to do that on <code>PyCharm</code> but having difficulties with the debug when i run my file from the python terminal using the command </p>
<p><code>python testings.py --annotations=input.csv</code></p>

<p>You can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Pdb</a> for debugging using the command line.</p>
<p>It has a argument <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html#pdbcommand-break" rel="nofollow noreferrer">b(reak)</a> that allows you to specify a line number where you want to have a break point.</p>
<p>It's definitely more cumbersome than using a proper IDE, but certainly helps in certain situations.  </p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p>Simple example script (example.py):</p>
<pre><code>a = 2
b = 5

c = a + b

print("{0} + {1} = {2}".format(a, b, c))
</code></pre>
<p>Starting debugger:</p>
<pre><code>python3 -m pdb example.py
</code></pre>
<p>Now the debugger will start and will point to the first line. We can then use the commands (see documentation linked above) to step through the code. An example:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; /home/[...]/example.py(1)&lt;module&gt;()
-&gt; a = 2
(Pdb) b 4
Breakpoint 1 at /home/[...]/example.py:4
(Pdb) c
&gt; /home/[...]/example.py(4)&lt;module&gt;()
-&gt; c = a + b
(Pdb) s
&gt; /home/[...]/example.py(6)&lt;module&gt;()
-&gt; print("{0} + {1} = {2}".format(a, b, c))
(Pdb) p c
7
(Pdb) 
</code></pre>
<p>Explanation: Every line with <code>(Pdb)</code> is a prompt where you can enter commands. Here are the commands I entered:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>b 4</code> sets a breakpoint at line 4. This is confirmed by the next line.</li>
<li><code>c</code> continues running the script until the next breakpoint is hit. As you can see in the next line, the debugger now stops at <code>c = a + b</code> which is line 4 of the script.</li>
<li><code>s</code> performs one step, so we are now at the print statement.</li>
<li><code>p c</code> prints the value of expression "c" which in this case is simply the value of the variable <code>c</code>: 7</li>
</ol>
<p>For more commands and their explanations, again, take  look at the official documentation. Hope this serves as a very basic introduction on how to use Pdb.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I saw that and it didn't solve the issue.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">interesting can you add a small example of how to specify lines</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I edited my answer, see above. I hope that helps.</span>
