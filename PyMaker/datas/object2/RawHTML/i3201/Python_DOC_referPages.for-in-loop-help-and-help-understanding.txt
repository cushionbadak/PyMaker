<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I'm currently following a tutorial that uses BeautifulSoup to extract information from an HTML page, and while I was following, I realized I didn't understand a step. The code is:</p>
<pre><code>period_tags = seven_day.select(".tombstone-container .period-name")
periods = [pt.get_text() for pt in period_tags]
periods
</code></pre>
<p>I'm confused by the second line. I understand brackets are used for lists, but I don't understand where the "pt" came from, and I'm also fairly unfamiliar with the "for" and "in". </p>
<p>Could someone help me understand? Hopefully I provided enough context.</p>

<p>It's called a <em>list comprehension</em>. See <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions</a></p>
<p>It's like an inverted for-loop, which allows you to create lists from an iterable (and, optionally, a condition). Quoting the documentation example, if you want to create a list of squares of numbers &lt; 10, the standard way to do it, would be</p>
<pre><code>squares = []
for x in range(10):
    squares.append(x**2)
</code></pre>
<p>But the list comprehension syntax allows you to write</p>
<pre><code>squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]
</code></pre>
<p>or, just the even numbers</p>
<pre><code>squares = [x**2 for x in range(10) if x%2==0]
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">@hntrandrew You should probably spend some time working through the official Python tutorial that blue_note linked. It will make it easier for you to understand the BeautifulSoup tutorial.

<span class="comment-copy">@hntrandrew: thanks, please accept answer if that helped</span>
