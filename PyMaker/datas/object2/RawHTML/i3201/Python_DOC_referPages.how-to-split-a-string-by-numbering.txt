<p>I wish to split the following corpus into its parts:</p>

<p>I wrote this, but doesn't work:</p>
<pre><code>for i in [int(s) for s in corpus.split() if s.isdigit()]:

print(answer)

<p>What can I do?</p>

<p>You tagged <a class="post-tag" href="/questions/tagged/regex" rel="tag" title="show questions tagged 'regex'">regex</a> but provided a non-regex solution. This is a non-regex correct solution for your OP.</p>
<p>Splitting on spaces is ok, then accumulate text parts into a temporary variable until you encounter the next number, then add the temporary to your overall result. </p>
<p>Using list to store temporarty (parts) is more efficient that appending to a string because of immutability. </p>
<p>Skip storing the numbers itself:</p>
<pre><code>corpus = '1  Write short notes on the anatomy of the Circle of Willis including normal variants.     2  Write short notes on the anatomy of the radiological spaces of the orbit excluding the eyeball.      3  Write short notes on the anatomy of the axis (C2 vertebra).      4  Write short notes on the anatomy of the corpus callosum.      5  Write short notes on the anatomy of the posterior division of the internal iliac artery  6  Write short notes on the anal canal including sphincters.'               

allparts = []  # total result
part = []      # parts that belong to one number
for p in corpus.split():
    if p.isdigit():      # if a number
        if part:             # if stored something
            allparts.append(' '.join(part))   # add it to result
            part=[]
        continue         # skip storing the number  

    part.append(p)      # add to part

if part:   # add rest
    allparts.append(' '.join(part))

print(allparts)

<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>['Write short notes on the anatomy of the Circle of Willis including normal variants.', 
 'Write short notes on the anatomy of the radiological spaces of the orbit excluding the eyeball.', 
 'Write short notes on the anatomy of the axis (C2 vertebra).',

<p>Using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.split" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>re.split</code></a> and list comprehension, using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>str.strip</code></a> to remove eventual spaces:</p>
<pre><code>import re
result = [
    phrase for phrase in map(str.strip, re.split('\d+\s\s', corpus)) if phrase

<p><strong>Result:</strong></p>

<p>Try using re.split() with Regular Expression + strip()</p>
<pre><code>a = "1  hello.  2  my name is. 3  maat."

answer = [s.strip(" ") for s in filter(None, re.split(" *\d+ ", a))]

print(answer) #['hello.', 'my name is.', 'maat.']
</code></pre>
<p>re.split() is pretty much split() but it contains demilitmer as well
/ strip(" ") removes space from s</p>

<span class="comment-copy">"It doesn't work" may be a correct description, but <i>how</i> does it not work?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If I knew that - I wouldn't be asking you...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">But you <i>do</i> know what happens when you run it. Does it give an error? Does it print out garbage? Does your computer shut down?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">DV - no comment. How to know what I should improve upon? Solution works, so that can not be it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hello: the cyclomatic complexity (<a href="https://imgur.com/a/ectVIQJ" rel="nofollow noreferrer">5</a> following <a href="http://www.lizard.ws/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">lizard</a> metrix) of your code is quite higher than necessary and, in general, your code is far from pythonic.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@LucaCappelletti - thanks for the feedback. Mine is a working solution, it is easy understandable and it solves the problem at hand. A oneliner using regex will produce the wanted output - I am in doubt it will give much opportunity to learn something though. If some metric tells me mine is more complex then nessessary I have to disagree.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It is good custom to explain downvotes, so that the answer may be bettered.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">4 upvotes and 4 downvotes, no comment as to why.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Your answer does not cover when the digits have values greater than 9 and returns also empty strings since it execute strip last, after having run the filter.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you for your opinion but I didn't understand the last part of your comment. Could you explain it to me if you don't mind?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Additionaly, your method splits in the user example at <code>(C2 vertebra).</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">You still accept only values under 10.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I have edited. Thank you for your delicate feedback!</span>
