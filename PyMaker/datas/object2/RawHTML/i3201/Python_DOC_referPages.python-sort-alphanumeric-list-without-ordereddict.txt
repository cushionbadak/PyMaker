<p>I've read many similar questions, but none of the solutions match the requirements I need which is, using Python 2.6.6 and without installing or using OrderedDict, how can I get my list to sort based on the first numbers in each item?</p>
<p>This is my list:</p>
<pre><code>apples = [ '15 The Green Apples ',
           '43 The Blue Apples ',
           '2 The Yellow Apples ',
           '7 The Red Apples ',
           '178 The Purple Apples '
         ]
</code></pre>
<p>apples.sort() gives me:</p>
<pre><code>[ '15 The Green Apples ',
  '178 The Purple Apples ',
  '2 The Yellow Apples ',
  '43 The Blue Apples ',
  '7 The Red Apples '
]
</code></pre>
<p>What I'd want is:</p>
<pre><code>[ '2 The Yellow Apples ',
  '7 The Red Apples ',
  '15 The Green Apples ',
  '43 The Blue Apples ',
  '178 The Purple Apples '
]
</code></pre>
<p>I tried converting the list to a dictionary and giving the first numbers 15; 43; 2; 7; 178; but that didn't work. I understand why it's sorting that way, as it's a string, but I can't convert it into an int.</p>
<p>I was thinking maybe using regex, but didn't get very far.</p>
<p>This grabs everything after the first space in the numbers:</p>
<pre><code>[^0-9]
</code></pre>
<p>This grabs only the beginning numbers:</p>
<pre><code>[.0-9]
</code></pre>
<p>A solution I think would work, but I don't know how to do this, is to match using regex just the numbers and cast that as an int, and sort that way.</p>
<p>EDIT: Possible duplicate question has different acceptable solution, different format, but similar question.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You have to specify a custom function as sort key, which would extract the initial numbers from each string</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; apples.sort(key=lambda x: int(x.split()[0]))
&gt;&gt;&gt; apples
['2 The Yellow Apples ', '7 The Red Apples ', '15 The Green Apples ', '43 The Blue Apples ', '178 The Purple Apples ']
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
</code></pre>
<p>Or using regex</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import re
&gt;&gt;&gt; apples.sort(key=lambda x: int(re.findall('\d+', x)[0]))
&gt;&gt;&gt; apples
['2 The Yellow Apples ', '7 The Red Apples ', '15 The Green Apples ', '43 The Blue Apples ', '178 The Purple Apples ']
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">to match just the numbers use <code>\d+</code>. Casting as an int in python is as simple as <code>int(something)</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>sorted(apples, key=lambda x: int(x.split()[0]))</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">This was exactly what I was looking for, thank you... now out of curiosity, how can I change the sorting from ascending to descending?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You would pass the additional keyword argument <code>reverse=True</code>.  See the documentation for the <code>list.sort</code> method here: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Perfect, thanks!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Another way would be to simply negate the value: <code>key=lambda x: -int(x.split()[0])</code>.</span>
