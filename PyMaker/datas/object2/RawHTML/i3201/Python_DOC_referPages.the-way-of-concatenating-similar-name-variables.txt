<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Using python, I want to make the following 'tests' list.
'tests = [1,2,3]' that I want to get <br/>
I know the bellow works, 
<code>tests = [test1, test2, test3]</code></p>
<p>How can I make tests easily, using for loop? 
I wrote like bellow, but it results in 'tests = [test1, test2, test3]'</p>
<pre><code>test1 = [1]
test2 = [2]
test3 = [3]
tests = []
for i in raange(3):
    test.append('test'+str(i))
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This might be what you're looking for:</p>
<pre><code>tests = [eval("test%d" % (i+1)) for i in range(3)]
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>[[1], [2], [3]]
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>test1 = [1]
test2 = [2]
test3 = [3]
tests = []
for i in range(3):
    tests.append("test"+str(i))
</code></pre>
<p>will work</p>
</div>

<span class="comment-copy">@Ell Thanks I know that, but I wanted to know the different way</span>
<span class="comment-copy">don't use eval!!!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">what's the alternative? :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">OP should not use variables like <code>test1</code>, <code>test2</code> ... in the first place, but list of lists... otherwise you can look the variables up in <code>locals()</code> or <code>globals()</code> dict</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This appends strings, not lists, to tests.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, but in question there is nothing about content of tests list. Author didn't say that this must be list of list, or list of elements, that came from test1, test2 and test3</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@darvark Sorry, my question is not appropriate. I changed the question. It was my first time to post a question. From now, I will be careful when posting.</span>
