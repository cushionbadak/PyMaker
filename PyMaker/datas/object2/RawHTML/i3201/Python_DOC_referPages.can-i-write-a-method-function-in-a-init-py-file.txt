<p>Can I write a method/function in a <code>__init__.py</code> file? as demonstrated below</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>In <code>__init__.py</code> file</p>
<pre><code>import subprocess
import config


def ssh_exe(cmd):
    try:
        ssh_cmd = "ssh root@{0} {1}".format(config.ip, cmd)
        out = subprocess.check_output(ssh_cmd)
        return out
    except Exception as e:
        return str(e)

<p>sure, they are normal files. Only difference is that they define that the folder is a package.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#packages" rel="nofollow noreferrer">python official basic tutorial</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <code>__init__.py</code> files are required to make Python treat the directories as containing packages; this is done to prevent directories with a common name, such as string, from unintentionally hiding valid modules that occur later on the module search path. In the simplest case, <code>__init__.py</code> <strong>can just be an empty file</strong>, but it can also execute initialization code for the package or set the <code>__all__</code> variable, described later.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that you usually don't put your code in <code>__init__.py</code> but instead define it in the packages' modules and import only the names you want to expose in the package namespace.</p>
<p>Here's an example on how to access then, suppose you have this directory structure:</p>
<pre><code>Development/
   main.py
   setup.py
   myprogram/
       __init__.py
       other.py
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>myprogram</code> folder is considered a package because of <code>__init__.py</code> so in <code>main.py</code> you can do:</p>
<pre><code>import myprogram
myprogram.something() # defined in `__init__.py`
import myprogram.other # the submodule other.py inside the package
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">@Prune Yes, I tried and it works fine without error. But how to access the method/function in another function?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for the reply. But how to access the method/function in another python file?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@HE-MAN I added information on how to access them</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks @nosklo. I got it.</span>
