<p>Considering the port number you are using I'd try with <code>SMTP_SSL</code> instead of <code>SMTP</code> and <code>starttls()</code>.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/smtplib.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/smtplib.html</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An SMTP_SSL instance behaves exactly the same as instances of SMTP.
  SMTP_SSL should be used for situations where SSL is required from the
  beginning of the connection and using starttls() is not appropriate.
  If host is not specified, the local host is used. If port is zero, the
  standard SMTP-over-SSL port (465) is used.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><code>STARTTLS</code> is a form of <em>opportunistic TLS</em>, it is supposed to be used with old protocols, that originally did't support TLS, to upgrade the connection.
The port 465 was used before the introduction of <code>STARTTLS</code> for <code>SMTPS</code>, which is now deprecated.</p>
<pre><code>import smtplib
s = smtplib.SMTP_SSL('cpanel.freehosting.com', 465)
s.login("myusername", "mypassword")
message = "Message_you_need_to_send"
s.sendmail("myemailid", "receiver_email_id", message)
s.quit()
</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively you should be able to use port 25 with your original code.</p>
<pre><code>import smtplib
s = smtplib.SMTP('cpanel.freehosting.com', 25)
s.starttls()
s.login("myusername", "mypassword")
message = "Message_you_need_to_send"
s.sendmail("myemailid", "receiver_email_id", message)
s.quit()
</code></pre>
<p>In both examples you can completely omit the port number as you are using the default ports.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Your best bet will be to check with the service provider, ie "does your SMTP server require TLS? Is 465 port the correct port?" etc. I also doubt that this is the correct server url</span>
<span class="comment-copy">There's quite a bit that goes into making a mail server work. MX Records, Reverse DNS, whitelisting, routing concerns, etc. Are you sure that <code>cpanel.freehosting.com</code> is your mail server, for instance?</span>
