<p>Are you using the module <code>threading</code>? If so, you could periodically check the status of your thread via the method <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html#threading.Thread.is_alive" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>threading.is_alive()</code></a>. </p>
<p>If your infinite thread is killed somehow, your permanently checking main thread (possibly notified by another thread initialized like <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12435211/python-threading-timer-repeat-function-every-n-seconds">this</a>) can also terminate.</p>
