<p>-This is a Python in general question.</p>
<p>I am having topology errors very often, they are very small and i would like to proceed to intersection even though they are there. Is it possible to make an exception for this particular :</p>
<p><code>TopologyException: found non-noded intersection between LINESTRING (229971 4.39944e+06, 229971 4.39944e+06) and LINESTRING (229971 4.39944e+06, 229971 4.39944e+06) at 229971.08857010119 4399438.0928708706</code> and make it complete the process anyway? I am using Python and Geopandas. </p>
<p>Also sometimes in intersection it says:</p>
<pre><code> TopologicalError: This operation could not be performed. Reason: unknown
</code></pre>
<p>is it possible for any line like this:<code>inte_s=gpd.overlay(data2,asttom,how='intersection')</code>
 that is causing this Error to create an exception and make it perform the calculation by being unfazed from the error that would show up? What code would do that in this line where the intersection is done?</p>

<p>Yes, you can skip or handle any exception in python using <code>try/except</code> blocks. In your case it would be:</p>
<pre><code>try:
    inte_s=gpd.overlay(data2,asttom,how='intersection')
except (TopologicalError, TopologyException):
    #skipping error here
    pass
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>One way you can handle errors in Python is using a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">try and except statement</a>. </p>
<p>Here is a sample piece of code that I use often when testing. You can place the operation that might fail in the try part of the block, and even if it does throw an exception, your whole script will not be broken. </p>
<pre><code>try:
    #operation that may fail
except Exception as e:
    print('something went wrong: ' + e)
    # what you want to do if the operation does fail
</code></pre>
<p>The above code is a general form for a try/except statement. If you are looking to catch a <em>specific</em> error, you're looking for something like <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13531247/python-catching-specific-exception">this</a> SO answer. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">Are you aware of <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#handling-exceptions" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>try/except</code></a>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">if you need something not specific and simply any error you should use:<code>except:     pass</code> only?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I tried what you wrote and it still produced the error with the message and everything.What is going on?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@a9e1: For handling/skipping exception of (almost) any type you can use <code>try: ... except: pass</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Probably exception is raised from some other part of code, not the one you put into try/except clause. Please try reading exception trace to find out what part of code produces an exception.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I did, it raises the TopologyException that was filtered.Maybe it raised it but was not affected by it?Maybe.</span>
