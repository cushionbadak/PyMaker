<p>My doubt is that I came across a regex which checks whether a password is strong or not. What is the impact of  <strong>^</strong> and <strong>$</strong> in this expression.</p>
<pre><code>a = compile(r'^(?=.*?[A-Z])(?=.*?[a-z])(?=.*?[0-9])(?=.*?[#?!@$%^&amp;*-]).{8,}$')
</code></pre>
<p>It has <strong>^</strong> and <strong>$</strong> signs in it. But the below code works the same as above. </p>
<pre><code>a = compile(r'(?=.*?[A-Z])(?=.*?[a-z])(?=.*?[0-9])(?=.*?[#?!@$%^&amp;*-]).{8,}')
</code></pre>
<p>If so why are they been used in the above code. Or is there reason for its usage. Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>The <code>^</code> means “beginning of a line” and the <code>$</code> means “end of a line”.
In your case, every match is a line so you don't have any problem.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>^</code> is followed by the string or pattern by which the string will be started with and <code>$</code> follows the string or pattern by which the string will be ended with. For your case your <code>regex</code> matched with the pattern of the string without regarding the starting or ending portion.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You would not ask the difference if you knew why caret and dollar sign are being used. Please check the marked question.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Is that  good to use both variants for the password checking program right?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Using these symbols is more secure because you are sure to match a single and complete line.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">By using ^ and $ we can match string with no new line characters in them ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No you cannot, the first occurence of new line is matched by <code>$</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><b>^ and $</b> ensures that there are no new line characters right?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That depends.
