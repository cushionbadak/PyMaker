<p>What is the difference between a python built-in and a normal object? we often say that in python everything is an object. 
for example, when I do this in Python 3.6:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import os, inspect
&gt;&gt;&gt; inspect.getsource(os.scandir)
TypeError: &lt;built-in function scandir&gt; is not a module, class, method, function, traceback, frame, or code object
</code></pre>
<p>I have two questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>is built-in function an object? if not is this why getsource throws TypeError?</li>
<li>why can't I find scandir in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">python3 documentation</a> as a built-in?</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can't access the source of builtins and other modules that were written using the C API, since there isn't a Python source for them.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/inspect.html#inspect.getsourcefile" rel="nofollow noreferrer">From the documentation for <strong><code>os.getsourcefile</code></strong></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Return the name of the Python source file in which an object was defined. <strong>This will fail with a TypeError if the object is a built-in module, class, or function.</strong></p>

<span class="comment-copy">you have a point, but still my two question wasn't answered. and furthering your point, where can I find the C source code for that?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The answer to your second question is that <code>scandir</code> is <i>not</i> a builtin that is always available, so of course it's not listed there.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">ok, but IMHO it would be better to list it there and provide highlighted description of availability scope. unless thatâ€˜s too much hassle for open source ofc. :D</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The link you posted refers to builtins that are <i>always</i> available in Python, without any imports required.  Adding functions that <i>do</i> require inputs would quickly muddle that list.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">and my first question, are built-ins objects? if they're not, wouldn't that violates basic principle of python?</span>
