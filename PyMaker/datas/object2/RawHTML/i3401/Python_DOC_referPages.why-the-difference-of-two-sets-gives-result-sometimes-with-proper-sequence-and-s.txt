<p>I wondered while performing some set related operation.
below is my scenario,
I have two sets 'a' and 'b', and I'm calculating the difference.</p>
<pre><code>a = {1,2,3,5}
b = {5,6,7,8}
print(b-a)
</code></pre>
<p>and I have another two set 'c' and 'd' and same, I'm calculating the difference of that two sets also.</p>
<pre><code>c = {1,2,3,4,0}
d = {6,7,8,9,5}

print(d-c)
</code></pre>
<p>The result of above two operations is like :</p>
<pre><code>{8, 6, 7}          #Expecting {6,7,8}, why this sequence changed ?
{5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
</code></pre>
<p>But here I found that the sequence of the first result is changed.
while other is in the correct sequence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A set is an <strong>unordered</strong> collection with no duplicate elements. Basic uses include membership testing and eliminating duplicate entries.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Sets are unordered.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sets are fundamentally unordered.  <code>{6,7,8}</code> is the same as <code>{8,6,7}</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">But why for the second scenario its gives correct order ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">For the second scenario, you are just lucky.</span>
