<p>I am a newbie learning python. Please take a look at the below code (From Data Structures and Algorithms in Python by Goodrich, et al).</p>
<pre><code>age = -1   # an initially invalid choice
while age &lt;= 0:
    try:
        age = int(input('Enter your age in years: '))
        if age &lt;= 0:
            print('Your age must be positive.')
    except ValueError:
        print('That is an invalid age specification.')
    except EOFError:
        print('There was an unexpected error reading input.')
        raise  # let's re-raise this exception.
</code></pre>
<p>I know what ValueError is. For example the ValueError occurs if the input is given as characters instead of an integer.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I have no idea when EOFError raises.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>I can't get what 're-raise this exception' means</p></li>
<li><p>The book says, 'the call to input will raise an EOFError if the console input fails.' Again, I have no idea what console input is and when console input fails.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>I have tried several ways of raising EOFError, but every time I tried there was only ValueError. Can someone give me some idea?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>You caught the exception, meaning Python will continue with the loop instead of letting the exception percolate up the stack, ultimately ending the program if it remains uncaught. Calling <code>raise</code> without an argument in an <code>except</code> clause simply raises the same exception again, equivalent to</p>
<pre><code>except EOFError as exc:
    print("Unexpected error")
    raise exc
</code></pre>
<p>Re-raising the exception is necessary if you don't actually <em>handle</em> the exception, instead simply adding additional logging before (possibly) someone else handles it.</p>
<p><em>Triggering</em> the <code>EOFError</code> can be done by running</p>
<pre><code>$ python -c 'input()' &lt; /dev/null
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;string&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
EOFError: EOF when reading a line
</code></pre>
<p>as all attempts to read from <code>/dev/null</code> look like an attempt to read from the end of a file.</p>

<p>From <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>input</code>'s documentation</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When <code>EOF</code> is read, <code>EOFError</code> is raised.</p>

<p><code>EOF</code> is sent when the input stream reaches the end, or if it's from the console, it means the user presses ctrl-D on *NIX, or ctrl-Z on Windows.</p>
<p>You can catch the <code>EOFError</code> exception and break your <code>while</code> loop as a way to end the program gracefully, so change your exception block to:</p>

this is a test to see where the EOF occurs... suspect is that it will be EOF line 4

<span class="comment-copy">I'm sorry but when I enter $ python -c 'input()' &lt; /dev/null as an input, it still says it is ValueError, maybe because it is a string?</span>
