<p>I have a file written in Python 2 and I want to convert the code to Python 3, while saving a file of both. How do you do this using Git Bash? </p>

<p>Sounds like you want a copy of the file for Python3. I would copy the file and rename it with the Python version as part of the name and then rename the original file to also include the version. Something like:</p>
<pre><code>cp foo.py foo36.py
mv foo.py foo27.py
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">I am not sure if I understand you correctly: You want to convert code from python 2 to 3. That usually involves replacing code parts that are incompatible with the new version. Where do you see the connection to the git bash shell?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Have you tried using <code>2to3</code>? <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/2to3.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/2to3.html</a></span>
