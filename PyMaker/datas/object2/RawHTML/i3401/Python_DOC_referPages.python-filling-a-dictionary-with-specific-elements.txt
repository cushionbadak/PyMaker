<p>I am kind of lost here and can't really find a similar question. Maybe also because I don't know how to search for it.</p>
<p>I want to import the names.csv file, which holds a bunch of names in the structure: ID, Name, Gender, Year, State, Count</p>
<p>Now I'm trying to transcribe all the names and <code>count</code> integers into a dictionary which I call <code>names</code>. I don't understand why it now continually returns me an empty dictionary.</p>
<p>Through the conditionals, I'm trying to say that IF the name is in the dictionary already, it is supposed to sum the count onto the existing count.</p>
<p>Can anyone help? Sadly I'm really a newbie and can't help myself...</p>
<pre><code>with open("../data/names.csv") as file:
names = {}

for lines in file:
    data = lines.strip().split(",")
    name = data[1]
    count = data[5]
    if name == "Name":
        continue
    for name, count in names.items():
        if name in names:
            names[name] = names[name] + count
        else:
            names[name] = count

print(names)
</code></pre>

<p>First, you should avoid parsing the CSV file yourself, it can become quite tricky when e.g. quotes are involved. There is <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">a csv module built-in</a></p>
<p>For your case, I would use <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">pandas</a>. The <code>.groupby()</code> function together with <code>.sum()</code> will do exactly what you want:</p>
<pre><code>import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('names.csv')
print(df[['Name', 'Count']].groupby('Name').sum())
</code></pre>

<p>Better to use <code>defaultdict</code> from standard python lib (<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html?highlight=defaultdict#collections.defaultdict" rel="nofollow noreferrer">for details link</a>) and for working with csv files csv module (<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.reader" rel="nofollow noreferrer">link for details</a>)</p>
<pre><code>from collections import defaultdict

food_list = 'spam spam spam spam spam spam eggs spam'.split()
food_count = defaultdict(int) # default value of int is 0
for food in food_list:
    food_count[food] += 1 # increment element's value by 1

food_count
</code></pre>
<p>in result you will have:</p>
<pre><code>defaultdict(&lt;type 'int'&gt;, {'eggs': 1, 'spam': 7})
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">What's the inner for loop supposed to do?(this one:<code>for name, count in names.items():</code>)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I am trying to define key and value of the dic..</span>
<span class="comment-copy">you have two different variables called <code>name</code>: one holds the name from the csv, the other is declared in the inner for loop. the second one is hiding the first one.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Oh okay. How can I carry the first name + count vars simply into the dictionary?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you very much for the tip! I'll look into panda!</span>
