<p>I'm new to Python. Trying to implement some code in Spyder.</p>
<p>"Python 3.6.3 |Anaconda custom (64-bit)| (default, Oct 15 2017, 03:27:45) [MSC v.1900 64 bit (AMD64)]"</p>
<p>I'm trying to implement some code from a video on Neural Nets.</p>
<pre class="lang-python prettyprint-override"><code>def nonlin(x, deriv=False):
    if(deriv=true):
        return(x*(1-x))
</code></pre>
<p>The code is returning </p>
<blockquote>
<p>SyntaxError: invalid syntax. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>My question is 2 part:</p>
<ol>
<li>What is the correct syntax?</li>
<li>Where can I go to familiarize myself with the standard format? It looks like there are multiple syntaxes that work depending on the version/type. Maybe I'm just looking in the wrong places. </li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>First learn to format the code when you are asking a question because it's incmorehensive 
the keyword "True" goest with the first letter in uppercase and second you have to go "==" instead of a single "="</p>
<pre><code>def nonlin(x, deriv=False):
    if (deriv==True):
        return (x * (1 - x))

print(nonlin(29, deriv=False))
print(nonlin(29, deriv=True))
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">I think your question is not correct because i think this is a python syntax error not a spyder syntax error.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Like Pils19 said, syntax errors (like "grammar errors") are errors in the language. It doesn't matter what word processor/editor you use (like Spyder). Also, it would really hope if you could post the code correctly formatted. See if you can figure out Stackoverflow's code formatting.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sorry for the issue with the code formatting. I can see why that would be frustrating. Any recommendation on where I can go to familiarize myself with the Python 3.6.3 syntax?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks. That did the trick. Any suggestion on where I can become more familiar with the appropriate syntax? Early days here and I want to get off of relying on the community to debug basic errors.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks! Appreciate you taking the time.</span>
