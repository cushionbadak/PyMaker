<p>Can you tell me how I should formalize my <code>.py</code> file.</p>
<p>From some sources I've found that all files should start with:</p>
<pre><code># coding : utf-8
# PEP-8
</code></pre>
<p>Some people on GitHub do this:</p>
<pre><code># -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
</code></pre>
<p>However, Google for example doesn't use either of these and start files with license information:</p>
<pre><code># Copyright (C) 2018 Google Inc.
# Licensed under http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0 &lt;see LICENSE file&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>What is the best and accepted way?</p>

<p>It depends.</p>
<p>Python 2 used ASCII as default encoding for source files.</p>
<p>Python 3's default is UTF-8.</p>
<p>So, if you intend to only support Python 3+ then you don't have to declare the utf-8 encoding as it is already the default.</p>
<p>If you intend to support Python 2 as well and you have non-ASCII string literals then you should declare an encoding.</p>
<p>If your text editor also needs a coding declaration (e.g., if your Unix locale is set to, say, Latin-1, but your code is UTF-8), Python's lenient syntax allows a single declaration to be used for bothâ€”e.g., <code># -*- coding: utf-8 -*-</code> is recognized by both emacs and Python.</p>
<p>Some official information:</p>
<p>Python 3's docs about unicode support: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/unicode.html#python-s-unicode-support" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/howto/unicode.html#python-s-unicode-support</a></p>
<p>PEP 263 that introduced the encoding declaration syntax: <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0263/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0263/</a></p>
<p>PEP 3210 about changing the default encoding from ASCII to UTF-8 starting from Python 3.0: <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3120/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3120/</a></p>

<span class="comment-copy">IIRC, the <code># PEP-8</code> declaration is an "opt-in" used by one of the super-checker tools that run a slew of format checkers, linters, etc., on your code, to specify that this file should be run through the <code>pep8</code> checker and rejected if there are any warnings. If I'm remembering right, it's probably obsolete, as (a) <code>pep8</code> is deprecated in favor of <code>pycodestyle</code>, and (b) neither of the current up-to-date super-checkers seems to use this declaration so it's probably one of the two that are no longer maintained.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It might also be worth adding links to <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0263/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PEP 263</a> and <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3120/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PEP 3120</a>, and maybe explaining the difference between the different coding declaration styles (basically, sharing the coding declaration between Python and emacs and/or vi).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, cool. How about PEP-8 line and licence?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@abarnert, thanks, added some references</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MAxShvedov I doubt you will find any PEP about that. It is up to personal preferences and organizational conventions.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@DeepSpace I got it, thank you again.</span>
