<p>I'm trying to run a python script in Windows 7 in the command prompt, however I keep receiving this error every time I try to run it.</p>
<pre><code>File "inb4404.py", line 73
  except urllib2.HTTPError, err:
                          ^
Syntax Error: invalid syntax
</code></pre>
<p>I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong. I located the directory containing the python script using 'cd' and also have Python in my PATH. Then I wrote 'python inb4404.py' and received that error. </p>
<p>Any pointers would be greatly appreciated, thank you.</p>

<p>The script you are using is written for Python 2 but you are running it using Python 3. </p>
<p>Depending on what your goals are, you have a few options. The simplest would be to run the script using Python 2. You may already have it in the <code>c:\Python27\python</code> directory or can install it. See these <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/faq/windows.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Window tips</a> for details or download it <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2715/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to get more involved, you can manually change the script over to Python 3. This would take some <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.3/howto/pyporting.html#capturing-the-currently-raised-exception" rel="nofollow noreferrer">reading up on the differences</a> such as the one you encountered with the except <code>urllib2.HTTPError, err</code> becoming <code>except urllib2.HTTPError as err</code>. The script you are running is small so it may be doable but if it relies on Python 2 only libraries it could get more complex fast. Additional tools and info for converting Python 2 to 3 is available at <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/2to3.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">2to3</a> which provides a tool that identifies issues and can even automatically fix them for you but like most automatic tools, it may not do everything you need.</p>

<p>Your syntax is wrong. See <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer" title="Python Document">https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html</a>.
If you want <code>err</code> to be the error object, it should be <code>except urllib2.HTTPError as err:</code></p>
