<p>I'm having issues with code that used to work during weeks.</p>
<p>The problem comes from this part of my code:</p>
<pre><code>TypeError: ifile  = open('0_Inputs/CompaniesList.csv', "r", encoding = 'utf-8')
</code></pre>
<p>I got the following message:</p>
<pre><code>open() got an unexpected keyword argument 'encoding'
</code></pre>
<p>If i try:</p>
<pre><code>ifile  = open('0_Inputs/CompaniesList.csv', "r")
</code></pre>
<p>then i have an other error: </p>
<pre><code>OSError: cannot identify image file '0_Inputs/CompaniesList.csv'
</code></pre>
<p>Im doing <code>from PyPDF2 import PdfFileReader, PdfFileWriter</code> but I don't if there's a conflict between libraries? </p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You should use the <code>csv</code> module instead of opening the file this way.</p>
<pre><code>with open('0_Inputs/CompaniesList.csv', newline='') as ifile:
    pass
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">You are asking about opening PDFs, but you are trying to open a csv? Is the <code>open()</code> function you are referring to the built in open?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you for answering. I got this: TypeError: open() got an unexpected keyword argument 'newline'</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Did you load the <code>csv</code> module? Are you running Python 3?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I did import csv, and I'm running Python 3.6. I can't find where is the problem with   the open function.  Can it be a conflict with Image from the pillow library?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Just delete this argument soâ€¦ But it is very strange.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Problem solved, I had to delete pillow. Thank you</span>
