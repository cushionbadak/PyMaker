<p>I have code written in C# that I want to port to Python.</p>
<p>I want to port <code>Serial.write(Byte, int, int)</code> from C# to Python and I am using Pyserial. I tried <code>Serial.Write</code> in Pyserial but wasn't able to get the work done.</p>
<p>Can anyone guide me through how to create a similar function in Python?</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://pythonhosted.org/pyserial/pyserial_api.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the docs</a>, you need to write <code>bytes</code>, not numbers.</p>
<p>So you need to convert your numbers, which are one <code>byte</code> and two <code>int</code>, to bytes.</p>
<p>You can do that with the <code>struct</code> module. See the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>struct.pack</code></a> method.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">It's a shame to be the StackOverflow stereotype here, but you should really start out with the examples on the man-page: <a href="https://pythonhosted.org/pyserial/shortintro.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">pythonhosted.org/pyserial/shortintro.html</a>. And when that doesn't work, give us a relevant - and short - piece of code that you're having trouble with. And the error it produces and what your expected result is.</span>
