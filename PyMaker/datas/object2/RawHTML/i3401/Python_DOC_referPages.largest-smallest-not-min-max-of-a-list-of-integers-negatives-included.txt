<p>(I couldn't find any min/max examples using negative integers)</p>
<p>Hello. I am trying to write a simple program that will find the "largest" and "smallest" of 3 user-defined integers. This would be too easy if I am just intended to find the minimum and maximum. I think I am being asked to write a program that finds the min/max of absolute values of these numbers and then remembers what number generated the biggest/smallest, even if it was negative.
This sounds slightly complicated though and this is an introductory course. Can someone tell me what the simplest solution to this problem is?</p>
<p>Currently my program only finds min/max:</p>
<pre><code>print("This program will find the \"biggest\" \n"
      "and \"smallest\" of three integers. \n"
      "Please enter Num1: ")
while True:
  try:
     nNum1 = int(input())       
  except ValueError:
     print("Please enter an integer. \n")
     continue
  else:
     print("You have entered " + str(nNum1) + ". \n")
     break
print("Please enter Num2: ")
while True:
  try:
     nNum2 = int(input())       
  except ValueError:
     print("Please enter an integer. \n")
     continue
  else:
     print("You have entered " + str(nNum2) + ". \n")
     break
print("Please enter Num3: ")
while True:
  try:
     nNum3 = int(input())       
  except ValueError:
     print("Please enter an integer. \n")
     continue
  else:
     print("You have entered " + str(nNum3) + ". \n")
     break

nMin = min(abs(nNum1), abs(nNum2), abs(nNum3))
print("The *smallest* of these three numbers is " + str(nMin) + ". \n")
nMax = max(abs(nNum1), abs(nNum2), abs(nNum3))
print("The *largest* of these three numbers is " + str(nMax) + ". \n")

<p>Simply use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/sorting.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>sorted</code></a> with <code>abs</code> as the key function, and the smallest number will be the first item of the resulting list, while the largest number will be the last item.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = [-5, -8, 2]
&gt;&gt;&gt; sorted(a, key=abs)[0]
2
&gt;&gt;&gt; sorted(a, key=abs)[-1]
-8
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">without <code>abs</code> this works fine. why do you need <code>abs</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, @L_Church is write, maybe there is misunderstanding here, could you please write out an example ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">not looking for min/max, looking for "largest" number and "smallest" number. Min/Max is basically looking for what is furthest at either end of the number line. I want closest to/furthest from zero</span>
<span class="comment-copy">does using -1 as the index as you have return the last value in the sorted list?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user391838 Yes in Python negative index means counting backwards from the end of the list.</span>
