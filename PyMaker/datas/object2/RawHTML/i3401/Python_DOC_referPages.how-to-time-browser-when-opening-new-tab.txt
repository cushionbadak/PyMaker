<p>I have the following code for when I need to click on an item, which opens in a new tab,and I need to switch the browser to that tab.</p>
<pre><code>def ThingsinTab(browser):

   clickbutton=Somefunction #Find where to click

   clickbutton.click()

   try:  

      WebDriverWait(browser,10).until(
      EC.number_of_windows_to_be(len(old_tabs)+1))
   except: return browser

   THIS POINT!!

   new_window=(set(browser.window_handles)-old_tabs).pop()
   browser.switch_to.window(new_window)

   #Do some stuff with this tab

   browser.close()  
   browser.switch_to_window(main_tab)

   return browser
</code></pre>
<p>Sometimes the tab opens, but it remains with a grey background, not fully loaded for a long while. I have narrowed where the code is stuck in this point and I signaled it in the code above. 
What I want is a way to time the new variable <code>new_window</code> and the switch, so that if let's say, after 10 seconds it hasn't move on in the code, it stops, closes the new tab and return the browser.</p>
<p>Provided this function is a part of a bigger code, I would like to know as well how to time in the bigger script this function, so if it takes more than a number of seconds, it interrupts the function from running and resume the rest of the code.</p>
<pre><code>Big script

some things

ThingsinTab() #I want to set a maximum time for this function to complete its code,or else stop it and move on.

More some things

<p>You could spin off a thread that opens the window, then wait for a maximum of 10 seconds. If it hasn't finished by then, kill the thread and perform your alternative strategy.</p>
<p>You might find the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>threading</code></a> module useful. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html#threading.Thread.join" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>thread.join(10)</code></a> can do the "wait for a maximum of 10 seconds" part; it shouldn't be <em>too</em> hard to put this together, aside from the usual difficulty of getting threads to work.</p>
