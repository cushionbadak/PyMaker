<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>seems we are asking a lot, but we are seeking a short validation for positive int or float being entered as input. The code below rejects negative, text and null entries - yay! It accepts int as valid, but why doesn't entry like 1.1 pass? (seemingly a positive numeric entry) We want entry of positive 1 and 1.1 to pass. is there an easy way without two separate blocks, including try/catch?</p>
<pre><code>bookPrice = input("What is the cost of your book? &gt;&gt; ")
while bookPrice.isnumeric() is False or float(bookPrice) &lt; 0:
    bookPrice = input("Use whole # or decimal, no spaces: &gt;&gt; ")
bookPrice = float(bookPrice)
print("Your book price is ${0:&lt;.2f}.".format(bookPrice))
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>isnumeric()</code> is checking if all the characters are numeric (eg 1, 2, 100...).</p>
<p>If you put a '.' in the input, it doesn't count as a numeric character, nor does '-', so it returns <code>False</code>.</p>
<p>What I would do is try to convert the input to <strong>float</strong>, and work around bad inputs.
You could've used <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#isinstance" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>isinstance()</code></a>, but for that you would need to convert the input to something else than <strong>string</strong>.</p>
<p>I came up with this:</p>
<pre><code>message = "What is the cost of your book? &gt;&gt;"
while True:
    bookPrice = input(message)
    try:
        bookPrice = float(bookPrice)

        if bookPrice  &lt;= 0:
            message = "Use whole # or decimal, no spaces: &gt;&gt; "
            continue
        currect_user_input = True

    except ValueError:
        currect_user_input = False
        message = "Use whole # or decimal, no spaces: &gt;&gt; "

    if currect_user_input:
        print("Your book price is ${0:&lt;.2f}.".format(bookPrice))
        break
</code></pre>
</div>
