<p>I am new to python and my first task is to save the data from a .txt file into a matrix. </p>
<p>.txt file that contains the following data:</p>
<pre><code>0 1 1 

0

2 3 2 4  
</code></pre>
<p>I want to read the .txt file and transform it into a 2D matrix in python by counting the occurrence of each number in each line and save it to a matrix where each line is considered as a frame.</p>
<p>The output would be come</p>
<pre><code>          c0 c1 c2 c3 c4

frame0    1     2    0    0    0

frame1    1     0    0    0    0  

frame2    0     0    2    1    1
</code></pre>
<p>For instance, the number 0 occurs once in the first line where number 1 occurs twice.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.Counter" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>collections.Counter</code></a> to count the occurrences of each item in a list and map the items to their counts in a dict:</p>
<pre><code>from collections import Counter
text='''0 1 1
0
2 3 2 4'''
matrix = []
for line in text.split('\n'):
    counts = Counter(line.split())
    matrix.append([counts.get(str(i), 0) for i in range(max(map(int, counts.keys())) + 1)])
frame_size = max(map(len, matrix))
matrix = [frame + [0] * (frame_size - len(frame)) for frame in matrix]
print(matrix)
</code></pre>
<p>This outputs:</p>
<pre><code>[[1, 2, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 2, 1, 1]]
</code></pre>
