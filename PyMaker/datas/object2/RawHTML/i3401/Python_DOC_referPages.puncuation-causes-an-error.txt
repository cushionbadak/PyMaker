<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Hello I got a small block of code that when run with the test phrase I get an error when the code hits the punctuation.  I think that the value of word is null but I tried to cast that to a string to prevent getting the error IndexError.  I have stepped through the program and am getting a value for word of '' instead of ' ' and would like to know the difference so I can fix this issue.  The code works with all letters.</p>
<pre><code>word = ''
quote = input('enter a 1 sentence quote, non-alpha words: ').lower()
for character in quote:
    if character.isalpha() == True:
        word += character
    else:
        if str(word[0]) &gt;= 'h':
            print(word.upper())
            word = ''

        else:
            word = ''
</code></pre>
<p>Sample Input:Wheresoever you go, go with all your heart
Desired Output:With all the capitalized words on their own line.
WHERESOEVER
YOU
WITH
YOUR
HEART</p>

<p><code>''</code> is a perfectly valid string. You don't need to "cast" it, or anything of the sort.</p>
<p>But it's an <em>empty</em> string. So it doesn't have a first character <code>word[0]</code>. If you read the error message:</p>
<pre><code>IndexError: string index out of range
</code></pre>
<p>… that's what it's telling you. The problem isn't that you don't have a string, it's that you have a string that isn't big enough to have a first character.</p>
<hr/>
<p>What you want to do here is either check for the empty string before asking for its first character:</p>
<pre><code>if word and word[0] &gt;= 'h':
    print(word.upper())
    word = ''
else:
    word = ''
</code></pre>
<p>… or handle the <code>IndexError</code>:</p>
<pre><code>try:
    if word[0] &gt;= 'h':
        print(word.upper())
        word = ''
    else:
        word = ''
except IndexError:
    word = ''
</code></pre>
<p>Normally, in Python, it's more idiomatic to just <code>try</code> something and handle errors (<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-eafp" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Easier to Ask Forgiveness than Permission</a>, as opposed to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-lbyl" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Look Before You Leap</a>), but in some cases it's going to be more readable to check first, and I think this is one of those cases.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">What exactly is a "none letter"?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Please post the entire exception, not just a description of it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">why not doing <code>word=''</code> in the end instead of in all the branches?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Jean-FrançoisFabre That’s a good improvement to the OP’s code, but it’s not relevant to the problem, and I don’t like making extra changes without explaining them. If you think it’s important enough to add as a side note at the end, I can do that (or just edit it yourself—I’m sure you can explain “DRY” in one line at least as well as I can).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">yeah, you're right; this isn't codereview.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks guys I am able to understand this now</span>
