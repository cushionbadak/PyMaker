<p>So basically I have learned a bit with ISO 8601 where the format is </p>
<pre><code>"2018-07-06T07:00:00.000"
</code></pre>
<p>and basically what I have achieved is that I starting of to change the ISO to a more formal timestamp which is:</p>
<pre><code>etatime = str(datetime.datetime.strptime("2018-07-06T07:00:00.000", "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%f"))
</code></pre>
<p>which will give an output of:</p>
<pre><code>2018-07-06 07:00:00
</code></pre>
<p>However I noticed the time is 1 hour behind the BST (British time) which should be added one hour.</p>
<p>My question is, is there possible to go from (<code>2018-07-06T07:00:00.000</code>) to  (<code>2018-07-06 08:00:00 BST</code>)?</p>

<p>Assumptions: the input represents a UTC timestamp, and you want to localise that to <em>London</em> time. You probably do not want to localise it to BST time, since BST is the DST variation of GMT, and an actual location like London will switch between BST and GMT depending on the time of year. You'll want to install the <a href="http://pytz.sourceforge.net" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>pytz</code> module</a>.</p>
<pre><code>from datetime import datetime, timezone
import pytz

date = '2018-07-06T07:00:00.000'
utc_date = datetime.strptime(date, '%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%f').replace(tzinfo=timezone.utc)
london_date = utc_date.astimezone(pytz.timezone('Europe/London'))
</code></pre>
<pre><code>datetime.datetime(2018, 7, 6, 8, 0, tzinfo=&lt;DstTzInfo 'Europe/London' BST+1:00:00 DST&gt;)
</code></pre>
<p><code>strptime</code> gives you a <em>naÃ¯ve</em> <code>datetime</code> object (without timezone information), <code>.replace</code> gives you an <em>aware</em> <code>datetime</code> object (with timezone information), which then enables you to simply convert that to a different timezone.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>One suggestion is that you can use the <code>timedelta</code> function from <code>datetime</code> module:</p>
<pre><code>from datetime import datetime, timedelta

etatime = datetime.strptime("2018-07-06T07:00:00.000", "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%f")

# Before adding one hour
print(etatime)

etatime = etatime + timedelta(hours=1)

# After adding one hour
print(etatime)
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>2018-07-06 07:00:00
2018-07-06 08:00:00
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">So that original timestamp represents the time <i>in UTC</i>? Since there's no timezone information included, "going to BST" is an undefined operation.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Oh, actually I dont know the represents time it is actually,  because UTC is usually the same time as BST - which is uncorrect for my question. I think it is just faulty made or something like that, all I know is that it is 1 hour behind the BST, which I can't really tell what timezone it is who has 1 hour behind BST - I assume GMT-1 in that case.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">So, that's what you need to figure out. "One hour off" could mean that the date has been generated wrong and is truly <i>one hour off</i>; it could mean that it represents UTC and you want to localise it to BST; it could mean it has been generated in some other local timezone and you want to localise it to BSTâ€¦ The correct thing to do depends on which of these assumptions is true.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Oh you are totally correct, I just mindblowed myself. It is UTC time and BST is UTC + 1 basically. So you are absolutely correct when you meant that it is time for <i>UTC</i>. So yes. Converting from UTC to BST would be my question. :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Looks liek it working, However I can't get the step where I can remove the end of the print - The print right now looks <code>2018-07-05 08:00:00+01:00</code> and basically I just want to remove the last <code>+01:00</code>, is that possible to do?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You want to explicitly format your timestamp: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime.strftime" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/â€¦</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">I was looking at it, but I hav eno idea how I can replace/remove the timezone information at the end since there is none in the documentatiuon that I can find :/</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It's not about "removing" anything, it's about outputting the date in a format you like, in this case without mentioning the timezone anywhere: <code>london_date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')</code>.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">Hmm im getting an issue saying: <code>module 'datetime' has no attribute 'strptime'</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Oh, I by accident had an str left. My bad!</span>
