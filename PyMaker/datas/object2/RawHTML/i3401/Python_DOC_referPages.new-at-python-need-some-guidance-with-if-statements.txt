<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Q: Code runs but only prints the else statement...
   Any help is appreciated.</p>
<pre><code>fruit = str()
favorite_fruits = ["mango", "kiwi", "pineapple"]
if fruit in favorite_fruits is "mango":
    print('You really like ' + fruit + '.')
if fruit in favorite_fruits is "kiwi":
    print('You really like ' + fruit + '.')
if fruit in favorite_fruits is "pineapple":
    print('You really like ' + fruit + '.')
if fruit in favorite_fruits is "apple":
    print('You really like' + fruit + '.')
else:
    print('Your going to starve.')
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>str()</code> returns <code>''</code> every time. So <code>fruit</code> is always <code>''</code> which doesn't satisfy any of the <code>if</code> statements.</p>
<p>Also your if statements are off. You can just check if <code>fruit</code> is in <code>favorite_fruits</code> and then print:</p>
<pre><code>fruit = "mango"
favorite_fruits = ["mango", "kiwi", "pineapple"]

if fruit in favorite_fruits:
    print('You really like ' + fruit + '.')
else:
    print('Your going to starve.')
</code></pre>
<p>If you want user input then use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>input</code></a> instead of hard coding <code>fruit</code>. </p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>fruit in favorite_fruits is "apple"</code> is not going to do anything meaningful, but I can't even guess what you thought it would mean, especially considering apple isn't in that list.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The apple reference was just to show that it would not print.</span>
