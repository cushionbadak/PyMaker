<p>i'm making a small program where user creates an account but for some reason in this part of the code pass does nothing 
can somebody please explain this?</p>
<pre><code>def create_password():
    while True:
        password = '#'
        not_allowed_characters = '!#¤%&amp;/()=?^\'.,&lt;&gt;'
        for c in list(password):
            0 + 0
        if c in not_allowed_characters:
            print(c + ' is not allowed')
            pass #pass does nothing how can i fix this
        if 0 is 0:
            print(1)
create_password()
</code></pre>

<p><code>pass</code> does nothing <em>by definition</em>. That's what it's for: as a no-op, a placeholder for when the syntax requires a statement but you don't want to do anything.</p>
<p>I suspect what you want here is <code>continue</code>, which will loop.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">What did you expect <code>pass</code> to do?</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>pass</code> is actually for <i>nothing</i>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-pass-statement" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/reference/…</a> pass is a null operation — when it is executed, nothing happens. It is useful as a placeholder when a statement is required syntactically, but no code needs to be executed,</span>
<span class="comment-copy">how can i make it to not run the rest of the loop without breaking it</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@pythonprogrammer use <code>continue</code>.</span>
