<p>If you're looking for a disposable email address, look for such a service with a public API (eg. <a href="https://market.mashape.com/Privatix/temp-mail" rel="nofollow noreferrer">temp mail</a>). Then use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.client.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http.client</a> or <a href="http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python Requests</a> to interact with that API. </p>
<p>If your goal is to create spam or ghost accounts - don't. These services are aimed at quality assurance, ie. testing email services.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Check that the terms and conditions allow this. I guess that they don't.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You can check GMAIL's API document for that. Most likely no, as they are trying hard to distinguish human from machines during registration.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What have you tried so far to solve your problem in python?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If this is for automating corporate account creation, other options are available, and probably more suitable, as products from Google.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thank you all for your responses</span>
