<p>I found out this question has been answered before, but not very clear to me.<br/>
I understand data type can somehow called user defined class actually it is same as class in python.</p>
<p>But in some books dictionary (dict) is called data structure some books call it data type.<br/>
What is the difference?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>A dictionary (or map or associative-array) is a data-structure with keys and values. </p>
<p>In Python, that data structure can be used <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datatypes.html?highlight=dict" rel="nofollow noreferrer">as the <code>dict</code> datatype</a></p>
<hr/>
<p>So, to answer the question more broadly, all languages have built-in data types.</p>
<p>Not all languages have built-in data structures, but they generally can be implemented by using the data types that are available</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can we construct a class for specific data structure? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sure, for example, I would make a <code>class LinkedList</code> or <code>class BinaryTree</code>, but as mentioned, those are composed of more simpler types. </p>

<p>Data structure is a general computer science concept. It is just a way of organizing data to make certain operations easier or harder.</p>
<p>Data type is a concept specific to a programming language. In a way, it is a concrete implementation of a data structure in a particular programming language. But the actual definition of what constitutes a "type" varies among programming languages. For example, in <code>C</code>, you can define a <code>struct</code> and use it as a type. There are also basic types like <code>int</code>, <code>float</code>, <code>char</code> etc. In <code>python</code>, you can use the built-in types like <code>list</code>, <code>set</code> etc. or define your own types using classes.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Thank you very much. May I take it in this why: if it is a build in data structure it is called data type, if it is user construct type it is called data structure? Then shouldn’t user construct class called data type as well?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Welcome. Feel free to accept the answer using the checkmark next to the post, if this answers your quesiton</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Can we construct a class for specific data structure? But if we can then shouldn’t it be a data type?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">A class is a data-type in OOP languages. Not all languages have classes.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">dict is written in C, though, not as a Python class. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/45728790/2308683">stackoverflow.com/a/45728790/2308683</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">So we can call some user define data type -data structure if it is complicated structured?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It doesn't need to be complicated. Even simple types are data structures. Even a simple <code>int</code> (talking in <code>C</code> terms) can be thought of as a data structure.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks. So sounds like there is no major difference between data type and date structure even in python terms right</span>
