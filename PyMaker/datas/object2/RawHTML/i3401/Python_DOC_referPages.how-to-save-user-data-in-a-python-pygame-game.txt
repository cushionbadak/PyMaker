<p>I don't mind if the save is readable or not, I don't plan on making this game big, just mainly for friends. I'm fairly new to python/pygame, and all of the tutorials don't really make sense to me. All I want is a way to save game progress, and when they return there progress is there. Anything helps!</p>

<p>You need to save some representation of the game's current state. This can be any format you want -- if you have a game state object, you can serialize and save it using the <code>pickle</code> module, described <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6420311/how-to-make-save-load-game-functions-in-pygame">here</a>. If you have something simple that you could describe in a text file, e.g. something that reads like</p>
<pre><code>score = 300
level = 10
lives = 2
</code></pre>
<p>then you could just save it in a text file when the user exits, and then load it when they start again.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I've got a complete example here: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/45374532/6220679">stackoverflow.com/a/45374532/6220679</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">So what would the code for that be, say I create a text file called user_data inside my game folder. Inside of the txt file do I write my variables? Or do I need to do it in python.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Zane just do some googling about how to read/write files with python.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I figured out how to read and write but how do I implement it as variables, right now I have a variable called LevelOneWin, and for a test i'm setting it to true in my txt file. What would I do to use that in my code.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Zane Combine your knowledge of reading/writing files with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#textseq" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the documentation on strings</a> -- specifically string equality and converting to (and from) other datatypes.</span>
