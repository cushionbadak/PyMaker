<p>I am currently learning Python through edX platform, I came across two terms that got me confused: required argument and optional argument.
Can anyone feel so kind to explain the difference between the two?</p>
<p>Take function round() for example,
the quiz stated: "The function round has two arguments. Select the two correct statements about these arguments."</p>
<p>here are the options:</p>
<p>number is a required argument.</p>
<p>number is an optional argument.</p>
<p>ndigits is a required argument.</p>
<p>ndigits is an optional argument.</p>
<p>According to what I have learned, I know that you have to specify input in order to get ndigit, such as round(1.68 , <strong>1</strong>) &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;1.7</p>
<p>If I just wrote round(1.68) &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I will get 2</p>
<p>Thus, to my understanding, ndigit is an optional argument, meaning that you have to <strong>choose</strong> in order to make it work, otherwise, the function will only work what is it required, like an autopilot program</p>
<p>Please give me some feedback if I am wrong, or share some link where I can learn more.
I am not the native English speaker, so the words "required" and "optional" really seem confusing to me at one point. I hope to learn more from you all.</p>
<p>By the way, I got the right answer, I'll keep learning Python, hope to work in this field, cheers!</p>

<p>The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#round" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs</a> for <code>round()</code> define the function as <code>round(number[, ndigits])</code></p>
<p>The square brackets are common notation to show which arguments are optional.</p>
<p>In the case of <code>round()</code>, if the <code>ndigits</code> parameter is omitted or <code>None</code> it reverts to a predefined behaviour - in this case rounding to the nearest integer.</p>
<p><code>number</code> on the other hand is required; the function cannot be called without this argument and will raise an error if it is missing.</p>

<span class="comment-copy"><i>optional</i> means you <b>can</b> specify but don't have to. <i>required</i> means that it won't work without it. Your summary is correct. To see that <code>number</code> is required, you need only consider what the logical result of rounding no number to the third digit -- it's nonsense! :)</span>
