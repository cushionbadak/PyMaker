<p>I have the following directory structure:</p>
<p>/year/month/day/file.txt</p>
<p>and what I'd like to is to delete entire directories where the /year/month/day is greater than x number of days. </p>
<p>Additionally, if the x number of days exceeds the days in the current month, it deletes the day/ folders from the previous month.</p>
<p>For example: If today is January 15th, and the x number of days to remove is 20, then the script should remove everything but the last 5 days in December.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>for year in os.listdir('.'):
    for month in os.listdir(year):
        for day in os.listdir(os.path.join(year, month)):
            date = datetime.date(int(year), int(month), int(day))
</code></pre>
<p>Now you can use the utilities in the <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#date-objects" rel="nofollow"><code>date</code></a> class. When you've decided to remove a entire directory, use <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html#shutil.rmtree" rel="nofollow"><code>shutil.rmtree</code></a>.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>today = datetime.date.today()
for year in os.listdir('.'):
    for month in os.listdir(year):
        for day in os.listdir(os.path.join(year, month):
            date = datetime.date(int(year), int(month), int(day))
            age = today - date
            if age &gt; datetime.timedelta(days=20):
                shutil.rmtree(os.path.join(year, month, day))
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">How can a date be greater than a number? What does that mean?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I tried pulling the day component of date.today() and deleting the day/ folders that qualified while decrementing a counter, and then subtracting the month component (as necessary), and then removing the day/ from previous month using the remaining counter value.  Somehow I just feel like it's rather ugly and was wondering if there's a better way.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I still don't understand the rule you're giving. If it's January 15, and you want to remove things that are more than 20 days old, why are you removing the last 5 days in December, instead of everything <i>but</i> the last 5 days in December?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@CarlSagan: Show us the code instead of describing it, and tell us what it did wrong instead of making us guess.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@CarlSagan: OK. If you wanted to delete only the most recent directories, iterating date objects and turning them into directory paths that match would make sense. But if you want to delete all <i>but</i> the most recent directories, it doesn't. How would you know when to stop looking? Iterate all dates back to 1970 just in case? That's why I turned it around, walking the directories and turning them into dates. Does that make sense?</span>
