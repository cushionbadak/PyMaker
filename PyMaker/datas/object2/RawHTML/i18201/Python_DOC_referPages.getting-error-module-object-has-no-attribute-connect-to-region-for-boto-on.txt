<p>I am learning how to use the boto module with python and AWS
when i am trying to run the follow code:</p>
<pre><code>import boto.ses
conn = boto.ses.connect_to_region("us-west-2")

<p>I keep geting the follow error:</p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):

<p>I am subscribed to the AWS service,
I am using the pycharm as an IDE and have the boto.cfg file configured correctly</p>

<p>You apparently haven't actually installed <code>boto</code>, you've just copied its source code into your project. That's now how you use packages in Python. </p>
<p>See <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/install/index.html" rel="nofollow">Installing Python Modules</a> in the Python docs, <a href="http://docs.pythonboto.org/en/latest/getting_started.html" rel="nofollow">Installing Boto</a> in the Boto docs, and <a href="http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/quickstart.html" rel="nofollow">Quickstart</a> in the <code>pip</code> docs.</p>
<p>Orâ€¦ I believe PyCharm has built-in GUI functionality for managing your installed site-packages, and building virtual environments and managing <em>their</em> installed packages, so you don't even have to learn how to use <code>pip</code> or <code>setup.py</code> files if you don't want to.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">works for me.  I suspect improper installation of <code>boto</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">hi abarnet, I did install boto , in fact it is working with other models of the Amazon Web Services (AWS) like SES (simple email service). i am also not able to run this command and geting the same error when i am running it directly from the python interpeter.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Then either (a) you've installed it, and <i>also</i> copied it into your project, which means there's essentially a 50/50 chance any given module will work, or (b) you've installed it, and <i>also</i> created a local package and module with the same name, which will overshadow the one in your site-packages. Either way, the problem is the same: there should not be a file named <code>Boto/boto_ses.py</code> inside your project directory.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">hi again,i reinstall the boto module on pycharm ,now it is the most upgraded one with version 2.14.0 i also refactor the name of the file boto_ses to boto_ses1 but i am getting the same error.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@FirdaNovo: You're telling me that you no longer have a file named <code>D:/Document/PycharmProjects/Boto/boto_ses.py</code>, but you still get the exact same error, with the same reference to that file? If so, that is possible in some circumstances if there's a leftover .pyc file for the no-longer-there .py file.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">after changing the file name it was solved,thank you for the help</span>
