<p>I just recently dove in to the world of programming and was given a very basic exercise to complete but I am kind of stuck and do not know what to do next.
The problem was : Given 3 numbers determine if they can form a triangle and if yes calculate the Perimeter and Area,draw the Triangle afterwards.
I have managed to calculate the perimeter and area of the triangle(is such exists) but have no idea how to make the computer draw a triangle from whatever values were input.</p>
<p>Here is the code:</p>
<pre><code>import math
a = int(input("Enter your first number"))
b = int(input("Enter your second number"))
c = int(input("Enter your third number"))
if a+b&gt;c and a+c&gt;b and b+c&gt;a:
    print("The Triangle's Perimeter is:")
    print(int(a+b+c))
    print("The Area of the triangle is:")
    print(int(math.sqrt((a+b+c)/2)*(((a+b+c)/2)-a)*(((a+b+c)/2)-b)*(((a+b+c)/2)-c)))
else:
    print("The numbers do not form a triangle")
input("Press any key to continue")
</code></pre>
<p>Would love if you guys could give me an insight on how to achieve this task</p>

<p>Here's another solution, using Tkinter:</p>
<pre><code>from Tkinter import *

def draw(a, b, c):
    # determine corner points of triangle with sides a, b, c
    A = (0, 0)
    B = (c, 0)
    hc = (2 * (a**2*b**2 + b**2*c**2 + c**2*a**2) - (a**4 + b**4 + c**4))**0.5 / (2.*c)
    dx = (b**2 - hc**2)**0.5
    if abs((c - dx)**2 + hc**2 - a**2) &gt; 0.01: dx = -dx # dx has two solutions
    C = (dx, hc)

    # move away from topleft, scale up a bit, convert to int
    coords = [int((x + 1) * 75) for x in A+B+C]

    # draw using Tkinter
    root = Tk()
    canvas = Canvas(root, width=500, height=300)
    canvas.create_polygon(*coords)
    canvas.pack()
    root.mainloop()

draw(2, 4, 5)

<p>If you are plotting by using the (x,y) coordinates of the vertices, you have at least three continuous degrees of freedom: 2 for choosing the location of vertex A, and one more for the direction from A to B.  Then, there is a binary choice of clockwise or counter-clockwise order for the labeling of the vertices.</p>
<p>If you don't care which of these to use, then you can put A at (0,0), B at (0, c), and then solve for the intersection of two circles: radius a centered at B, and radius b centered as A.</p>
<pre><code>x² + y² = b² 
(x - c)² + y² = a² .... subtract these to eliminate y² 
(x - c)² - x² = a² - b²
-2cx + c² = a² - b²
2cx = c² + b² - a²
x = (c² + b² - a²)/(2c)
y = ± √[ b² - x² ] .... choose - for clockwise, + for counter-clockwise
</code></pre>
<p>Now you have three points A=(0,0), B=(0,c) and C=(x,y) with the desired opposite side lengths a,b,c respectively.  If you need the angles, use the Law of Cosines from trig:</p>
<pre><code>c² = a² + b² - 2ab(cos C)
2ab(cos C) = a² + b² - c²
C = cos⁻¹[ (a² + b² - c²)/(2ab) ]
</code></pre>
<p>The same pattern applies to solving for A and B.  Those are the interior angles.  For turtles, the turning angle is exterior angle, so start at point A, move (c) in any direction, turn (180-B), then move (a), then turn (180-B), then move (b).</p>

<span class="comment-copy">There are a few built in modules suitable for drawing shapes. Take a look at <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/turtle.html?highlight=turtle#turtle" rel="nofollow noreferrer">turtle</a> or <a href="http://effbot.org/tkinterbook/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Tkinter</a>(the <code>canvas</code> widget in particular).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you for your input,I have looked around but didn't find anything of use.I need to create the triangle shape based on the inputs from a,b and c variables.Do you know a way I can do that?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What exactly is the question? How to determine the points of the triangle from the side length, or how to draw the triangle using a graphics framework?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I never used <code>turtle</code> of <code>Tkinter</code> but there is a whole universe, so to speak, of decent drawing utilities in Python. My favourite is <code>matplotlib</code>. I doesn't come with all Python distributions as a standard, but if you have it I can help you in no-time. Try the following line of code: <code>import maplotlib.pyplot as plt</code>. If it works for your Python let me know and I can sort something out.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@tobias_k I'm sorry I cannot explain it better,I have difficulties using english as it is.But here is my question: Suppose the user selects an input value of 4 for the a variable,4 for the b variable and 4 for the c variable.Am I able to graphically draw the triangle from those values.What if the user enters other values for a,b,c.Will the triangle change accordingly.This is where I am stuck.I am able to draw a normale triangle using turtle,but whether the values change or not,it's the same triangle.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Is the module turtle installed by default or is it external? plus that module creates nothing <i>practically</i> useful as turtle is only used to teach programming for <i>kids</i> ...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@KDawG: <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>turtle</code> is built-in to Python</a>. And what's wrong with teaching programming to kids? The OP may well be a kid learning to program!</span>
