<p>You may want to look into the <code>str.format()</code> function. If you read <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html#formatspec" rel="nofollow">the documentation</a> you'll find that it has the ability to center text:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; "{0:^40}".format(" Ministry of Silly Walks ")

<span class="comment-copy">Do you want text center aligned within a larger string? In the console? to a file? to a string?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I have a file with the text(poem.txt) and I want to be centre aligned after I run the program(I am new to python. So sorry for my lack of language)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You want to reformat <code>poem.txt</code>, you mean? Also it always helps to show examples - those transcend language barriers ;)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">How do you define your center?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I want a program that can show me after I run it the poem.txt centre aligned</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sorry for my lack of understanding basic programming. But how do I open  the file using your program?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You already had a way to do that in your original question: <code>lines = open ('poem.txt ', 'r'). readlines ()</code>. Just adapt it accordingly.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It tells that the name 'lines' is not defined</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I just did it thank you so much</span>
