<p>I am trying to make a program where you select say median for the option, next could I make it ask you to put in your list and say ("Ex: 10,40,30") and then make it take each item before the "," and append it to a list, then make it take out the ",". Any ideas how I could do this?</p>
<p>This is all I got so far</p>
<pre><code>option5=(["1. Median", "2. Average", "3. Mean", "4. Mode"])
for items in option5:
    print (items)
    print ("")
choice5=input("Choose another option: ")
while choice5 not in ("1234"):
    choice5=input("Choose another option: ")
print("")
if choice5 == "1":
    print("Please put your list of numbers like the example below.")
    print("Ex: 10,20,30")
    print("")
    median=input("List: ")
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I think this is what you want: <code>median_list = median.split(",")</code>.</p>
<p><a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.split" rel="nofollow">Here</a> is the documentation for the string method split.</p>
<p>I am presuming that the input maps to output like so:</p>
<p><code>1,2,3,4,5</code> -&gt; <code>["1", "2", "3", "4", "5"]</code></p>
<p>Another way you could do it that would be more flexible and catch incorrect input like those in your comment is using <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html#ast.literal_eval" rel="nofollow">ast.literal_eval</a> (don't use the regular <code>eval</code> as it is unsafe).</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>from ast import literal_eval

try:
    median_list = list(literal_eval(median))
except SyntaxError:
    print("Invalid data was entered!")
</code></pre>
</div>

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks man :) Do you have any idea how I would validate that it is listed in that way? For example what if they input "50 70 40 30" without the "," than it wouldn't work so I could I do a while statement to validate that they put it in a certain way? Would I do something like while median not in ",": ??</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You could try and do something like that, but my edit provides a more general answer.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks man :) But the only problem with this is that it says int object is not iterable. Any ideas? I think the problem is that it says Except SyntaxError, but what if theres a TypeError?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user2812028 The second code works fine for me if you put the <code>try... except...</code> just below and with <code>try</code> at the same indentation as the last line of your program.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I changed it from SyntaxError to TypeError and it worked. :) Thanks man!</span>
