<p>I try the following code:</p>
<pre><code>print(repr("%0.2f" % cost).rjust(24), repr("%0.2f" % provision).rjust(17), end="\n")
</code></pre>
<p>but the resulting string I get is (when cost = 100.00 and provision = 4.00)</p>
<pre><code>            '100.00'            '4.00'
</code></pre>
<p>So <code>r.just</code> is working perfectly (looked it up in here) but for some odd reason these apostrophes appeared around the values.</p>
<p>this doesn't happen in my next line of code:</p>
<pre><code>print("Provision summ %0.2f euros." % summ)
</code></pre>
<p>which gives me </p>
<pre><code>Provision summ 4 euros.
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, no apostrophes, why is that? Can you advise me how to remove them? I have tried adding <code>.remove("'", "")</code> to my string, but it didn't help.</p>

<p>Do not use <code>repr()</code> here; it introduces the quotes because you are asking for the Python literal form of the strings. The <code>end='\n'</code> is entirely redundant too as that is the default. Grouping the format strings in parenthesis would do what you want:</p>
<pre><code>print(("%0.2f" % cost).rjust(24), ("%0.2f" % provision).rjust(17))
</code></pre>
<p>or justifying <em>before</em> interpolating:</p>
<pre><code>print("%0.2f".rjust(24) % cost, "%0.2f".rjust(17) % provision)
</code></pre>
<p>You perhaps would do better studying <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.format" rel="nofollow"><code>str.format()</code></a> and use that to format and justify your text:</p>
<pre><code>print("{:&gt;24.2f}{:&gt;18.2f}".format(cost, provision))
</code></pre>
<p>Here the <code>&gt;24</code> and <code>&gt;18</code> right-justify the value in a field 24 and 18 characters wide (the latter is 17 + the extra space <code>print()</code> adds when printing multiple arguments):</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; cost, provision = 100.0, 4.0
&gt;&gt;&gt; print("{:&gt;24.2f}{:&gt;18.2f}".format(cost, provision))
                  100.00              4.00
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>That's what <code>repr</code> does, though: shows a representation of the actual object. In this case, the object is the string composed of <code>"%0.2f" % cost</code> etc.</p>
<p>I have no idea why you would use <code>repr</code> here at all, especially when you're not doing so in the next, correct, line. It should just be:</p>
<pre><code>print(("%0.2f" % cost).rjust(24) ... )
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Why that double formatting (i. e. using <code>%0.2f</code> first and then again using <code>rjust</code>)?  You can do that in one step, that's what it is meant for:</p>
<pre><code>print('%24.2%17.2f' % (cost, provision))
</code></pre>
<p>This is probably what you want.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Hint: What does <code>repr</code> do?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">did you mean <code>remove(""'"")</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Wilhelmsen: That's either too many or too few quotes; not valid Python as it stands.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you for your answer, obviously i had not understood what i had read about r.just() and repr() and that's why my code looks so messed up, but for now i got my code working just the way i wanted it to, and now i will go ahead and study the str.format() you mentioned.  Thank you so much for helping me out Pieters!</span>
