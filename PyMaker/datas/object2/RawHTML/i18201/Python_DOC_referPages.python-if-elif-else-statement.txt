<p>I'm trying to create a program with python that calculate the cost for shipping. </p>

<li>you should get integer from raw_input, not string. use <code>int()</code>.</li>

<p>below is fixed code.</p>

<p>You can't compare Strings numerically.  Instead convert to an int first and then compare.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>if int(total) &lt; 50
</code></pre>
<p>Variables to avoid duplication would help too.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>When you compare strings it does so lexicographically, like in a phone book. For example:  </p>
<p><code>"a" &lt; "b"</code>: True<br/>
<code>"bill" &lt; "bob"</code>: True<br/>
<code>"100" &lt; "3"</code>: True</p>
<p>If you want to compare numbers in the order that we count them you need to use the int type.</p>
<p><code>total = int(raw_input('What is the total amount for your online shopping?'))</code></p>
<p>Then change all of the string literals in your code like <code>"50"</code> to integer literals like <code>50</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You are comparing <strong>strings</strong> numerically. That's impossible, like comparing <code>apple</code> with <code>orange</code>, which one is bigger? The computer won't understand that, it needs to compare the <strong>size</strong>.</p>
<p>To do that, we need to convert it to an integer. Use the <code>int()</code> function. Here:</p>
<pre><code>#convert it to an integer straight away
total = int(raw_input('What is the total amount for your online shopping?')) 
country = raw_input('Shipping within the US or Canada?')

if country == "US":
    if total &lt;= 50:
        print "Shipping Costs $6.00"
    elif total &lt;= 100:
            print "Shipping Costs $9.00"

<p>This:</p>
<pre><code>total = raw_input('What is the total amount for your online shopping?')
</code></pre>
<p>produces a string. Comparison between string and numbers are not very well defined. You need to convert total to a number first. Example:</p>
<pre><code>total = int(raw_input('What is the total amount for your online shopping?'))
</code></pre>
<p>(this ignores input error handling such as when the user's input is not a number)</p>
<p>Note that the behavior changes in Python 2.x and Python 3.x. In <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#comparisons" rel="nofollow">Python 2.x</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Objects of different types, except different numeric types and different string types, never compare equal; such objects are ordered consistently but arbitrarily (so that sorting a heterogeneous array yields a consistent result).</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>CPython implementation detail: Objects of different types except numbers are ordered by their type names; objects of the same types that donâ€™t support proper comparison are ordered by their address.</p>

<p>When using raw_input your user input comes in as a string and you cannot calculate numbers in the format of strings. So you need to change your string input to an integer in order to make the comparisons.
You can do like this:</p>
<pre><code>total = int(raw_input('What is the total amount for your online shopping?'))
country = raw_input('Shipping within the US or Canada?')

if country == "US":
    if total &lt;= 50:
        print "Shipping Costs $6.00"
    elif total &lt;= 100:
        print "Shipping Costs $9.00"
    elif total &lt;= 150:
        print "Shipping Costs $12.00"
else:
    print "FREE"

elif country == "Canada":
    if total &lt;= 50:
        print "Shipping Costs $8.00"
    elif total &lt;= 100:
        print "Shipping Costs $12.00"
    elif total &lt;= 150:
        print "Shipping Costs $15.00"
    else:
        print "FREE"

else:
    print "Try Again"

<p>It's like adding apples &amp; houses to get the total which is impossible. It needs to be the same type, in this case integer type, to get the total. Use the int() to convert the string into an integer.   </p>
<pre><code> total = int(raw_input('What is the total amount for your online shopping?'))
</code></pre>
<p>could also be (but less preferable): </p>
<pre><code> total = raw_input('What is the total amount for your online shopping?')
 total = int(total)

<span class="comment-copy">You need to format your code correctly... try indenting it 4 spaces.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Is it intentional that shipping is free if the purchase is greater than $150?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This looks like the same code.  What did you change?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">total = int(raw_input('What is the total amount for your online shopping?')) and change several string to int</span>
<span class="comment-copy">An actual description of the problem and solution would be much better than just posting code.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@GraemePerrow description added. thanks for your comment.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">THANK YOU!!! I should've tried deleteing the Quotes first...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">.. <code>int("5")</code> seems like a verbose way to spell <code>5</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Well yes.  But in the real code, total is a variable so int(total) is needed.  Ah you are saying the point is it should be if int(total) &lt; 50.   I'll edit for clarity.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I actually think it would make more sense to convert <code>total</code> to an <code>int</code> (or, IMHO, a <code>float</code>) once, rather than repeating the conversion for each comparison.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">So do I.  Hence my comment about variables to avoid duplication.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Point out what you have changed. In case of Python, get the indentation right, or the program is will be wrong just because of that. Also, in this case, you have only changed the <code>print</code> lines as it seems which might help depending on the python version but is not an answer to the problem.</span>
