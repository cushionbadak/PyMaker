<p>Does anyone know what kind of hash function python3 uses? Is there any way to reimplement the function accept lists as keys?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>See the <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#hash"><code>hash()</code> function</a>; object types implement a <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__hash__"><code>__hash__</code> hook function</a>.</p>
<p>No, you cannot make it accept <code>list</code>s, but subclasses of <code>list</code> could be made to work. Do take into account that not keeping the hash <em>and</em> equality tests stable for keys <strong>will</strong> break your dictionary.</p>
<p>You'd be better off storing <em><code>tuple</code>s</em> as keys, however. Turning a list into a tuple is trivial enough:</p>
<pre><code>my_dictionary[tuple(my_list)] = my_value
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Also using a <code>frozenset</code> as a hashable equivalent of list might be a good idea if order of items is not important.</span>
