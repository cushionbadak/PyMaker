<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Given the following strings as input to a Pythonic method:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes</p>
<p>The Art of War</p>
<p>A Tale of Two Cities</p>
<p>A Princess of Mars</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would like to see the following as the output:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, The</p>
<p>Art of War, The</p>
<p>Tale of Two Cities, A</p>
<p>Princess of Mars, A</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Any ideas please?</p>

<p>First, <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.split" rel="nofollow"><code>split</code></a> off the first word:</p>
<pre><code>first, rest = title.split(None, 1)
</code></pre>
<p>Now, check if the first word is an article:</p>
<pre><code>if first in {'A', 'An', 'The'}:
</code></pre>
<p>And, if so, move it to the end:</p>
<pre><code>    return rest + ', ' + first
</code></pre>
<hr/>
<p>Putting it all together:</p>
<pre><code>def fix_title(title):
    first, rest = title.split(None, 1)
    if first in {'A', 'An', 'The'}:
        return rest + ', ' + first
    return title
</code></pre>
<hr/>
<p>If you want to be able to handle blank lines properly, you need a bit more logic, and I think in this case it reads better with <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.partition" rel="nofollow"><code>partition</code></a> instead of <code>split</code>. Just change the two lines in the middle to:</p>
<pre><code>    first, _, rest = title.partition(' ')
    if first in {'A', 'An', 'The'} and rest:
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Do you just want a function that fixes a single title, or do you want a function to transform the whole input? And, if the latter, is the input a list of strings, one big string with newlines, a text file, â€¦? And are those blank lines in the input actually empty strings/lines that have to be left alone?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@abarnert I can do the actual implementation myself.  I just couldn't figure out  the actual code necessary.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I like this because it can handle times when there is no definite article in the string.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">'An' or 'A' is not a definite article</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Spaceghost: True, they're <i>indefinite</i> articles. But that really belongs as a comment on the question; the OP clearly wants <code>'A'</code> and <code>'An'</code> to be moved, he just used the wrong wording in asking for it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You are right.. I was responding after I saw it (again) in the comment .  I did not mean to suggest the answer was wrong.</span>
