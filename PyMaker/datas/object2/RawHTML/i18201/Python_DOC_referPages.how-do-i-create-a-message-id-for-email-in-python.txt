<p>I would like to add a unique <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2822.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">RFC2822</a> compliant <code>Message-ID</code> header to a message created using <a href="https://docs.python.org/library/email.util.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python's built in <code>email</code> library</a>. How would I got about doing this? Is there a way within the library itself?</p>

<p>This might help:</p>
<pre><code>from email.utils import make_msgid 
make_msgid()
