<p>Because <code>number</code> is an integer. Turn it into a string too:</p>
<pre><code>print('Good Job, ' + myName + '!  You guessed my number ' + str(number) + ' in ' + guessesTaken + ' guesses!')  
</code></pre>
<p>However, it'd be much better to use <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.format"><code>str.format()</code> string formatting</a>:</p>
<pre><code>print('Good Job, {0}!  You guessed my number {1} in {2} guesses!'.format(
    myName, number, guessesTaken))
</code></pre>
<p>String formatting converts inputs for you; see the <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#formatstrings">Format String Syntax documentation</a> for more details on what formatting options you have.</p>

<p><code>number</code> is an integer. You can't add integers and strings, as <em>the error message you received almost certainly told you.</em></p>
<p>Convert it to a string using <code>str(number)</code>.</p>

<p>The problem is that <code>number</code> is an integer. As the error message you received stated, you can't add integers and strings together.</p>
<p>You can convert it into a string using <code>str(number)</code> like I have done below.</p>
<p>This is what it should be:</p>
<pre><code>print('Good Job, ' + myName + '!  You guessed my number ' + str(number) + ' in ' + guessesTaken + ' guesses!')

<span class="comment-copy">Welcome to Stack Overflow. Please read the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/tour">About</a> page soon. To show code properly, enter (copy'n'paste) it into the question, then use the <b><code>{}</code></b> button above the edit box to indent so it looks like code. With a question like this, it is helpful to annotate which is line 31 (though I see your question, as opposed to the title, does identify the line more clearly). It is also helpful to show the exact error message you are getting.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Also, as a matter of style, it would be better to replace that line with <code>print('Good Job, {}!  You guessed my number {} in {} guesses!',format(myName, number, guessesTaken)</code>. You don't need the <code>str</code> this way.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@sweeneyrod: Way ahead of you.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why doesn't it have to be that way in this line?     print('I am sorry.  The number I was thinking of was ' + number + ' Thanks for playing, though.')</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Because the line just before it replaced <code>number</code> with <code>str(number)</code>.</span>
