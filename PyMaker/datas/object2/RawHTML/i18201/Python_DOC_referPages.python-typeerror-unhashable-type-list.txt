<p>i'm reciving the following error in my program:

</code></pre>
<p>The program is meant to do an adjacency list which works fine and then proceed to search if there is a path between vertex va and vb. I used a dictionary of lists in collection/defaultdict so i can properly append adjacent vertex.</p>
<p>The problem is in the if clauses after the list is created at the end of the program. I can't find a way to properly use the if clauses with the dict to find if there is a valid path between vertex. Also grafo is a graph class.</p>
<p>Here is the code:</p>
<pre><code>class graph:
    v = 0
    a = 0
    node = []

class vertex:
    ta = []
    adj = {}

def caminhografo(grafo, va, vb):
    vat = defaultdict(list)
    i = 0
    a = 0
    z = 0
    vo = int(va)
    vq = int(vb)
    vz = int(va)
    vw = int(vb)
    x = len(grafo.node)
    if vz &lt; vw:
        for vz in range (vw+1):
            a = 0
            x = len(grafo.node)
            for a in range (x):
                if [int(vz),int(a)] in grafo.node:
                    vat[vz].append(a)                   
    if vz &gt; vw:
        while vz &gt; vw:
            a = 0
            x = len(grafo.node)
            for a in range (x):
                if[int(va),int(a)] in grafo.node:
                    vat[vz].append(a)
            vz = vz - 1
    a = 0
    x = len(grafo.node)
    print(vat)

<p>The problem is that you can't use a <code>list</code> as the key in a <code>dict</code>, since <code>dict</code> keys need to be immutable. Use a tuple instead.</p>
<p>This is a list:</p>
<pre><code>[x, y]
</code></pre>
<p>This is a tuple:</p>
<pre><code>(x, y)
</code></pre>
<p>Note that in most cases, the <code>(</code> and <code>)</code> are optional, since <code>,</code> is what actually defines a tuple (as long as it's not surrounded by <code>[]</code> or <code>{}</code>, or used as a function argument).</p>
<p>You might find <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#tuples-and-sequences">the section on tuples in the Python tutorial</a> useful:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Though tuples may seem similar to lists, they are often used in different situations and for different purposes. Tuples are <strong>immutable</strong>, and usually contain an heterogeneous sequence of elements that are accessed via unpacking (see later in this section) or indexing (or even by attribute in the case of namedtuples). Lists are mutable, and their elements are usually homogeneous and are accessed by iterating over the list.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And in the section on <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries">dictionaries</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unlike sequences, which are indexed by a range of numbers, dictionaries are indexed by keys, which can be any immutable type; strings and numbers can always be keys. <strong>Tuples can be used as keys if they contain only strings, numbers, or tuples; if a tuple contains any mutable object either directly or indirectly, it cannot be used as a key. You can’t use lists as keys</strong>, since lists can be modified in place using index assignments, slice assignments, or methods like append() and extend().</p>
</blockquote>
<hr/>
<p>In case you're wondering what the error message means, it's complaining because there's no built-in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function">hash function</a> for lists (by design), and dictionaries are implemented as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table">hash tables</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The hash() is a built-in python method, used to return a unique number . This can be applied to any user-defined object which won’t get changed once initialized. This property is used mainly in dictionary keys .</p>
<p>TypeError: <a href="http://net-informations.com/python/iq/unhashable.htm" rel="nofollow noreferrer">unhashable type</a>: 'list' usually means that you are trying to use a list as an hash argument. This means that when you try to hash an unhashable object it will result an error.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Is the tuple considered part of the dict list, or it's also the key? as the program is completely ignorning the ifs as if they were always false.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Rex I don't think I understand your question. If you use a tuple as key, then it will be the key, just like any other key. <code>(some, tuple) in some_dict</code> should work, assuming <code>(some, tuple)</code> is actually a key in <code>some_dict</code>. Make sure your actually added the keys you think you added. It may be better to play around with simpler dictionaries in the interpreter if you're having trouble understanding how they work.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">So the tuple will be read just as keys? If i'm looking for (key1, element_in_key) it won't work?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Rex The easiest way to answer your questions is probably to try things in the Python interpreter. The short version is, if you store a key like, <code>some_dict[key] = something</code>, then <code>key in some_dict</code> will be true. It doesn't matter what the key is (as long as it's hashable).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">So by using a dictionary of lists, i block myself from getting list values from the keys in the if? In that case, my if will never be true in any case because i'm looking for a mutable variable? So it's better to use another format to store the adjacency of the vertex.</span>
