<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I use the following code to parallelize my image processing function:</p>
<pre><code>from dask.distributed import Client
from dask.distributed import progress

def processImage(image_in_path, image_out_path)
    im = read_image(image_path)
    im_processed = gradient(im)
    write_image(im, image_out_path)

client = Client()

in_list = list_image(dir_path)
out_list = ...
comp = client.map(processImage, in_list, out_list)
progress(comp)
</code></pre>
<p>As I'm using tqdm in my code already, and I like its features, is it possible to use it to draw the progress of such computation?</p>
<p>I've see <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/44484119/5547936">this post</a> linking to a <a href="https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm/pull/279" rel="nofollow noreferrer">tqdm pull request</a>, but I think it is for the dask local, not the dask distributed. So it is not made for the distributed interface. Or maybe I'm missing something...</p>
<p>I went a bit in the code of dask progress, but it is unclear to me how I could plug tqdm to it...</p>
<p>Any solution ?</p>
<p>Thanks a lot </p>

<p>As you suggest, you could implement a tqdm progress bar in the same way that dask's <code>progress</code> function is implemented.  You would probably want to use the <code>feed</code> route to get a feed of updates as work completes.</p>
