<p>You can see I tried on python and powershell, for some reason PS eats 2 to 3 letters.
Of course I get Syntax Errors on python so it's not visual.</p>
<p>Pasting it to sublime doesn't cut any letters off.</p>

<p>From which Program are you doing your copy?</p>
<p>Which Version of Powershell you are trying?</p>
<p>Maybe there are some whitespaces or tabes in your Copy &amp; Paste?</p>
<pre><code>test = '''
import numpy
import time
import datetime
import os
import sys
import random
import threading
'''
</code></pre>
<p>Tried it in Pycharm and then copied in Powershell:</p>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VfRSz.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer">enter image description here</a></p>
<p>Powershell is Version 5.1.17763.316</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Can be that it is depending on the latest Update. Or maybe the encoding settings of your Page are different? I was copying from UTF-8</span>
