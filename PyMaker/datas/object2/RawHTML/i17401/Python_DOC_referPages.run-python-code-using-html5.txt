<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Basically I want to create a sexy GUI using HTML5 then call code that I wrote in python. I have just discovered some tutorials about web2py, however I am getting the videos now from youtube so I can only watch when I get home. (Life of a student with no internet at home).</p>
<p>So basically I have written a python script, now I want to use a webpage to interact with that script instead of terminal as I have been doing. So I have a webpage provide me the GUI to my python app.</p>
<p>Hope this makes more sense.</p>
<p>Any help and direction will be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>

<p>You need to flip that around, you want to run server-side python code that renders your sexy HTML5 GUI. There are many Python frameworks that are suitable to this, including <a href="http://www.web2py.com/">web2py</a>, <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com">django</a>, and my personal favorite <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">flask</a>.</p>
<p>Any of these frameworks will let your python code run, then render the HTML with python variables/functions available by using a templating engine (for example Flask uses <a href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/">Jinja</a> template). Tutorials are readily available for all of these python libraries, but if you want to take a look at Flask, I can recommend <a href="http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world">Miguel Grinberg's excellent tutorial series.</a></p>

<span class="comment-copy">I have never used web2py but Flask and Bottle are 2 frameworks that are pretty lightweight and easy to learn.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Have you seen <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/howto/webservers.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this</a> page in the docs?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Having a look now. Thank you!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you very much. Makes more sense now! Much appreciated.</span>
