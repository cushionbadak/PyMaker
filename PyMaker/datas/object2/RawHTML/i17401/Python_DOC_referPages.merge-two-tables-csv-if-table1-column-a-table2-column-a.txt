<p>I have two CSV's, openable in Numbers or Excel, structured:<br/>
<code>| word | num1 |</code><br/>
 and<br/>
<code>| word | num2 |</code></p>
<p>if the two words are equal (like they're both 'hi' and 'hi') I want it to become:<br/>
<code>| word | num1 | num2 |</code></p>
<p>here are some pictures: </p>
<p><img alt="table1" src="https://i.imgur.com/orYuvCO.png"/>
<img alt="table2" src="https://i.imgur.com/wWSHXJJ.png"/></p>
<p>So like for row 1, since both the words are the same, 'TRUE', I want it to become something like<br/>
<code>| TRUE | 5.371748 | 4.48957 |</code></p>
<p>Either through some small script, or if there's some feature/ function I'm overlooking.<br/>
Thanks!</p>

<p>Use a dict:</p>
<pre><code>with open('file1.csv', 'rb') as file_a, open('file2.csv', 'rb') as file_b:
    data_a = csv.reader(file_a)
    data_b = dict(csv.reader(file_b))  # &lt;-- dict
    with open('out.csv', 'wb') as file_out:
        csv_out = csv.writer(file_out)
        for word, num_a in data_a:
            csv_out.writerow([word, num_a, data_b.get(word, '')])  # &lt;-- edit

<p>For <code>csv</code>, I always reach for the data analysis library <code>pandas</code>. <a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/" rel="nofollow">http://pandas.pydata.org/</a></p>
<pre><code>import pandas as pd

df1 = pd.read_csv('file1.csv', names=['word','num1'])
df2 = pd.read_csv('file2.csv', names=['word','num2'])
df3 = pd.merge(df1, df2, on='word')
df3.to_csv('merged_data.csv')

<p>I think what you're looking for is <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#zip" rel="nofollow"><code>zip</code></a>, to let you iterate the two CSVs in lock-step:</p>
<pre><code>with open('file1.csv', 'rb') as f1, open('file2.csv', 'rb') as f2:
    r1, r2 = csv.reader(f1), csv.reader(f2)
    with open('out.csv', 'wb') as fout:
        w = csv.writer(fout)
        for row1, row2 in zip(r1, r2):
            if row1[0] == row2[0]:
                w.writerow([row1[0], row1[1], row2[1]])
</code></pre>
<p>I'm not sure what you wanted to happen if they're <em>not</em> equal. Maybe insert both rows, like this?</p>
<pre><code>            else:
                w.writerow([row1[0], row1[1], ''])
                w.writerow([row2[0], '', row2[1]])
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">On the right track, but it's putting a comma between <i>each and every</i> character. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/kUJ1gFR.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer">See?</a>. What should I change?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Oops! There were a pair of brackets missing. Please see my edit.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That works almost perfectly. Is there anyway to add words to the dict that <i>don't</i> exist in both csv's? For instance lets say there is a word in the first csv that isn't in the second, can you add just the word and the number from the first csv, leaving the third column blank?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Please see my newest edit.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That <i>almost</i> works. The thing is my first two csv files aren't 'synced'... End up with problems like <a href="http://i.imgur.com/lJHKI41.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this</a> (notice the double entry of '100%').</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@AndrewSB: You need to explain what you actually want to do. Give us some (small) sample input and the expected output, explaining anything that isn't obvious.</span>
