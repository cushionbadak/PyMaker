<p>I have to define a function named introduce(). It asks for the name of a person twice, and then introduce each of the two people to the other. The function introduce() takes one string parameter</p>
<p>for instance it would say:
What is your name?
John</p>
<p>And What is your name? Mike</p>
<p>it would then return: </p>
<p>John meet Mike,</p>
<p>Mike meet John </p>
<p>the code I have so far is </p>
<pre><code> def introduce(intro):
     1st = input('What is your name?: ')
     2nd = input('And what is your name? ')
     print(1st(input) 'meet' 2nd(input))
</code></pre>
<p>I would like to know what I am doing wrong, I am new to Python so I am not too familiar with some of the elements in it</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Among other things, variable names in Python (and most other languages) can't start with digits, so use <code>first</code> and <code>second</code>. </p>
<p>You're also doing some weird syntactical stuff in your <code>print</code> call, which definitely doesn't work. Once you assign the two variables, just print them out--there's no need to refer to the <code>input</code> function again. Just pass <code>first</code>, <code>second</code>, and anything else as comma-separated arguments to the <code>print</code> function:</p>
<pre><code>print(first, 'meet', second)
</code></pre>
<p>I <em>highly</em> recommend you work through some of the <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/" rel="nofollow">Python tutorials</a>. This is all really basic syntactical stuff; doing the examples there will likely help you out a lot.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>First, in Python, variable names cannot start with numerals, so try naming them <code>first</code> and <code>second</code></p>
<p>Second, the <code>(input)</code> after the variables is unnecessary (and wrong). The variable name speaks for itself.</p>
<p>Third, separate your variables and <code>'meet'</code> with a comma, so they're printed with a space between them and automatically joined together. There are other ways, but this is the simplest</p>
<pre><code>def introduce(intro):
    first = input('What is your name?: ')
    second = input('And what is your name? ')
    print(first, 'meet', second)
    print(second, 'meet', first)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>first of all, you need to not start variable names with numbers.</p>
<p>the input is saved in the variable <em>1st</em>. You don't need to use <code>1st(input)</code>. Instead, you just `print(first)</p>
<p>Also, there is a problem with the way you join the strings. It can be done in two ways:</p>
<pre><code>#Method 1:
print(1st, 'meet' , '2nd')
</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code>#Method 2:
print(1st + ' meet ' + 2nd)
</code></pre>
<p>the difference is: a comma will add the space, whereas a space is required when using <em>+</em> (at least, they are the only differences you need to be aware of.)  </p>

<span class="comment-copy">Very few (?) programming languages might have variable names starting in a digit.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I guess you should read at least a bit of a <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python tutorial</a>; this is pretty basic stuff. Read the error messages you're getting, they will point you in the right direction (for example that <code>1st</code> is not a legal variable name)...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Unfortunately none of the answers thus far have said that you shouldn't be using <code>input</code>.  You should rather be using <code>raw_input</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@devnull The asker didn't specify a version, but <code>print</code> is being used as a function, so this may well be Python 3, which doesn't have <code>raw_input</code>.</span>
