<p>I was wondering if there was a way of telling if two numbers were both above 0. I was thinking of using an <code>elif</code> statement but I wasn't sure if that would work. </p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Use <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#boolean-operations" rel="nofollow">boolean operators</a> to test more than one condition, here the <code>and</code> operator does what you want:</p>
<pre><code>if x &gt; 0 and y &gt; 0:
    # x and y are both over 0.
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Just for fun, here's another method:</p>
<pre><code>if min(x, y) &gt; 0:
    # x any y are both over 0
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Ah, sorry, I meant if both were over 0</span>
<span class="comment-copy">And too obscure to make it past a code review. Just use <code>and</code>..</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is probably best if there are more than two items to check.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@TimPietzcker: true, if there are several values to test and they all have to be over 0, <code>min()</code> might be an option.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Just to be clear: I'd accept Martijn's answer, I've added this for fun (as mentioned in the answer itself).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for this! I might look into this if I ever want to vary my coding a bit.</span>
