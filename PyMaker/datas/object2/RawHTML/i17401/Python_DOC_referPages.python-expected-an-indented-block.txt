<p>I thought everything was properly indented here but I am getting an <strong>IndentationError: expected an indented block</strong> at the <strong>else:</strong> statement.  Am I making an obvious mistake here?</p>

<p><em>Do nothing</em> translates to using the <code>pass</code> keyword to fill an otherwise empty block (which is not allowed). See the <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#pass-statements" rel="nofollow">official documentation</a> for more information.</p>

<p>You need to put something inside the <code>if</code> block.  If you don't want to do anything, put <code>pass</code>.</p>
<p>Alternatively, just reverse your condition so you only have one block:</p>
<pre><code>if lower(letter) != vowel:
    new_string += letter
</code></pre>
<p>Incidentally, I don't think your code will do what you intend it to do, but that's an issue for another question.</p>

<p>You can't do this.    </p>
<pre><code>if (lower(letter) == vowel):

<p>Try: </p>
<pre><code>if (lower(letter) == vowel):
    #do nothing
    pass

<p>This can be caused by mixing tabs and spaces. However, this is probably caused by having nothing inside your if statement. You can use "pass" as a placeholder (see example below).</p>
<pre><code>    if condition:
        pass
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">For empty blocks you should use <code>pass</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">In case you already knew that you had to put something in the <code>if</code> block and thought that you hadâ€¦ a comment isn't a statement. It's simplest to think of it as if comments get removed before the code gets parsed.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Nice tutorial link for further explanation.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">To be fair, there are no tabs in the example. +1 for <code>pass</code>, though.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yeh, I jumped the gun a bit, I've amended my answer accordingly :)</span>
