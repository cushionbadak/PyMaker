<p>In my python script, I do the following:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; x = 0123456
</code></pre>
<p>However, when I print this, it comes out as this:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; x = 0123456
&gt;&gt;&gt; print x
42798
</code></pre>
<p>Does this have to do with the zero in front? Or is it just my computer?</p>

<p>A number literal starts with 0 is considered as an octal number. You can realize it like this</p>
<pre><code>print int("123456", 8)   # 42798
</code></pre>
<p>Here we asked <code>int</code> function to consider the number <code>123456</code> as a base 8 number.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> that this will work only in Python 2.7. Because in Python 2.7, <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/reference/lexical_analysis.html#integer-and-long-integer-literals" rel="nofollow">octal numbers are defined like this</a></p>
<pre><code>octinteger     ::=  "0" ("o" | "O") octdigit+ | "0" octdigit+
</code></pre>
<p>But <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#integer-literals" rel="nofollow">in Python 3.x, this is changed to</a></p>
<pre><code>octinteger     ::=  "0" ("o" | "O") octdigit+
</code></pre>
<p>So, In Python 3.x this will be treated as Syntax error,</p>
<pre><code>x = 0123456
# SyntaxError: invalid token
</code></pre>
<p>If at all you are going to represent octal numbers in your code, you should do</p>
<pre><code>x = 0o123456    # Remember the o (for octal) after the first 0
</code></pre>
<p>This will work in both Python 2.7 and 3.x</p>

<p>leading <code>0</code> means it's being interpreted as an octal number. Octal 0123456 is 42798 decimal. Similarly, if you had <code>x = 0x123456</code>, you'd be printing out 1193046, because <code>0x</code> means it's a hexadecimal number.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Some of the sub-questions can be trivially self-answered: 1) To see if "it has to do with zero in front:" <code>x = 123456</code>; 2) To "verify it's not your computer" (<a href="http://ideone.com" rel="nofollow noreferrer">ideone.com</a>)</span>
