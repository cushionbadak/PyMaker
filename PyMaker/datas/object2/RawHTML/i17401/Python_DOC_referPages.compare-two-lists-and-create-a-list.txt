<p>I'm still trying to learn programming so please help me simplify this.  I'm trying to run something that looks through the indices in my list and if it finds a 1 returns "yay" (just for debugging purposes).  Here's what I have so far:</p>
<pre><code>def replaceValues(distList, indexList):

    for i in range (1,len(indexList)):

        if indexList[i] = 1
    return "yay!"
</code></pre>
<p>However, I get a syntax error whenever I run this, which underlines the 1.  Please help!</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Apart from incorrect indentation(fixed below), you are using <code>=</code> when you should be using <code>==</code>, and you left out a colon from your if statement.</p>
<p><code>=</code> is used to assign values</p>
<p><code>==</code>  evaluates equality(returning a boolean i.e <code>True</code> or <code>False</code>)</p>
<p>You left out a <code>:</code> in your if statement.</p>
<p>Corrected code:</p>
<pre><code>def replaceValues(distList, indexList):

    for i in range (1,len(indexList)):
        if indexList[i] == 1:
            return "yay!"
</code></pre>
<p>If you don't understand exactly how Python uses <strong>whitespace/indentation</strong> as an integral part of it's syntax/structure and other syntax basics, then you need to get on that i.e tutorials.. A quick google should turn up many. I recommend <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/cs101" rel="nofollow"><strong>Udacity</strong></a> or <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/python" rel="nofollow"><strong>Codeacademy</strong></a></p>

<p>There are <em>three</em> syntax errors that I see.</p>
<p>First, <a href="http://www.openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english2e/ch04.html" rel="nofollow">you're using the <code>=</code> sign (assignment) when you need <code>==</code> (comparison)</a>.</p>
<p>Second, you're missing a colon at the end of your <code>if</code> statement.</p>
<p>Finally, you <strong>must*</strong> have an indented block after your <code>if</code> statement.</p>
<p>All together, it should read like this:</p>
<pre><code>if indexList[i] == 1: # double-equals and colon
    return "yay!" # This must be indented to the proper level
</code></pre>
<p>You should really go have a look at the <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/" rel="nofollow">tutorials</a>; this is all stuff that's laid out very well there, and it's all critical to doing pretty much anything in Python.</p>
<hr/>
<p><sub>*Technically, you can also follow an <code>if</code> statement with an expression on the same line (e.g. <code>if 1: pass</code>). However, I personally think this is hideous in almost every case.</sub></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>=</code> is an assignment statement.  Example:</p>
<p><code>name = "tyler"</code></p>
<p>You should use <code>==</code> to check for equality of primitives (you're comparing integers, which are primitives). </p>
<hr/>
<p>Switch :</p>
<p><code>if indexList[i] = 1</code></p>
<p>to:</p>
<p><code>if indexList[i] == 1</code></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Try it like this:</p>
<pre><code>def replaceValues(distList, indexList):
    for k in range(1, len(indexList)):
        if indexList[k] == 1:            
            return "yay!"

<span class="comment-copy">Python is indentation-sensitive. You have to indent it. Please refer to a starting python tutorial.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sorry, I fixed the indentation.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The privous comments should fix your issue. Otherwise, post the error information.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Look at this as you are not using equality.  <a href="http://docs.python.org/2.3/ref/comparisons.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/2.3/ref/comparisons.html</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user3288734 if this is the indentation, it will ALWAYS return <code>"yay!"</code>, not just if you find a <code>1</code>. You'd have to include your <code>return</code> in the <code>if</code> block by indenting it as well. Running the code above will end up with a <code>SyntaxError</code> because you don't have a <code>:</code> after your <code>if</code> block, and then a <code>SyntaxError</code> expecting an indented block after the <code>if</code> block :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">To your final note: I do a lot of <code>try: statement; except: block</code> lines. Generally when I'm trying something it's <code>int(foo)</code> or <code>os.remove(file)</code> or etc. A single line of stuff to try, then a block of stuff in case it goes wrong. I use it only occasionally on <code>if</code>s, and always when I'd rather be using a switch/case ;-)</span>
