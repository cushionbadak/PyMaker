<p>I would like to find if last character of a string is <code>.</code>. I know that it is easier to find using <code>$</code> in <code>re</code>. However, is there a easy way to find <code>.</code> without <code>re</code>? Also is <code>re</code> faster than other string manipulation modules?</p>
<pre><code>string1 = "this is a string1."
string2 = "this is a string2."
string3 = "this is a string3."
</code></pre>
<p>The string always contain <code>.</code> at the last only.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Use <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes#str.endswith" rel="nofollow"><code>str.endswith</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; string1 = "this is a string1."
&gt;&gt;&gt; string1.endswith('.')
True

&gt;&gt;&gt; string4 = "this is a string1?"
&gt;&gt;&gt; string4.endswith('.')
False
</code></pre>
<p>According to <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/howto/regex.html" rel="nofollow">Regular expression HOWTO - Python documentation</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Regular expression patterns are compiled into a series of bytecodes
  which are then executed by a matching engine written in C. For
  advanced use, it may be necessary to pay careful attention to how the
  engine will execute a given RE, and write the RE in a certain way in
  order to produce bytecode that runs faster.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Thank you. Solved the problem.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@sundar_ima, Faster-or-not cannot be answered absolutely. It depends on the pattern used / regular expression, string implementation. Try timeit yourself for that.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@sundar_ima, According to <a href="http://ideone.com/hPTJkK" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this benchmark</a>, <code>str.endswith</code> is faster than the regular expression <code>\.$</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you the explanation too. :-)</span>
