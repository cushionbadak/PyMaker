<p>I am following the <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/howto/curses.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Curses programming HowTo on the Python site</a>, but I am running into a rather bizarre issue.</p>
<p>My code is currently very short, doesn't actually do anything <strong>because</strong> of this error, I haven't been able to move on. Here's my code:</p>
<pre><code>import curses
#from curses import wrapper

stdscr = curses.initscr()
curses.noecho()
curses.cbreak()

stdscr.keypad(True)

def main(stdscr):

    begin_x = 20; begin_y = 7
    height = 5; width = 40
    win = curses.newwin(height, width, begin_y, begin_x)

    stdscr.refresh()
    stdscr.getkey()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    wrapper(main)
</code></pre>
<p>and the Traceback:</p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "curses.py", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
    import curses
  File "/home/nate/Documents/Programming/Python/curses.py", line 4, in &lt;module&gt;
    stdscr = curses.initscr()
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'initscr'
</code></pre>
<p>I commented out the <code>from curses import wrapper</code> because that was giving me another error,</p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "curses.py", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
    import curses
  File "/home/nate/Documents/Programming/Python/curses.py", line 2, in &lt;module&gt;
    from curses import wrapper
ImportError: cannot import name wrapper
</code></pre>
<p>but I suppose that would be another question.</p>
<p>I am following the tutorial word for word right now, to learn curses, but currently the only thing it's making me do is use curses directed at Python :P.</p>
<p>I am running Python 3.3.2 on Ubuntu 13.10, so <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13434514/python-curses-initscr-error">this question</a> has nothing to do with this, as he was using Windows and I am not (thankfully :D)</p>
<p>Why am I not able to do this? I'm copying it directly from the Python site, so you'd think it would work!</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You named your file <code>curses.py</code>, so Python thinks that file is the <code>curses</code> module. Name it something else.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>mv curses.py someOtherName.py</code></p>
<p>If you get the same error, try removing any <code>.pyc</code> files.</p>
<p>In this case it would be <code>rm curses.pyc</code>.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Oh of course...I can't believe I did that :P Thanks :D</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If the error persists, check for a <code>curses.pyc</code> file in the same folder, and delete it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for the answer, but this is essentially a duplicate of the one above. :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">kind of, but one may forget to remove the .pyc file .. in that case same error comes</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That is true. I was thinking you should have made this a comment, but you can't do that until you've got 50 rep.</span>
