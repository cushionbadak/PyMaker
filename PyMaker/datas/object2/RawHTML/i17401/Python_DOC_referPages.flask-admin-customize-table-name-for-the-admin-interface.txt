<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I like to change the name display at the top level menu of Flask-Admin. By default it seems he uses the calass model name. I like to change that for a more Human readable Name.</p>
<p>I've seen that in the "layout.htlm" template, there is a variable called <code>{{ item.name }}</code>. This is used to display the name of the menu. Is there a way to change that for another name or to surcharge the name in the model definition ?</p>
<p>Using <code>__tablename__</code> doesn't work and will break internal flask-admin. Is there an equivalent to <code>__repr__</code> but for table name instead of column.</p>
<p>Regards</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>BaseModelView</code> accepts an argument named <code>name</code>. If you provide a value, it will be used for display on the menu.</p>
<pre><code>from flask.ext.admin.model import BaseModelView

admin.add_view(BaseModelView(MyModel, 'Menu Text'))
</code></pre>
<p>If you are using SQLAlchemy:</p>
<pre><code>from flask.ext.admin.contrib.sqla import ModelView

admin.add_view(ModelView(MyModel, db.session, 'Menu Text'))
</code></pre>
<p>Here I've used positional arguments, but I could have just as easily done <code>name='Menu Text'</code> instead.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks a lots for your fast and clear answer. It works like a charm. Just another question. You said you use potisional arguments. I was unable to find where I can find the descirption of positional or named arguments that can be used with ModelView. You have an idea where I can find this doc (I'm using SQLAlchemy)?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You won't find a description in the Flask-Admin documentation. Positional vs keyword arguments is a <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-argument" rel="nofollow noreferrer">general Python concept</a>. If you need more, this question has been <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1419046/python-normal-arguments-vs-keyword-arguments">asked before</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hi again. My question was not about the difference between named and positional args. My issue is that I can't find in the flask-admin doc where I can find a description of positionnal or named args for the 'add_view' method of the ModelView class. (Sry for my english. My first comment was not enough clear.)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Did you try looking at <a href="https://github.com/mrjoes/flask-admin/blob/master/flask_admin/contrib/sqla/view.py#L243-L244" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the source</a>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yep that the kind of informations I was looking for. Many, many thanks for this answer. I thought this is the kind of info I can find in the <a href="http://flask-admin.readthedocs.org/en/latest/api/mod_contrib_sqla/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">API doc</a>. Do you think this is normal not finding those infos in the generated API doc ?</span>
