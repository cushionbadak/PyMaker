<p>Consensus seems to be that <code>requests</code> is by far the best option for making HTTP requests in Python 2.x. However, in Python 3.x <code>urllib2</code> has been "split into parts and renamed to <code>urllib.request</code>, <code>urllib.parse</code>, and <code>urllib.error</code>." Has it just been renamed, or has it had parts rewritten making it a decent alternative to <code>requests</code>?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The <code>urllib</code> and <code>urllib2</code> libraries have been cleaned up for Python 3, moving various disparate parts into a clear package hierarchy. The APIs themselves haven't changed all that much. It's mostly a tightening of the naming conventions.</p>
<p>You only need to compare the <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/urllib2.html" rel="nofollow">Python 2 <code>urllib2</code> documentation</a> with the <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.request.html" rel="nofollow"><code>urllib.request</code> page for Python 3</a> (with only exceptions moved to <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.error.html" rel="nofollow"><code>request.error</code></a>) to see that the basic functionality has not been updated.</p>
<p><code>requests</code> itself remains the better choice for handling your HTTP client needs in Python 3.</p>
