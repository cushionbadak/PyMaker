<p>Q = question</p>
<p>I want to access information from a csv file, for example if the file included:</p>
<pre><code>NAME|DATE OF BIRTH|PHONE NUMBER|

 xxx|yyyyyyyyyyyyy| zzzzzzzzzzz|

 xxx|yyyyyyyyyyyyy| zzzzzzzzzzz|

 xxx|yyyyyyyyyyyyy| zzzzzzzzzzz|
</code></pre>
<p>How would I ask a question, example:</p>
<p>(pseudo code)<br/>
what is the name of the person you are looking for? : </p>
<p>And for python to get the information and display it?</p>
</div>

<p>Without writing all your code for you...</p>
<p>Break your problem down into the different components you need to implement:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open" rel="nofollow">Read</a> a <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html" rel="nofollow">.CSV</a> file</li>
<li>Organize the data for retrieval (one or more <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries" rel="nofollow"><code>dicts</code></a>, keyed by each field you might want to use to look up records, is probably the simplest solution)</li>
<li>Get user <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input" rel="nofollow">input</a> ("ask a question")</li>
<li>Retrieve the requested data</li>
<li><a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print" rel="nofollow">Display</a> the requested data to the user</li>
</ul>
<p>Figure out (i.e. research) how to implement each of these individually, and then you can write your program to do that. If you then have a specific problem with a specific piece, come back to SO with the code you've written and explain the trouble you're having.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Yes, but how do i Organize the data for retrieval, that is my main problem as i know how to read a .CSV file                                   Okay thank you</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user3340683 How have you tried to organize it so far? Think about what fields (e.g. <code>name</code>, <code>date_of_birth</code>, <code>phone_number</code>) you might want to use to look up records. Then you can create dictionaries keyed off these fields, and look up the user input in the appropriate dictionary.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I am looking to use surname and dob</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Oh so i have now got Organize the data for retrieval but now i need to Retrieve the requested data which i cant find out to do</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ap306 Assuming you've got a dict called <code>data</code> and a requested name called <code>name</code>, you just use <code>data[name]</code>. Read the tutorial I linked above, or ask another question here on SO with a specific problem.</span>
