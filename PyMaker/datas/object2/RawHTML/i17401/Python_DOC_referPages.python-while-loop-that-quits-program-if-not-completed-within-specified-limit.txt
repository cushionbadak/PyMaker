<p>Adding an approximation of how I'd do it, in the absence of an example containing the problem.  <code>else</code> on a for loop will only execute if you did not break out of the loop.  Since you know the max number of times to run the loop is 3 you can just use a <code>for</code> loop instead of a <code>while</code> loop. <code>break</code> will still break you out early.</p>
<pre><code>for _ in range(3):
    if raw_input("Password:") == valid_passwd:  # really should compare hashed values (as I shouldnt have passwords stored in the clear
        print "you guessed correctly"
        break
    print "you guessed poorly"
else:
    print "you have failed too many times, goodbye"
    sys.exit(1)
# continue on your merry (they got the right password)
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>How about <code>sys.exit()</code></p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import sys
&gt;&gt;&gt; guess = False
&gt;&gt;&gt; if guess:
...     pass
... else:
...     sys.exit()
</code></pre>
