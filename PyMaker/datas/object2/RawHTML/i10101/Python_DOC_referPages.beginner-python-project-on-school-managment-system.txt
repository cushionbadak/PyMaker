<p>i am beginner in programming and just got the hang of python language.i am doing a small project on a miniature school management system using the class defined below.i need help in reading and writing these details into a csv file.i also want to know how to modify these details.i hope you would help me with this in python language itself.</p>
<pre><code>class student:

 def __init__ (self):
  self.adno=0
  self.name="null"
  self.m = [0,0,0,0,0]
  self.m[0]=0
  self.m[1]=0
  self.m[2]=0
  self.m[3]=0
  self.m[4]=0
 def inp(self):
  print "Enter the details:\n"
  self.appno=input("Enter the application number   :")
  self.name=raw_input("Enter the name                 :")
  print "\nEnter the mark for  \n"
  self.m[0]=input("English         : ")
  self.m[1]=input("Mathematics     : ")
  self.m[2]=input("chemistry       : ")
  self.m[3]=input("Physics         : ")
  self.m[4]=input("computer science: ")
 def out(self):
  print "\nApplication number :%d\nName :%s\n"  %(self.appno,self.name)
  print "\nMarks : \n\n"
  print "English        :  ",self.m[0]
  print "Mathematics    :  ",self.m[1]
  print "Science        :  ",self.m[2]
  print "Social Science :  ",self.m[3]
  print "Second Language:  ",self.m[4]

<p>Instead of using csv files, you can also use <strong>Pickle</strong></p>
<p>Saving a student:</p>
<pre><code>import pickle

file = open("student_record.pkl", "w")
pickle.dump(file, student_object)
file.close()
</code></pre>
<p>Loading a student's record:</p>
<pre><code>import pickle

file = open("student_record.pkl")
student_object = pickle.load(file)
</code></pre>
<p>You can also save multiple student classes in one file by putting a list into pickle.dump().</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Take a look at: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html</a>. Or, if you really want to start out with Python 2.7, at <a href="https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/csv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/2.7/library/csv.html</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">as i said before i am beginner i didnt quite understand the link content please would u make it simpler by coding the above program so that the datas are stored in  a TEXT file</span>
