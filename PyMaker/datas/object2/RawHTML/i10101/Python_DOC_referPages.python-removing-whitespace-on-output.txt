<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>So, I have this code:</p>
<pre><code>print("%d" % a, end=(" "))
</code></pre>
<p>It works, but in the output, there's a whitespace after the last number. I need to get rid of the last whitespace. My output needs to be shown on the same line, separated by a blank space. There should be no space after the last value.</p>
<p>Here's an example: (n is input, so suppose n = 5)</p>
<pre><code>0 1 1 2 3
</code></pre>
<p>I've tried .strip, .join, but none of them worked. What do i have to do to get the right output? I'm sorry if this is too much of a simple question, I'm new in python.</p>
<p>edit: edit2:</p>
<pre><code>a, b, i = 0, 1, 0
n=int(input())
for j in range(0, n):
    while i &lt; n:
        print("%d" % a)
        a, b = b, a + b
        i += 1
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You are adding the trailing space yourself with the <code>end</code> argument.</p>
<pre><code>print("%d" % a, end=(" "))
</code></pre>
<p>Means print <code>a</code> ending in a <code>' '</code>. Remove the <code>end</code> argument and the trailing space will no longer be printed (the default <code>'\n'</code> will be printed instead). See <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print" rel="nofollow">the docs for <code>print()</code></a> for more details. </p>
<p>Note also, that the <code>end</code> argument does not affect the string you are printing, i.e., <code>a</code> is not affected by <code>end</code>. If there is a trailing space in a string <code>a</code>, then <code>a.strip()</code> will remove that space. The reason it doesn't get removed by <code>strip()</code> in your case is that the space is not in the string you are printing, but instead is added to the visual output by the <code>print()</code> function.</p>
<h1>Update:</h1>
<p>It is hard to say, because it is a mystery what happens before or after the code snippet in your edit, but it sounds like you want to do something like:</p>
<pre><code>a, b, i = 0, 1, 0
n=int(input())
nums = []
for j in range(0, n):
    while i &lt; n:
        nums.append(str(a))
        ...
        # Based on your desired output, 
        # I assume you modify the value of `a` somwhere in here
        ...
print(' '.join(nums))
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">is <code>a</code> a list? Whats the input for <code>a</code>? Please, edit your question and add more information about your input in order to understand what are you looking for.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">what do you think <code>end=(" ")</code> does?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">See my updated answer. Also, please include all relevant code in your question to make it obvious what you are trying to do.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thanks, elethan! that was really helpful. its fixed  :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">but if i remove the end=(" ") my output is like</span>
<span class="comment-copy">+ one number each line</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Put the input values, converted to strings in a [ list ] then " ".join(list)</span>
