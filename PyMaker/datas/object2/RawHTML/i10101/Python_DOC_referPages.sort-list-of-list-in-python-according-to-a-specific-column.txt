<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have a list of lists that looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>l = [[1, 2, 3], 
     [3, 5, 4], 
     [9, 8, 7]]
</code></pre>
<p>I want to sort corresponding elements in each sublist so that the <em>middle sublist</em> would be in descending order, which would result in:</p>
<pre><code>l = [[2, 3, 1],
     [5, 4, 3], 
     [8, 7, 9]]
</code></pre>
<p>The second list is now descending: <code>[5, 4, 3]</code>. Essentially, I want reorder the vertical columns in that 2D representation. It seems like an easy task, but I had difficulties finding a solution.</p>
<p>So far I tried:</p>
<pre><code>from operator import itemgetter
sorted(l, key=itemgetter(1))
</code></pre>
<p>which didn't change anything and I tried</p>
<pre><code>print(l.sort(key = lambda row: (row[1])))
</code></pre>
<p>which gave None.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The attempts you made will sort by values in the second column, but you want to sort by values in the second row. So transpose the list, sort by column, then transpose back.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; l = [[1, 2, 3], [3, 5, 4], [9, 8, 7]]
&gt;&gt;&gt; transposed_l = zip(*l)
&gt;&gt;&gt; transposed_l.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
&gt;&gt;&gt; l = zip(*transposed_l)
&gt;&gt;&gt; l
[(2, 3, 1), (5, 4, 3), (8, 7, 9)]
</code></pre>

<p>Bonus tip: your <code>print(l.sort(...</code> approach printed <code>None</code> because <code>sort</code> doesn't return anything, it sorts in-place. So you should instead do <code>l.sort(...)</code> and then <code>print(l)</code>. Conversely, your <code>sorted(l, ...)</code> attempt didn't appear to do anything because it <em>doesn't</em> sort in-place, and instead returns a brand new list. I'm guessing you did <code>sorted(l, ...)</code> and then <code>print(l)</code> and were surprised to see nothing changed. You might instead do <code>l = sorted(l, ...)</code> and then <code>print(l)</code>. (although just using <code>sort</code> would be more idiomatic)</p>

<span class="comment-copy">@PatrickHaugh That's not quite right. reversed should be reverse</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Guys, this isn't a dupe (I thought so too).  What he wants to do is sort the columns of a 2d matrix by their values in the second row, descending.</span>
