<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; adf = "123 ABCD#"
&gt;&gt;&gt; df = "&lt;ABCD#&gt;" 
&gt;&gt;&gt; adf.strip(df)
&gt;&gt;&gt; '123 '
&gt;&gt;&gt; xc = "dfdfd ABCD#!"
&gt;&gt;&gt; xc.strip(df)
&gt;&gt;&gt; 'dfdfd ABCD#!'
</code></pre>
<p>Why does strip() take out ABCD# in adf? 
Does strip completely ignore "&lt;" and "&gt;" ?Why does it remove the chars when no "&lt;" and "&gt;" are there in the original string?  </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The method strip() returns a copy of the string in which all chars have been stripped from the beginning and the end of the string (default whitespace characters).</p>
<p>The characters that are in df, they occur at the end in the string adf. This is not the case in string xc where the first and last character are ! and d.</p>
<p>str.strip([chars]); =&gt; If any character in str occurs in chars at last or first index, then that character is stripped off from str. Then it again checks. When no character is stripped, it stops.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">why does it matter?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Consider <code>'www.example.com'.strip('cmowz.&lt;&gt;')</code> The characters used to strip are a set; any characters on both ends of the string are removed until they cannot be removed.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Would it kill people to read <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.strip" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the docs</a> before asking questions that are so trivially answered?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">does it ignore "&lt;" and "&gt;" part of df?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Since string adf did not contain "&lt;" or "&gt;" so it ignores them in this case.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thanks, in other words, strip() looks for individual char in [chars] and remove them from front and end of the string? correct?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Absolutely. If anyone of the char in [chars] occurs, it strips them off</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user3837980 so each <b>individual</b> char in <code>chars</code> is the catch.</span>
