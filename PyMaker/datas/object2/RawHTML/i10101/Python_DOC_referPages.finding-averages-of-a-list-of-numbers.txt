<p>I'm trying to get a sum of the numbers in the list and then find the average, round the average to 2 decimal places, and then print it.</p>
<p>I am receiving this error:</p>
<pre><code>TypeError: 'float' object is not callable

<p>How can I fix the error?</p>

<p>Your code is working fine on my machine.</p>
<p>But as a suggestion:
In Python 3.4 the statistics module was introduced, which enables you to do</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from statistics import mean
&gt;&gt;&gt; mean([1, 2, 3, 4, 4])
2.8
&gt;&gt;&gt; mean([49.99, 20, 155.20, 71.65, 91.07])
77.582
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">works fine here: 77.58. Hint: no need to convert average to float: it is already a float. and <code>sum_value</code> is not known.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Can't reproduce this issue. Aside from a NameError (<code>sum_value</code> not defined, assume you meant <code>sum_of_values</code>) the code runs as expected. Prints <code>77.58</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">how did you call your module? can you type <code>print(float.__file__)</code> / quit your IDE and restart to get rid of parasite remaining overrides of <code>float</code> you may have made before ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Maybe a <code>float = some value</code> before that. It's a common error for beginners.</span>
