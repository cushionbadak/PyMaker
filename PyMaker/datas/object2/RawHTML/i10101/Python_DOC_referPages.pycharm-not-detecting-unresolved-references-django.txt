<p>So I'm having a problem with PyCharm and can't find a solution for it.
It fails to recognize unresolved references: </p>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Jxo21.png" rel="nofollow"><img alt="example" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Jxo21.png"/></a></p>
<p>The image also shows that it fails to auto-complete <em>request.session</em>. It only happens with <em>.session</em>, it works with every other attribute.</p>
<p>Also, this image shows that it does detect unresolved references for other stuff:</p>

<p>I'm running it on a virtualenv, the interpreter is configured correctly and I have Django Support enabled.</p>
<p>Oh, and I'm using Python3 and Django 1.10.2</p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Just tried it with other projects. It doesn't work with Django 1.10.x but works with Django 1.9.x</p>

<p>Well, in your 1st example <code>request</code> is a parameter to the <code>dummy_view</code> function - how would Pycharm know what type it is in order to check unresolved references (or offer auto-completion suggestions)?</p>
<p>You could add a check for <code>request</code>'s type (also maybe a good idea to prevent bugs):</p>
<pre><code>def dummy_view(request):
    assert isinstance(request, ExpectedClassType)
</code></pre>
<p>Or, since you tagged your question with <code>python-3.x</code> you could also use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html" rel="nofollow">type hinting</a>:</p>
<pre><code>def dummy_view(request: ExpectedClassType):
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Should this be a bug report to PyCharm?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@JeffBridgman I'm not sure if it's a bug or if I'm missing something, since it was working fine yesterday.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm a loyal Jetbrains customer and they have outstanding official support channels.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@PauloScardine I'll head there then, thank you! :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It does know, it has Django support. It works perfectly on projects with earlier versions of Django. I'll type hint the parameter while this possible bug isn't fixed, thanks :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm not talking about Django support - which would matter but only if the variable type would be known (and can then be looked up in Django support), I'm talking about the <b>actual code context</b>. Use the <b>exact</b> same code when comparing with the earlier versions, not like you do in this question where you compare undefined reference checking in 2 different contextes: an unknown parameter (local variable) which can be anything vs. a known class instance.</span>
