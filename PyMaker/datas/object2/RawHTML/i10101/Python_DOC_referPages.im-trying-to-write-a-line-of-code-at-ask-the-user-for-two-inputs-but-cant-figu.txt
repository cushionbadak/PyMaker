<h1>Why does this line of code not split the two</h1>
<pre><code>Lat1,long1 = input("Enter the Lat and Long of the source point separated by a comma eg 20,30").split()
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>By default using <code>split()</code> will only split on a space. You are asking the user to enter two entries separated by a <code>,</code>, so you will end up getting a</p>
<pre><code>ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 2, got 1)
</code></pre>
<p>To resolve this, you need to split on the identifier you are looking to split with. In this case it is a ',', so call <code>split</code> as <code>split(',')</code>:</p>
<pre><code>Lat1,long1 = input("Enter the Lat and Long of the source point separated by a comma eg 20,30").split(',')
</code></pre>
<p>Demo:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; Lat1,long1 = input("Enter the Lat and Long of the source point separated by a comma eg 20,30").split(',')
Enter the Lat and Long of the source point separated by a comma eg 20,3060,80
&gt;&gt;&gt; Lat1
'60'
&gt;&gt;&gt; long1
'80'
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">where do you want to split?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If the user were to not split by a comma can you send back a response telling them invalid input?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You can use exception handling so that if your code can't split on <code>,</code> it can output to the user to ensure the input is "value1,value2".</span>
<span class="comment-copy">great, Thank you!</span>
