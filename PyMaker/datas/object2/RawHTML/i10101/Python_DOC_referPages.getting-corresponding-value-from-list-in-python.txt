<p>I have a list in Python and I would like to get the corresponding value. </p>
<pre><code>month_days = [('January', [31]), ('February', [28, 29]), ('March',[31])]
</code></pre>
<p>I would like to enter for example <code>Jan</code> and get the number of days as is in the list. </p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>send_days('March')

<p>I think you are looking for a <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_dictionary.htm" rel="nofollow">dictionary</a> instead of a list of tuples.</p>
<p>But with your current code you could use this: </p>
<pre><code>month_days = [('January', [31]), ('February', [28, 29]), ('March',[31])]


def send_days(m):

    for x in month_days:
        if x[0] == m:
            return x[1]

send_days('January')
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Assuming your list actually looks like:</p>
<pre><code>month_days = [('January', [31]), ('February', [28, 29]), ('March',[31])]
</code></pre>
<p>You can convert it into a dictionary:</p>
<pre><code>month_dict = dict(month_days)
</code></pre>
<p>and then query the dictionary with month names:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;month_dict['February']
[28, 29]
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>It sounds like what you are looking for is either a dictionary or a named tuple. You can read up on both <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/collections.html#collections.namedtuple" rel="nofollow">here</a></p>

<span class="comment-copy">Also if you wan't a look up feature, maybe look into <code>dictionaries</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">what did you try?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I just want to enter "March" and get 31</span>
