<p>I have a simple code, written to simplify fractions in python. Putting in certain numbers (Such as shown in the code) give huge, and possibly incorrect values. Below is the code.</p>
<pre><code>from fractions import Fraction
print(Fraction(36/40))
</code></pre>
<p>And it outputs:</p>
<pre><code>8106479329266893/9007199254740992
</code></pre>
<p>Why does it do this, and how can I fix this?</p>

<p>I believe that you intended to use <code>Fraction(36, 40)</code>.
Notice the comma instead of the slash.
What happens is that you input a division result instead of the numerator and denominator.</p>
<p>There are quite a few ways to init the Fraction. Take a look at the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/fractions.html" rel="nofollow">docs</a>. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">I'm going to guess it's just a floating point error? <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2100490/floating-point-inaccuracy-examples" title="floating point inaccuracy examples">stackoverflow.com/questions/2100490/â€¦</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Does the docs article you have linked contain info over / vs , and other related things?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It's right at the beginning. Basically you can initialize the Fraction with two integer numbers (which I suggested), another fraction, a float number (which was unintentionally your case), a decimal number or a string. String will actually just get parsed to two integers.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@DanielLaCour The difference is in which constructor is called. Since a comma delimits function arguments, with a comma, you're supplying 2 arguments. With a slash, you're supplying 1 argument, which is the result of division.</span>
