<p>Initially we don't know how many inputs we are going to take and input is given in the following format</p>
<pre><code>sam
edward
harry
</code></pre>
<p>so far i have tried using split() and splitlines()</p>
<pre><code>queryName = input().split('\n')
print(queryName)
</code></pre>
<p>It gives only ['sam'] and same result is for splitlines().
How can we take all those values as input?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input" rel="nofollow"><code>input</code></a> reads a single line of input. You need to read in a loop.</p>
<p>Here I assume an empty input (i.e. two newlines after another) means the end of input:</p>
<pre><code>result = []
while True:
    s = input()
    if s:
        result.append(s)
    else:
        break
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This will get all lines from standard input. That means it shouldn't be interactive because that never ends, e.g. it should be piped from a file or process.</p>
<pre><code>import sys
lines = list(sys.stdin)
</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively:</p>
<pre><code>for line in sys.stdin:
    # do something with line
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">How will you know when input is finished?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I am quoting the problem statement   " You will  be given an unknown number of names to query your phone book", and it is given in the format described above i.e one name each line</span>
