<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have some code which prints every possible letter combination for a word length of 3.</p>
<pre><code>letters = ["a","b","c","d","e","f","g","h","i","j","k","l","m","n","o","p","q","r","s","t"    ,"u","v","w","x","y","z"]
for x in range(0,26):
    for y in range(0,26):
        for z in range(0,26):
            print(letters[x],letters[y],letters[z])
</code></pre>
<p>This code works fine but if I wanted to see every 4 letter word, then I would have to add another for loop and the same for 5 letters and so on. </p>
<p>I am wondering how I can have a certain number of for loops depending on user input.</p>
