<p>So, I have this code that allows two inputs:</p>
<pre><code>a, b = input("Enter a command: ").split()
if(a == 'hello'):
    print("Hi")
elif(a == 'color' and b == '3'):
    print("Changing color to 3")
    #example, doesn't actually change color
elif(a == 'color' and b == '2'):
    print("Changing color to 2")
else:
    print("invalid command")
</code></pre>
<p>And the "color 2"/"color 3" thing works. However, typing "hello", as it's
a single word, gives me this error:</p>
<pre><code>ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 2, got 1)
</code></pre>
<p>So, how can I get around/fix this?
I hope this was formatted correctly and everything, thanks for taking the time to look at the question. I'm pretty new to python, so sorry if it's a simple fix.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you don't know in advance how many arguments there are to the command, then you can not use this construct:</p>
<pre><code>a, b = input("Enter a command: ").split()
</code></pre>
<p>You could try like this instead:</p>
<pre><code>a, _, b = input("Enter a command: ").partition(' ')
</code></pre>
<p>Or, may I suggest to use more verbose variable names:</p>
<pre><code>command, separator, arguments = input("Enter a command: ").partition(' ')
</code></pre>
<p>It will work for any number of arguments after the first 'command' word, because <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.partition" rel="nofollow"><code>str.partition</code></a> is guaranteed to return a 3-tuple.  </p>

<span class="comment-copy">Added a doc reference.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you, that worked!</span>
