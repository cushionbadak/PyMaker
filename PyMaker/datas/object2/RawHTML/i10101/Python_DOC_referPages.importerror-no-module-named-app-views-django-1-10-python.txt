<p>I just have started learning django in its 1.10 version. In a project (called <code>refugio</code>) I have created an app called <code>mascota</code>.</p>
<p>This is my views.py file for my app:</p>
<pre><code>from __future__ import unicode_literals, absolute_import
from django.shortcuts import render
from django.http import HttpResponse

# Create your views here.
def index(request):
    return HttpResponse("Index")
</code></pre>
<p>Also, I already have written my urls.py file for it:</p>
<pre><code>from django.conf.urls import url
from apps.mascota.views import index

urlpatterns = [
    url(r'^$/', index),
]
</code></pre>
<p>And I have modified the url.py file of my project:</p>
<pre><code>from django.conf.urls import url, include
from django.contrib import admin

urlpatterns = [
    url(r'^admin/', admin.site.urls),
    url(r'^', include('apps.mascota.urls')),
]
</code></pre>
<p>But when I run the server of my project, it sends me the next error message:
<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ww9EC.png" rel="nofollow"><img alt="enter image description here" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ww9EC.png"/></a></p>
<p>If it helps, My dir tree is the following:</p>
<p><code>REFUGIO
    apps
        mascota
            views.py
            urls.py
    refugio
        settings.py
        urls.py
    manage.py
</code></p>
<p>I know this is a dummy question, but I don't know what is wrong, I have already checked my urls sentences, but I see everything ok.</p>
<p>I will appreciate your help.</p>
<p>Ps.: My app is located inside a folder called apps.</p>
<p>Regards.</p>

<p>Every Python package need <code>__init__.py</code> file (read <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this</a>).</p>
<pre><code>REFUGIO
    apps
        mascota
            __init__.py
            views.py
            urls.py

        settings.py
        urls.py

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Change your file structure into </p>
<pre><code>REFUGIO

        urls.py
    refugio
        settings.py
        urls.py

<p>and then change the line in urls.py </p>
<pre><code>from apps.mascota.views import index
</code></pre>
<p>into </p>
<pre><code>form mascota.views import index

<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">That apps folder was created manually by you, right ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, I have created them manually, and also I have created the <b>init</b>.py inside the app folder</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Not sure if it's a typo, but your url <code>url(r'^$/', index),</code> can never match anything, since it expects a slash <code>/</code> after the end of the string <code>$</code>. It should probably be <code>url(r'^$', index),</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">My app already has the <b>init</b>.py file</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You have all files? <code>apps/__init__.py</code>, <code>apps/mascota/__init__.py</code> and <code>refugio/__init__.py</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">In fact, I have another project where I don't organize my project using an app folder and this project is working fine, but reading the "good practices", this say that it would be better if all my apps are located inside a folder called apps. That's the reason I organize my project in this way, but now I'm getting this error.</span>
