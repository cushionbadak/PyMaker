<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I want to assign column values of 2d array to a repetitive range.<br/>
For example, range will be from <strong>1</strong> to <strong>3</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>[1, 0, 0]
[2, 0, 0]
[3, 0, 0]
[1, 0, 0]
[2, 0, 0]
[3, 0, 0]
</code></pre>
<hr/>
<p>I have code:</p>
<pre><code>width, height = 3, 6 
array2d = [[0 for x in range(width)] for y in range(height)]

repRange = list(range(1,4)) #it is [1, 2, 3]

j = 0
for i in range(height):    
    array2d[i][0] = repRange[j]

    if j &gt;= len(repRange)-1:
        j = 0
    j += 1

for row in array2d:
    print(row)
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>
<pre><code>[1, 0, 0]
[2, 0, 0]
[3, 0, 0]
[2, 0, 0]
[3, 0, 0]
[2, 0, 0]
</code></pre>
<p>It fails. It started good, but in 2-nd repetition it failed. </p>
<hr/>
<p>What is wrong with logic? If there is a more simple approach, I hope you share it. </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The problem with your logic is that when you get to the end of the <code>repRange</code> you are setting <code>j</code> to 1 instead of 0. That happens because <code>j += 1</code> is after the <code>if</code> statement; the test in the <code>if</code> statement also needs to be adjusted. Here's a repaired version of your code.</p>
<pre><code>width, height = 3, 6 
array2d = [[0 for x in range(width)] for y in range(height)]

repRange = list(range(1, 4)) #it is [1, 2, 3]

j = 0
for i in range(height):
    array2d[i][0] = repRange[j]

    j += 1
    if j &gt;= len(repRange):
        j = 0

for row in array2d:
    print(row)
</code></pre>
<p><strong>output</strong></p>
<pre><code>[1, 0, 0]
[2, 0, 0]
[3, 0, 0]
[1, 0, 0]
[2, 0, 0]
[3, 0, 0]
</code></pre>
<p>Here's a more compact version.</p>
<pre><code>from itertools import cycle

width, height = 3, 6 
repRange = cycle(range(1, 4))
zeroes = [0] * (width - 1)
array2d = [[next(repRange)] + zeroes for y in range(height)]

for row in array2d:
    print(row)
</code></pre>
<p>And here's another:</p>
<pre><code>from itertools import cycle

width, height = 3, 6 
zeroes = [0] * (width - 1)
array2d = [[v] + zeroes for _, v in zip(range(height), cycle(range(1, 4)))]

for row in array2d:
    print(row)
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Have a look at the standard library module <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html" rel="nofollow">itertools</a>. The function <code>cycle</code> does what you want:</p>
<pre><code>from itertools import cycle
width, height = 3, 6 
array2d = [[0 for x in range(width)] for y in range(height)]
for l, i in zip(array2d, cycle([1,2,3])):
    l[0] = i
</code></pre>
