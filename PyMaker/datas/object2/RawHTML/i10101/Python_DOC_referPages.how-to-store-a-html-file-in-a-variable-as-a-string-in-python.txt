<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have html file and I want to store the contents of that file in a variable as a string value. I have tried this but it returns a blank string. How can I do this?</p>
<pre><code>def myfunc():
    str = ""
    with open("/home/suman/Alert_logo_report.html") as report_file:
        raw_html = report_file.readlines()
        str = ''.join(raw_html)
    return str
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Use <code>"""string_literal"""</code> instead of <code>"string_literal"</code> or <code>'string_literal'</code>. """string_literal""" is for multi line strings. This will work.</p>
<pre><code>def myfunc():
str = """"""
with open("employees.html") as report_file:
    raw_html = report_file.readlines()
    str = """""".join(raw_html)
return str
</code></pre>
</div>

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for reference but in that answer it stores value as a list but I want as a string. @RafaelOsipov</span>
<span class="comment-copy">use report_file.read() instead of readlines. This will read the entire document to a string.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I don't know why your code doesn't work.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Don't name a variable <code>str</code>. This shadows the built-in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-str" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>str</code> function</a>.</span>
