<p>I'm calling a method which run time is undefiniable.
I want to wait for it some second (for example 2 sec) and after then I want to step my program next.</p>

<p>I believe you are looking for the sleep function in the time module.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">use <code>time.sleep(s)</code> from <code>time</code> module. <code>import time; time.sleep(2)</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">What's the method? Maybe <code>time.sleep</code> is a valid solution, but it could cause race conditions.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You need to do a basic Google search before asking a question: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/time.html</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is actually a much more complicated question than everyone is treating it.  What you want to do is use <code>multiprocessing</code> or <code>threading</code> to start a child thread that executes the method.  You then want the parent to  kill the child if it hasn't returned a value after the allotted time.  This is not easy stuff.  Why don't you do some reading on those two modules and come back when you have more concrete questions.</span>
