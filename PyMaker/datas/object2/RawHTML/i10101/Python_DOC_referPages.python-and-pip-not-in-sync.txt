<p>I am working on a remote linux server with python 2.7.6 pre-installed. I want to <strong>upgrade to python 2.7.12</strong> (because I am not able to install some libraries on the 2.7.6 due to some <strong>ssl error</strong> shown below).</p>
<p>I downloaded and compiled from source and installed 2.7.12 and <code>python2.7</code> opens 2.7.12. However, I still get an update python version warning while using pip. It seems the pip has not synced with 2.7.12 and continues to serve 2.7.6 and I am not able to find other installations of pip in system.</p>
<p>I just want a working version of python2.7.x with pip/pip2/pip2.7 working properly.</p>

<p>Upgrade (and automatically reinstall) pip this way: </p>
<pre><code>/path/to/python2.7.12 -m pip install pip --upgrade
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>-m</code> flag loads the corresponding module, and in the case of pip will execute <code>pip</code> (thanks to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/__main__.html" rel="nofollow">the power of the <code>__main__</code> module inside the package</a>).</p>
<p>After installation, your current <code>pip</code> should also be up-to-date.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Alternatively, you could run </p>
<pre><code>/path/to/python2.7.12 /path/to/pip2 install pip --upgrade
</code></pre>
<hr/>
<p>NB: be wary about which <code>pip</code> and <code>python2</code> you're running: there'll probably be a <code>/usr/bin/python</code> and /usr/bin/pip<code>next to the ones you installed in</code>/usr/local/<code>. The ones in</code>/usr/bin` should just be updated following the standard system updates, if at all.</p>

<p>Thanks @Evert , just before looking into your solution I tried,</p>
<pre><code>curl -O https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
python27 get-pip.py
</code></pre>
<p>This fixed my issue and I was able to install libraries to <code>2.7.12</code> using <code>pip/pip2.7</code></p>
<p>I was earlier trying <code>python2.7 -m pip install package-name</code> and I was getting <code>pip not found</code>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Does that machine have openSSL? Most of the times, python gives this warning but still installs the packages. Is it able to install things into your system?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No, it isn't. I tried installing <code>sklearn</code> and it threw lots of exception and now it shows that it is installed. But sklearn is broken and not working.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Can you install urllib3, pyOpenSSL and openSSL and then try installing packages again?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ar7 I've seen this error, and if I remember correctly, it's an issue with an outdated <code>pip</code>, as the OP guesses. Upgrading <code>pip</code> is usually the solution.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I don't understand the paths in your error messages though: they seem to point to a recent pip version and a manually installed Python 2. That doesn't indicate Python 2.7.6 to me.</span>
