<p>I am very new to python and very much appreciate any help I can get! </p>
<p>I have created a class and I am hoping to combine two lists from a previous instance of the class with the same lists in the current instance of the class. </p>
<p>This is my current code: </p>
<pre><code>def merge(self, another_flu_tweets):
    self.another_flu_tweets = another_flu_tweets
    import self.another_flu_tweets 
    self.tweets = self.tweets + self.another_flu_tweets.tweets 
    self.labels = self.labels + self.another_flu_tweets.labels 
</code></pre>
<p>The error says no Module self.another_flu_tweets and occurs at the import line.  </p>
<p>I have ran a code to create an instance of the class and then input the name of that instance as the argument for the merge method. </p>
<p>Does anyone have suggestions for how I can reference a previous instance of a class in the current instance of a class? Any help is very much appreciated!!!</p>
<p>Currently using:</p>
<pre><code>another_flu_tweets = flu_tweets()
current_flu_tweets = flu_tweets()
</code></pre>
<p>and then I ran </p>
<pre><code>current_flu_tweets.merge('another_flu_tweets') 
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Pass the name of the instance without the quotations, as using quotations makes it a string which will complicate your code:  </p>
<pre><code>current_flu_tweets.merge(another_flu_tweets)
</code></pre>
<p>Once you've passed the name of the other instance to a method in your current class, you'll simply do:</p>
<pre><code>def merge(self, another_flu_tweets):
    self.tweets = self.tweets + another_flu_tweets.tweets 
    # or self.tweets += another_flu_tweets.tweets
    self.labels = self.labels + another_flu_tweets.labels 
</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html" rel="nofollow"><code>import</code></a> statements are used for <em>imports</em>; not sure of what you were expecting that to do.</p>
<p>The <code>self</code> reference on the other hand is a name (conventionally used) to refer to the current <em>instance</em> of the class within a <em>method</em>. So you would not need to set up an instance attribute that references the other instance i.e. <code>self.another_flu_tweets</code> is not needed.</p>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>import</code> is used to import objects from python packages (i.e. different files). What do you mean under "previous instance of a class"? Could you please provide more source code to show your logic?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm finding it difficult to understand what you are trying to achieve with this <code>import self.another_flu_tweets </code> line. <code>import</code> is for gaining access to code in one module from another. What exactly do you mean "a previous instance?" Do you still have a reference to that instance? Is it <code>another_flu_tweets</code>? If so, <code>self.tweets = self.tweets + another_flu_tweets.tweets</code> should work. That's what objects are for.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sorry I am still trying to get the terminology down. Basically I have created a class, that contains a list of tweets and a list of labels and I want to concatenate that with a list of tweets and labels from a current instance of a class I am working on.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Can you show us how you ran your code?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sorry I am still trying to get the terminology down. I have class flu_tweets  Then there is code that makes a list of tweets and a list of labels     def merge(self, another_flu_tweets): (With code from above) To test: another_flu_tweets = flu_tweets() current_flu_tweets = flu_tweets() and then I ran current_flu_tweets.merge('another_flu_tweets') To try and import the list I needed. I was hoping to be able to concatenate the lists of tweets and labels from the two instances of the class.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you! This was actually what I tried first but I get an error saying, "AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'tweets'" Do you know how I can avoid this error?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You're passing the name as a string. Remove the quotations <code>''</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Actually it was an error in how I input my argument! This works! Thank you!!!!</span>
