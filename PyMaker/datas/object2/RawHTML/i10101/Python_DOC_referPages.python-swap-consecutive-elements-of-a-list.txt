<p>I want to swap the consecutive elements of a list such that the first element will go to the last. eg <code>[4, 7, 3, 4, 3]</code> should print as <code>[7,3,4,3,4]</code>
This is the code I've written but it doesn't work right. How can I modify it to get it working?</p>
<pre><code>ls = [4, 7, 3, 4, 3]
i=0
b=1
while i+1&lt;len(ls):
    ls[i]=a
    ls[i]=ls[i+1]
    ls[i+1]=a
    i+=1
print ls
</code></pre>
<p>I do not want to just switch the first element with the last one. I want to modify this code further to create a bubble sort algorithm, I am just confused at how to get done what I just explained. </p>
<p>Updated : Thanks for the answer that I should change "ls[i]=a" with "a=ls[i]", but can someone explain to me how this differs in logic?</p>

<p>You don't need a loop to move the first element to the last. Just pop the first element off the list, then append it.</p>
<pre><code>ls.append(ls.pop(0))
</code></pre>

<p>Python allows to work with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html" rel="nofollow">lists</a> by selecting one or several elements at the time and to concatenate the content of the <code>list</code></p>
<pre><code>ls = [4, 7, 3, 4, 3]
new_list_with_first_element_at_the_end = ls[1:] + [ls[0]]
</code></pre>

<p>If you really feel you must, make a <code>swap</code> function:</p>
<pre><code>def swap(l, i, j):
    tmp = l[j]
    l[j] = i
    l[i] = tmp
</code></pre>
<p>Then you can:</p>
<pre><code>for i in range(len(l)-1):
     swap(l, i, i+1)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy"><i>"doesnt work right"</i>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Can you clarify "swap consecutive elements of a list"?  How is this swapping consecutive elements?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">it prints [7, 3, 4, 3, 8] instead of [7,3,4,3,4]</span>
<span class="comment-copy">swapping in pairs. eg the first element will swap with the second then the second with the third and so on</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Just change the first line in <code>while</code> loop to <code>a = ls[i]</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I know I can do that but i want to swap the elements one by one in pairs from left to right</span>
<span class="comment-copy">unless you pass an index, then it removes the element at that index.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@PatrickHaugh " list.pop([i]) Remove the item at the given position in the list, and return it. If no index is specified, a.pop() removes and returns the last item in the list. "</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@HogRider123 why?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">"i want to swap the elements one by one in pairs from left to right" ... er, no you don't. :-)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">In principle yes, but... did you try this?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yeah, you can only add a sequence and <code>ls[0]</code> isn't a list. Should be <code>... + [ls[0]]</code></span>
