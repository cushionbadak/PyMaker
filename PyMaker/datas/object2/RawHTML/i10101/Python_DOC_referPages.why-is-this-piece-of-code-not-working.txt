<p>I am currently doing a project for school in which I am supposed to make a dice game. Here is the code:</p>
<pre><code>Roll = input("Do you want to Roll or Stick?")
if Roll in ("Roll" , "roll"):
    print("Your new numbers are," , +number10 , +number20 , +number30 , +number40 , +number50)

KeepDelete = input("Would you like to keep or delete a number?")
if KeepDelete in("Keep", "keep"):
    print("Your numbers are," , +number10 , +number20 , +number30 , +number40 , +number50)
print("Your final score is," , number10+number20+number30+number40+number50)
if KeepDelete in("Delete", "delete"):
    Delete = int(input("What number would you like to delete?"))

if Delete == (number10):
    del(number10)
Score1 = int("Your numbers are" , number100 , number20 , number30 , number40 , number50)
print("Your final score is" , +number100 + number20 + number30 +number40 + number50)

if Delete == (number20):
   del(number20)
Score2 = int("Your numbers are" , number10 , number200 , number30 , number40 , number50)
print("Your final score is" , +number10 + number200 + number30 + number40 + number50)

if Delete == (number30):
    del(number30)
Score3 = int("Your numbers are" , number10 , number20 , number300 , number40 , number50)
print("Your final score is" , +number10 + number20 +number300 + number40 + number50)

if Delete == (number40):
    del(number40)
Score4 = int("Your numbers are" , number10 , number20 , number30 , number400 , number50)
print("Your final score is" +number10 + number20 + number30 + number400 + number50)

if Delete == (number50):
    del(number50)
Score5 = int("Your numbers are" , number10 , number20 , number30 , number40 , number500)
print("Your final score is" +number10 + number20 + number30 + number40 + number500)
</code></pre>
<p>Here is the error code:</p>
<pre><code>Score1 = int("Your numbers are" , number100 , number20 , number30 , number40 , number50)
TypeError: int() takes at most 2 arguments (6 given)
</code></pre>
<p>Sorry for such a long piece but I have been confused on this for about six hours. Any help would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Just taking a section of your code:   </p>
<pre><code>print("Your final score is," , number10+number20+number30+number40+number50)
if KeepDelete in("Delete", "delete"):
    Delete = int(input("What number would you like to delete?"))

if Delete == (number10):
    del(number10)
Score1 = int("Your numbers are" , number100 , number20 , number30 , number40 , number50)
print("Your final score is" , +number100 + number20 + number30 +number40 + number50)
</code></pre>
<p>int() casts the arguments to integer format.  The error message is telling you it takes two arguments: 1) the value to be converted and 2) the base.</p>
<p>So in:</p>
<pre><code>Delete = int(input("What number would you like to delete?"))
</code></pre>
<p>You're trying to cast the argument <code>input("What..."))</code> to an integer.</p>
<p>In the specific error message you're getting, you're trying to cast <code>"your numbers are"</code> and all of the subsequent variables to <code>int</code>, and pass that to the variable Score 1.  Python doesn't know where to start with that.</p>
<p>You can find more information at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html?highlight=int#int" rel="nofollow">Python Docs</a>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Did you mean <code>print(...)</code> and not <code>int(...)</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">- Lukasz Rogalski I typed in int() but have just realized it was wrong. Thank you for the help.</span>
