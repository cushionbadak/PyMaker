<p>You can do it line-by-line to avoid using more memory as the files get larger, and use regular expressions replacement with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.sub" rel="nofollow"><code>re.sub</code></a> to match numbers in different formats:</p>
<pre><code>import re

with open('infile.txt', 'rt') as infile:
    with open('outfile.txt', 'wt') as outfile:
        for line in infile:
            line_without_numbers = re.sub(r'\[0-9]*(\[0-9]*)?', '', line).strip()
            outfile.write(line_without_numbers)
</code></pre>
<p>I've also run <code>.strip()</code> on the string to remove the leading/trailing padding spaces for the numbers that have been removed.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You appear to have confused this with a code-writing or tutorial service. It's not.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I do not need a tut i only asked how do i remove numbers in the script,  so i am only left with names in the list and no numbers.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Oh! Then: you do it by writing some code. If you don't know how to write that code, you <i>do</i> need a tutorial.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Addison I have no problem with new users. However, I do object to users (of any experience) who ask bad questions. This shows no effort at all, and does not meet the guidance in <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/how-to-ask">How to Ask</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The guidance isn't a secret, indeed you're given links to it while writing a question. You have nobody to blame but yourself if you couldn't be bothered to read it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you it worked !</span>
