<p>I've been using bpython for Python 2 and now I want to use it for Python 3 as well.</p>
<p>However I've run into problems. The bpython documentation reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>bpython supports Python 3. It's as simple as running setup.py with Python 3.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I run the setup script it creates a build folder, but I don't know what to do from there? I want to be able to type <code>bpython</code> in the Terminal and run the bpython interface for Python 3.</p>
<p>I originally installed bpython with pip, that worked off the bat.</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/install/#standard-build-and-install" rel="noreferrer">Run <code>python3 setup.py install</code> command</a> (without <code>install</code> it only builds); You may need to prepend the command with <code>sudo</code>: <code>sudo python3 setup.py install</code>.</p>
<p>BTW, you can also use <code>pip</code>: <code>pip3 install bpython</code> or <code>python3 -m pip install bpython</code>.  </p>
<p>And if you pip-install bpython for both 2 and 3, then you can specify which version of Python to use for a given session by using either of the following two commands:</p>
<pre><code>python2 -m bpython
python3 -m bpython
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for helping a beginner out! I did manage to install bpython in my "python3.5/site-packages" folder. But how do I set up bpython to enable me to type "bpython" in the Terminal? There is no executable bpython script in the bpython folder that I can alias in my bash profile?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@timkl, If you installed the package using <code>pip</code>, issuing the following command will list all the files installed: <code>pip3 show -f bpython</code>. <code>grep</code> it <code>pip3 show -f bpython | grep bin</code> to list executables. Otherwise, check <code>bin</code> directories; maybe you need to adjust <code>PATH</code> environment variable if the <code>bin</code> directory in not listed in the <code>PATH</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The key for me was understanding <code>python3 -m bpython</code></span>
