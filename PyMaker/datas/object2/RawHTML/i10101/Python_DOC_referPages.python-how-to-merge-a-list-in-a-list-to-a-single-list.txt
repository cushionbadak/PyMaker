<p>I currently have a list like this:</p>
<p><code>[3, 4, ['x', 'y', 'z'], 5]</code></p>
<p>and want to make it to</p>
<p><code>[3, 4, 'x', 'y', 'z', 5]</code></p>
<p>New beginner at this, and tried searching around, but couldn't find anything I could understand.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>l=[3, 4, ['x', 'y', 'z'], 5]
nl=[]
for x in l:
    if not isinstance(x,int):
        for y in x:
            nl.append(y)
    else:
        nl.append(x)

print(nl)
</code></pre>
<p>One liner</p>
<pre><code>l=[3, 4, ['x', 'y', 'z'], 5]
nl=[];[nl.extend([x] if isinstance(x,int) else x) for x in l]
</code></pre>
<p>It is not flatening list of list because the given one is combination of list and int</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Just google <code>flatten list of lists in python</code>. Definitely a duplicate.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why doesn't your attempt to solve it work?  Maybe we can help with that.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">Your "one-liner" is an example of when NOT to use list comprehensions. Do not mix imperative techniques (mutating a data structure: i.e. <code>list.exend</code>) with functional constructs, i.e. list comprehensions. Also, it is generally considered unpythonic to use multiple statements per line, seperated by a semicolon, like that. Readability counts.</span>
