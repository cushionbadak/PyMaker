<p>My test is simple. I want to send two requests to two different servers then compare whether the results match.</p>
<p>I want to test the following things.</p>
<ol>
<li>send each request and see whether the return code is valid.</li>
<li>compare different portion of the outputs in each test method</li>
</ol>
<p>I do not want to send the requests in setUp method because it will be send over and over for each new test. I would rather want to send the requests at the initialization. (maybe in the <strong>init</strong> method). But I found a lot of people were against that idea because they believe I should not override the init method for some reason. (I do not know exactly why) If that's the case, where should I send the requests?
I am kind of against doing them in the class body (as shared variables).</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I'd personally send the requests in a test case.  You can still split up the checks on the result into several methods; just choose names that don't start with <code>test</code>, so they won't be called as test cases.</span>
