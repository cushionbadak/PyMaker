<p>This lines of my code </p>
<pre><code>    v_recorrido= [[4, 45], [4, 15], [4, 45]]      

    t=0
    for i in v_recorrido:
        seg = 60*v_recorrido[i][0] + v_recorrido[i][1]
</code></pre>
<p>are throwing me this error:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TypeError: list indices must be integers, not list</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why? I am new to Python (coming mainly from C++) but I have checked the documentation for the syntax and it seems to be right.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Python for loops are what is described in some other languages as "for-each" loops. That is, <code>i</code> in each iteration is not an index, but the actual element in <code>v_recorrido</code>. So:</p>
<pre><code>seg = 60*i[0] + i[1]
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>for i in v_recorrido:
    seg = 60*v_recorrido[i][0] + v_recorrido[i][1]
</code></pre>
<p>This is what is in some languages called a for-each loop, meaning the iteration variable takes on the <em>value</em> of each of the elements, not the index of the element. The error is because you are trying to subscript <code>v_recorrido</code> using its elements.</p>
<p>Change it to:</p>
<pre><code>for i in v_recorrido:
    seg = 60*i[0] + i[1]
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>In your example, i is actually a list item. In the first iteration it is equal to [4, 45], then [4, 15] and finally [4, 45].</p>
<p>What you might be looking for is to iterate over a range equal to the length of v_recorrido. Like:</p>
<pre><code>for i in range(len(v_recorrido)):
  ....
</code></pre>
