<p>I want this piece of code to print "second". </p>
<p>I tried these inputs
s1 = ".0" and s2 = "0.00"</p>
<p>Could anyone please explain in brief what "<code>if all(ord(c1) is ord(c2) for c1, c2 in zip(s1, s2)):</code>" means exactly?</p>
<p>I understand that it relates to string equality as well as comparing the ord() on strings and wanted to know how these are different.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any help.</p>
<p>PS : Please excuse the indentation. Python beginner here!</p>

<p>There's no 100% sure way of making that piece of code print second, since interning is an implementation detail.</p>
<p>CPython interns integers in the <code>[-5, 256]</code> range,</p>
<p>So you'll need a character that when it's passed to <code>ord</code> returns something &gt; 256.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; s1 = "asdሴ"
&gt;&gt;&gt; s2 = "asdሴ"
&gt;&gt;&gt; s1 == s2
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; all(ord(c1) is ord(c2) for c1, c2 in zip(s1, s2))
False
</code></pre>
<p><code>all(ord(c1) is ord(c2) for c1, c2 in zip(s1, s2))</code> checks if every <code>ord(c1)</code> has the same <code>id</code> as <code>ord(c2)</code>.</p>
<p>From the <code>id</code> <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#id" rel="nofollow">documentation</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Return the “identity” of an object. This is an integer which is guaranteed to be unique and constant for this object during its lifetime. Two objects with non-overlapping lifetimes may have the same id() value.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>CPython implementation detail: This is the address of the object in memory.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>In plain english, <code>if all(ord(c1) is ord(c2) for c1, c2 in zip(s1, s2))</code> means that ALL the values of <code>ord(s1[i])</code> and <code>ord(s2[i])</code> for <code>i</code> ranging from <code>0</code> to <code>len(s1 or s2)</code> (where <code>c1</code> and <code>c2</code> if the reference for <code>ord(s1[i])</code> and <code>ord(s2[i])</code>) is same for both the lists</p>
<p>Check <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#zip" rel="nofollow"><code>zip()</code></a> document. As per the document:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>zip()</strong> returns a list of tuples, where the i-th tuple contains the i-th
  element from each of the argument sequences or iterables. The returned
  list is truncated in length to the length of the shortest argument
  sequence</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; l1 = [1, 2 ,3]
&gt;&gt;&gt; l2 = [7, 8, 9]
&gt;&gt;&gt; zip(l1, l2)
[(1, 7), (2, 8), (3, 9)]
</code></pre>
<p>Now <code>[ord(c1) is ord(c2) for c1, c2 in zip(s1, s2)]</code> will return the tuple list of <code>True/False</code> value based on the condition <code>ord(c1) is ord(c2)</code> where <code>c1</code> and <code>c2</code> are <code>tuple</code> pair from the previous list of tuple returned by <code>zip()</code>.</p>
<p>Now the last part. if <code>all()</code> will return <code>True</code> if the list <code>[ ... ]</code> of <code>True/False</code> value mentioned above will be having all the values as <code>True</code>. In case any single item is as <code>False</code>, <code>all()</code> will return the value as <code>False</code></p>

<span class="comment-copy">You are having 3k+ reputation, but still you do not have proper indentation in the code. You should be knowing how to ask the question by now.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@anonymous: I haven't programmed in python so please excuse the indentation. For that matter ive even mentioned that in my question.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Aditya: It is independent of the language. When you paste the code here, shouldn't it be formatted. And in Python, scope is defined based on the indentation. Incorrect indentation means your code is good for nothing</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@anonymous: Thanks for the help..</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The question asks what that snippet means, not how to make it print a certain result.</span>
