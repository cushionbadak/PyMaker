<p>I've just started playing around with python lists, I've written the simple code below expecting the printed file to display the numbers [12,14,16,18,20,22] but only 22 is displayed. Any help would be great.</p>
<pre><code>a=10
b=14
while a &lt;= 20:
    a=a+2
    b=b-1
    datapoints=[]
    datapoints.insert(0,a)
print datapoints
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>a=10
b=14
datapoints=[]  # this needs to be established outside of your loop

while a &lt;= 20:
    a=a+2
    b=b-1
    datapoints.append(a)
print datapoints
</code></pre>
<p>You need to set up datapoints outside your loop, and then inside your loop, append each additional datum to datapoints</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Joel already answered but if you want a more compact code you can use range</p>
<pre><code>numbers = []
for number in range(12,24,2):
    # do whatever you want with b
    numbers.append(number)

print numbers
</code></pre>
<p>or if you only want to print the numbers you can do</p>
<pre><code>print [number for number in range(12,24,2)]
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>you can achieve the expected list as output by using the <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#range" rel="nofollow">range()</a> method. It takes three parameters, start, stop and step. </p>
<pre><code>data_points = range(12, 23, 2)  # range returns list in python 2
print data_points
</code></pre>
<p>Note that, in <code>python 3</code> the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-range" rel="nofollow">range()</a> is a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#range" rel="nofollow">sequence-type</a>. So, you will have to cast it to <code>list</code> in python 3</p>
<pre><code>data_points = list(range(12, 23, 2))  # python 3
print(data_points) 
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Well, you are setting <code>datapoints</code> to an empty list <i>in the loop</i>. I suggest you move the <code>datapoints=[]</code> line to take place <i>outside</i> of the loop.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Also, use <code>list.append()</code> if you expected numbers to be added at the end, which your expected output suggests you want.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Does <code>b</code> have a purpose?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Or if you want to prepend the numbers, use <code>collections.deque</code> so you can call <code>appendleft</code> and perform the prepend efficiently (<code>list</code>s only have efficient appends on the right, prepending is <code>O(n)</code>).</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>while</code> is often not that pythonic IMO for a case like this, consider using a <code>for</code> loop instead in combination with <code>range</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">cheers, I'm new to this and sometimes its hard to see the wood for the trees.</span>
