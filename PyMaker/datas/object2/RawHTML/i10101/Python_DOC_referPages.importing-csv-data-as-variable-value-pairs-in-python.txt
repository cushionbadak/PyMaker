<p>I'm trying to emulate the bash concept in Python to have data from a CSV as variable-value pairs. I've a CSV file, which can be made anyway as possible (its up to me). Currently it looks like this...</p>
<pre><code>Unit,pixels
AvgVol,87654
AvgLen,5432
</code></pre>
<p>and similarly a long list of values. If modifying the CSV will make it work, do suggest that too.</p>
<p>I'm trying to read these in such a way that I can access the values like <em>pixels</em> using <em>Unit</em> or <em>87654</em> using <em>AvgVol</em> without having to remember their index, similar to what <code>cat</code> or <code>source</code> would do in bash. Anyways, This is useful so that I can edit my CSV file with the list of variables and their values, without having to worry about their order or anything when referring to a particular variable for its values. I'll later use these for other computations so I can go like </p>
<pre><code>if AvgVol&gt;MaxVol:
   print 'something'
</code></pre>
<p>Any help is appreciated and I hope its doable without much complexity. Thanks!!</p>

<p>You can use the <code>csv</code> module to perform your task.</p>
<p>Here is an example:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat csvfile 
Unit,pixels
AvgVol,87654
AvgLen,5432
$ python3 script.py 
{'Unit': 'pixels', 'AvgLen': 5432, 'AvgVol': 87654}
</code></pre>
<p>and here is the python program:</p>
<pre><code>import csv

csvdict={}
with open('csvfile', 'r') as file:
    reader = csv.reader(file)
    for row in reader:
        csvdict[row[0]]=(int(row[1]) if row[1].isdigit() else row[1])

print(csvdict)
</code></pre>
