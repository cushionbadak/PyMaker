<p>I'm new to Python and I've been given the task to create a program which uses a text file which contains figures in Fahrenheit, and then I need to change them into a text file which gives the figures in Degrees... Only problem is, I have no idea where to start.
Any advice?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>First you'll need to create a Python function to read from a text file.</p>
<p>Second, create a method to convert the degrees.
Then, you will create a method to write to the file the results.</p>
<p>This is a very broad question, and you can't expect to get the full working code. 
So start your way from the first mission, and we'll be happy to help with more problem-specific problem.</p>

<p>I'd start making a python script file (a text file with *.py), and write an expression that <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html" rel="nofollow">opens</a> your text file. You'll need to do some operations on <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_strings.htm" rel="nofollow">strings</a> to get your lines of characters into a usable data structure (possibly a <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/courses/python-beginner-nzzVa/0/1?curriculum_id=4f89dab3d788890003000096" rel="nofollow">list</a> of floats).</p>
<p>Not required, but I also recommend you write a <a href="http://www.learnpython.org/en/Functions" rel="nofollow">function</a> that <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/8th-engage-ny/engage-8th-module-4/8th-module-4-topic-d/v/converting-farenheit-to-celsius" rel="nofollow">converts</a> your units because it will make your code more readable.</p>
<p>Finally, you'll want to convert your numbers back into strings that can be <a href="https://pythonprogramming.net/writing-file-python-3-basics/" rel="nofollow">written</a> to a file, and then of course <a href="https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex16.html" rel="nofollow">write</a> those lines to a file.</p>

<p>Hope this help!</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python
Fahrenheit = int(raw_input("Enter a temperature in Fahrenheit: "))
Celsius = (Fahrenheit - 32) * 5.0/9.0
print "Temperature:", Fahrenheit, "Fahrenheit = ", Celsius, " C"
</code></pre>
<p>The program asks for input as fahrenheit &amp; converts in to celcius</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Have you tried google? Find out how to read and write files. Start from there</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You also need to be more specific in your requirements. Just how is the input text file formatted with the figures: one per line, all in one line separated by spaces, other?</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><i>degrees Fahrenheit</i> into "degrees"?  What kind of degrees?  Kelvin, Rankine, Celsius?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You cannot convert <i>Fahrenheit to Degrees</i>. At all. You can convert <i>degrees Fahrenheit to degrees Celsius</i> and vice versa.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">This solution does not include file IO.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This solution takes user input, but the OP wants to load a text file, do math stuff, and write an output file.</span>
