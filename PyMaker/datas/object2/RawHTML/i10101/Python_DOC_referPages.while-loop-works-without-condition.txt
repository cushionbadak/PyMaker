<p>As far as I know, while statement requires condition to work, but here it works without any; how's that possible? How does <code>while q:</code> work?</p>
<p>The code is below:
...</p>
<pre><code>q = set([])
for i in range(N):
    q.add((i, 0))
    q.add((i, M - 1))
    w[i][0] = h[i][0]
    w[i][M - 1] = h[i][M - 1]
for i in range(M):
    q.add((0, i))
    q.add((N - 1, i))
    w[0][i] = h[0][i]
    w[N - 1][i] = h[N - 1][i]

while q:
    ci, cj = q.pop()
    for ii, jj in ((0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)):
        ni, nj = ci + ii, cj + jj
        if 0 &lt;= ni &lt; N and 0 &lt;= nj &lt; M:
            if w[ni][nj] != h[ni][nj] and (w[ni][nj] is None or w[ni][nj] &gt; w[ci][cj]):
                w[ni][nj] = max(h[ni][nj], w[ci][cj])
                q.add((ni, nj))
</code></pre>

<p>A <code>while</code> loop evaluates any expression it is given as a boolean. Pretty much everything in Python has a boolean value. Empty containers, such as <code>set()</code> generally evaluate to <code>False</code>, while non-empty containers, such as a set with at least one element, evaluate to <code>True</code>.</p>
<p><code>while q:</code> can therefore be read as "loop while <code>q</code> is not empty", i.e., "loop as long as <code>q</code> does not evaluate to boolean <code>False</code>".</p>
<p>As an aside, instances of any class you write will usually evaluate to <code>True</code>. You can modify this by implementing a <code>__bool__</code> method in your class that returns something else.</p>
<p>Also, <code>q = set()</code> works fine. No need for <code>q = set([])</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>There is a condition. 
The loop will iterate as long as there is an element in set q.</p>
<p>You would get a similar effect if you wrote:</p>
<pre><code>while len(q):
    # do something
</code></pre>
<p>or even</p>
<pre><code>while len(q) &gt; 0:
    #do something
</code></pre>
<p>However, these expressions could be viewed as perhaps a little redundant.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Problem unclear</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks a lot! It's not quite obvious (very non-obvious, to be honest), and  python documentation wasn't helpful in this case.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Dunno. I thought that <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-while-statement" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/reference/â€¦</a> was pretty clear, but I do understand that it is pretty technical for a beginner unfamiliar with the terminology.</span>
