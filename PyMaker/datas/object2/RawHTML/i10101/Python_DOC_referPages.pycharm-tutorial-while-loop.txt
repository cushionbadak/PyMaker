<p>It's my answer for this question :" Print all squares from 0 to 99(1,4,..,81)Use number variable in while loop."
Pycharm says it doesn't match with its answer.
I think i should print those numbers in a single line but i couldn't deal with it.How can i do that ?</p>

<p>Your code will <code>print</code> each number in a newline, because, in Python, the call to <code>print()</code> comes with an <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html?highlight=print#print" rel="nofollow">implicit newline (see the <code>end</code> argument per the documentation)</a>. </p>
<p>Next, you're making an assumption about output formatting.  As I see it, there are two primary issues with this assumption:</p>
<p>1) Calls to functions (e.g. <code>print()</code>) in a <code>while</code> loop "execute" when they're called -- there's no delay to see if a future pass through the loop will provide extra data to the function.</p>
<p>2) You're assuming that the Python interpreter will guess that printed numbers (in a while loop) are desired to be returned in a comma separated list.  Computers are machines that do what you tell them to do -- if you don't write logic to explain what you need, the machine cannot give you this.</p>
<p>You can express your desired output in the following ways:</p>
<p>1) Collect the numbers (as strings) in a list, then output them after you're done looping:</p>
<pre><code>square = 0
number = 1

# think of this as a result container
number_result_list = []

while number &lt; 10:
    square = number ** 2
    # place that number at the end of your container:
    number_result_list.append(str(square))
    number += 1

# join all your number strings together, using a comma
print(",".join(number_result_list))

# prints 1,4,9,16,25,36,49,64,81
</code></pre>
<p>2) Specify that you want to use a comma in the call to print.  Make special note of the trailing comma -- you now know why this happens:</p>
<pre><code>square = 0
number = 1

while number &lt; 10:
    square = number ** 2
    print(square, end=",")
    number += 1

# prints 1,4,9,16,25,36,49,64,81,
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">This code runs. What are you trying to ask exactly?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Pycharm says it doesn't match with its answer , i mean it tries to say : user should print those numbers in a single line (1,4,9,16....).I ask how can i do that ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Please be more specific on the print format, beyond "in a single line." Do you want those parentheses surrounding all the values? Do you want just commas between values, or a comma and a space? Also, so you want all that formatting done in printing, or can it be done with strings such as using the <code>join</code> method?</span>
