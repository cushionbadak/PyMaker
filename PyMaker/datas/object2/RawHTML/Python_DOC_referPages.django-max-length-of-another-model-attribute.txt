<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I want to have the integer value of one model attribute be the max_length of another model attribute like mentioned below "capacity = models.IntegerField(<strong>max_length=Concerthall.capacity</strong>)".</p>
<pre><code>class Concerthall(models.Model):
    name = models.TextField(max_length=254)
    capacity = models.IntegerField()
    employees = models.IntegerField()

    def __str__(self):
    return self.name

class Events(models.Model):
    name = models.TextField(max_length=254)
    capacity = models.IntegerField(max_length=Concethall.capacity)
    timeFrom = models.DateTimeField()
    timeTo = models.DateTimeField()
    concerthallName = models.ForeignKey(Concerthall, on_delete=models.PROTECT, null=True)
</code></pre>
<p>Maybe it is also working with validators but I searched for several hours and wasn't able to find any solution to this. </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I suggest a different approach, doing the validation in the models <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/ref/models/instances/#django.db.models.Model.clean" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>clean()</code></a> method:</p>
<pre><code>class Events(models.Model):
    name = models.TextField(max_length=254)
    capacity = models.IntegerField(default=0)
    timeFrom = models.DateTimeField()
    timeTo = models.DateTimeField()
    concert_hall = models.ForeignKey(Concerthall, on_delete=models.PROTECT)

    def clean(self):
        if self.capacity &gt; self.concert_hall.capacity:
            raise ValidationError(
                'the capacity of the event cannot exceed the capacity of the hall')
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>IntergerField</code> has no attribute <code>max_length</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">I don't understand what you are trying to achieve. Could you add a better explanation?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why would you need to do this if you can always access the hall capacity by <code>my_event.concerthallName.capacity</code>? Why do you need to store the capacity twice?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sorry for the bad explanation. The point it that the capacity of a Concerthall is static e.g. 400 people. But the capacity of a certain event is not. It could be 350 or 200 but definitely not over 400.</span>
