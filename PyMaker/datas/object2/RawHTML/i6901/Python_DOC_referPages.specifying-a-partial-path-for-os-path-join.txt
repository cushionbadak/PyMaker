<p>I have a python script that creates a PDF and saves it in a subfoler of the folder where the script is saved. I have the following that saves the file to the subfolder:</p>
<pre><code>outfilename = "Test" + ".pdf" #in real code there is a var that holds the name of the file
outfiledir = 'C:/Users/JohnDoe/Desktop/dev/PARENTFOLDER/SUBFOLDER/' #parent folder is where the script is - subfolder is where the PDFs get saved to
outfilepath = os.path.join(outfiledir, outfilename)
</code></pre>
<p>Is there a way I can save the PDFs to the subfolder without having to specify the full path? Lets say I wanted yto make this script an exe that multiple computers could use, how would I display the path so that the PDFs are just saved in the subfoler?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Try it:</p>
<pre><code>import os
dir_name = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)) + '/subdir'
path = os.path.join(dir_name, 'filename')
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">I would typically have the script take an argument (either through command line or in a config file) to pass in the output directory.  Something like:  <code>python &lt;myscript&gt; -o /path/to/outdir</code> <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Beautiful, worked like a charm!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Do you mind explaining what the <code>os.path.abspath(__file__)</code> part does, please?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sure, <code>__file__</code> is module attribute, that saved path to this module.</span>
