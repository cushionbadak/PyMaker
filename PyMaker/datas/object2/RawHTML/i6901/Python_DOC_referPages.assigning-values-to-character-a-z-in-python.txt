<p>I am noobie. I am trying to assign values from A to Z. 
This is very long. </p>
<pre><code>   A= 97
   B= 98
   C= 99
   D= 100
   ...
   Z= 122
</code></pre>
<p>What is the best way to do it?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can do it like that:</p>
<pre><code>import string

alpha_dict = {k: ord(k) for k in string.ascii_lowercase}
print(alpha_dict)  # {'r': 114, 'l': 108, 'z': 122, ...}
</code></pre>
<p>And access your variables like <code>alpha_dict['a']</code>.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Note that the values you have in your example correspond to the <strong>lowercase</strong> letters but you are naming your variables with <strong>uppercase</strong>. If you actually want the uppercase, instead of looping through <code>ascii_lowercase</code> loop over <code>ascii_uppercase</code></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Instead of hard-coding every letter you can use <code>ord('letter')</code>. For example <code>ord('a')</code> will return the number <code>97</code> which stands for the letter <code>a</code> in ASCII.</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>I used the code of <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/45985285/6869922">Ev. Kounis</a> for producing the dictionary because mine was wrong. If there's any problem I can delete it.</p>
<pre><code>import string

alpha_dict = {k: ord(k) for k in string.ascii_uppercase}

'''Iterates in keys of alpha_dict, turning the key to lowercase, removes 
 the old key and replaces it with the new lowercase one'''
for key in alpha_dict:
    lower = key.lower()
    alpha_dict[lower] = alpha_dict.pop(key)

print(alpha_dict)
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">don't create variables like this. Why would you do that?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You don't need the assigments. There's <code>ord('A'.lower())</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">You can use the <code>ord(str)</code> function</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Once you have these variables, what are you intending to do with them?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MosesKoledoye Why not simply <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#ord" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>ord('a')</code></a>? Why the <code>lower()</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sorry, my question wasn't clear. I wanted to put an ASCII value of 'a' in 'A'. Is there any way to do it?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ShikhaNepal Check my edit, I think it does what you need.</span>
