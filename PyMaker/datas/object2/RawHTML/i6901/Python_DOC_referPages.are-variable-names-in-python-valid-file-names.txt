<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I want to use the name of variables as file names. Are there any cases in which this might not work? </p>
<p>example: </p>
<pre><code>my_var = "value" 
with open("my_var.txt", 'wb') as fp:
    pickle.dump(my_var, fp)
</code></pre>
<p>Here "my_var" is both a part of a file name and the name of a variable. </p>
<p>So basically I'm asking if python allows any characters in variable names, that would make trouble in filenames. </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This may vary for other OSes, but under Windows, all the reserved (forbidden) characters for file names are also not allowed within Python variable names:</p>
<ul>
<li>&lt; (less than)</li>
<li>&gt; (greater than)</li>
<li>: (colon)</li>
<li>" (double quote)</li>
<li>/ (forward slash)</li>
<li>\ (backslash)</li>
<li>| (vertical bar or pipe)</li>
<li>? (question mark)</li>
<li>* (asterisk)</li>
</ul>
<p>However, there are a few different problems: Certain names are not allowed as Windows file names, specifically:</p>
<pre><code>CON, PRN, AUX, NUL, COM1, COM2, COM3, COM4, COM5, COM6, COM7, COM8, COM9, LPT1, LPT2, LPT3, LPT4, LPT5, LPT6, LPT7, LPT8, and LPT9
</code></pre>
<p>So, you can't name a file <code>CON.txt</code> under windows even though <code>CON</code> would be a perfectly valid variable name in Python.</p>
<p>Then, there is a length limit for filenames, so very long variable names might cause a problem. </p>
<p>Lastly, Python variable names may be comprised of a wide range of Unicode characters, not all of which may be available for filenames. </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Since Python variable names can only contain underscores, letters, and numbers they could all be used as file names.</p>
<p>The one issue that could come up, although hard to imagine, is that you could have a Python variable name longer than some file systems allow.  (260 characters in Windows)</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">It is valid. <code>"my_var"</code> in string is string and not variable.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That highly depends on the OS and file system. In most cases it will valid but very long names could be troubling.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">that would depend on the filesystem. Characters would be OK, but in python you can define a very long variable name, that would be an issue in Windows for instance.</span>
