<p>I have a datetime object,</p>
<pre><code>import time, datetime, pytz
current_unixtime                            = time.time()
current_date_milis_for_blibli               = int(round(current_unixtime * 1000))
current_datetime_object                     = datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(current_unixtime, pytz.timezone('Asia/Jakarta'))
</code></pre>
<p>how do i convert it into:</p>
<pre><code> Mon May 16 14:07:15 WIB 2016 
</code></pre>
<p>or in PHP equivalence:</p>
<pre><code>D M d H:i:s T Y
</code></pre>
<p>What i tried are written below, as you can see, i can't seem to get the 3 characters for Day and Month:</p>
<pre><code>year    = current_datetime_object.year
month   = current_datetime_object.month
day     = current_datetime_object.day
hour    = current_datetime_object.hour
minute  = current_datetime_object.minute
second  = current_datetime_object.second
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>result = current_datetime_object.strftime("%a %b %d %H:%M:%S %Z %Y")
</code></pre>
<p>You can also specify output by changing values in brackets.</p>
<p>Examples are based on datetime.datetime(2013, 9, 30, 7, 6, 5).</p>

<p>I can find the answer to the question here, turns out Python Documentation mentioned this kind of conversion between datetime object to a formatted string:</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Have you searched for relevant information or made any attempt to find an answer yourself?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">i can just use an array filled with values of months, but i wanted a better solution. And i don't know how to get the "Mon" equivalent in python.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Well... okay, I guess that qualifies as trying <i>something</i>, but it's kind of the bare minimum. I mean, actually go out and look for how to turn a Python datetime into a string.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thank you. That is exactly what i needed.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@RaymondSeger: Sure thing. I couldn't tell from your question, but you may want to use <code>%b</code> (lowercase) as opposed to <code>%B</code> if you want a month's <i>abbreviated</i> name.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">it's %b actually, because the PHP equivalent is "M"</span>
