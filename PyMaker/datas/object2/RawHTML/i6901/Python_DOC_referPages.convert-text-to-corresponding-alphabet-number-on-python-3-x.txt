<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I want to be able to have an input where someone can type a sentence which will convert the letters to its corresponding number i.e. a-1 and z-26</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If <code>letter</code> is a variable, you can do something like this:</p>
<pre><code>number = ord(letter) - ord('a') + 1
</code></pre>
<p><code>letter</code> could only take the values 'a', 'b', ..., 'z'.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>def convert(sentence):
  output = ""
  for letter in sentence:
      alphaNum = ord(letter.lower()) - 96
      output += str(alphaNum) + " "
  return output
</code></pre>
<p>Call <code>convert("hello")</code> will give you <code>'8 5 12 12 15 '</code>
You can tweak the output format a little bit, not sure if this is what you want?</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Please show us that you tried to solve the problem yourself first. Small hint: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#ord" rel="nofollow noreferrer">ord()</a> might be useful</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That <code>-26</code> isn't useful. What number is <code>ord(letter) - 26</code> supposed to give you?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sorry it was a stupid mistake. I wanted to write 96, which is the ASCII code of the 'a' character minus one.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Maybe instead of using a magic number, use <code>ord(letter) - ord('a')</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, good idea. I edited the answer, but adding 1, because 'a' should be associated with 1, not with 0.</span>
