<p>How would I write a statement that says:</p>
<pre><code>If today is Monday, then run this function.
</code></pre>
<p>My thoughts are:</p>
<pre><code>if datetime.now().day == Monday:
     run_report()
</code></pre>
<p>But I know this is not the right way to do it. How would I properly do this?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.date.weekday" rel="noreferrer"><code>date.weekday()</code></a> like this:</p>
<pre><code>from datetime import date

if date.today().weekday() == 0:
    run_report()
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>import datetime as dt

dt.date.today().isoweekday() == 1  # 1 = Monday, 2 = Tues, etc.
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Both <code>datetime.date</code> and <code>datetime.datetime</code>
objects have a <code>today</code> method that return respectively a <code>Date</code> and a <code>Datetime</code> object.</p>
<p>Which both have a <code>weekday</code> and <code>isoweekday</code> methods.
<code>weekday</code> count from Monday = 0, while <code>isoweekday</code> count from Monday = 1:</p>
<pre><code>from datetime import date, datetime
if date.today().weekday() == 0:
    # it is Monday
if datetime.today().isoweekday() == 1:
   # it is Monday
</code></pre>
<p>See <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.date.weekday" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation</a></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>from datetime import datetime

# Print True just when is Monday.
print(datetime.now().weekday() == 0)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">This is something you could easily work out yourself, by reading the documentation to see what <code>day</code> returns, or even trying it yourself in the shell.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Alexander in that case, you can edit the duplicate list yourself and add your findings (I did that for you). Maybe you're not aware of this relatively new SE feature (with that one you can remove my "unfit" link and leave yours)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Alexander specially for you: <a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/355666/what-should-i-do-if-i-feel-that-the-original-question-of-the-duplicate-isnt-the" title="what should i do if i feel that the original question of the duplicate isnt the">meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/355666/â€¦</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Perfect. Appreciate it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I think that Monday is 0.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Not for <code>isoweekday</code>. Return the day of the week represented by the date. Monday == 1 ... Sunday == 7</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You are right I get confused with <code>weekday</code>. Thanks for the clarification!</span>
