<p>My question is like: 
when use:</p>
<pre><code>import tarfile
tar = tarfile.open("sample.tar.gz")
tar.extractall()
tar.close()
</code></pre>
<p>if the file before compress called "sampleFolder", after I doing the above steps, how to return the "sampleFolder" name, better with its full path, or how to set the result to other name like "Folder"?</p>
<p>it's not a good question, but I actually have demand on this in my project.</p>
<p>I have to edit the question to: if I don't know the "sampleFolder", can I get a return to it after the decompress step</p>

<p>It will be extracted to the working directory by default: </p>
<pre><code>import os
os.getcwd()
</code></pre>
<p>So, the path to the extracted data is:</p>
<pre><code>from pathlib import Path
extracted_to_path = Path.cwd() / 'sampleFolder'
</code></pre>
<p>To extract in a different location:</p>
<pre><code>with tarfile.open('sample.tar.gz') as tar:
    tar.extractall(path='/other/folder')
</code></pre>
<hr/>
<p><em>edit:</em> If you just want to know the name <code>"sampleFolder"</code> contained in the archive, it's not necessary to extract somewhere.  You should use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/tarfile.html#tarfile.TarFile.getnames" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>getnames</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>tar.getnames()
</code></pre>
<p>Note that tarballs can have multiple files or folders within.  </p>

<span class="comment-copy">Use the other methods to get info about the archive.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/tarfile.html#tarfile.TarFile.extractall" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/â€¦</a> Just use the <code>path</code> keyword</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You can use the <code>getmembers</code> method to list the files in the archive, but the archive can contain multiple files. If you want to put them all in one folder, you can create a new one and use the answer below.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">~Thanks. I'll accept the answer below if you don't mind.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">you misunderstand my question, I want to get the result folder name after the decompress step</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The resulting folder name after the decompress step is the <code>extracted_to_path</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The asker doesn't have "sampleFolder", they are looking to find it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I think the OP misunderstands how tarballs work, i.e. that they can contain multiple files and not just one file or directory.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I figured, set path in the extractall(). Thanks!</span>
