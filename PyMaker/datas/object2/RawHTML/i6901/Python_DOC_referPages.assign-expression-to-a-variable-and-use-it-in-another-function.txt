<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I got the following code, that should be used in another function, so I want to pass it using a variable</p>
<pre><code>soup.find("div", {"class" : "article-entry text"}).text.replace('\n', "")
</code></pre>
<p>Using</p>
<pre><code>textFormat = "soup.find("div", {"class" : "article-entry text"}).text.replace('\n', "")"
</code></pre>
<p>doesn't work obviously. Do I have to escape characters? How?</p>
<p>What would be the best way to execute the content of textFormat. Like so?</p>
<pre><code>text = exec(textFormat)
</code></pre>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Use lambda:</p>
<pre><code>soup_find = lambda x,y: soup.find(x,y).text.replace('\n', '')
soup_find("div", {"class" : "article-entry text"})
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can wrap it in another function like this:</p>
<pre><code>def textFormat():
    return soup.find("div", {"class" : "article-entry text"}).text.replace('\n', "")
</code></pre>
<p>Then use it like this:</p>
<pre><code>text = textFormat()
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to pass it to another function:</p>
<pre><code>def func(another_func):
    return another_func()

func(textFormat)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You need to escape quotes that your string is surrounded by. Moreover you need to use raw string, to escape other chars. So ...:</p>
<pre><code>textFormat = r'soup.find("div", {"class" : "article-entry text"}).text.replace(\'\n\', "")' 
</code></pre>
<p>But if you need to apply function that is have partially  fixed elements you should just use <code>partial</code> from <em>functools</em>, not this ad hoc with <code>eval</code>.
Using partial you can fix common arguments and pass others that are not common on every call.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">It might be a good idea to explain in details what you are trying to archive with that.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I got a big function, that can be applied to different websites for scraping except for this expression. This is why I want to put everything in one function and only pass the scraping statement, which is different for every website</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Then you should have one base class where the subclasses overwrite one function.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">But the function I am talking about is around 60 lines of code. I got only two minor changes, so overwriting the whole function seems like not the best idea, right?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You don't overwrite the whole function. Just a class method that runs the code that changes.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you. Lamdba seems to be coming up on my journey to learn python pretty often. Any good resource to learn it for a beginner? Have a hard time understanding what this is doing..</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user2252633 lambda is one of the useful things, if u sure know how to use that) <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#lambda-expressions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#lambda-expressions</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Question was about variable :) But this variant too usable for sure</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@JeffersonHoup <code>textFormat</code> IS a variable and you can pass it to another function like this <code>func(textFormat)</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@JeffersonHoup see the update</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yeah, all right. In my first post I mean: "U're just create a function", because that expression: text = textFormat() will return value of func, because of "()". After update all right ) nvm so</span>
