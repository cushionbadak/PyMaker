<p>I run cron jobs on a daily basis and store there final status in a text file. </p>
<p>file data contains <code>start_time</code>, <code>end_time</code>, <code>cron job name</code>, <code>date</code>, <code>status</code>:</p>
<pre><code>08/21/2017 18:31:47.000 EDT 08/21/2017 19:31:53.077 EDT create_dump 20170821 failed

08/22/2017 18:31:35.000 EDT 08/22/2017 19:31:51.000 EDT create_dump 20170822 failed
</code></pre>
<p>I would like to retrieve jobs that are in failed state for more than 24 hrs (when compared with system date).</p>
<p>comparison with end_time and value returned by datetime function</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>you can make use of os.stat to examine when what happened. Here is an example code..</p>
<pre><code>def checking_the_dir_info():

x = os.scandir('/path/to/folder/')
print('Type of the object resulted by scandir is ', type(x))

for element in x:
    print('The element is on it own ', element, 'and the type of it ', type(element))

y = os.stat('./naber/asd.txt')
print('Last change date ', y.st_mtime)

from time import sleep

sleep(0.1)
z = open('./naber/asd.txt', 'a')
z.write(' Ne olacak bunun sonu :)')
sleep(0.1)

y = os.stat('./naber/asd.txt')
print('Birthtime of the file ', y.st_birthtime)
</code></pre>
<p>With the sleep function, you can observe that 'something' in the folder 'naber' has been changed and for all other different use cases, you can look to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.stat" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a></p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You need to show us the code you've tried.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">use most use regex</span>
<span class="comment-copy">which time should be compare with os time ? start_time ? or end-time?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">compare end_time with datetime</span>
