<p>I know that the function eval executes the string(in the parameter) without the quotes .So what I was just trying was that</p>
<pre><code>x=eval("4*5")  #this works
eval("x=4*5")  #but this doesn't
</code></pre>
<p>Please tell where I am wrong!</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>use</p>
<pre><code>exec('x=4*5')
</code></pre>
<p>eval evaluates only expressions not assignments.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>4*5</code> is an <strong>expression</strong>, it has a value of <code>20</code>.</p>
<p><code>x=4*5</code> is not an expression and it doesn't have a value. It's a <strong>statement</strong>, meaning it performs an action.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>eval()</code> runs its string parameter as a python expression. It evaluates the value of that expression. It cannot work with assignments or other statements that are not expressions.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>eval</code> function has the following structure:</p>
<pre><code>eval(expression, globals=None, locals=None)
</code></pre>
<p>The expression argument is parsed and evaluated as a Python expression. It is actually a string expression rather than a assignment.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">While it's fine to be curious about this, using eval or exec is pretty much always the wrong approach to solving a problem. If you tell us what you're trying to do in a larger context, we can tell you a better way to do it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">eval take an expression as arguments.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">ya I got it,Thanks . I was just trying to know the use of eval function . I thought whatever is written in the argument is executed as it is.</span>
