<p>I've just started using Pandas and I'm trying to export my dataset using the <code>to_csv</code> function on my dataframe <code>fp_df</code></p>
<p>One column (entitled <code>fp_df['Amount Due']</code>)has multiple decimal places (the result is 0.000042) - but when using to_csv it's being output in a scientific notation, which the resulting system will be unable to read. It needs to be output as '0.000042'. </p>
<p>What is the easiest way to do this? The other answers I've found seem overly complex and I don't understand how or why they work. </p>
<p>(Apologies if any of my terminology is off, I'm still learning)</p>

<p>Check <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.to_csv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the documentation for <code>to_csv()</code></a>, you'll find an attribute called <code>float_format</code></p>
<pre><code>df.to_csv(..., float_format='%.6f')
</code></pre>
<p>you can define the format you want as defined in the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#format-specification-mini-language" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Format Specification Mini-Language</a></p>

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks! I guess the data is being output in scientific notation because it's stored as a "float"? Can I ask what <code>%.6f</code> means? Does it mean "round to six decimal places"? EDIT: Thank you! Answered perfectly</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm not sure what you mean. The <code>float_format</code> will only be applied to columns that are of type <code>float</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sorry - I think my issue stemmed from the fact that I hadn't quite grasped what a "float" was. Your answer has helped me learn - thanks.</span>
