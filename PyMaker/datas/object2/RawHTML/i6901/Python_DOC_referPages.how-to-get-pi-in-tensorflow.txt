<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I could not find any information about mathemtical constants in the Tensorflow API</p>
<p>neither in <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.12/api_docs/python/math_ops/basic_math_functions" rel="noreferrer">Basic Math functions</a> nor in <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/api_guides/python/math_ops" rel="noreferrer">Math Ops</a>.</p>
<p>I was able to get it by</p>
<pre><code>import math as m
pi = tf.constant(m.pi)
</code></pre>
<p>However, this would mean to include another library, - so I wonder if there is this functionallity for mathemtical  constants like <code>pi</code>, or <code>euler</code> already provided inside tensorflow? </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>math</code> is <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html" rel="noreferrer">in the Python standard library</a>, not a third-party module.</p>
<p>I don't see why using it is a problem whatsoever.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>As I know NO, and there's a reason for it. If each library define it own pi will be lots of code duplications!
You did it right</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">sry , did not meant third party library - I editet my question. I could not find a anything related to mathematical constans in tensorflow and want to know if they are provided in tf</span>
