<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Here I am trying to check whether elements of 'b' that are [1,3],[1,5],[3,7],[5,7],[6,9],[8,10] are subsets of elements of 'a' that are [1,3,5,7] and [6,8,9,10].
If any element of b is subset of any element of a then it gets removed from b.</p>
<pre><code>     a = [[1, 3, 5, 7],[6, 8, 9, 10]]
     b = [[1, 3], [1, 5],[10, 11],[6, 9],[8, 10]]
</code></pre>
<p>If any element of 'b' is subset of any element of 'a' then it gets removed from b.
That means the new b should be :-</p>
<pre><code>     b = [[10,11]]
</code></pre>

<p>If you want set operations, use python's <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#sets" rel="nofollow noreferrer">set</a> data type, which has a <code>issubset()</code> method.</p>
<pre><code>b = [x for x in b if not any(set(x).issubset(y) for y in a)]
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Very nice. What did you try?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You're question isn't very clear at least to me. Do you mean any array in b that is one of the pairs producible from a</span>

<span class="comment-copy">yes, any array of 2 elements in b is made from any array of 4 elements in a.</span>
