<p>I have a question about docstrings in simple email python scripts.</p>
<pre><code>message = """\
From: %s
To: %s
Subject: %s

%s
""" % (FROM, ", ".join(TO), SUBJECT, TEXT)
</code></pre>
<p>I see docstrings like this often in email scripts. My question is, what is the docstring doing? I thought docstrings were used only for <code>help</code> commands and such. I apologize if this is a stupid question.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>A string with <code>"""..."""</code> (triple quotes) is called a multiline string. There is a distinction between a multiline string and a docstring. The latter is a subset of the former.</p>
<p>The one in question is being assigned to a variable, so it is <em>not</em> a docstring. A docstring is what you'd find at the top of a function, like this:</p>
<pre><code>def foo():
    """This is a doc-string"""
    pass
</code></pre>
<p>And printing out <code>foo.__doc__</code> gives you</p>
<pre><code>print(foo.__doc__)
'This is a doc-string'
</code></pre>
<p>You should understand that only the first multiline string in a function (if it is un-assigned) becomes the docstring of a function (provided no optimisation switches are set) and the rest are all discarded.</p>
<p>In contrast, </p>
<pre><code>message = """\
From: %s
To: %s
Subject: %s

%s
""" % (FROM, ", ".join(TO), SUBJECT, TEXT)
</code></pre>
<p>Happens to be a multi-line string with some C-style format arguments that is assigned to the variable <code>message</code>.</p>

<p>That is not a docstring but just a normal string (<code>str</code>). Using the triple double-quotes (<code>"""</code>), or triple single-quotes (<code>'''</code>), you're telling to Python to use that as a long string. This string is separated by <code>\n</code>. Docstrings often uses this kind of long string to ease the read.</p>
<p>In your code, seems like it's preparing the email, using variables to specify the subject, text, CC, etc.</p>
<p>Hope it makes sense.</p>

<p>It's because it's useful to write the string in multiple lines, from the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>docs</code></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>String literals can span multiple lines. One way is using
  triple-quotes: """...""" or '''...'''.</p>
