<p>i have a script action.py which will take a file name as command line argument and do some processing on that file.
i want to run this script multiple times with different input files . i used Popen() command to run the script which is surprisingly working fine in interpreter but does not work if  i run the script .</p>
<pre><code>for i in range(n):
    Popen("python action.py input" +str(i)+ ".txt")
</code></pre>
<p>if i copy this code in the interpreter it works fine and spawn n processes but does not do any thing when i run the whole script in pycharm. </p>

<p>I think You are mentioning about the subprocess module.This code might work:</p>
<pre><code>import subprocess
process = subprocess.Popen(['python','script','argv1','argv2'])
</code></pre>
<p><p>For Further references read the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.Popen" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Popen()</a> documentation. </p>
<p>Hope This Helps</p>

<span class="comment-copy">There is no <code>Popen()</code> function in Python, unless you wrote your own. Please check your code for validity. As a side note, why not simply call the functions from that script?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Have you imported popen using <code>from os import popen</code>?</span>
