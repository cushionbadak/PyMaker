<p>Say you wrote a function that returns the factorial of a number (factorial of 5 is 120 because 5*4*3*2*1=120) so if you have a huge number clearly it's going to take python a while to figure it out. Is it possible to have it run some while loop or something that runs while python figures out the factorial of x?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>What you're looking for is to generate another process that will calculate factorial concurrently to the work that your current process is doing.</p>
<p>There's a module called <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">subprocess</a> that might interest you. Also see <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13606867/what-is-the-difference-between-multiprocessing-and-subprocess">this</a>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Yes that is possible. It is called multithreading. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2846653/how-to-use-threading-in-python">Here</a> is a good explanation with some examples how to do it in python.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Flomp that's not a good idea: threads implementation in python are, lets say "not ideal". Read about GIL to see why.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is a broad question, I'm going to close it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@cᴏʟᴅsᴘᴇᴇᴅ I'd rather find something close enough to be a dup. That's not broad - the OP asks how to run code concurrently in python. A legit question.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@alfasin Sorry... should've been clear - I was going to close this as a dupe :)</span>
