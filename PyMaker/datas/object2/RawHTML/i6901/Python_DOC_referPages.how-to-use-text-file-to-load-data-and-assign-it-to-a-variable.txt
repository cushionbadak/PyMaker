<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>i am new to python(learner).I created a simple program which asks for username and password and i used <code>getpass()</code>function to hide password
.But i want my program to load username and password from a text file.</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python
import getpass
import os
print (' ')
print (' ')
print ('Please enter username and password in order to continue :')
print (' ')
print (' ')
user = (str(input('           USERNAME : ')))
usr_list = open("usr.txt", "r")
for line in usr_list:
  line.strip()
  if line == user:
    password = getpass.getpass("           PASSWORD : ")
    if password == 'root':
      os.system("python3 cross.py")
    else:
      print ('WRONG! Password')
      os.system("python3 sec.py")
  else:
    print ('WRONG! Username')
    os.system("python3 sec.py")
</code></pre>
<p>now, if i remove text file and open function from code and insert a string like "user1" <code>if user == "user1":</code> it works fine. </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can read data from text file simple:</p>
<pre><code>with open('your_text_file.txt', 'r') as f:
    username = f.readline()
    password = f.readline()
</code></pre>
<p>This is mean that you are open file "your_text_file.txt" for reading ('r' as second parameter) and we read first line, after that we read the next line</p>
<p>This is work if your username and password write in the different line:</p>
<p>your_text_file.txt:</p>
<pre><code>sume_username
verylongandstrongpassword
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">You want to hide password in textfile, or only load username and password from textfile?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">i just want to store usernames and passwords in txt file and want to load these username and passwords in code and by boolean expressions want to check if it's right or not it decide real code will execute or not</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Firstly he would have to <b>write</b> the inputs into the file.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">He asked only hove to read data from file, of course he must write to file before he read, but for his purpose he can do this without python</span>
<span class="comment-copy">i tried it but whenever i load username.txt it load the file evan it print the data but boolean expressions for string is not working like( inside txt ::: 1.. user1\n 2..user2 ) and x = "user2". But when i try if y == "user2":   break . It doesn't work.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Try to do <code>y.strip()</code> this function is trim whitespace before and after word('\n', '\t' ' '). If it is not worked do <code>print(y)</code> and write to me the output</span>
<span class="comment-copy">file = open("test.txt", "r") for line in file:   line.strip(" ")   if line == "user6":     print ("done")   else:     print ("not working")      # this code is not working it always print "not working" six times(because of six lines in file)</span>
