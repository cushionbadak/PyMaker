<p>I'm quite new on this Python world (i worked in the past with java, c++... but I never used Python). </p>
<p>Well, let's go with the question. </p>
<p>As I know, when I needed to export a java project, I just needed to create a .war (automaticly if I used Eclipse) and use it whenever and wherever I need it...</p>
<p>Now, I need to export a python project created in pyCharm and use it in other computers (it's a linux program created for getting information of the system and display it through sockets in a server), but I don't know what steps should I follow to export this project and use it on other machines.</p>
<p>My project looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>+ProjectRootDir
    +Package
      -File.py (modules uses in main)
    +MainPackage
      -Main.py
+ExternalLibraries (I understand that I will need 
    to install them manually on the other computers).
</code></pre>
<p>Maybe is a stupid question, but I researched through manuals and other questions but I don't find the answer...</p>
<p>Any idea?</p>
<p>Regards!</p>

<p>Generally speaking, if you just want to work on a different machine you just have to copy your Python project's <code>RootDir</code>, create new project in PyCharm, add the folder to it and install all dependencies.</p>
<p>This is however made easier by:</p>
<p>a) setting up your project as a python package (see my comment) as this allows you to define dependencies which will automatically be installed and</p>
<p>b) the use of virtual environments which can be exported and installed on a different machine, see <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html</a></p>
<p>Personally I use <code>conda</code> (<a href="https://conda.io/miniconda.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://conda.io/miniconda.html</a>) to manage my environments: <a href="https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html</a></p>

<span class="comment-copy">I realise that you're specifically asking about PyCharm (which I know nothing about) but in general you may want to check out some basic information on Python packaging. <a href="https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/distributing-packages/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">packaging.python.org/tutorials/distributing-packages</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">I wiil read that article... But I don't think that is what I am asking for...</span>
