<p>Like we have python modules in the standard library from which we can import methods and use them, is there also a module where all the built-in functions are defined?
If yes, how can I view that module?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/builtins.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>builtins</code></a> (Python 3) or <a href="https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/__builtin__.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>__builtin__</code></a> (Python 2) module provides access to them.</p>
<p>This is even useful sometimes if you rebind the name of a builtin, eg <code>list = [1, 2, 3]</code>. You generally shouldn't do that, but if you do you can still access the builtin list constructor as <code>builtins.list</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>On python3, <code>import builtins</code> or <code>import __builtin__</code> for older versions</p>
<p>You can check any modules content with the <code>dir</code> function</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I wanted to know from where I could view the contents of 'builtins' module...i.e. the exact code.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">thanks @user2357112</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Because they're not written in Python. They're C. Not all of the CPython implementation is written in Python.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Note that <code>builtins</code> is <code>__builtin__</code> in Python 2.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Does there exists a module such as 'builtins.py' ? If yes, where is it located in the python directory?</span>
