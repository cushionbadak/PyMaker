<p>I have been generating random sets and lists and was curious about how one would calculate the number of multiples in that given set or list. The code I have written gives me the wrong number, so I am assuming I have allocated something incorrectly. The code is</p>
<pre><code>b= random.sample(range(1, 56), 6)
print(b)
numbers = (b)
count_multiples = 0
for y in (b):
    for x in (b):
        if y % x ==0:
            count_multiples+=1
print("MPS:", count_multiples)
</code></pre>
<p>I am brand new to coding and this exchange, so any help would be appreciated.</p>

<p>This depends on what exactly you mean by number of multiples in the list.</p>
<p>1). Do you want to count every number at least once, since every number is a multiple of itself?</p>
<p>2). Do you want to count an element more than once if it is a multiple of more than one element in the list?</p>
<p>If you answer yes to both of these questions your code looks fine (although not the most efficient).  If no try something like the following:</p>
<pre><code>min, max = 1, 56
n = 6
count = 0 
random_list_with_no_duplicates = random.sample(range(min, max), n)

# If no to 1) but yes to 2)
random_list_with_no_duplicates.sort()
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(i + 1, n):
        if random_list_with_no_duplicates[j] % random_list_with_no_duplicates[i] == 0:
            count += 1

# If no both
random_list_with_no_duplicates.sort(reverse=True)
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(i + 1, n):  # change to just 'i' if yes to 1), no to 2)
        if random_list_with_no_duplicates[i] % random_list_with_no_duplicates[j] == 0:
            count += 1
            break
</code></pre>

<p>In Python, <code>True</code> and <code>False</code> are equal to <code>1</code> and <code>0</code>, respectively. You can take advantage of this and use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#sum" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>sum</code></a> to add the booleans together. The result will be the number of elements, <code>e</code>, where <code>bool(e)</code> evaluates as <code>True</code>.</p>
<pre><code>count_multiples = sum(y % x == 0 for y in b for x in b)

<span class="comment-copy">I'm sorry, but I'm afraid that I don't understand the <i>notion</i> of <i>multiples</i> (at least in your context). Could some examples be shared - e.g. for <code>[48, 3, 31, 13, 35, 49]</code>? Does it have anything to do with <i>divisors</i>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Do you meant he count of unique values? If so, you can hash your values in a <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#set-types-set-frozenset" rel="nofollow noreferrer">set</a> and find the length: <code>len(set(b))</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">For this example I am looking at elements in the set that divide other elements in the set, for instance given the set or list (2, 5, 6, 8) there would be two multiples since 2 divides 6 and 8.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you all so much for the comments! Code is working great.</span>
