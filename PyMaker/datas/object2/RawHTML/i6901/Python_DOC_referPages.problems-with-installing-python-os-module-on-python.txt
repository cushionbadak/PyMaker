<p>I have recently downloaded ActivePython 3.6 and it works just fine, but when I try to install the os module I get following console output:<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5j5G2.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Command prompt screenshot</a></p>
<p>Thank you for all your help in advance:)</p>

<p>In the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python Standard Library</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">16.1. os â€” Miscellaneous operating system interfaces</a></p>

<p>OS is one of the libraries listed, so you shouldn't need to download anything.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Why do you think you need to install that module? It's part of the standard library.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You're right. My mistake. Thank you</span>
