<p>I have used a Salesforce python package to query the API via SOAP, and it has returned me a base64 serialized ordered dict. How would I go about decoding this to an ordered dictionary?</p>

<p>Sounds like you want <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/base64.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>b64decode</code></a>, followed by <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>json.loads</code></a>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">base64 is a binary-to-text encoding scheme. How was your binary serialized? <code>pickle</code>?

<span class="comment-copy">like <code>json.loads(base64.b64decode(log))</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes. But first things first, you should show us what the b64decode result looks like. Maybe it yields well formed JSON, maybe it's something else.</span>
