<p>We are trying to find out the distance between 2 locations or customer location to the centroid location. The data looks like below and its not real data just for understanding i gave</p>
<p>Customer_Location || Centroid_LatLong|| Distance </p>
<p>[[13.070418, 77.583677]] || [[13.0704402, 77.5836726],[13.0704402, 77.5966726]] || [[0.0752384],[0.0536366]]</p>
<p>We want to get the haversine distance we have code but how can we get the distance in multiple element in lat long:</p>
<p>How can we find the distance for the given data set which contains 2 columns in a dataframe one is customer location and another column is the centroid_latlong(list of centroids).I wanted to find distance between customer location with each of the centroids availabe in the centroid_latlong column and store it into a distance column which will be again list of distances.</p>
<p>For instance customer_location is [13.070418, 77.583677] and centroid_latlong is [[13.0704402, 77.5836726],[13.0704402, 77.5966726]]
How to find distance []?</p>
<p>I know how to calculate distance like haversine we do consider only thing is how can we work on if we have list of values in a dataframe/</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Try this</p>
<pre><code>a = ( pow(sin(dLat/2),2) + pow(sin(dLon/2),2) * cos(p1Lat) * cos(p2Long) )
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">@Ashwin Padhy please clarify if this didn't solve the issue</span>
<span class="comment-copy">no thats already there in the code which i have given.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">"I know how to calculate distance like haversine we do consider only thing is how can we work on if we have list of values in a dataframe/ "  you mean the syntax you want ? can't you access the elements of dataframe ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Dataframe column has data which of list of lat and long and centroid is of many list of lat and long so calculating that is the trouble i am facing.  For instance  customer_location is [13.070418, 77.583677] and  centroid_latlong is [[13.0704402, 77.5836726],[13.0704402, 77.5966726]]  How to find distance [] if these are 2 columns in dataframe ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">as much as i can understand your problem you can do 1.) calculate mean lat, lng from the centroid_latlong and then calculate distance between mean lat,lng and customer lat,lng.   2.) Calculate distance for each centroid_latlng lat,lng i.e calculate distance b/w customer location [13.070418, 77.583677] and [13.0704402, 77.5836726] then calculate distance b/w customer location [13.070418, 77.583677] and [13.0704402, 77.5966726] and so on ..</span>
