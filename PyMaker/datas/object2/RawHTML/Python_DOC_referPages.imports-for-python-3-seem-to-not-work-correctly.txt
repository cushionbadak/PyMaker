<p>Not sure why it seems to not instantiate the parent class. Kinda new to python 3 and imports also. So not sure what went wrong, any help would be great! Thanks in advance!

<span class="comment-copy">Your last example file doesn't import anything named <code>subClass</code> (nor <code>subclass</code> which you seem to be showing here). So getting an error is not unexpected. What exactly is confusing you about the situation? Is <code>encrypted_auditor</code> supposed to be relevant? I'd also warn you that it's not generally a best practice in Python to put every class in its own module (and certainly not to create subpackages for no particular reason). Is there a particularly good reason you couldn't write your code in one or two files in a much flatter directory structure?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sorry forgot to edit that one to the general notation.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This was the file structure that was requested by my bosses we are building an api that fits into a bigger program</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It's hard to tell if the typos in your code are what are causing your errors, or if they're just an artifact of copying your code to Stack Overflow. The obvious cause of your <code>NameError</code> is that you haven't defined a class named <code>subClass</code> but instead one named <code>SubClass</code> (with a capital "S" on the front). Maybe you have other issues too, but we can't help with that without a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve">Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example</a>.</span>
