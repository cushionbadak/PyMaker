<p>I am aware that using filtfilt (e.g. in Python via scipy or in Matlab) I will apply the filter bidirectional. Setting up the b, a parameters based on a 4th order filter will effectively result in an 8th order filter. </p>
<p>I believe that creating the same 4th order filter with sos output and using sosfiltfilt will not change the filter order and should result in a 4th order filter (not an 8th order). Is that correct?</p>
<p>TLDR: Is forward-backward filtering in case of sosfiltfilt also doubling the filter order like in filtfilt?</p>

<p>Using forward-backward filtering, whether it is using the b,a parameter form or the sos form, doubles the effective order of the filtering when compared to a simple forward filter. That is the reason why <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-1.0.0/reference/generated/scipy.signal.sosfiltfilt.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>scipy.signal.sosfiltfilt</code></a>'s example compares a 4th-order Butterworth filter using <code>sosfiltfilt</code> with an 8th-order Butterworth filter using <code>sosfilt</code>.</p>
