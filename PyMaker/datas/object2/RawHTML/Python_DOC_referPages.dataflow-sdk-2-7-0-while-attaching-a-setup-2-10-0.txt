<p>I am trying to run a dataflow job, have the following setup.py file:</p>
<pre><code>import setuptools

setuptools.setup(
              name='Some-Name',
              version='0.0.1',
              install_requires=[
                  'apache-beam==2.10.0',
                  'tensorflow-transform==0.12.0'
                  ],
              packages=setuptools.find_packages(),
              )
</code></pre>
<p>but when I submit the job to GCP, the SDK shows as 2.7.0 and the job won't run. It will stop after 1 hour with the following error:</p>
<p>Workflow failed. Causes: The Dataflow job appears to be stuck because no worker activity has been seen in the last 1h.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I fixed this issue by updating the <code>tensorflow-transform</code> and apache-beam in my local virtual environment where I was submitting the dataflow job from. Once I updated my local apache-beam and <code>tensorflow-transform</code> and <code>tensorflow</code>, it seems to work. I'm not sure why since the <code>setup.py</code> stated the versions of the packages.</p>
