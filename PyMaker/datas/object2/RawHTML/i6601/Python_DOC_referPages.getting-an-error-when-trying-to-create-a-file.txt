<p>I'm creating this program where you translate a DNA sequence from a file to RNA and then create a file with the RNA stored in it. I'm having this error,  </p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>First, you have to define f in python before you try to write anything on it:</p>
<pre><code>f = open('filename.txt', 'w')
</code></pre>
<p>where filename.txt is the name and format of your file and 'w' is called mode that we use for writing in files if you want to read a file you can use 'r' mode.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Where do you open the file and assign to <code>f</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Error is clear! What is <code>f</code>? probably it's a file handler that you miss to define it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You're missing a line like <code>f = open("filename", "w")</code> You should also use <code>with</code> so you don't have to write <code>f.close()</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">And you need to indent the body of the <code>for</code> loop, and put parentheses after <code>f.close</code></span>
