<p>I'm currently learning how to use Flask, and my goal is to let the user provide certain inputs, click Generate, and then Download a .zip file of .docx files generated by a different python script.</p>
<p>Currently, my .docx generation python script saves the folder locally, which I don't think is ideal. It is saved as a folder of .docx files, so what is the best way to have those files able to be downloaded by a user who inputted variables that generated those files?</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">zipfile</a> module and <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/api/#flask.send_from_directory" rel="nofollow noreferrer">flask.send_from_directory</a> are what you need</p>
