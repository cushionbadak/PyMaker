<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have a list called A</p>
<pre><code>A = ["How are you","I am good","What are you doing?"]
</code></pre>
<p>I want to search for a word "good" and if it is found in the list then i want to get the item's index number in which the word has been found.</p>
<p>Desired output:</p>
<pre><code>A = ["How are you","I am good","What are you doing?"]

B = "good"
</code></pre>
<p>Result =&gt;</p>
<p>"good" word was found in list A[1] </p>
<p>i want to get the index number of the list's item in which the word was found.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Try this (I made a function):</p>
<pre><code>A = ["How are you","I am good","What are you doing?"]
B = "how"

def FindWordInList(list,item):
    index = 0
    for string in list:
        index += 1
        for word in string.split():
            if word.lower() == item:
                #Subtracts one from the list as list index starts at 0
                return index - 1

    print("Could not find the word {} in the list".format(item))

indexofword = FindWordInList(A,B)
print("{} word was found in list A[{}]".format(B,indexofword))
</code></pre>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can try this:</p>
<pre><code>A = ["How are you","I am good","What are you doing?"]
B = "good"
d = [(i, a) for i, a in enumerate(A) if B in a]
print("Elements found", d[0][-1]) #printing what elements contain "good"
print("'{}' was found in list A[{}]".format(B, d[0][0]) if d else "'{}' not found".format(B))
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>'Elements found', 'I am good'
'good' was found in list A[1]
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">What if B = "you"?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Use Ajax1234's method as it probably faster, and uses less lines of code than mine</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#enumerate" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>enumerate</code></a> instead of manually counting up the index.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">How can I print out the item of the list in which the word was found?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Add the following line to the bottom: print("The sentence {} was found was {}".format(B, A[indexofword]))</span>
<span class="comment-copy">How can I print out the item of the list in which the word was found?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@infinitiayush please see my recent edit.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You might consider <code>if B in a.split()</code> if you don't want to catch accidental hits like "goodies" or so...</span>
