<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I want to wait for a click in Python Turtle before continuing. The code outline is as follows:</p>
<pre><code>do_stuff()

# Wait for click and DO NOT continue if user has not clicked

# When user clicks:

do_other_stuff()

end()
</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/39713672/5757613">This</a> answer on SOF asks something similar, but the proposed solution involves extending the Turtle class. I remember using a simpler way to do this, but cannot recollect it.</p>
<p>Any help would be much appreciated.</p>

<p>Without modifying turtle nor wizardry, you may have something working with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#turtle.onclick" rel="nofollow noreferrer">tirtle.onclick</a>.</p>
<pre><code>do_stuff()
# Wait for click and DO NOT continue if user has not clicked
# When user clicks:
def second_part():
    turtle.onclick(None)
    do_other_stuff()
    end()
turtle.onclick(second_part)
turtle.mainloop()
</code></pre>
<p>You may even chain them manually (not tested):</p>
<pre><code>do_stuff()

def third_part():
    turtle.onclick(None)
    ...

def second_part():
    turtle.onclick(third_part)
    ...

turtle.onclick(second_part)
...
</code></pre>
</div>
