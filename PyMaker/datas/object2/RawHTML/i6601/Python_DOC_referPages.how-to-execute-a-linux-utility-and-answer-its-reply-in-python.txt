<p>When I am executing an utility, blab, and it will ask yes or no for confirmation, what can I do? Thanks,</p>
<p>The code is as below:</p>
<pre><code>proc = subprocess.Popen("blab delete {}".format(num), shell=True,
                        stderr=subprocess.STDOUT, stdin=subprocess.STDIN)
stdout_value = proc.communicate()[0]
</code></pre>

<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html?highlight=subprocess#subprocess.Popen.communicate" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Popen.communicate()</a> documentation:</p>
<p>If you want to send data to process's stdin using python, create the Popen object with <code>stdin=PIPE</code>. Similarly, to get anything other than None in the result tuple, you need to give stdout=PIPE and/or stderr=PIPE too.</p>
<pre><code>from subprocess import PIPE, Popen, STDOUT

process = Popen("blab delete {}".format(num), shell=True, stdin=PIPE, stdout=PIPE, stderr=STDOUT)
output = process.communicate(input=b'yes')[0]
output = output.decode('utf-8')
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Yes, I agree. But I need to answer its question not only its output.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">you could send in the answer via the same procedure, calling <code>process.communicate(input=b'some answer')</code> repeatedly.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It works. I always though the input is for the initial step. Out of my surprise, it can be the input for subprocess's reply</span>
