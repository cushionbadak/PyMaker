<p>When I type something like in the command prompt : </p>
<pre><code>pip install beautifulsoup4
</code></pre>
<p>Why doesn't it install in the scripts folder where I have the directory set? (i.e)</p>
<pre><code>L:/Code/Scripts
</code></pre>
<p>I can never find these packages once I install them and I don't know why. They seem to be installing in a different location, and this is true any time I've downloaded a package.  They go to random places.  Thanks.</p>

<p>When you install with pip, it installs the package into site-packages folder under your python distribution. Try to look for <code>python-location\Lib\site-package</code></p>

<span class="comment-copy">There isn't much of an use to know the path of the installed library, <code>pip</code> will install it under it's Python version path, but you don't need this knowledge to use the library in Python.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">But it seems like I can't use the module associated with the package.  When calling my python file, it is saying, "No module named BS4" (beautiful Soup).  The line in question in my code is: from BS4 import BeautifulSoup</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@DiamondJoe12 What does is say?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">And, in checking my scripts folder (set to this in my current directory) there is the folder: beautifulsoup4-4.0.0b3 .  Not sure what's up here.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">So,Yuan Fu - you are correct it was in that folder.  Once I copy bs4 from site-package, into my scripts folder, it doesn't give me the error.  So it must be that the package must be in the directory in which it is called from?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That works, you can check this site about importing in python. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#the-module-search-path" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#the-module-search-path</a>  Basically you can import modules either from local directory or from the directory that is in path</span>
