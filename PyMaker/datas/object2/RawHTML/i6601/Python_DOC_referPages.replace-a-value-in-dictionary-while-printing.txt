<p>I have a python dictionary, A sample configuration is as below:</p>
<pre><code>{
"user_name": "abc"
"password": "xyz"
}
</code></pre>
<p>I want to print this dictionary, but while printing i want to mask password field in it. 
Print statement should return something like below:</p>
<pre><code>{
"user_name": "abc"
"password": "*****"
}
</code></pre>
<p>Is there a way to achieve it in python?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If what you want is to modify the behavior of the <code>print</code> function regarding your dictionary, you should create your own dictionary class, inherited from the default Python <code>dict</code> and then define your own <code>__repr__</code> function.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>import copy
d2 = copy.deepcopy(d)
d2['password'] = '***'
print(d2)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I think you just want to print the items in your dictionary, rather than customise the dictionary class like others are suggesting. Something like this ought to do:</p>
<pre><code>def get_masked_str(mydict):
    result = "{\n"
    for k, v in mydict.items():
        if k == "password":
             v = "*****"
        result += "    " + repr(k) + ": " + repr(v) + "\n"
    result += "}\n"
    return result
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Here's a simple function that doesn't use external modules, that replaces the password field with <code>*</code>'s.</p>
<pre><code>def secure_str(d):
    x={}
    x.update(d)
    x['password']=len(x["password"])*"*"
    return x
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Sure, either a custom class for the dictionary or for the password string. Override <code>__str__()</code> to affect how the object prints.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You might look at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/reprlib.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">reprlib</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Is it essential that <code>str(mydict)</code> does that, or is it acceptable that a different function does the printing?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why would you store a password in plain-text anyway? Even if you overwrite the representation as soon as you store it in plain text there are ways to access it.</span>
