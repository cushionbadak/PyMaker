<p>I have a program that returns a set of ages inside of an array and I want to count them and put them inside of a dictionary, I have tried the following but no results. Please help!</p>
<p>let's say I have an array as follows:</p>
<pre><code>ages = [20,20,11,12,10,11,15]
# count ages inside of array, I tried this
 for i in set(ages):
     if i in ages:
         print (ages.count(i))
# result returns the following
  1
  2
  1
  1
  2
</code></pre>
<p>this makes perfect sense as if we look at the set(ages) it equals = {10,11,12,15,20}</p>
<p>so the returning count actually equals to the count of each value in ages</p>
<p>When I try to put in a variable though, it only appends the first number or it says it is not iterable!
How can I store it into a list, even better how can I make dictionary containing the set(ages) and the count for each of the set(ages)</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<p>There are a lot of different ways to achieve this.  The first, and likely easiest, is to import the <code>Counter</code> class from <code>collections</code>.</p>
<pre><code>from collections import Counter
ages = [20,20,11,12,10,11,15]
counts = Counter(ages)
# Counter({10: 1, 11: 2, 12: 1, 15: 1, 20: 2})
# if you want to strictly be a dictionary you can do the following
counts = dict(Counter(ages))
</code></pre>
<p>The other way is to do it in a loop:</p>
<pre><code>counts = {}
for a in ages:
  # if the age is already in the dicitonary, increment it, 
  # otherwise, set it to 1 (first time we are seeing it)
  counts[a] = counts[a] + 1 if a in counts else 1
</code></pre>
<p>And finally, <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0274/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">dict comprehension</a>.  It has really no advantage over the loop other than the fact that it's a single line.  You still end up iterating over each variable in the list:</p>
<pre><code>counts = {a:ages.count(a) for a in ages}
</code></pre>
<hr/>
<p>Since you asked more about the <a href="http://pythoncentral.io/one-line-if-statement-in-python-ternary-conditional-operator/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">ternary operator</a>, that loop is equivalent to saying:</p>
<pre><code>counts = {}
for a in ages:
  # if the age is already in the dicitonary, increment it, 
  # otherwise, set it to 1 (first time we are seeing the number)
  if a in counts:
     counts[a] = counts[a] + 1 
     print("Already seen", a, " -- ", counts[a])
  else:
     counts[a] = 1
     print("First time seeing", a, " -- ", counts[a])
</code></pre>
<p>The ternary operator allows us to complete this pattern in a single line.  Lots of languages have it:</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>try this!</p>
<pre><code>ages = [20,20,11,12,10,11,15]
dic = {x:ages.count(x) for x in ages}
print dic
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you need to store counts, better you use Python dicts.</p>
<pre><code>ages = [20,20,11,12,10,11,15]
age_counts={} #define dict
for i in ages:
    #if age_counts does not have i, set its count to 1
    #increment otherwise
    if not age_counts.has_key(i):
        age_counts[i]=1
    else:
        age_counts[i]+=1
#you can now have counts stored
for i in age_counts:
    print i, age_counts[i] 
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Thank you, but I am trying to do it manually without libraries</span>
<span class="comment-copy">great! I have a question, how could you use an if and else statement when setting a variable?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It's called the <a href="http://pythoncentral.io/one-line-if-statement-in-python-ternary-conditional-operator/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">ternary operator.</a>  It really just frees up some lines of code.  It's equivalent to doing <code>if a in counts: counts[a] = counts[a] + 1 else: counts[a] = 1</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Isn't <code>import Counter from collections</code> invalid syntax?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Those are <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#sets" rel="nofollow noreferrer">set comprehensions</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Jalepeno112 Yes you are correct, I saw <code>set</code> in the question and jumped to conclusions.</span>
