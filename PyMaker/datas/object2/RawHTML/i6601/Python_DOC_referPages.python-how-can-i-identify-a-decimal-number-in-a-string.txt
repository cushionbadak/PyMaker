<p>How can I identify decimal numbers in a list of strings, in order to remove them? Ideally in a single operation, something like <code>content = [x for x in content if not x.isdecimal()]</code></p>
<p>(Sadly, isdecimal() and isnumeric() don't work here)</p>
<p>For instance, if <code>content = ['55', 'line', '0.04', 'show', 'IR', '50.5', 'find', 'among', '0.06', 'also', 'detected', '0.05', 'ratio', 'fashion.sense', '123442b']</code> I would like the output to be <code>content = ['line', 'show', 'IR', 'find', 'among', 'also', 'detected', 'ratio', 'fashion.sense', '123442b']</code></p>

<p>You should use a regex to test if a string is a decimal:</p>
<pre><code>import re
content = ['line', '0.04', 'show', 'IR', '50.5', 'find', 'among', '0.06', 'also', 'detected', '0.05', 'ratio', 'fashion.sense', '123442b']
regex = r'^[+-]{0,1}((\d*\.)|\d*)\d+$'
content = [x for x in content if re.match(regex, x) is None]
print(content)
# =&gt; ['line', 'show', 'IR', 'find', 'among', 'also', 'detected', 'ratio', 'fashion.sense', '123442b']
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">So what are you trying to achieve? Filter strings in a list that contain a decimal point? Keep those, discard those? Please do include inputs and expected outputs.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sorry, this was a badly phrased question. Edited.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">you wrote <i>a list of strings</i>. Post that list</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Please do include a sample list and the expected output. Try to think of edgecases (whitespace? thousands-separators?). Think the problem through.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks. There should not be whitespace. Thousands-separators... maybe but I don't mind if they slip through.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That's very good, but it lets single-digit numbers slip through.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Unstack You want to keep integers, don't you? single digit numbers are integers, so they are in the result list.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Unstack Anyways, I edited my answer, it should now remove integers as well.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">this should be a comment then not an answer!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for your correction, just realised what I did.</span>
