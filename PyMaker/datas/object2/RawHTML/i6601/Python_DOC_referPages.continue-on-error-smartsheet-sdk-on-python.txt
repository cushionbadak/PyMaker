<h1>Question</h1>
<p>How can I simply bypass this error to continue the program.</p>
<p>The exception of this error is handled by the smartsheet api sdk but i don't know how to call it.</p>

<p>If you want to catch this exception and continue, you'll need to use the <code>try</code> and <code>except</code> keywords.

<span class="comment-copy">I already search for that but I don't know wich expect is it or even where to place it to bypass the error  The test of the error should be like that :   ss.Users.get_user(id)   And then with that the catch error would be like that ?  try:     ss.Users.get_user(id)   except:     pass</span>
