<p>i am entering </p>

<p>Entering <code>py -3.4 -m pip install pygame</code> in the command-line is the least error prone way to install pygame on Windows (replace <code>3.4</code> by your specific Python version). </p>
<p>That is because you have to click a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#installation-steps" rel="nofollow noreferrer">checkmark</a> during the installation to add Python to the PATH and can't enter <code>python</code> in the command-line if you forget it and the <code>/Scripts</code> directory also has to be added to the PATH, otherwise you can't enter <code>pip</code>. But using the Python launcher <code>py -3</code> or <code>py -3.4</code> and running pip as a module <code>-m pip</code> usually works.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>First install pip</p>
<pre><code>python get-pip.py

<p>Add your python C:\Pythonx\Scripts to the system path</p>

<p>then run </p>
<pre><code>pip install pygame

<span class="comment-copy"><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/42663743/6220679">Try this</a>, just replace <code>3.6</code> with <code>3.4</code>. BTW, why don't you use the latest Python version?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">because i am using pyscripter which i have always used and it only supports 3.4.4:)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">and i have tried it using 3.6 and it didnt work aswell was getting the same error</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Did you enter <code>py -3.4 -m pip install pygame</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">that got me so far but then i got Command "python setup.py egg_info" failed with error code 1 in C:\Users\Kareem\AppData\Local\Temp\pip-build-fzmrdx00\pygame</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thanks it worked :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">pip is already install beacuse it comes with python doesnt it? and what do you mean by add it to the path?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@skk10101 yes, pip is already installed. Ignore this answer.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">In CMD set this path (pythonx -- replace it with your python folder name)  <code>set PYTHONPATH=%PYTHONPATH%;C:\pythonx\Scripts </code></span>
