<p>What's the difference between these two functions? I've seen people put quotes around type annotations and other times leave them out but I couldn't find why people choose to use one or the other.</p>
<pre><code>def do_something(entity: Entity):
    pass
def do_something(entity: 'Entity'):
    pass
</code></pre>
<p>Are there advantages or disadvantages to any of these?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Putting quotes around type hints is something that makes sense when making a <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/#forward-references" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Forward Reference</a> according to PEP 484. In this case putting quotes around a name is used to subdue a NameError that would occur.</p>
<p>In other cases, don't use quotes, it doesn't result in the hint you want: </p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def bad_foo(a: 'int'):
...     pass
&gt;&gt;&gt; def good_foo(a: int):
...     pass
&gt;&gt;&gt; bad_foo.__annotations__['a'] == good_foo.__annotations__['a']
False
</code></pre>
<p>though for now type checkers (mypy, atleast) don't seem to treat these differently, I wouldn't be sure if that would be the case in the future. Best to be clear and not use quotes when you actually don't need them. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">I think there was some chatter on a Python mailing list about making the resolution of type annotations lazy so you could define things later (in your example, define <code>Entity</code> below all the code).</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.get_type_hints" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>typing.get_type_hints</code></a> is the way to resolve type hints with forward references, if you need to do that.</span>
