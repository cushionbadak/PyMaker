<p>The coding that I am using to learn:</p>
<pre><code>import requests


r = requests.get("http://google.com")

f = open("./page.html", "w+")
f.write(r.text)
</code></pre>
<p>So if i understand all right this will create a .html file and write the google.com html code that i request (r) in it.</p>
<p>If i run this now:</p>
<pre><code>import requests

params = {"q": "pizza"}
r = requests.get("http://google.com/search", params=params)

f = open("./page.html", "w+")
f.write(r.text)
</code></pre>
<p>Does the <code>f.write(r.text)</code> rewrite everything that's on 'r' variable like it was a blank file or it will just edit the file with new stuff i add into 'r'? didn't knew how to ask. Thanks</p>
<p>EDIT: nevermind I am a noob! use <code>f = open("./page.html", "a")</code> if i want to append and 'w' if i want to overwrite</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>That all depends on how you open the file</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The mode indicates, how the file is going to be opened "r" for
  reading, "w" for writing and "a" for a appending.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>f = open("./page.html", "r")
f = open("./page.html", "w")
f = open("./page.html", "a")
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">you could just try it out yourself :P</span>
<span class="comment-copy">why not you are trying yourself by executing it, its appending or overwriting</span>
