<p>First, I'm still really new to Python. I've seen some examples that use %timeit and it looks really useful for doing some optimization work. The problem is, I haven't found how to actually get started with it. It looks like there's some similar ways to do this and I found some Python 2.7 examples too. Okay, so here's some easy points for a Python Guru out there.</p>
<p>I'm using Python 3.6.
What do I need to import? Either import syntax is fine.</p>
<pre><code>import xxxxx    or    from xxxxx import yyyyy
</code></pre>
<p>It looks like I can use %timeit on loops and some other constructs. Can they be used on "def" too? I'm fine if you drop me a link and say "rtfm", it will at least get me going in the right direction.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p><code>%timeit</code> is <code>ipython</code> magic; you can only use it by <a href="https://ipython.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">installing IPython</a> and using it as your interactive interpreter instead of plain <code>python</code>. It's built on top of <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/timeit.html#timeit.repeat" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the <code>timeit</code> module's <code>timeit.repeat</code></a> (possibly reimplemented; it does some extra work to make the results more useful to humans at a glance), which you can use in regular Python, but <code>%timeit</code>'s convenience requires <code>ipython</code>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">This looks amazing. So, I am trying to go the route of adding "ipython==6.2.0" to my requirements.txt file. It installs fine. I can even do "import timeit". But I still run into problems using "%timeit" and "timeit".  Rereading you answer, makes me think I can't use IntelliJ with it, since it uses the "Python plugin".</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@NickAllen: <code>import timeit</code> is unrelated; the <code>timeit</code> <i>module</i> ships with plain Python. Odds are IntelliJ is running a plain Python interpreter, not the <code>ipython</code> executable. <code>ipython</code> is much more than just a few libraries, it's a complete wrapper that replaces the interactive Python shell; you need to run <code>ipython</code> itself to get the magic features, merely having the libraries installed is insufficient.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for your time and insightfulness. I really appreciate it.</span>
