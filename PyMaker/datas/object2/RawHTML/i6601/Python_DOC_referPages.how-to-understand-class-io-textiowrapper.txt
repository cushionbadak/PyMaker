<p>The following is the code:</p>
<pre><code>fin=open("myFile.txt","r") # opening a file creates a file handle

for line in fin:
    print(line)

fin.close() # close file handle
</code></pre>
<p>My question is: how to understand the TextIOWrapper object fin? I mean, is it safe to say it is something with a sequence structure, where each item of the sequence is a line of your file with "\n" added? What else could I say about it? How do you understand it?</p>
<p>Any comments are greatly appreciated. </p>

<p>That expression <code>for line in file</code> splits (streams more accurately) the file by the new line delimiter until it reaches EOF. Think of it a stream that reads until it's a new line, and then returns the characters it just read. </p>

<p>File-like objects are <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-iterator" rel="nofollow noreferrer">iterators</a> that produce a line of text on each iteration. Iterators in general just means "things you can loop over exactly once"; files differ from this pattern on insofar as they can (depending on what the represent) be <code>seek</code>ed, which would reset the iterator to a new position in the file.</p>
<p>To be clear, they are <em>not</em> sequences; the term "sequence" has specific meaning, and includes the ability to index it, iterate it multiple times in a row or in parallel, all without manually fixing up state.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">It's not "with <code>\n</code> added"; the line contains the newline in your file too; at most, it's converting <code>\r\n</code> to <code>\n</code> (if it's a file with Windows line endings).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">so, the "\n" is with each line, as long as it does not reach EOF, right?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">When print line, the print function will add a new line effect automatically.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That's why, coding this way will print each line separated by an empty line.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I don't think it adds a newline but I do think it includes a newline</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@GarriganStafford: The iterator includes the newline (unless it's the last line of the file and it's not newline terminated), using <code>print</code> to echo adds another.</span>
