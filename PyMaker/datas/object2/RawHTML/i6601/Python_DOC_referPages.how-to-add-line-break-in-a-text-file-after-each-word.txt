<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have a text file with this contents "one two three four" and I want to create a new text file with one word for each line, like this: </p>
<pre><code>one
two
three
four 
</code></pre>
<p>I came up with this code:</p>
<pre><code>with open('words.txt','r') as f:
    for line in f:
        for word in line.split('\n'):
        print word
</code></pre>
<p>It prints each word in new line, so my question how I can write these words in new file that have one word each line?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You're close to the proper answer but you need to split the line differently. <code>for line in f</code> already reads the file newline-by-newline. So just do a normal split to break the line using whitespace characters. This will usually split text files into words successfully.</p>
<p>You can handle multiple files in a <code>with</code> statement, which is very convenient for scripts like yours. Writing to a file is a lot like <code>print</code> with a few small differences. <code>write</code> is straightforward, but doesn't do newlines automatically. There's a couple other ways to write data to a file and seek through it, and I highly recommend you learn a bit more about them by reading <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#methods-of-file-objects" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the docs</a>.</p>
<p>Below is your code with the changes applied. Be sure to take a look and understand why the changes were needed:</p>
<pre><code>with open('words.txt','r') as f, open('words2.txt', 'w') as f2:
    for line in f:
       for word in line.split():
           f2.write(word + '\n')
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">what's the difference between "each word in new line" and "one word each line"? seems like your code does that and is what you're looking for</span>
<span class="comment-copy">what i am trying to do, is to create text file that have one column, and each line have just one word form the old file</span>
