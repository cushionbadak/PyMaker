<p>Basically what I want is to have the program run and start back at the beginning until a command is typed. I have the repeat part working, but I can't get the loop to break when I want it to. I was trying to use an if statement to take the input and use it to break the loop. I've seen it done in tutorials, but I can't get it to work for me. I understand the break statement is to exit a loop, I'm wondering if it is possible to use the break statement in an if statement like so:</p>
<pre><code>while True:
    i == input('Type a letter:') #They type a letter
    if i == quit: #If they type "quit" this executes
        print('Goodbye') #The program says goodbye
        break #Ends the loop
    else:
        print("Your letter is", i) #If they type anything else, it gets printed
</code></pre>
<p>With this for me it just prints,:</p>
<pre><code>Type a letter: quit
Your letter is quit
Goodbye
Type a letter: 
</code></pre>
<p>if I type it, not breaking the loop. If it's not possible, does anybody have another way that I could get the same result, having the loop end when I type something like "quit"? Any help is appreciated.</p>

<p>You need to set <code>i</code> with a single equals sign (this may have been a typo in your post).</p>
<pre><code>i = input('Type a letter:')
</code></pre>
<p>You also need to put <code>quit</code> in quotes to make it a string. As you have it, you're comparing the user's input with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#quit" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the builtin <code>quit</code> function</a>, so they'll never be equal.</p>
<pre><code>if i == 'quit':
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>if</code> doesn't break. <code>break</code> does. If that isn't working, then the <code>if</code> condition is faulty, and you should print out some values like <code>print(i == quit)</code> before the if statement to see what's really happening</span>
