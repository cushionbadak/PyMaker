<p>I am pulling data from a Rally server, and would like to write it to a CSV file and create snapshots.
I am creating the file with:</p>
<pre><code>orig_stdout = sys.stdout
timestr = time.strftime("%m-%d-%Y")
f = open(timestr+'FileName.csv', 'w')
sys.stdout = f

#all of the setup and functions

sys.stdout = orig_stdout
f.close()
</code></pre>
<p>The output I am writing to file comes from:</p>
<pre><code>for item in response:
    print("%s, %s, %s, %s" % (item.Attribute1, item.Attribute2, item.Attribute3, item.Attribute4))
</code></pre>
<p>The problem is that the strings will occasionally have a comma in it already. This is true for every usual character. I do not wish to replace the commas in said strings. </p>
<p>Is there a special character I can use that an Excel CSV file would recognize and be able to split into columns properly, or can I somehow tell the file to delimit using a multiple characters such as ",,"</p>
</div>

<p>Python has a built-in csv modules that can handle various formats (such as excel)
 and can handle special options (such as escaping) automatically for you.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#writer-objects" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Writer object from the CSV module</a> sounds like what you're looking for. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">Have you looked at the <code>csv</code> module?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Oh I feel stupid now; I'm new to python (I mainly work with SQL or tools like Tableau). My initial search for an answer didn't turn up the csv module, but I could have guessed that one existed. Thank you for the help.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">One hint if you're new to python: Don't redirect sys.stdout to a file just to use print. Instead use an approach like <code>with open('file.csv', 'w') as out: out.write('text')</code></span>
