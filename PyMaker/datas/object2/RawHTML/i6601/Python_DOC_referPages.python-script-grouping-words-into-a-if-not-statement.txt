<p>Trying to figure out how to use an if not statement in which I can group three to four words to omit from a CSV file. Towards the bottom of the code, you'll see that I'm stuck at:  <code>if ('reddit', 'passwords') not in x:</code></p>
<p>Any help would be great.</p>
<pre><code># import libraries
import bs4
from urllib2 import urlopen as uReq
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup as soup

my_url = 'https://www.reddit.com/r/NHLStreams/comments/71uhwi/game_thread_sabres_at_maple_leafs_730_pm_et/'

# opening up connection, grabbing the page
uClient = uReq(my_url)
page_html = uClient.read()
uClient.close()

# html parsing
page_soup = soup(page_html, "html.parser")


filename = "sportstreams.csv"
f = open(filename, "w")
headers = "Sport Links " + "\n"
f.write(headers)

links = page_soup.select("form a[href]")
for link in links:
    href = link["href"]
    print(href)

    f.write(href + "\n")

            f2.write(x.strip()+'\n')

<p>Use the builtin function <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#all" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>all</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>if all(t not in x for t in ('reddit', 'passwords')):
</code></pre>
<p>Or <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#any" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>any</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>if not any(t in x for t in ('reddit', 'passwords')):
</code></pre>
<p>Here's it is in your context manager:</p>
<pre><code>with open('sportstreams.csv') as f, open('sstream.csv', "w") as f2:
    for line in f:
        if any(t in line for t in ('reddit', 'passwords')):
            # The line contains one of the strings.
            continue
        else:
            # The line contains none of the strings.
            f2.write(line.strip() + '\n')

<span class="comment-copy">It is unclear what you want <code>if (...) not in x</code> to do. Do all the elements have to be missing from <code>x</code>, or is any one of them sufficient to trigger the <code>if</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I guess my code is weak as I'm trying to simplify my results with any line containing the word "reddit" "/r/" and "/password" to be omitted. This will shorten my list of links which would be a success for me. :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Please edit an explanation into your question to make it complete. It would be nice if you could show specific examples of lines you want to omit vs ones you want to keep.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This isn't working my friend. What could I be doing wrong? I replaced <code>if ('reddit', 'passwords') not in x:</code>  with what you wrote. Doesn't omit lines that contain reddit or password. :(</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@JamesDean that's partially your own fault. The spec in your question is extremely unclear.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I apologize. What should I do in regards to omitting any line that contains those elements (reddit, /r/, /password)?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@JamesDean: I've added an example of the context manager to my answer. You want to omit lines containing <code>'reddit'</code> or <code>'password'</code>, correct? Your post is a bit unclear.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>if not any</code> would accomplish the same purpose more elegantly.</span>
