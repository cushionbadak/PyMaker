<p>I'm trying to do a program which would read the lines from a file, with lists-shaped sentences on each line. Each line would present like this:</p>
<pre><code>['First Sentence','Second Sentence','Answer 1',Line number,'Answer 2',Line number]
</code></pre>
<p>each of these elements in the list must be in a list, which would present like this:</p>
<pre><code>menuList=['First Sentence','Second Sentence','Answer 1',Line number,'Answer 2', Line number]
</code></pre>
<p>I tried to do it by just doing this:</p>
<p>the file, named test.txt:</p>
<pre><code>['Sentence 1','Sentence 2','Answer 1',2,'Answer 2',3]
</code></pre>
<p>the code:</p>
<pre><code>from linecache import getline
content=list(getline(test.txt,1))
print(content)
</code></pre>
<p>But the list I was supposed to obtain became this:</p>
<pre><code>['[',"'",'S','e','n','t','e','n','c','e',' ','1',"'",',',"'",'S','e','n','t','e','n','c','e',' ','2',"'",',',"'",'A','n','s','w','e','r',' ','1',"'",',','2',',',"'",'A','n','s','w','e','r',' ','2',"'",',','3',']']
</code></pre>
<p>If you don't understand this mess, the program basically stored each character of the line and stored them in the 'content' list.</p>
<p>So, do someone know how could I store the list as it was supposed to be stored? I can review the way to write things into the txt file, it's not a problem. But I need to have 6 parts in my lists, with the first part and second part of the sentence, the two answers, and the linked sentence where they lead to.</p>
<p>It is supposed, after cleaning everything, printing this:</p>
<pre><code> Sentence 1
 Sentence 2

 → Answer 1
 → Answer 2

 Which do you choose?
</code></pre>
<p>And the player choose one of the answers, linked to a value, which is the next line to read.</p>

<p>The given string is a python literal; you can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html#ast.literal_eval" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>ast.literal_eval</code></a> to convert the string to python object:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; ast.literal_eval("['Sentence 1','Sentence 2','Answer 1',2,'Answer 2',3]")
['Sentence 1', 'Sentence 2', 'Answer 1', 2, 'Answer 2', 3]

<p>Consider using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>json.loads()</code></a> from the standard library.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">It works very well. Thank you! How could I make this question "resolved"?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ok, I wrote [resolved] in the title too.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Did you try that?  It doesn't like the single quotes.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Just replace quotes: <code>json.loads(line.replace("'", '"')</code>. You also mentioned <code>Line number</code> in a couple of places where apparently <code>2</code> or <code>3</code> would be returned by <code>loads()</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">but... isn't json.loads() used to read json files? I don't know how to use json files</span>
<span class="comment-copy">load() accepts a file-like object, while loads() accepts a string. Please consult the decoding docs, linked to in my answer.</span>
