<p>My machine runs on Windows 10, I have installed recently python 3.6 along with my previous python 2.7, unable to import libraries in python 3.6.</p>

<p>You can reinstall all libraries installed by saving list of them:</p>
<p><code>python -m pip freeze &gt; libraries.txt</code></p>
<p>(please notice <code>python</code> is Python 2.7 here)</p>
<p>Next you should install all of them with Python 3:</p>
<p><code>python3 - pip install -r libraries.txt</code></p>
<p>But not all old libraries are compatible with new version of Python!</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">the libraries are not reusable between different python versions. you will want to reinstall those libraries again for python 3.6. i.e. <code>python3 -m pip install SomePackage</code> <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html#basic-usage" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html#basic-usage</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">command line throws error python3 is not recognized</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You should locate <code>python3</code> and use full path or add it to <code>PATH</code> environment variable. Try type <code>where python3</code> to find full path.</span>
