<p>When using the <a href="http://docs.python-requests.org" rel="nofollow noreferrer">requests</a> and <a href="https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">BS4</a> modules, with placed breakpoints, it often throws an exception (or even more than one) on the lines where the <code>request.get</code> and <code>bs4.BeautifulSoup</code> located. Without setting breakpoints, there are no errors.</p>
<pre><code>def func_a(link):
    request = requests.get(link)
    soup = bs4.BeautifulSoup(request.text, 'lxml')
    soup = soup.find('a', {'class': 'mva_item'})
    result = soup['href']
    return result
</code></pre>
<p>Do such exceptions affect the execution time of the program?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>In general you should only worry about performance where you have specifically observed a problem. If you can show that these exceptions are slowing down your program to a level you are not satisfied with, you can consider doing something about it. I doubt it's a problem. Your code has to fetch information from the Internet, no optimisation will change that. If they were slowing things down, you could probably do nothing about it anyway.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">This is very vague. Provide some code and more detail.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@AlexHall added some code</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What do you mean "with placed breakpoints, it often throws an exception...Without setting breakpoints, there are no errors". Is this in a debugger? Which debugger? What exactly does it show?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@AlexHall VS code, while you press F9 it sets breakpoint</span>
