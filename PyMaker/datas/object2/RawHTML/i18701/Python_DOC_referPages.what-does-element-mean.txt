<p>I was reading the python documentation where I came across <code>elem [,n]</code> this notation for arguments. I have seen such notations in past. Don't just know what they mean. Also, google doesn't support searching brackets.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The Python documentation has a <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/reference/introduction.html#notation">section about the used notation</a>, which says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[…] a phrase enclosed in square brackets (<code>[ ]</code>) means zero or one occurrences (in other words, the enclosed phrase is optional).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This notation originates from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backus%E2%80%93Naur_Form">Backus–Naur Form (BNF)</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>It means that the argument so bracketed is optional.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Generally this means that the parameter within the square brackets is optional; however, without a link to the specific documentation it's hard to say.</p>
