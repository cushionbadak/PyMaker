<p>Normally, executing the following code will <strong><a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html" rel="nofollow">pickle</a></strong> an object to a file in my <code>current</code> directory:</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Cool thanks. Is your way to open the file preferred to what I did? Or more "pythonic", I should say.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It is preferred, because it closes the file for you in a <code>try: ... finally: f.close()</code> fashion. You should read about the Python context manager, it's a really great feature in many situations.</span>
