<p>Here is an example.  </p>
<p>The file has a string: <code>4;4;4;8;4;4;4;9;9;4;4</code>.</p>
<p>I would like it to output: </p>
<pre><code>4;4;4
8
4;4;4
9
9
4;4 
</code></pre>
<p>In this example the limit determining when to splice would be any number greater than 4. I have tried looking at the python libraries and other questions here.  My guesses have involved the following:</p>
<pre><code>listA = [] 
listB = []
for i in line:
    listA.append(i)

for item in listA:
    if int(item) &gt; 4:
         listB.append(item)
    else:
         item = item

print(listA)
print(listB)
</code></pre>
<p>Is there a more efficient and faster way?  I am sure there is but I am not that experienced in python and would appreciate the help!  </p>

<p>Use <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.groupby" rel="nofollow"><code>itertools.groupby</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>from itertools import groupby

for key, group in groupby(line.split(';'), key=lambda i: int(i) &gt; 4):
    if key:
        for i in group:
            print(i)
    else:
        print(';'.join(group))
</code></pre>
<p>Demo:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; for key, group in groupby(line.split(';'), key=lambda i: int(i) &gt; 4):
...     if key:
...         for i in group:
...             print(i)
...     else:
...         print(';'.join(group))
... 
4;4;4
8
4;4;4
9
9
4;4
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>groupby</code> utility function groups sequences by a key; here by wether or not the values are greater than 4 or not; each iteration gives us a sequence of values that are one or the other  If the values in the current group <em>are</em> indeed greater we print them on seperate lines, otherwise they are joined again into one string with semicolons. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">I will be doing this for thousands of lines in a file, so a loop generating lists would also be great!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks Martijn for the formatting.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">When I run this with an example <code>line = 4;4;4;5;4;4</code> it says that there is a Type_error where the 'int' object is not iterable.  When I do the same thing with <code>line = '4;4;4;5;4;4'</code> it says there is an invalid literal for int() base 10.  I think this refers to the ";".  Let me know what you think.  Thanks @Martijn Pieters</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Also... I am a little confused as to what the above answer really means.  An explanation would be greatly appreciated.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Note that this retains <code>9;9</code> while the OP's example shows they're expecting the <code>9</code>'s as separate groups...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I would appreciate it if the <code>9</code>'s were separate groups.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why are the <code>9</code>s separate but not the last two <code>4</code>s?</span>
