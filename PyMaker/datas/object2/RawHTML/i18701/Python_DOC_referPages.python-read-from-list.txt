<p>I have a question about lists in python and how to print from them. Which of the following code snippets prints all 7 words found in the list "words"? I have compiled and tried it but I still don't know which of this snippets is correct.</p>
<pre><code>1.
i = 0 
while i &lt; 7: 
    print(words[i], end=" ")
i += 1

2.
i = 0 
while i &lt; 7: 
    print(words[i], end=" ")
    i += 1
3.
i = 1 
while i &lt; 7: 
    print(words[i], end=" ")
    i += 1

4.
i = 0 
sum = "" 
while i &lt; 7: 
    sum += words[i] 
    i += 1 
print(sum)

5.
i = 0 
sum = "" 
while i &lt;= 7: 
    sum += words[i] 
    i += 1 
print(sum)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If your list looks something like this, <code>words = ["a","b","c"..]</code>,</p>
<p>All you have to do is iterate over them using the <code>for</code> statement,</p>
<pre><code>for i in words:
    print i
</code></pre>
<p>That should print out the words:</p>
<pre><code>a
b
c
....
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This shouldn't be all that difficult to follow as a dry run (use pen and paper if you need to).
You'll need to remember that if <code>words</code> has 7 elements, they are words[0]...words[6]. ie the list index starts at 0</p>
<p>Obviously you haven't been able to run them. How did you try to run them? What went wrong?</p>
<p>If you still can't work it out, a good strategy is to fall back to the answer that has the most in common with the other answers...answer 2 :)</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Answer: None are correct. They are all wrong. Presuming to know how many words that should be found is the starting point of why this is wrong.</p>
<p>The point of putting the words you found into a list is so that you can separate the responsibility of finding results to printing them.  To decouple them one can't know about the other.  More specifically; you don't care how many are in the list, you just need to know how print the list.  As such you are really just asking "How do I print a list". </p>
<p>Secondly, there is no compiling in python.  Have you tried reading <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/" rel="nofollow">http://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/</a> ?
or <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/" rel="nofollow">http://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/</a> </p>
<p>For code of a correct answer see @enginefree's answer.</p>
<p>Even if you are going to do it the way you are doing it with indexes i would suggest</p>
<pre><code>for i in range(0..MAX_ELEMENTS-1):
    print words[i]
</code></pre>
<p>I also would strongly discourage use of while loops for a problem with a definite knowable boundary of operations such as iteration over a collection from the outset of the operation.  While generally implies changing conditions, unknowable endpoints and the need for custom increment control. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">What output do you get when you try?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">FYI, <code>print " ".join(words)</code> would more pythonic.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Can I go for <code>print(*words, sep='\n')</code>? Seriously though - why don't you just run them and see? And what is correct - you're in the best position to determine that surely?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I hope this isn't from a course where they are teaching Python. It looks like a question that's been "ported" from some other language.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Is your question how to run them, or which is the correct answer? Hurry it's about to be closed.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is wrong. I think you meant <b>print i</b></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@radicalbiscuit Thanks. I guess I am a bit tired.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That's horribly unpythonic and isn't resuable.  What do you do when there are 6 results.. etc.  @enginefree got it right.</span>
