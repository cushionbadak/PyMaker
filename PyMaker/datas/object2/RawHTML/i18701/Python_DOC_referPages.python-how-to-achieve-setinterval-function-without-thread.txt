<p>I want when a function execute finsish, before the next function execute it could wait some time </p>
<p>and I know the <code>setinterval</code> or <code>settimeout</code> effect could achieve through <code>multithreading</code> or somthing</p>
<p>but I want deploy my app to some <code>Paas</code> platform, I am afraid the <code>thread</code> is not allowed</p>
<p>Another way I have consider is do some operation which take some time, like:</p>
<pre><code>for i in range(30000):
    print i
</code></pre>
<p>but I'm not sure the <code>print</code> could be executed on in the background</p>
<p>So what can I do?</p>
