<p>In Python, the <strong>List</strong> is one type of homogeneous sequences, while the <strong>Tuple</strong> is one type of heterogeneous sequences. But in a List, we still can put arbitrary type of data in it, like <code>a=[1, 2, 'abc']</code>. So, what's the real difference between homogeneous and heterogeneous sequences in Python?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Lists and tuples are mostly identical in Python, except that lists are mutable and tuples are immutable.  Both lists and tuples can be either homogeneous or heterogeneous.</p>
<p>If you want sequences with enforced homogeneity, use the <code>array</code> module or use NumPy, for example.</p>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>From the <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#sequence-types-list-tuple-range" rel="nofollow">Python Documentation for sequence types</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lists are mutable sequences, <strong>typically</strong> used to store collections of homogeneous items (where the precise degree of similarity will vary by application).</p>
<p>Tuples are immutable sequences, <strong>typically</strong> used to store collections of heterogeneous data (such as the 2-tuples produced by the enumerate() built-in). Tuples are <strong>also</strong> used for cases where an immutable sequence of homogeneous data is needed (such as allowing storage in a set or dict instance).</p>

<span class="comment-copy">There isn't one.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Both lists and tuples can contain instances of different types. The main difference between them is that tuples are immutable. Where did you read lists were homogeneous sequences in Python?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I've downvoted this because python lists are not in fact homogenous.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Marcin: I'm not sure that's an appropriate reason for a downvote.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@FrédéricHamidi I made a mistake. In the document, it says that "Lists are mutable, and their elements are usually homogeneous and are accessed by iterating over the list." I missed the word "usually" here. You're right, thanks.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Lists and tuples should not be used interchangeably in most circumstances, while your answer seems to imply the contrary.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@arshajii: I was very careful to limit my answer to facts about the sequences themselves.  This is not an appropriate place to opine about which type is better.</span>
