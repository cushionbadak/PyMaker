<p>I have a list like so: </p>
<pre><code>["('JAX', 'IAH')", "('IAH', 'ORD')"]  # flight goes JAX -&gt; IAH, then IAH -&gt; Chicago
</code></pre>
<p>But occasionally I find items like this, which I need to flag / dump:  </p>
<pre><code>["('JAX', 'IAH')", "('IAH', 'JAX')"]  # flight is an out-and-back --&gt; dump it
</code></pre>
<p>These only happen when <code>listlen</code> = 2 so I have been trying to come up with something clever, but cannot — I've already burned my last brain cell getting 150M records up in Redis this weekend.</p>
<p>Anyone?</p>

<p>You can invert a tuple with a slice:</p>
<pre><code>l[0] == l[1][::-1]
</code></pre>
<p>If you need to convert the strings into tuples, you can use <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html#ast.literal_eval" rel="nofollow"><code>ast.literal_eval</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import ast
&gt;&gt;&gt; ast.literal_eval("('JAX', 'IAH')")
('JAX', 'IAH')
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Why are those strings? (Are they actually tuples?)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, they are tuples.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>l[0] == l[1][::-1]</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">So they’re <i>not tuples</i>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ToddCurry minitech's solution was based on your answer that they were actual tuples. If they were, then his answer is correct. If instead they're strings then you misled him.</span>
