<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>    lrgstPlace = features[0]
    strLrgstPlace = str(lrgstPlace)
    longtide = re.match("r(lat=)([\-\d\.]*)",strLrgstPlace)
    print (longtide)
</code></pre>
<p>This is how my features list looks like</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Feature(place='28km S of Cliza, Bolivia', long=-65.8913, lat=-17.8571, depth=358.34, mag=6.3)
  Feature(place='12km SSE of Volcano, Hawaii', long=-155.2005, lat=19.3258333, depth=6.97, mag=5.54)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why does the regex cant match anything?Its just gives me "None" as a result.</p>
<p>EDIT - 
Moved r outside and used .search</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I think you meant to put the r outside the quotes:
<code>r"(lat=)([\-\d\.]*)"</code></p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Move the <code>r</code> out of the regex...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You also probably don't want to capture the "lat", but only the number that follows: r"lat=([\-\d\.]*)"</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You might also want <code>re.search</code> instead of <code>re.match</code>.</span>
