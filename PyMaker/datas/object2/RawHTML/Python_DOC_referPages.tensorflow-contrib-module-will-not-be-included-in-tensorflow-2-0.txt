<p>I am training my own model using Python on Windows 10 with TensorFlow 2.0 and Python 3.6, Anaconda 3. When I run the commands:</p>
<pre><code>python train.py --logtostderr --train_dir=training/ --pipeline_config_path=training/faster_rcnn_inception_v2_pets.config
</code></pre>
<p>to train my images, it shows that The Tensorflow Contrib module will not be included in TensorFlow 2.0. What should I do with TensorFlow now? Do I need to upgrade or downgrade TensorFlow? Which Anaconda Promt commands should I run?</p>

<p><code>tf.contrib.*</code> will indeed disappear from tensorflow, and will not even make it to the <code>tf.compat*</code> namespace.</p>
<p>It is one of the breaking change in TF 2.0. There are many, many others, as it is not only a major revision of TF but a complete change of mindset IMHO. Generally speaking, you cannot really expect a TF 1.x script to run smoothly in TF 2.0, even after a run of their automatic conversion script. You <em>will</em> need to rewrite your code, and before that, rethink your way of working with TF, especially if you were ignoring the Keras API.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Right now only TF 2.0 alpha is available, you shouldn't be using it to run existing code as it breaks API.</span>
