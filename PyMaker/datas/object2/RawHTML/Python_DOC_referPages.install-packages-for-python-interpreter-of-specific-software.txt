<p>I have a question regarding installing a python package like <strong>pathlib2</strong> for the python interpreter that comes with a software called Nuke for example.
In this case the python executeable is located in the following directory </p>
<pre><code>C:\Program Files\Nuke11.1v6\python.exe
</code></pre>
<p>Because it is shipped by a piece of software, it looks a little different to your default python installation, at least for my knowledge. For example, I believe the modules are located inside <code>pythonextensions\site-packages</code> and I cannot find the typical "Scripts" folder in which pip.py should be. </p>
<p>The closest thing I found is <code>C:\Program Files\Nuke11.1v6\lib\ensurepip\_bundled</code> with pip-9.0.1-py2.py3-none-any.whl and setuptools....... but so far nothing else</p>
<p>What I tried: 
I cd'ed into the Nuke folder and ran <code>python.exe -m pip install pathlib2</code> which returned with the error No module named pip, as predicted. 
I am sure it is bad practice to change the python interpreter of a software but I have no other option. Therefore I would like to modify the python version as less as possible (like using the pip it comes with if possible, instead of installing a new pip).</p>
<p>Second question: does a pip install always install with the compiler for the current python version in mind? For example, this article explained that the module numpy uses c compiled code, which has to be compiled against the same compiler of the python installation.</p>
<p>Thanks for the help.</p>

<p>You have <code>ensurepip</code>, good. First try</p>
<pre><code>"C:\Program Files\Nuke11.1v6\python.exe" -m ensurepip
</code></pre>
<p>to install <code>pip</code>. Now do</p>
<pre><code>"C:\Program Files\Nuke11.1v6\python.exe" -m pip install pathlib2
</code></pre>
<p>You better remove the second question and ask it in a separate topic.</p>
