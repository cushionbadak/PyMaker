<p>I have the following code:</p>
<pre><code>route = [0, 7, 3, 0]
for first, second in zip(route, route[1:])
</code></pre>
<p>I use zip to get a pair of numbers then I want to add a new number between the predetermined pair. For example, I want to add 5 between 0 and 7 of the first pair. How can do it? Thanks a lot.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>To add a new number between a random pair of numbers in the list, you can try this:</p>
<pre><code>route = [0, 7, 3, 0]
import random
new_val = 5
route.insert(random.randint(1, len(route)-1), new_val)
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>[0, 7, 3, 5, 0]
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy"><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>list.insert</code></a> is what you want</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes but how to define position of first and second in the route according to the route and it should be randomly with pair of numbers.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks. My idea is I check every pair of elements and then add number inside. Not "randomly" as you suggested. Thanks :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@TienNguyen could you post an example of what you would like your final output to be?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I cut a part of my code and posted above. My problem is create a route in which I insert new node, it makes the route shorter. I need to choose each pair of node. For example the distance from node [0] to node[7] is 20. When I add node[4], the route from [0][4] +[4][7] = 18. So I will insert 4 between 0 and 7. That's why I use first, second and zip above :)</span>
