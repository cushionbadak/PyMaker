<p>Use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/csv.html#module-csv" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>csv</code></a> module using space as the delimiter. Process row-by-row if that suits your application, or read the data into a list of lists to provide random access to the data. Example:</p>
<pre><code>import csv

with open('file.csv') as f:
    data = [row for row in csv.reader(f, delimiter=' ')]

print(data[0][2])
print(data[3][3])
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre>
31
1001
</pre>

<span class="comment-copy">will it work for text file?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">CSV is a text file with the data formatted as CSV. If you mean some arbitrary text file with some other format then, no, it won't work.</span>
