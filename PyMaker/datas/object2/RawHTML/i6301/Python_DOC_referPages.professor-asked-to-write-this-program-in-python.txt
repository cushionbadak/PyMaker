<p>Professor asked to write this program in python:</p>
<p>Problem<br/>
Write a program to prompt for the number of triangles and the height of each triangle, then print out all the specified triangles.</p>
<p>The triangles should have the following format:</p>
<pre><code>How many triangles: 2

The height of the triangle: 3

1  3     5  
 7     9   
 11   

The height of the triangle: 4

1     3     5     7   
9    11    13   
15    17   
 19   

Process finished with exit code 0


How many triangles: 3

The height of the triangle: 1

1   

The height of the triangle: 3

1     3     5   
  7     9   
 11   

The height of the triangle: 5

 1     3     5     7     9   
 11    13    15    17   
 19    21    23   
 25    27   
 29

</code></pre>
<p>I got this so far:</p>
<pre><code>number = eval(input("Enter height"))

for i in range(1, number+1):
    for j in range(i, 10):
        print(j+i, end="\t")
    print("\n")
    print()
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>you need to take the range in opposite order : </p>
<pre><code>number = int(input(("Height of triangle : ")))
odd_number = 1
for i in range(number, 0, -1):
    for j in range(0, i):
        print("{}".format(odd_number), end="\t")
        odd_number += 2
    print("\n")
</code></pre>
