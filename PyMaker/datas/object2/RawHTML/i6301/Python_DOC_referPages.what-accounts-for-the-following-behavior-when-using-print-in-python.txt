<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have the following code:</p>
<pre><code> import numpy as np
 import math as mat

 list_of_numbers = {int(mat.sqrt(x)) for x in range(7)}

 print(list_of_numbers)
</code></pre>
<p>I was expecting the output to be the square root of each number from zero to 6. </p>
<p>i.e., [0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2]</p>
<p>Why is it that Python only prints </p>
<pre><code>[0, 1, 2]
</code></pre>
<p>I have checked the documentation on print <a href="https://www.python-course.eu/python3_print.php" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.python-course.eu/python3_print.php</a></p>
<p>It seems that there is no reference about print not printing duplicate values. Can anyone help?</p>

<p>You have created a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#sets" rel="nofollow noreferrer">set literal</a> here:</p>
<pre><code>list_of_numbers = {int(mat.sqrt(x)) for x in range(7)}
</code></pre>
<p>Sets don't store duplicates. They're useful data structures for checking membership for things that can be hashed.</p>
<p>They are definitely not the same thing as lists.</p>
<p>To create a list, you just need to swap <code>{</code> and <code>}</code> for <code>[</code> and <code>]</code>:</p>
<pre><code> list_of_numbers = [int(mat.sqrt(x)) for x in range(7)]
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>It is because you are using a Set instead of a List. Try:</p>
<pre><code>import numpy as np
import math as mat

list_of_numbers = [int(mat.sqrt(x)) for x in range(7)]

print(list_of_numbers)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You need to change</p>
<pre><code>list_of_numbers = {int(mat.sqrt(x)) for x in range(7)}
</code></pre>
<p>to</p>
<pre><code>list_of_numbers = [int(mat.sqrt(x)) for x in range(7)]
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Change <code>{}</code> to <code>[]</code>. <code>{}</code> is for set and <code>[]</code> is for list. Set will only have unique elements so the output is correct</span>
