<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>              for i in magicList:
                    enemyName = myfont.render(enemy.name,1,(255,255,255))
                    number = []
                    number.append(i)
                    pos = len(number)

<p>I am trying to display on screen every item from the list 'magicList' as well as a number in front of that indicating the position so it would look someting like this</p>
<p>1) Fireball</p>
<p>2) Explosion</p>
<p>3) Heal</p>
<p>I have been able to display it with just the text but i can't seem to do it with the numbers, is my use of the len flawed or is it something else because everytime it try that it returns the error:</p>
<pre><code>    mDisplayText=myfont.render((str(pos, i)),1,(255,255,255))
    TypeError: text must be a unicode or bytes
</code></pre>
<p>it's weird that its like this considering pos <em>should</em> be an integer, but if anyone knows what's wrong here i'd love to know.</p>
<hr/>
<p>For anyone that is asking why i don't just do it without the numbers, I have to use the numbers because that is how the player will select it, doing this way means i can append a potentially infinite number of items to the list without having to pre-program them all.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I don't see any problem with the len function, I have seen below in the documentation, please see this, it is not obvious to say with out looking at your data, hence sharing this info.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Null characters (‘x00’) raise a TypeError. Both Unicode and char (byte) strings are accepted. For Unicode strings only UCS-2 characters (‘u0001’ to ‘uFFFF’) are recognized. Anything greater raises a UnicodeError.</p>

<p>One more thing I also suspect casting "str(pos, i) ", because I tried below lines to rule out the root cause and ended up having error "    print(str(pos, i))
TypeError: coercing to str: need a bytes-like object, int found"  </p>
<pre><code>i ='Some text'
pos =2
print(str(pos, i))
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">What are you trying to do with <code>str(pos, i)</code>? If you want to convert both <code>pos</code> and <code>i</code> then do it separately (<code>str(pos) + str(i)</code>). <code>str</code> only takes one argument to convert to string, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-str" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-str</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">I know that already and have made amends in the actual code, that was just leftovers from testing anyway since regardless it returns a type error</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The <code>TypeError: text must be a unicode or bytes</code> gets raised because you pass something else than a string to <code>.render</code>. The code snippet in your post raises a different error. Always post your actual code <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve">(a verifiable example)</a>, otherwise you make it difficult for us to help you to debug it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Doing str() was probably a bad idea, but the list is just a list of strings and pos should just be a number, so their is no Null Characters or anything like that</span>
