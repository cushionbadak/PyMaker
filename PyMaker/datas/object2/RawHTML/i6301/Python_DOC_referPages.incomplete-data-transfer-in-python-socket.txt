<p>I am creating a client server program on which client downloads server's files. it works fine in localhost, but the problem occurs in except localhost connection. I've tried googling but none of the solutions(from previously suggested to the same problem) works.</p>
<p>Here is my code:</p>
<pre><code>def upload(sock): # server.py
    filename = str(sock.recv(4096)).split(' end')[0]
    if os.path.exists(filename):
        sock.send('YES')
        sock.send(str(os.path.getsize(filename)) + ' end')
        foo = open(filename, 'rb')
        upbytes = foo.read(4096)
        sock.sendall(upbytes)
        while upbytes != '':
            upbytes = foo.read(4096)
            sock.sendall(upbytes)
        foo.close()
        print "\tUpload Complete !"
    else:
        sock.send('NO')


def download(sock, filename): #client.py
    sock.send(filename + ' end')
    if sock.recv(4096) == 'YES':
        filesize = int(str(sock.recv(4096)).split(' end')[0])
        print filesize, 'filesize'
        foo = open('downloaded_' + os.path.basename(filename), 'wb')
        downbytes = sock.recv(4096)
        foo.write(downbytes)
        downlen = len(downbytes)
        while downlen &lt; filesize:
            downbytes = sock.recv(4096)
            if not downbytes:
                break
            foo.write(downbytes)
            downlen += len(downbytes)
        foo.close()
        print 'filesize', filesize, 'downlen', downlen
        print "\t\tDownload Complete !\n"
    else:
        print "\t\tFile not found ! &lt;" + filename + '&gt;'

<p>I've tried different solutions but none of them worked!</p>

<p>Sockets have no concept of "messages" as you are using them. If you put <code>'YES'</code> then <code>'some_filename'</code> onto the socket, it's chance (helped by doing a local connection) that when you do a <code>recv(4096)</code> that it shows up as just <code>'YES'</code> and not <code>'YESsome_f'...</code>.</p>
<p>You need to either parse the stream into the messages yourself (store data received), or add a layer of something that has messages (like HTTP or ZMQ).</p>
<p>If you want to host files, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html#http.server.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>python -m http.server</code></a> can do that for you.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Hi and welcome to Stack Overflow. Its really important to ask questions properly here. Have a look at <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/how-to-ask">How to Ask</a> and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve">Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example</a>. Thanks. It's really important to tag a question correctly - adding the [vb.net] tag isn't appropriate in this case as the question seems to relate solely to python code. Thanks again.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@DavidWilson thankyou sir, for guiding me with that. but more importantly it would be great to know the solution of this problem. i am stuck here to move further :(</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you run <code>python -m http.server</code> (Python 3) that will host files from the current directory for you.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@NickT does http.server supports sending and receiving messages like socket does(with send(string) recv(string) ??</span>
<span class="comment-copy">HTTP supports messages. Sockets <b>do not support messages</b>, they are <b>streams</b>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">why is it that it works on localhost and not in other? its not that files are not transferring, it is only transmitted incomplete ! confused that is socket the only thing i've to work with or are there any alternatives for what i want to do with socket</span>
