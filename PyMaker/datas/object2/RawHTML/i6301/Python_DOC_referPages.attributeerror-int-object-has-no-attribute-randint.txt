<p>The problem is on giving a new random number for user to guess it. It displays an error: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>AttributeError: 'int' object has no attribute 'randint'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My code is right here:</p>
<pre><code>import random
print "Try to find the number I have on my mind in once !! " 
print "Everytime you are wrong the number will change !! " 
guess = 0 
energy = True 
while energy == True:
    random = random.randint(1,100)
    guess = input("What's the number ?? : ")
    if guess != random:
        print "Unfortunately you didn't find it  .. "
if guess == random:
        print "Unbelievable ! You found it .. ! " 
        energy = False
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Please make sure your files name are not random.py since python interprets this as a module.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>
<p>change your variable named <code>random</code> to something else. Like so,</p>
<pre><code>import random
print ("Try to find the number I have on my mind in once !! ")
print ("Everytime you are wrong the number will change !! ")
guess = 0 
energy = True 
while energy == True:
    number = random.randint(1,100)
    guess = input("What's the number ?? : ")
    if guess != number:
        print ("Unfortunately you didn't find it  .. ")
if guess == number:
        print ("Unbelievable ! You found it .. ! ") 
        energy = False
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>It is <code>randint</code>, not randit. That's why python is unable to find it. </p>
<p>Update:
You are doing 
<code>random = random.randit(1,100)
</code>
that is you are overriding the imported random with your random variable. Name it something other than a python keyword/module/function name.
For example: <code>random_val = random.randint(1, 100)</code></p>

<span class="comment-copy">Please show the full stack trace, not just the error message.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You could spell <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.randint" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><i>"randint"</i></a> correctly...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You fixed the code in the question ("randit" to "randint"), so the code no longer has an error.  Which means this question is no longer useful.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Please see my answer, <i>randint</i> is not the only problem here. It is actually a really relevant question that can happen to a lot of people.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It is not, It's named test4.py</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Do you have another <code>random.py</code> somewhere ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No, I do not...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">But you know, I can say you helped me. I solved the problem by changing the name of the variable "random". So it is like number = random.randint. and It works fine !</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@KostasPetrakis see edited answer for the same as before</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I fixed that, but it keeps displaying the same error .. My code right now looks like this : import random print "Try to find the number I have on my mind in once !! "  print "Everytime you are wrong the number will change !! "  guess = 0  energy = True  while energy == True: 	random = random.randint(1,100) 	guess = input("What's the number ?? : ") 	if guess != random: 		print "Unfortunately you didn't find it  .. " 	if guess == random: 		print "Unbelievable ! You found it .. ! "  		energy = False</span>
