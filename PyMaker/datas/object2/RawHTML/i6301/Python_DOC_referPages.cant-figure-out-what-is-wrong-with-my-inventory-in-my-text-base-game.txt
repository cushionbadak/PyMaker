<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>So I want to be able to remove and add items in an inventory that I tried creating in my game but I keep receiving an error. This is my code:</p>
<pre><code>inventory={}
def add_to_inventory():
    inventory.append()

elif choice == "use h on razor":
        print ("(pick up razor)")
        if "razor" in inventory:
            print ("You already got this item.")
            print ("")
            print ("Inventory: " + str(inventory))
        if "razor" not in inventory:
            print ("You walked over and picked up your razor blade.")
            print ("It's been added to your inventory.")
            add_to_inventory("razor")
            print("")
            print ("Inventory: " + str(inventory))
        game()
</code></pre>
<p>this is the error that I receive when I run my game:</p>
<p>(pick up razor)
You walked over and picked up your razor blade.
It's been added to your inventory.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Your error is occurring because <code>add_to_inventory</code> has no parameters in the function definition, but you are trying to pass <code>'razor'</code> as an argument to it. That's what <code>TypeError: add_to_inventory() takes 0 positional arguments but 1 was given</code>means.</p>
<p>Also, you are using the list <code>append</code> method, but you are making inventory a dictionary.</p>
<p>Here are two options that you could use depending on the functionality desired, one for the dictionary and one for the list. </p>
<pre><code>#DICTIONARY INVENTORY

from collections import defaultdict
inventory = defaultdict(int)

def add_to_inventory(item, amount):
    inventory[item] += amount

#LIST INVENTORY 

inventory = []
def add_to_inventory(item):
    inventory.append(item)

<span class="comment-copy">Welcome to StackOverflow.  Please read and follow the posting guidelines in the help documentation.  <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve">Minimal, complete, verifiable example</a> applies here.  We cannot effectively help you until you post your MCVE code and accurately describe the problem. We should be able to paste your posted code into a text file and reproduce the problem you described.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Look at the error.  It says <code>add_to_inventory</code> takes no arguments.  Yet you tried to pass an argument when calling it.  So make up your mind.  Should it take an argument or not?  If so, then <i>add it</i>.  If not, then <i>don't call it with one</i>.  It really doesn't get much more basic than this.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Voting to close - these bugs are at the level of typos (e.g., missing arguments).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">wow, thank you so much! The second option seemed to solve my problem!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That <code>if</code> / <code>else</code> pattern is a common one, addressed by the standard libraries. Consider using <code>inventory = collections.defaultdict(int)</code>.  <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.defaultdict" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/…</a></span>
