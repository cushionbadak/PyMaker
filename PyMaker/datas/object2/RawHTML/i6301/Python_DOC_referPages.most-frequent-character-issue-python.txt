<p>I am trying to Write a program that lets the user enter a string and displays the string that was entered and the most frequently occurring character in the string. The program can treat upper and lower-case characters the same. If there is tie, then both characters should be output. Use the following strings to test the program:</p>
<pre><code>The House on Haunted Hill
Python programming is fun
Gone with the Wind
</code></pre>
<p>The program works as its intended only on "Python programming is fun", but I only get the frequency of the character on the other 2, but not the letter. </p>
<pre><code>def main():

    string = input('Enter a sentence: ')

    string.lower()

    counter = 0
    total_counter = 0

    most_frequent_character = ""

    for ch in string:
        for str in string:
            if str == ch:

                counter += 1
        if counter &gt; total_counter:
            total_counter = counter
            most_frequent_character = ch
        counter = 0

    print("The most frequent character is", most_frequent_character, "and it appears", total_counter, "times.")

main()
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Try using these two lines after getting the input from the user. </p>
<pre><code>string = string.lower()
string = string.replace(" ", "")
</code></pre>
<p>You need to lowercase all the characters and then strip the whitespace (assuming you are not counting whitespace as a character).</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Actually, you <em>are</em> getting the most frequent character.  YOu left spaces in your input; space will often be the most frequent character.  Note the output:</p>
<pre><code>The most frequent character is   and it appears 4 times.
                               ^
</code></pre>
<p>See the extra space in there?  The middle one is your most frequent character.</p>
<p>Try changing your input conversion line to also remove spaces:</p>
<pre><code>string = string.replace(' ', '').lower
</code></pre>
<p>Now, the output is</p>
<pre><code>&gt; Enter a sentence: The House on Haunted Hill
The most frequent character is h and it appears 4 times.
&gt; Enter a sentence: Python programming is fun
The most frequent character is n and it appears 3 times.
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<blockquote>
<p>If there is tie, then both characters should be output.</p>

<p>If there are multiple letters with the same maximum frequency, then maybe use a list to store those letters.</p>
<pre><code>from collections import Counter
s = "Hello SO!"
c = Counter(list(s.replace(' ','').lower()))
max_freq = max(c.values())
letters = [letter for letter in c if c[letter] == max_freq]

msg = 'Most frequent character is {} and it appears {} times.'
print(msg.format(','.join(letters), max_freq))
# Most frequent character is l,o and it appears 2 times.

</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>alph = [0]*26

        if max_freq &lt; alph[ord(c)-ord('a')]:
            max_freq = alph[ord(c)-ord('a')]
for i in range(26):
    if alph[i] == max_freq:
        print("Character : ",chr(i+ord('a')),", Frequency : ",alph[i])

<p>The alph array is initialised to 0 for all characters from a-z. </p>

<p>ord(c) - ord('a')</p>

<span class="comment-copy">This is fine as a coding exercise. For production code, take a look at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.Counter" rel="nofollow noreferrer">collections.Counter</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">"I only get the frequency of the character on the other 2, but not the letter": what does this mean?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">One obvious problem is that <code>string.lower()</code> needs to be <code>string = string.lower()</code>.  Without assigning it to something, it has no effect.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It's also a really bad idea to overload the <code>str</code> type by using it as a variable.  You should use a different name.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Also it looks like you are not stripping the whitespace. So the most common character could be a space.</span>
