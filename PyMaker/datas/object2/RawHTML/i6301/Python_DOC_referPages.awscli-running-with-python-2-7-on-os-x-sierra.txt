<p>I'm having an issue with my awscli version + python versions installed on my Mac.
After several tries following <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-install-macos.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this</a> I managed to have it working, however, if i run <em>aws --version</em> I get <em>aws-cli/1.11.170 Python/2.7.10 Darwin/16.7.0 botocore/1.7.28</em></p>
<p>This confused me because I thought I had just installed python 3.6, so I decided to run <em>which python</em>, and it returned <em>/usr/bin/python</em></p>
<p>I was still unsure and after some research I found this:</p>
<p><em>$which python3 /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/bin/python3</em></p>
<p>Now i'm totally unsure which python version is the "main" one and if it is affecting my awscli, i plan to create a restapi using aws SDK with boto3 for Python.</p>
<p>How can i clean my python install or simply make sure my Mac is ready to work with the aws SDK + python?</p>
<p>PS.: I've tried <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3819449/how-to-uninstall-python-2-7-on-a-mac-os-x-10-6-4">this</a> to uninstall python 2.6, 2.7 and 3.6 (currently installed on my system i suppose) but nothing really happened.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for the help!</p>

<p>I would recommend creating a virtual environment to create an isolated environment for all the packages in your project. You can create a virtual environment of a specific python version using the following syntax in your shell:</p>
<pre><code>$ python3.6 -m venv env
</code></pre>
<p>One you activate the virtual environment, you can use pip to install packages into your local python instance:</p>
<pre><code>$ source env/bin/activate
(env) $ pip install awscli
</code></pre>
<p>Whenever you plan to run your application, or install packages for the project, simply activate the virtual environment.</p>
<p>For more information, see the documentation for the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">venv</a> module in Python's standard library.</p>
