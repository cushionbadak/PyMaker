<p>I have 2 arrays, for example:
[1, 2, 3] and [4, 5, 6]
How do i merge them into 1 big array?:
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
not
[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]</p>
</div>

<p><code>+</code> operator can be used to merge two lists.   </p>
<pre><code>data1 = [1, 2, 3]
data2 = [4, 5, 6]

data = data1 + data2

print(data)

# output : [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
</code></pre>
<p>Lists can be merged like this in python.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>By using the <code>+</code>  operator, like this:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; [1, 2] + [3, 4]
[1, 2, 3, 4]
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>l1 + l2</code>. You can simply add them.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Python makes this ridiculously easy: <code>[1, 2, 3] + [4, 5, 6]</code> that's it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">They look like plain Python lists, not <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/array.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">arrays</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@PM2Ring That's probably what he meant. I've seen quite a few people who don't understand the difference between list and arrays in Python. They use the two terms synonymously.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ChristianDean Indeed, and I'm doing my small part to reverse that trend. ;) It may seem a little pedantic, but when there are two built-in array-like types (lists and tuples), the arrays of the <code>array</code> module I linked above, plus Numpy arrays, I think it's important to give these things their correct names.</span>
