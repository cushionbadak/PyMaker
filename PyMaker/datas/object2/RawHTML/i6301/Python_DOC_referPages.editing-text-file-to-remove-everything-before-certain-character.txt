<p>So I'm creating a fake chat generator, I've gotten chatlogs of Twitch streams to make a massive chatlog text file. However they're formatted like this,</p>
<pre><code>[2017-10-14 05:27:17 UTC] beboh13: is this guy good
</code></pre>
<p>Is there a way to make a Python script to edit every line to remove the 4th space, so the message above would turn into this?</p>

<p>Okay so I solved my problem, you don't actually have to use Python, I just got my text editor, did CTRL+H to bring up the replace menu, made sure that the special command thingys were on. (The button was a picture of <code>.*</code>) Then did <code>.*UTC] .*:</code> to replace with nothing.</p>

<p>You can change your logfile to a csv format and do the following</p>
<pre><code>In [3]: import csv

In [3]: with open('twitch.csv','r') as file:
    reado = csv.reader(file, delimiter= ' ') 
    #make sure that the delimiter in the file is a space
    for row in reado:
        print(' '.join(row[4:]))
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">I think you need the <b>split()</b> method. Once you know how to use this built-in <b>spilt()</b> method, it will be lot easier :) <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#str.split" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Read about it here</a></span>
