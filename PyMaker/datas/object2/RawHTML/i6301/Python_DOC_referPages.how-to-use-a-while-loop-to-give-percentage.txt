<p>I’m trying to make a system where, if you input a number, it tells you what grade it would be, but it doesn’t work. </p>
<p>My code is</p>
<pre><code>percentage = input(“Please input a number”)
if percentage == 100:
     Grade = (“A*”)
     print (“A”)
elif percentage ==80:
     Grade = (“A”)
     print (“A”)
elif percentage == 60:
     Grade = (“B”)
     print (“B”)
elif percentage == 40:
     Grade = (“C”)
     print (“C”)
else:
     Grade == (“D”)
     print (“D”)

<p>The error says </p>
<pre><code>NameError: name ‘grade’ is not defined

<p>The below code working in python2.7. </p>
<pre><code>percentage = input("Please input a number")

<p>== and = are different operations. == is comparison while = is assignment.</p>
<p>Try the following code:</p>
<pre><code>percentage = int(input("Please input a number"))
if percentage == 100:

elif percentage == 80:
     grade = "A"

<pre><code>percentage = int(input("Please input a number: "))
grade = ''

if percentage == 100:
     grade = "A*"     
elif percentage == 80:

<p>There are a number of things going on here.</p>
<ol>
<li>Your input is a string, but you're comparing it to an int (always false).</li>
<li>You are only checking exact percentages, what about ranges? In your code, an input percent of 81 would result in a D grade, probably not the result you want for real-world input data.</li>
</ol>
<p>Try something like this:</p>
<pre><code>from collections import OrderedDict as od

CUTOFFS = od()
CUTOFFS[100.0] = 'A*'
CUTOFFS[80.0] = 'A'
CUTOFFS[60.0] = 'B'
CUTOFFS[40.0] = 'C'
CUTOFFS[0.0] = 'D'

def percent_to_grade(p):
    for k, v in CUTOFFS.items():
        if k &lt;= float(p):
            return v
    raise ValueError('Invalid CUTOFFS data')

def get_grade(percent=None):
    while True:
        if percent is not None:
            try:
                percent = float(percent)
                if percent &lt; 0.0 or percent &gt; 100.0:
                    percent = None
                    raise ValueError('Invalid value for percent')
                break
            except Exception as exc:
                print str(exc), 'Trying again ...'
        percent = input('What is your grade? ')
    ##
    grade = percent_to_grade(percent)
    return grade

def test():
    vals = [100, 80, 79.9, 39, 0, -2, 'TBD', None]
    for v in vals:
        print v, get_grade(v)
        print

<p>Run the <code>test</code> function to see this in action:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; test()
100 A*

80 A

79.9 B

39 D

0 D

-2 Invalid value for percent Trying again ...
What is your grade? 10
D

TBD could not convert string to float: TBD Trying again ...
What is your grade? 20
D

None What is your grade? 30
D

<p>I gave manual input to the last three so we could see all test cases.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>Grade == (“D”)</code> in your <code>else</code> section. That is a comparision and not an assignment operation.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Change Percentage to percentage in line one</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Are you sure that's the exact error message? there is no variable named <code>'grade'</code> (lowercase, python is case-sensitive)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">There are many syntax errors with this code. When comparing input strings with integers, you first need to cast the input to <code>int</code> with <code>percentage = int(input("Please input a number: "))</code>. Lastly, change <code>Grade == ("D")</code> from an equality test to assignment <code>Grade = ("D")</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">suggestion: the many <code>print</code>statements are unnecessary. just add one last line at the end: <code>print Grade</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Unnecessary to assign <code>Grade</code> if you're just going to print what it references.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This code just prints 'D' regardless of the input. Need to convert it to an integer.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Understood. Edited for the changes.</span>
