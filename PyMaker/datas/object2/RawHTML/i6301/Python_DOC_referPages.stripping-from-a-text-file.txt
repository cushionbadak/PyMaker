<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If my text file contains this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>['A', 'B', 'C', 21, '25', 'D', '6', '8', '100', 'A']['Q', 'W', 'E', 21, '11', 'R', 'T', 3, 60, 'C']</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and I want to collect the 1st item from each list into python- eg: A and Q. How would I do this?</p>
<p>I might want to collect the 3rd values later, eg C and E too</p>
<p>EDIT BELOW:
I now have the following code: </p>
<pre><code>def ADMIN():
        print("Welcome")
        ADMINoption = input("Do you want option A or B.\n").upper()
        if ADMINoption == 'A':
            import re
            file = open('Membership.txt').read()
            temp = [re.split("\W+", i)[1:-1] for i in re.findall("\[(.*?)\]", file)]
            list_of_members = [i[0] for i in temp]
            print("The following are the usernames of the Members:")
            #print (*list_of_members)      THE * removes [] from list display
            for a in list_of_members:
                print (a)
            ADMINchoice=input("Select the member details you wish to inspect\n").upper()

ADMIN()
</code></pre>
<p>it produces the following:</p>
<pre><code>"Welcome Do you want option A or B. a 
The following are the usernames of our members: 
DON21 
BAR50 
Select the member details you wish to inspect"
</code></pre>
<p>my text file contains:
['DON21', 'DONALD', 'TRUMP', 21, 'GYM', 'X', 'Easy', 5, 100, 'PO']['BAR50', 'BARACK', 'OBAMA', 50, 'SWIMMING', 'K', 'TRAINING', 3, 60, 'L']</p>
<p>How do I get the answer of the question to start returning the associated values from the list?
For example if I select 'DON21' it returns:
['DON21', 'DONALD', 'TRUMP', 21, 'GYM', 'X', 'Easy', 5, 100, 'PO']
or even a selection of the list such as 'TRUMP', 21, 'GYM'
??</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can try this:</p>
<pre><code>d = [['A', 'B', 'C', 21, '25', 'D', '6', '8', '100', 'A'], ['Q', 'W', 'E', 21, '11', 'R', 'T', 3, 60, 'C']]
s = [i[0] for i in d]
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>['A', 'Q']
</code></pre>
<p>Accessing the data from the text file:</p>
<pre><code>import re
data = open('filename.txt').read()
new_data = [re.split("\W+", i)[1:-1] for i in re.findall("\[(.*?)\]", data)]
final_data = [i[0] for i in new_data]
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks 'wwii', I hadn't realised to be honest with you. I will look through the tutorial when I have more time</span>
<span class="comment-copy">can d collect it from the text.txt?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">its saying this error:  "TypeError: list indices must be integers, not tuple"</span>
