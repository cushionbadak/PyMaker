<p>I am subtracting two dates in python 2.7 and getting wrong result in seconds. Apparently difference between these dates  is more than 24h which is 86400s. But I am getting 44705s, why is that and how to fix it ?</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; date1
datetime.datetime(2017, 10, 22, 11, 41, 28)
&gt;&gt;&gt; date2
datetime.datetime(2017, 10, 20, 23, 16, 23)
&gt;&gt;&gt; (date1-date2).seconds
44705
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Calling <code>.seconds</code> will only give you the seconds component of the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.timedelta" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>timedelta</code></a> object, which only takes into account seconds, minutes, and hours (see docs for more detail). If you want the entire <code>timedelta</code> in seconds, call <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.timedelta.total_seconds" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>total_seconds</code></a>.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; (date1 - date2).total_seconds()  
131105.0
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>date1-date2</code> is <code>datetime.timedelta(1, 44705)</code>.  You're only looking at the seconds portion.  Look at the days portion too.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Maybe you want <code>(date1 - date2).total_seconds()</code>?</span>

<span class="comment-copy">@irom Well, if it helps, I did post in the comments first :p It's up to you.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@StefanPochmann My finger slipped. (Y)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@StefanPochmann I'm not sure how to explain this, I can't seem to put it into words too well. What do you recommend?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sounds good now. Just maybe make it a link to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.timedelta" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this</a>?</span>
