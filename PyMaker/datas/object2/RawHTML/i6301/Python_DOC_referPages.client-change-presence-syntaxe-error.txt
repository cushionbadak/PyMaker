<p>You have to upgrade your Python interpreter to Python 3.5 or newer.</p>

<p>You are most likely using Python 3.4.</p>
<p>From here, you have 2 options. Either install Python 3.5 or 3.6 and continue using <code>async</code>/<code>await</code>, or convert your code to use the Python 3.4 syntax</p>

<span class="comment-copy">What version of Python are you using? <code>await</code> doesn't exist in all of them.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hoo.... Yeah... Was looking in the doc, and that how they use it. Juste erase await, and no more error. Thanks bro.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hmm. Deleting <code>await</code> will get rid of the Syntax Error, but I expect it was there for a reason in the first place. It is likely that the function will not behave correctly down the line. The real solution is to upgrade to a version of Python that supports <code>await</code>.</span>
