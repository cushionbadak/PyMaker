<p>I'm making a basic code for my python bot, but i encountered a problem: let's suppose that i have A variable, since A is a variable that is taken from an API, it's value changes. I want my bot to Print X when A varies of x% (for example, 10%). I know how to make the if statement but the problem is the percentage part, is there a way to tell my bot to print something when the variable changes of 10/20/30%?</p>

<p><strong>Considering the value hold by the variable is of <em>string</em> type:</strong> Firstly you should determine the logic based on which you calculate the difference of values. </p>
<p>For example, below is the sample code which determine the difference based on two conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Value at each index of the older and newer string</li>
<li>If two strings are of different length, fill the missing characters with '|'. Then calculate <em>percentage</em> change based on the length of bigger string.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sample code:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from itertools import zip_longest
&gt;&gt;&gt; old_a = 'Hello'
&gt;&gt;&gt; new_a = 'World X'
&gt;&gt;&gt; (sum(i!=j for i, j in zip_longest(old_a, new_a, fillvalue='|'))/max(len(old_a), len(new_a)))*100
85.71428571428571
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If the value of <code>A</code> is a <strong>number</strong> then this will work:</p>
<pre><code>percent_change = 100 * (new_A - old_A) / old_A
</code></pre>
<p>Or if you don't want negatives:</p>
<pre><code>import math

percent_change = math.fabs(100 * (A_final - A_initial) / A_initial)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Clear! I didn't know about itertools, thanks!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Matt5 If you are looking for the string change percentage, then please mention that in question too :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It should work, thanks!</span>
