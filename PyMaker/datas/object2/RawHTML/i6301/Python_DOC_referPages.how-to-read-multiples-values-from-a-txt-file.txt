<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I got a .txt file that contains multiple lines like this:</p>
<pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"><code>Hour: 10:51:17, Date: 01/14/2017 -- I: 14.13A V: 178.73V P: 2524.84W
</code></pre>
<p>How can I read each one of theses values separately?</p>
<p>I've already did a similar procedure in MATLAB using the code below:</p>
<pre class="lang-matlab prettyprint-override"><code>test_file = fopen('example3.txt');
A = fscanf(test_file,'Hour: %d:%d:%d, Date: %d/%d/%d -- I: %fA V: %fV P: %fW\n',[9,inf]);

data_file =A';
lines = size(A,2);
date1 = data_file(:,7);
date2 = data_file(:,8);
date3 = data_file(:,9)/1000;
</code></pre>
<p>I would to do a similar procedure in Python, but I can't find a way to read these values. I tried to be more explanatory.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Use regular expressions.</p>
<pre><code>import re

s='Hour: 10:51:17, Date: 01/14/2017 -- I: 14.13A V: 178.73V P: 2524.84W'
m=re.match('Hour: (.+), Date: (.+) -- I: (.+)A V: (.+)V P: (.+)W', s)

list(m.groups())

-&gt; ['10:51:17', '01/14/2017', '14.13', '178.73', '2524.84']
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">You will need to further explain what you are trying to do and also provide what you have tried to do so far to solve your task. Usually for these kind of tasks you look to split the line into parameters by some delimiter(s) and then process each parameter (e.g. convert to <code>datetime</code>). What are all these parameters and how do you intend to represent them in a graph? Are we talking a chart type <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chart" rel="nofollow noreferrer">graph</a> here or a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)" rel="nofollow noreferrer">graph</a> data structure (edges, vertices etc.)?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm actually new in Python programming. I've already did this in MATLAB using this code:  test_file = fopen('example3.txt');  A = fscanf(test_file,'Hour: %d:%d:%d, Date: %d/%d/%d -- I: %fA V: %fV P: %fW\n',[9,inf]);                    data_file =A';  lines = size(A,2);  date1 = data_file(:,7); date2 = data_file(:,8); date3 = data_file(:,9)/1000;  I would to do a similar procedure in Python, but I can't find a way to read these values.

<span class="comment-copy">It's fine that you're new to Python, but good Stackoverflow questions include your own attempts at the solution. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/asking">stackoverflow.com/help/asking</a> You may <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/posts/46900467/edit">edit</a> your question to include more information</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You need to parse each line of the file. The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#module-re" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>re</code></a> regular expression library module would be a good choice.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Simply tacking your MATLAB code onto the question is not even close to the same as actually trying to write some Python code that does the same thing. No cigar!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Named groups would probably be a good idea</span>
