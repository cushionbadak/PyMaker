<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I want to create a random list of names from a from a bigger list of names. The problem is, there is no space between the names that are generated. I cannot understand how to put space. Here's my code</p>
<pre><code>import random

final_list = ""

a=0

sss = ("John","Adam","Sara","Lory","Dick","Popeye")

while a&lt;7:

    x = random.choice(sss)

    final_list += x

    a += 1

print (final_list) 
</code></pre>
<hr/>
<p>The result is something like this:
SaraAdamDickPopeyeSaraPopeyeLory</p>
<p>How can I add space between the names? Also, can anyone suggest a shorter way to do this code?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can add an additional empty empty string at the original concatenation:</p>
<pre><code>x = random.choice(sss)
final_list += " "+x if final_list else x
a += 1
</code></pre>
<p>Or, more precisely, use <code>' '.join</code> in list comprehension:</p>
<pre><code>sss = ("John","Adam","Sara","Lory","Dick","Popeye")
final_string = ' '.join(random.choice(sss) for i in range(7))
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>To avoid leading or trailing spaces, check if length of <code>final_list</code> is already greater than zero.</p>
<pre><code>import random

final_list = ""
a=0
sss = ("John","Adam","Sara","Lory","Dick","Popeye")
while a&lt;7:
    x = random.choice(sss)
    final_list = final_list + " " + x if len(final_list) &gt; 0 else x
    a += 1
print (final_list) 
</code></pre>
<p>If you don't want explicit checking, you can make use of <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.strip" rel="nofollow noreferrer">strip</a> function to remove leading and trailing spaces after you construct the <code>final_list</code>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">this will not behave exactly right as a space will be appended before first name as well</span>
