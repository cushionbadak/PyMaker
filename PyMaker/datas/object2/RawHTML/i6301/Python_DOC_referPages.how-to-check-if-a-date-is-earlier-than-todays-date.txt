<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have a program that runs a Windows "net user" command to get the expiration date of a user.  For example: "net user justinb /domain"</p>
<p>The program grabs the expiration date.  I am taking that expiration date and setting it as variable <strong>datd</strong></p>
<p>In the example below, we'll pretend the expiration date given was 1/10/2018.  (Note: Windows does not put a 0 in front of the month)</p>
<pre><code>import time

datd = "1/10/2018"

# places a 0 in front of the month if only 1 digit received for month
d = datd.split("/")
if len(d[0])==1:
    datd="0"+datd
    print("Changed to: " + datd)

myDate = (time.strftime("%m/%d/%Y"))

print ("This is today's date: " + myDate)

if datd &lt;= myDate:    # if datd is is earlier than todays date
    print (" Password expired. ")
else:
    print (" Password not expired. ")

input(" Press Enter to exit.")
</code></pre>
<p>Right now, it gives me correct information if <strong>datd</strong> equals a date in 2017.  I am getting a problem with the year 2018 and on though.  It is telling me that 1/10/2018 comes before today's date of 10/24/2017.
Is there a way I change the format of the dates properly so that they are read correctly in this program?</p>
<p>I want the output to say that the <strong>"Password is not expired" if datd = 1/10/2018</strong></p>

<pre><code>from datetime import datetime

string_input_with_date = "25/10/2017"
past = datetime.strptime(string_input_with_date, "%d/%m/%Y")
present = datetime.now()
past.date() &lt; present.date()
</code></pre>
<p>This should do the job for you! Both handling day in format with leading 0 and without it.</p>
<p>Use <code>.date()</code> to make comparision of datetimes just to extent of daily date.</p>
<p>Warning: if you would like to be 100% correct and purist take care about timezone related issues. Make sure what time zone is assumed in your windows domain etc.</p>
