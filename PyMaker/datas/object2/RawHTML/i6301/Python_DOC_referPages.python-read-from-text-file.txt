<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I want my simple python program to go to a text file and collect 5 lines to print out.</p>
<p>I have got this far but it returns the whole file which I don't want to do yet.</p>
<pre><code>file=open('IH.txt','r')
text = file.read()
print(text)
file.close()
</code></pre>
<p>Can anyone help?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>How about</p>
<pre><code>file=open('IH.txt','r')
text=""
for i in range(6):
    text += file.readLine()
print(text)
file.close()
</code></pre>
<p><code>read()</code> reads the entire file. <code>readline()</code> reads only a line.</p>
<p>The loop has 5 iterations and in each iteration, the next line from the file is appended to <code>text</code> via concatenation.</p>
<p>You might also want to do exception handling.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Why don't you open a file using <code>return</code> and increment the counter variable by one. In case the counter reaches 5 do return.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">go through <code>https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/inputoutput.html#reading-and-writing-files</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Vidya, I'm a complete novice and don't know what 'return' is</span>
<span class="comment-copy">for i in range(6):         text += file.readline    #this works, thank you</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Actually, that is repeating in each iteration like you say, I just want it to print 5 lines in one go then stop, I later want to print the next 5 lines and stop again.  Any idea?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@UKcodeNovice What do you want to do after reading the lines? Would it be okay to make the lines as a list?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I want to ask a question about the lines</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@UKcodeNovice Have a look at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.islice" rel="nofollow noreferrer">islice from itertools package</a>. But even that is a form of loop it seems.</span>
