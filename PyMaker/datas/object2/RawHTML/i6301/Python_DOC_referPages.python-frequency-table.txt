<p>I want to make frequency table by below table.</p>
<p>number       1         2         4         6       Sum</p>
<p>frequency   0.4      0.25    0.15    0.2    1</p>
<p>And I wrote the below code.</p>
<pre><code>import random
from collections import Counter

number = [1, 2, 4, 6]

  s = 0
  n = len(p)
  for i in range(0, n):
    s = s + p[i]

  return y_cdf

    print('{0}\t{1}'.format(x[0], x[1]))

data = rand2_G(probability, 10000)
Table(data)

<p>But result is 
Number  Frequency
0   3990
1   2495
2   1521
3   1994</p>
<p>Above Table, Number is not 1,2,4,6.</p>
<p>How can I make frequency table with number 1,2,4,6(above number list)?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Starting with python 3.6, there is <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#functions-for-sequences" rel="nofollow noreferrer">random.choices</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>random.choices(population, weights=None, *, cum_weights=None, k=1)</code>
  Return a k sized list of elements chosen from the population with
  replacement. If the population is empty, raises IndexError.</p>
<p>If a weights sequence is specified, selections are made according to
  the relative weights. Alternatively, if a cum_weights sequence is
  given, the selections are made according to the cumulative weights
  (perhaps computed using itertools.accumulate()). For example, the
  relative weights [10, 5, 30, 5] are equivalent to the cumulative
  weights [10, 15, 45, 50]. Internally, the relative weights are
  converted to cumulative weights before making selections, so supplying
  the cumulative weights saves work.</p>
<p>If neither weights nor cum_weights are specified, selections are made
  with equal probability. If a weights sequence is supplied, it must be
  the same length as the population sequence. It is a TypeError to
  specify both weights and cum_weights.</p>
<p>The weights or cum_weights can use any numeric type that interoperates
  with the float values returned by random() (that includes integers,
  floats, and fractions but excludes decimals).</p>
