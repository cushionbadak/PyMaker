<p>I am new to python language and I have to create a right triangle that looks like this:
<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/y0duV.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer">right triangle</a></p>
<p>I cannot use print statements, I must use a loop, and I have to call functions to complete the loop. The functions are star() which prints a ('*'), space() which prints (' '), and newline() which prints("").</p>
<p>Any and all tips would be greatly appreciated. </p>

<p>You could think of it as a square where each row/column position determines which function to call.  To get a triangle you have to figure out the relationship between the row and column of each position that will produce the desired result.  In your example, you want a star() in positions where the column is greater-equal to the number of remaining rows.  Going through rows in reverse will provide this relationship outright:</p>
<pre><code>size = 4
for remainingRows in range(size,0,-1):
    for column in range(1,size+1):
        if column &gt;= remainingRows: star()
        else: space()
    newline()
</code></pre>
<p>Another way to approach this would be to consider the number of stars that you need to print on each line and call space() for the remainder of the line (before printing the stars).</p>
<pre><code>size = 4
for line in range(1,size+1):
    for _ in range(size-line): space()
    for _ in range(line): star()
    newline()
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">I can do the exact opposite of what I want  sp = 1     for i in range(size):         star()         sp -= 1          for j in range(size % size -sp):             star()         space()         newline()</span>
<span class="comment-copy">As per comment from avery, you need to do this yourself and then come back for help - that's the way you will learn. Here is a clue - think about creating a outer loop which is the height of the triangle, then consider what you need to do inside each iteration of that loop.</span>
