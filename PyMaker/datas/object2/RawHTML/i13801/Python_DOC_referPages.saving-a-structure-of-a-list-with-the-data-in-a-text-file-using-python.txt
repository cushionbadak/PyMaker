<p>I have a list of lists of tuples which I want to save in a text file as a string and later read it from another Python script and use ast.literal_eval to transform it from string to list.</p>
<p>My question is if its possible to write in a text file not only the data in the list but the whole structure my list of lists of tuples has.</p>
<p>For example to have a text file like this:</p>
<pre><code>[[(365325.342877, 4385460.998374), (365193.884409, 4385307.899807), (365433.717878, 4385148.9983749995)]]
</code></pre>
<p>Does this makes sense?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This sounds like a situation better suited to <code>pickle</code> than writing to a text file and using <code>ast.literal_eval</code>.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import pickle
&gt;&gt;&gt; l = [(1,2),(3,4)]
&gt;&gt;&gt; with open('new_pickle.txt', 'wb') as f:
    pickle.dump(l, f)

&gt;&gt;&gt; ================================ RESTART ================================
&gt;&gt;&gt; import pickle
&gt;&gt;&gt; with open('new_pickle.txt' ,'rb') as f:
    l = pickle.load(f)

&gt;&gt;&gt; l
[(1, 2), (3, 4)]
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>Writing out the repr will work, so long as all the values are Python built-ins with literal representations (e.g. int, float, str, bytes). But you shouldn't do this; it's limited to Python literals and slower. Use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html" rel="nofollow">pickle module</a>, the Python standard for serializing arbitrary data; it's faster, works with types that lack a literal representation, and (often) produces smaller output (particularly if you're using protocols 2 and higher).</p>
<p><strong>Edit</strong>: To your concern over reproducibility: pickles reproduce the original structure precisely.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Do you <i>need</i> the file to be human-readable? Why not use <code>pickle</code>? Or, if human readability is important, consider JSON - you get lists rather than tuples, but otherwise the structure is retained. You <i>can</i> do what you're thinking of, but it's not the best solution.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for the answer. I need to keep exactly the same structure cause I am going to use this list later in a python script which expects a list of list of tuples. The file wont be human-readable.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">In that case, use <code>pickle</code>. And if the data is huge you can always zip the pickle file. FWIW, Python code that processes a list of lists of tuples <i>should</i> work correctly on a a list of lists of lists, unless you need the immutability of those tuples, eg they need to be hashable so they can be used as dict keys or set elements.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks. This did the trick.</span>
