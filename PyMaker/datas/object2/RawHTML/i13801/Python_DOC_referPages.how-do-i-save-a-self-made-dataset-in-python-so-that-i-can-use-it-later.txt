<p>I created a dataset of arrays from PNG images. How can I save this dataset in Python such that I can access it later or in another Python script without having to rescan all the images?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use python's <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html" rel="nofollow">pickle</a> library to dump the data to a file.</p>
<pre><code>import pickle

dataset = [1,2,3,4]

with open('my_dataset.pickle', 'wb') as output:
    pickle.dump(dataset, output)
</code></pre>
<p>then you can load it back in another script.</p>
<pre><code>import pickle

with open('my_dataset.pickle', 'rb') as data:
    dataset = pickle.load(data)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">For small datasets <code>pickle</code> should be OK, as pointed out below in Brobin's answer.  If you want more fancy stuff like key-based or relational databases, you'll need something like <code>bsddb</code> or <code>sqlite</code>, both with Python bindings.  If you need high-performance, cross-platform floating-point access for huge datasets, <code>pytables</code> looks like a natural choice.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">my dataset is about 30,000 PNGs so could I still use pickle or would I need something more substantial?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">it all depends on what you get from those 30,000 image files.  If that's not too large just sticking with <code>pickle</code> is OK.  Maybe some examples?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I am just saving the numpy array representation of the image. i.e the RGB values stored in the array</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Unfortunately, I think that might be too much data to store in a pickle.</span>
