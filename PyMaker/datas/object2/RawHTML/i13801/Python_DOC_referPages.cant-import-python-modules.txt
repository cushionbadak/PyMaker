<p>I am trying to install EasyGUI. There is no <code>setup.py</code> so I can't install the module like you can with a proper module that has a <code>setup.py</code> file
Any help would be appreciated. Thanks</p>

<p>You haven't install them, you just have to put it a directory, where Python find them, e.g. in a folder is already in your <code>PYTHONPATH</code>.</p>
<p>Perhaps the best if you put <code>PythonXX/Lib/site-packages</code> directory.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Don't put manually python file into <code>PythonXX/Lib/site-packages</code> directory, use <code>pip install &lt;package-name&gt;</code> instead e.g.:</p>
<pre><code>$ pip install easygui
</code></pre>
<p>The advantage is that you can upgrade it later:</p>
<pre><code>$ pip install -U easygui
</code></pre>
<p>Or uninstall:</p>
<pre><code>$ pip uninstall -U easygui
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">After ten seconds of searching, I even located a video about how to install EasyGUI. What's your problem?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">how about some specifics. Operating system, python version.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I have reasearched and still havent found a solution. I have followed videos but it still is not working</span>
<span class="comment-copy">A small amount of research (ie "I typed <code>pip search easygui</code> into my terminal") suggests that you can install it with pip. I'd recommend that.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, this helped. I installed a fresh copy of Python 2.7 and then it created a directory for Python. Moved the module into there and it worked!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Was my pleasure :)</span>
