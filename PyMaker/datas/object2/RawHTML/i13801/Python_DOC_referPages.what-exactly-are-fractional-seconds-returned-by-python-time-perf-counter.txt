<p>This is probably a dumb/obvious question, but just want to make sure my hunches are correct.</p>
<p>I'm doing some basic performance timing in a Python3 script using time.perf_counter() like so:</p>
<pre><code>start = time.perf_counter()
# some time consuming operation here
end = time.perf_counter()
elapsed = end - start
</code></pre>
<p>And I'll get back values like 9.774 or 36.903 (to many more decimal places, of course). I'm assuming that larger numbers = more time elapsed, but what exactly do these numbers mean? E.g. is 1.23 fractional seconds just 1 second and .23 fractions of a second</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>As far as I know, "fractional second" just means a second with a fractional part (as opposed to a strictly integer number of seconds). So 9.774 means 9 seconds plus 774/1000 seconds.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">When a number is returned, like 1.23 for example, is that 1 second and .23 fractions of a second?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">From the doc: "Return the value (in fractional seconds)". What is unclear about that? To answer your question - yes.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Makes sense, thanks. I saw another post that had a weird answer, so I was confused <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8937708/what-is-a-fractional-second" title="what is a fractional second">stackoverflow.com/questions/8937708/what-is-a-fractional-second</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yeah I guess the term "fractional seconds" is a bit unusual, but they just mean seconds.</span>
