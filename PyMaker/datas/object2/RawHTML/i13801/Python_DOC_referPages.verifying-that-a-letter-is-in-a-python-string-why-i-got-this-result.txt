<p>I am new to programming, and am learning on Python 3.4.  I am working on an exercise to determine if a user defined letter is a vowel or consonant.</p>
<p>My original if statement looked as follows:</p>
<pre><code>letter = input('Enter a letter')

if letter == 'a' or 'e' or 'i' or 'u':
    print('your letter is a vowel')
else:
print ('your letter is a consonant')
</code></pre>
<p>this returned that my letter was a vowel every time.</p>
<p>I have since learned the answer was to  have an if statement that looks as follows:</p>
<pre><code>if letter == 'a' or letter == 'i' or .......
</code></pre>
<p>My question is why did my original if statement return that it was a vowel every time, and not give me an error?</p>
<p>My though process is that it is verifying that it is a string.</p>

<p>Any non-zeroish value evaluates to True in a condition.  Also, comparison operators (<code>==</code> in this case) have higher priority than logical operators (<code>or</code>,<code>and</code>,<code>not</code>).  (Details: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html" rel="nofollow">https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html</a>)<br/>
So python interpreted your if statement as:</p>
<pre><code>if (letter == 'a') or ('e') or ('i') or ('u'):
</code></pre>
<p>Since 'e' is not zero or zero-like, that part of the if was true, so your expression was true.</p>
<p>An easier approach than your working solution is:</p>
<pre><code>if letter in 'aeiou':
</code></pre>
<p>Which checks if letter is a character in the string.</p>
