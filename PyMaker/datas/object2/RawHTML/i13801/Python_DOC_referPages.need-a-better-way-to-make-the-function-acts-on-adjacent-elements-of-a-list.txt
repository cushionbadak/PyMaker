<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have a class A, a list of A instance(alist). Class A has an instance method (funca) that has only one parameter of another A instance and returns A instance.
Now I want to use "funca" to get the result of all the elements in "alist".
My script is like this:</p>
<pre><code>b = a[0]
for a in alist[1:]:
    b=b.funca(a)
</code></pre>
<p>I feel the code is ugly. Is there a better way to do this? (iteration or something?)</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You are essentially chaining the <code>A.funca()</code> calls based on the list, producing the call:</p>
<pre><code>alist[0].funca(alist[1]).funca(alist[2]).funca(alist[3])...funca(alist[-1])
</code></pre>
<p>You could use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#reduce" rel="nofollow"><code>reduce()</code> function</a>:</p>
<pre><code>from functools import reduce  # Python 3 compatibility
result = reduce(lambda a, b: a.funca(b), alist)
</code></pre>
<p>This essentially does the same as what your loop did, but in one line.</p>
<p>The <code>from functools import reduce</code> imports  the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.reduce" rel="nofollow">function from the Python 3 location</a>; in Python 2 it is one of the built-in functions. From Python 2.6 onwards it is also available in the Python 3 location for forward compatibility. </p>
