<p>I am building a project in python that requires the use of a small state machine. I could of course just make a bunch of states like</p>
<pre><code>__StateOne__ = 0
__StateTwo__ = 1
__StateThree__ = 2
# etc
</code></pre>
<p>and then just keep track with something like state = __StateOne__, but I was hoping to be able to do something like <a href="http://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/basic-types.html#atoms" rel="nofollow">elixir style atomics</a>. Would this be possible with some import or third party library?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Use enums:</p>
<pre><code>from enum import Enum

states = Enum('&lt;a descriptive name&gt;', 'one two three four')
</code></pre>
<p><code>states.one</code>, <code>states.two</code>, <code>states.three</code>... are now sorta like atoms, for your purposes.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Do you mean "atoms"? For what value of <i>"like"</i>? That is, which aspects of atoms' behaviour do you want? How about an enumerator (built into 3.4, available as a backport to earlier versions)?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">errr sorry yes. atoms. I'm not sure why I keep saying atomic. an enumerator might work. do you have a link?</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html</a> (just saying, it's the top hit on Google for <i>"Python enumerator"</i>...)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I've come to find that just because its a top hit on google doesn't neccesarily make it a good one :p</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Erlang/Elixir Atoms are by principle nothing more than: <b>stateX</b> = 'stateX'. Its like a constant having itself as value. That way different machines will always have the same value for that atom/constant. I cant see why you would need atoms for your state machine, constants will work just fine. Using enumeration could also benefit.</span>
