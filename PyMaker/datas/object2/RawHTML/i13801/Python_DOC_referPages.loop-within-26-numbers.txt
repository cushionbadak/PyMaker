<p>I have a number: 20. I want to be able to add 10 to it and get 4.
This is supposed to be looping the alphabet (numbers instead of letters)
Eg.</p>
<p>Start with 20
(adding 10)</p>
<pre><code>21
22
23
24
25
26
(again from 1)
1
2
3
4
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>As others have mentioned, you should go with the modulo operator (<code>%</code>) which gives you the reminder from a division.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; i = 20
&gt;&gt;&gt; i = (i + 10) % 26
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(i)
4
</code></pre>
<p>You could even create some kind of function for this:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def add_and_modulo(i, addition, modulo=26):
...     return (i + addition) % modulo
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; i = 20
&gt;&gt;&gt; i = add_and_modulo(i, 10)
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(i)
4
</code></pre>
<p>Although it's just one line of code, two calculations, so you're often better off just not writing a custom function, unless you use it a lot.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Sounds like a homework question ... What have you tried so far? What happened?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Another option besides the obvious modulo solution: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.cycle" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>itertools.cycle(range(1, 27))</code></a></span>
