<p>My team and I implemented a game in Python using Pygame. Whenever the game is run, alongside the GUI there is an extra black window that opens alongside, a .exe window. Is there anyway to stop it from opening? </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>That is a command window, specifically one running <code>python[Version Number].exe</code>. To remove it simply change the scripts file extension to <code>.pyw</code> instead of <code>.py</code>, which changes the file type to the same thing [Python], but without the console window opening too.</p>
<p>So for example, <code>script.py</code> would become <code>script.pyw</code></p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">I tried that but it forces the GUI window to shut as well</span>
