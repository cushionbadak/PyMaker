<p>When running <code>pip3 list</code> it shows packages installed for default python3.5, but I want it to show installed packages for another python installation, for example python3.6, which libs are located at <code>/usr/lib/python3.6</code>, how I can do this?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You'll have to run Python 3.6's pip.</p>
<p>On windows this is:</p>
<pre><code>py -3.6 -m pip list
</code></pre>
<p>on MacOS/Linux I believe it is</p>
<pre><code>python3.6 -m pip list
</code></pre>
<p>but substitute in whatever call you make to get to your Python3.6 interpreter.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Also: it might be illuminating to run <code>which pip3</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">I would start using Virtual Python Environments ASAP....</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@TimSeed sure maybe, but that's tough to tell from this limited question :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Agreed, it was your <i>which pip3</i>, that prompted my.... python env comment.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>which pip3</code> is not enough, you also need <code>pip3 --version</code>. Aslo <code>pip3.6 list</code> should work.</span>
