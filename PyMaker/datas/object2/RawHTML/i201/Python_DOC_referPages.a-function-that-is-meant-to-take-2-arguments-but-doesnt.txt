<p>Hey all I've got a very simple and probably stupid question to ask, i'm trying to write a function that will take in two arguments a potential key and the dictionary name and if the key isn't in the dictionary it should return something along the lines of "x" is an invalid key. This is what i have so far:</p>
<pre><code>test_dictionary = {1: 'a', 2: 'b', 3: 'c', 4: 'd'}

def show_value():
    i = ()
    if i in test_dictionary:
        pass
else:
    print((i)('is not a valid key'))

show_value(1, test_dictionary)
</code></pre>
<p>Now when i run this code it says show_value takes 0 positional arguments but two were given but when i try to put in 2 arguments it says 'tuple' object is not callable. Any help on this would be greatly appreciated</p>
</div>

    else:
        print(i, 'is not a valid key')

show_value(1, test_dictionary)  # OK
show_value(5, test_dictionary)  # 5 is not a valid key
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Problems</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Function definition does not match with function call. If you pass two parameters, there should be two at the receiving end also.</p></li>
<li><p><code>i = ()</code> creates a tuple (does not need and replaces <code>i</code> value if you had passed it). Using <code>(i)(..)</code>, you are trying to call a tuple object, which is not possible.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Working code</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>test_dictionary = {1: 'a', 2: 'b', 3: 'c', 4: 'd'}

def show_value(i, dictionary):
    if i in test_dictionary:
        print(f'{i} found')
    else:
        print(f'{i} not found')

show_value(6, test_dictionary)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You need to add the function parameters so it can accept two values.</p>
<pre><code>def show_value(i, dict):
</code></pre>
<p>Also, your else statement is not properly aligned with an if statement above. Good luck!</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.python.org" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org</a> is a good place to go for questions like this. In your specific case I think <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#defining-functions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this</a> is the page you want.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Have a look at the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.6/tutorial/controlflow.html#defining-functions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">tutorial</a> that teaches about writing functions.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Your function definition does not match with your function call.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I think that's the point of the question.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Your <code>show_value()</code> does not have any arguments defined.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">When you have no work to be done on <code>if</code> check, why use <code>pass</code>? Reverse your <code>if</code> check.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Oh man, I can prune this code into one line <code>show_value = lambda x, d: d.get(x, str(x) + ' is not a valid key')</code>. I just give a minimal diff to show how this function works. @Austin</span>
<span class="comment-copy">i'm sorry i'm still very new to python and your comment just blew my mind up hopefully i get as good as that in the future.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Philipclarkson take it easy, you should learn python in this hard way then you can optimaize them when you go further.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thank you for your help i appreciate it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">no problem, accept my answer if it's the best! Good luck!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">just had a look at this thank you very much</span>
