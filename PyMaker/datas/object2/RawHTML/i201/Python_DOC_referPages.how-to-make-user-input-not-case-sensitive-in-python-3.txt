<p>I'm new to Python and could really use some help on this. I want to create a function to filter which files I want to open and which months and day specifically. That way, the users need to input which city(files) they want to analyze on which particular month or day. However, I want the user to be able to input something that is not case sensitive. For example, the user can input 'chicago'/'CHICAGO"/"ChIcAgO" and the it still give you the right output and not the error handling message. Here is the code I use:</p>
<pre><code>def get_filters():
    """
    Asks user to specify a city, month, and day to analyze.

    Returns:
        (str) city - name of the city to analyze
        (str) month - name of the month to filter by, or "none" to apply no month filter
        (str) day - name of the day of week to filter by, or "none" to apply no day filter
    """
    print('Hello! Let\'s explore some US bikeshare data!')

    # get user input for city (Chicago, New York, Washington). HINT: Use a while loop to handle invalid inputs
    valid_cities = ['Chicago', 'New York', 'Washington']
    city = valid_cities.index(input('Would you like to filter the data for Chicago, New York or Washington? \n')
    while not city in valid_cities:
        city = input('Selection error! Please choose a vaild city \n')
    print("you chose %s." % city)

    # get user input for month (all, January, February, ... , June)
    valid_months = ['January', 'February', 'March', 'April', 'May', 'June', 'none']
    month = input('Would like to filter data by month? Type e.g. "May" for month, or "none" for no month filter \n')
    while not month in valid_months:
        month = input('Selection error! Please enter a valid month or "none" for no month filter. \n')
    print("you chose %s." % month)

    # get user input for day of week (all, Monday, Tuesday, ... Sunday)

<p>Assuming all your city names are lowercase, you can use </p>

<p>or <code>.upper()</code>, depending on how your csv is structured</p>

<p>Just use:</p>

<span class="comment-copy">So to clarify I should have in my while loop:                                                                  city = input('Would you like to filter the data for Chicago, New York City or Washington? \n').lower()</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes. Using the <code>str.lower()</code> - that is, built-in method of the string. Manual: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.lower" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.lower</a> Since the result of <code>input()</code> in your case will be a string, use the <code>.lower()</code> or <code>.upper()</code> method is clear.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Do I have to put .lower() after the input in the while loop as well e.g: while not city in valid_cities:         city = input('Selection error! Please choose a vaild city \n').lower()</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@colm6287 yes, everytime you ask for user input again</span>
<span class="comment-copy">So to clarify I should have in my while loop: city = input('Would you like to filter the data for Chicago, New York City or Washington? \n').lower()</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, exactly that.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">So to clarify I should have in my while loop: city = input('Would you like to filter the data for Chicago, New York City or Washington? \n').lower()</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes indeed, that would work.</span>
