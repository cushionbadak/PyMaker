<p>I have a structured string fed in via a socket to my Python script which is able to receive UDP syslog data from another item on my network.  This string is in the format of this:</p>
<pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"><code>&lt;30&gt;device="SFW" date=2019-03-07 time=11:12:19 timezone="EST" device_name="SFV4C6" device_id=C12345678ABCXYZ log_id=063110617710 log_type="Event" log_component="SSL VPN Authentication" log_subtype="Authentication" status="Successful" priority=Information user_name="valid@username" usergroupname="" auth_client="N/A" auth_mechanism="AD" reason="" src_ip=123.234.123.234 message="User valid@username authenticated successfully to login to SSLVPN through AD authentication mechanism" name="" src_mac=
&lt;30&gt;device="SFW" date=2019-03-07 time=11:12:20 timezone="EST" device_name="SFV4C6" device_id=C12345678ABCXYZ log_id=062910617701 log_type="Event" log_component="Firewall Authentication" log_subtype="Authentication" status="Successful" priority=Information user_name="valid@username" usergroupname="vpnallaccess" auth_client="SSLVPN" auth_mechanism="" reason="" src_ip=10.1.250.123 message="User valid@username of group vpnallaccess logged in successfully to Firewall through  authentication mechanism from 10.1.250.3" name="User Name" src_mac=
</code></pre>
<p>... with numerous key-value pairs in the string. (Note that <code>key= otherkey=something</code> is valid where <code>key=</code> is empty and would be interpreted as <code>key=None</code>, apparently, with this firewall's syslog implementation)</p>
<p>I for the life of me have not figured out how to properly split this out to get the key-value pairs into a dict file in Python.  Simply splitting on spaces won't work because some of the double-quoted strings contain spaces.</p>
<p>Does anyone have a nifty way to split out the data and parse it into a dict object so I can directly reference log values in it rather than having to constantly split out specific data from the string each time with long regex, etc.?</p>

<span class="comment-copy">looks like a job for regex</span>
<span class="comment-copy">NOTE: I do not control the strings; these strings're generated by a firewall appliance and handed off to the simple UDP listener syslog server that I have.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@meowgoesthedog Actually those <i>are</i> the full strings now.  They end with a simple EndOfLine.  Each line is processed independently from each other as each line is a separate item from the appliance handed to syslog independently.  Would the code I use for the syslog implementation be useful to see here?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ah ok, and individual key-value pairs can just end with <code>=</code> i.e. with no value?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@meowgoesthedog Correct; an empty value will just have <code>key=</code> and would be interpreted as <code>key=None</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is some kind of <b><i>unholy black magic</i></b> you have found/used!  But it works EXACTLY how I need it to!  Thank you kindly!  I like the use of <code>lambda</code> here to further handle the mapping of the key-value pairs as well, nice going!  (I rarely use lambda functions but I keep forgetting how useful they can be!)</span>
