<p>So I would like to know how to save and check different values in a file. I have tried to read a file</p>
<pre><code>with open(filename, 'r') as f:
    varName = f.readline()
</code></pre>
<p>and this to write things to a file however this overwrites anything already in the file </p>
<pre><code>with open('topname.txt', 'w') as f:
    f.write(str(name))
    f.close()
</code></pre>
<p>another problem is when I want to check the values by using a for loop however that didn't work. I was wondering if there was any other way to check, read and write values to/from a file.</p>
<p>An example of this is a login page where people can make accounts and log in and the program checks if the username and password exist.</p>
<p>When I looked on the internet it talked about a thing called pickle but it wasn't the same thing as what I wanted from what I could see.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>For your first question, you need to open the file in append mode:</p>
<pre><code>with open('topname.txt', 'a+') as f:
     f.write(str(name))
     f.close()
</code></pre>
<p>The '+' sign in append mode indicates that the script will create a new file if it doesn't already exist, if it does, it'll just append to it. </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You want to "append" to the file, so open it with mode <code>'a'</code> instead of <code>'w'</code>.</p>
<p>Also, do not call <code>f.close()</code> inside of the <code>with</code> block.  <code>with</code> will close the file for you after the block.</p>
<pre><code>with open('topname.txt', 'a') as f:
    f.write(str(name))
</code></pre>

</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>To append data to an existing file use <code>open("Filename", "a")</code> for "append mode." This is in contrast to your "read" and "write" modes.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>if you want to read ,write and update, you need to open file <code>file = open('topname.txt', 'a+')</code> and to check every line to match user data <code>for line in file:print(line)</code> .Other operations like <code>file.read(), file.write()</code> will help. Remember to release resources by closing file finally <code>file.close()</code></p>

<span class="comment-copy">Have you read <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#reading-and-writing-files" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the documentation</a>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@balderman Does this do the same as a+?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@PeterWood No I haven't. Would it be useful if I did?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@luckyjd I expect it would be useful, why not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTFM" rel="nofollow noreferrer">try and see</a>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thank you, that "+" would have got me stumped.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you, this will help a lot</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you, this will help me a lot.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thank you very much, this will help me a lot.</span>
