<p>For instance: </p>
<p>If I am iterating through a Python list ['a','b','c'] how do I get back to element 'a' once I have reached 'c'?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you mean to do a loop like if your list was in circle, simply use the modulo operator :</p>
<pre><code>mylist = ["a", "b", "c"]
for i in range(n): # set n to desired value
    print(mylist[i % len(mylist)])
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If by "get back to element <code>'a'</code>" you mean to "cycle" back through the list, Then you can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.cycle" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>itertools.cycle</code></a></p>
<pre><code>from itertools import cycle, islice

data = ["a", "b", "c"]
times_to_iterate = 4

infinite_data = cycle(data)

for element in islice(infinite_data, len(data) * times_to_iterate):
    print(element)
</code></pre>
<p>I used <code>islice</code> as it's the same as the builtin <code>slice</code> but for iterators as <code>cycle</code> will iterate forever otherwise. This will iterate through <code>data</code> 4 times.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Can you provide your code? It's unclear what your intention is exactly. Are you using a for loop? And do you want to end at the second pass of <code>'a'</code>? Or keep going?</span>
