<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I was just curious if there was a way to delete text from a string or only capture specific text when the string varies in info.</p>
<p>Exmaples of the strings I'm working:</p>
<pre><code>3/5/2019 12:38 PM
10/30/2019 6:32 AM
9/12/2019 9:53 AM
</code></pre>
<p>I want to be able to extract the date and hour of the day separately and append them to a list. However obviously those vary and even the index of the hour can change as the day, month or hour can become &gt; 10 which can push it back up to three spaces.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>import re

s = "3/5/2019 12:38 PM"
result = re.compile(r"[\s\/:]").split(s)
</code></pre>
<p><code>result</code>:</p>
<pre><code>['3', '5', '2019', '12', '38', 'PM']
</code></pre>
<p>This should solve your problem assuming the delimiter when the string come in are the same.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>you can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/regex.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">regular expressions</a>
something likes this:</p>
<pre><code>import re
m = re.match("(\d+/\d+/\d+) (\d+:\d+) (\wM)", "3/5/2019 12:38 PM")
print(m.groups())
</code></pre>
<p>this will print a tuple with the first item being the date and second item being the time and the third item being the PM or AM: <code>('3/5/2019', '12:38', 'PM')</code> which you can easily parse yourself</p>
<p><strong>Edit</strong> </p>
<p>you can also use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html?highlight=datetime#module-datetime" rel="nofollow noreferrer">datetime</a> module to parse the date string:</p>
<pre><code>import datetime
dt = datetime.datetime.strptime("3/5/2019 12:38 PM","%d/%m/%Y %I:%M %p")
print(dt.date(), dt.hour)
</code></pre>
<p>which will give you a datetime object which you can get all the information from</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>re.compile(r"[\s\/:]").split(s)</code> should return the numbers and <code>PM</code> in a list.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">How much do the strings vary? Can you give an example of a few different types of strings you're looking at?  There are a variety of regular-expression-style approaches you could take to get the information you're looking for</span>
