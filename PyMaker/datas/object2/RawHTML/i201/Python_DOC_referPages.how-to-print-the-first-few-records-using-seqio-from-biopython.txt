<p>I have a fasta file that has several hundred records but I'm trying to return a table with just the first 20 records (record description, AA length, and name).<br/> </p>
<p>My code is not working and I would like to know how to return just the first 20 records - preferably in a table format.<br/></p>
<p>This is my python code:</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/local/bin/python3
import cgi
import re
form = cgi.FieldStorage()
from Bio import SeqIO
for index, record in enumerate(SeqIO.parse("e_coli_k12_dh10b.faa", "fasta")): print(record.description, len(record.seq))
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>There are numerous ways to do this. The most similar to your current structure would be to add a <code>break</code> when the index hits 19 (that is the 20th number since counting starts at 0):</p>
<pre><code>from Bio import SeqIO

for index, record in enumerate(SeqIO.parse("e_coli_k12_dh10b.faa", "fasta")): 
    print(record.description, len(record.seq))
    if index == 19:
        break
</code></pre>
<p>However, the way I prefer style-wise is to use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.islice" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>itertools.islice</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>from itertools import islice
from Bio import SeqIO

records = SeqIO.parse("e_coli_k12_dh10b.faa", "fasta")

for record in islice(records, 20):
    print(record.description, len(record.seq))
</code></pre>
<p>Instead of printing you can insert the descriptions and lengths into a list, array or other data structure of your choosing if you want to store the table.</p>
