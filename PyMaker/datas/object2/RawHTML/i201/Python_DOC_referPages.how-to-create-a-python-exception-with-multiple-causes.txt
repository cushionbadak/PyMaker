<p>How do I raise a python exception with multiple causes, similar to Java's <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Throwable.html#addSuppressed(java.lang.Throwable)" rel="nofollow noreferrer">addSuppressed()</a> feature? For example I have list of multiple methods to try and if none of them work I want to raise an exception that includes the exceptions from all the methods that were tried. I.e.:</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>exceptions = []
for method in methods_to_try:
  try:
    method()
  except Exception as e:
    exceptions.append(e)
if exceptions:
  raise Exception("All methods failed") from exceptions
</code></pre>
<p>But this code fails because the <code>raise ... from ...</code> statement expects a single exception and not a list. Python 2 or 3 solutions are acceptable. All back traces and exception messages must be preserved.</p>

<h1>Use logging instead</h1>
<p>If using the logging module is acceptable for you, I guess it would be the cleanest to log the individual exceptions you caught and only raise a single overall exception.</p>
<p>If you only want to output the log-messages in case all tried functions error, this is an ideal case for the buffered logger from the  <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging-cookbook.html#buffering-logging-messages-and-outputting-them-conditionally" rel="nofollow noreferrer">logging cookbook</a>
You could modify it to always log at debug level, but raise the level to error, if all subfunctions raise an error.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Just pass the exceptions as arguments when creating the last exception.</p>
<pre><code>for method in methods_to_try:
    try:
        method()
    except Exception as e:
        exceptions.append(e)
if exceptions:
    raise Exception(*exceptions)
</code></pre>
<p>They will be available en the <code>args</code> attribute.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">you cannot raise <i>several</i> exceptions. Create a big exception with all the stacktraces and raise this. This is going to be ugly</span>
