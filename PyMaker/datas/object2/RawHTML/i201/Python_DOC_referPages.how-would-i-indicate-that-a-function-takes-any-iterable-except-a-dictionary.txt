<p>I have a function that will accept an <code>Iterable[int]</code>, but I don't want dictionaries to be accepted. I have another method to handle it. How do I indicate that in the type hint?</p>
<p><code>def unpack(iterable_to_unpack : Iterable[int]):</code></p>
<p>Would <code>sequence</code> be more appropriate?</p>
<p><code>def unpack(sequence_to_unpack : Sequence[int]):</code></p>
<p>From the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.7/glossary.html#term-iterable" rel="nofollow noreferrer">definition</a> of iterable, it would seem like it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An object capable of returning its members one at a time. Examples of
  iterables include all sequence types (such as list, str, and tuple)
  and some <strong>non-sequence</strong> types like dict, file objects..</p>

<p>Does this help? From the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs</a>:</p>
<pre><code>from typing import List
Vector = List[float]

def scale(scalar: float, vector: Vector) -&gt; Vector:
    return [scalar * num for num in vector]

# typechecks; a list of floats qualifies as a Vector.
new_vector = scale(2.0, [1.0, -4.2, 5.4])

<span class="comment-copy">You’ll have to check the type of the argument and, if it’s a dict, raise an error.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Right, but would <code>Sequence[int]</code> be the correct type hint to indicate that it only accepts <code>List</code>, <code>Tuple</code>, etc, but not dictionary?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Could you not simply test  whether <code>Sequence[int]</code> is the right type by testing it against <code>List</code>, <code>Tuple</code>, and <code>dict</code> ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I could, but I think it would be better to test it like so,<code>if (isinstance(sequence_to_unpack, Mapping)):</code> but I still need the correct type hint.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No, what I'm after is I want my method to accept only Sequence types (List, Tuple, etc..) but not dictionaries, so I was wondering what was the correct type hint. Given that <code>dict</code> inherits from <code>Iterable</code>, I don't think it's the right type.</span>
