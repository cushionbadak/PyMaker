<p>How do I know that a library, package or module exists (standard and external) that I could use to solve a given problem? For example, I have used the BeautifulSoup library to "decode" a web site while looking up some beginner practices, but I only knew BeautifulSoup exists because I saw it in a practice example and would have never known of it's existence if I didn't stumble upon it. </p>

<h3>All libraries in Python are managed by the "Pip Installs Packages" package manager (pip)</h3>

<p>Every module/lib installed in your local Python system can be listed using the <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_freeze/#pip-freeze" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>pip freeze</code></a> command in your system.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">just try to import the module, and run, if the code runs smoothly, then module exists in your environment. Is this you are looking?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You are answering your question here: "I only knew BeautifulSoup exists because I saw it in a practice example". Practice is what you need. When you are facing some kind of problem, you go googling libraries that can solve your problem.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is one more point where you miss things like the R equivalent of task view in Python. Nonetheless PyPI does have a search facility on many parameters. You might look up for topic-wise categorization. Or simply search for a phrase like "scraping". This most of the time works out ok, but nowhere nearly as neat as the CRAN task view.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Have you installed it with <code>pip</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No, I just instaled it in pycharm and upgraded it with cmd.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ok, but the names of the modules don't give away their nature (for what they are good for). The library/module name, e. g. BeautifulSoup, means nothing intuitively and I could never guess that there is a library with that exact name and use. Do python programers  just memorize the names and uses of the modules they stumble upon during their carreer or is there a method to this madness?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes there is a good method, like for all language and development environment, <a href="https://www.google.com" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Google</a> the name and find the library's documentation (<a href="https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Beautiful Soup Documentation — Beautiful Soup 4.4.0 documentation</a>) You can reverse the process to find a library that does what you want by searching for basic terms followed by "Python"</span>
<span class="comment-copy">By "exists" you should have been more specific on your first question. Talking about the lib's existance in your system <b>or</b> talking about the fact that a lib exists that does what you want</span>
