<p>I want to remove punctuation from strings in a series.</p>
<p>I am using python3.6 and maketrans(), translate() functions to do this. However, it does not give me the results I want. </p>
<p>Here are two sentences before code:</p>
<pre><code>Baking cake of straw-bana-choco will take longer than expcted


Please include as much of the following data that is available.&lt; &gt;&lt; &gt;- Cake Type:&lt; &gt;- Flavors:&lt; &gt;- Decoration Type:&lt; &gt;- Icing:&lt; &gt;-
</code></pre>
<p>Here is my code:</p>
<pre><code>remove_punc = str.maketrans(' ', ' ', string.punctuation)
df.Summary = df.Summary.str.translate(remove_punc)
df.Description = df.Description.str.translate(remove_punc)
</code></pre>
<p>Sentences after the code:</p>
<pre><code>baking cake of strawbanachoco will take longer than expcted


please include as much of the following data that is available   cake type flavors decoration type icing
</code></pre>
<p>So I am wondering why <code>strawbanachoco</code> is not <code>staw bana choco</code>, it seems the code is not replacing the <code>-</code> with a space <code></code>. Whereas in the second setences, it seems to be replacing the punctuations with spaces.</p>
<p>I did not include in the code snippet above, but I also lowercased all of my sentences.</p>
<p>Any suggestions on why this might be happening?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>If you want to replace each punctuation character with space:</p>
<pre><code>s = """
Baking cake of straw-bana-choco will take longer than expcted
Please include as much of the following data that is available.&lt; &gt;&lt; &gt;- Cake Type:&lt; &gt;- Flavors:&lt; &gt;- Decoration Type:&lt; &gt;- Icing:&lt; &gt;-
"""

remove_punc = str.maketrans(dict.fromkeys(string.punctuation, ' '))
print(str.translate(s, remove_punc))
</code></pre>
<p>Out:</p>
<pre><code>Baking cake of straw bana choco will take longer than expcted
Please include as much of the following data that is available         Cake Type      Flavors      Decoration Type      Icing     
</code></pre>
<p>And there's a very good overview of other methods here:

<p>It's not replacing it with spaces in the second sentence. You have spaces in your original string between the punctuation characters which are simply being preserved.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">So the only chars you want to replace are &lt;, &gt; and - ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I want to replace any punctuation that may appear in the series. So any of these: !"#$%&amp;\'()*+,-./:;&lt;=&gt;?@[\]^_`{|}~</span>
