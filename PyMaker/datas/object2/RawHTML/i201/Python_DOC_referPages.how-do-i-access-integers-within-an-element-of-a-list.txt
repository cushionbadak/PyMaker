<p>Hi I am new to python and trying to do couple of small tasks in data manipulations. Please note this is not homework, I am aware of this forum. I just do not know how to access a digit within an element hence I do not have any code to start with:</p>
<p>I have a list</p>
<pre><code>numbers = [865, 1169, 1208, 1243, 329]
</code></pre>
<p>-How do I write a program that displays the values in the list numbers in descending order sorted by their last digit</p>
<p>Output I desire:</p>
<pre><code>Sorted by last digit:
[1169, 1208, 865, 1243, 290]
</code></pre>
<p>-How can I display the values in the list numbers in descending
order sorted by the sum of their digits that are odd numbers</p>
<p>Output I desire:</p>
<pre><code>Sorted by sum of odd digits:
[1169, 290, 865, 1243, 1208]
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The easiest way is to use the <code>.sort()</code> method of the list object to do it <em>inplace</em> or the builtin <code>sorted()</code> to return a sorted copy. Both accept a <code>key</code> keyword argument that can be a function. My solution is to provide a function computing what you asked.</p>
<p>By last digit:</p>
<pre><code>sorted(numbers, key=lambda x: x % 10))
# reversed:
sorted(numbers, key=lambda x: x % 10, reverse=True)
</code></pre>
<p>By sum of odd numbers :</p>
<pre><code>sorted(numbers, key=lambda x: sum([int(i) for i in str(x) if int(i) % 2 == 1]))
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Have you read <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#lists" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the documentation</a>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You can access the individual digits by making each number a string (<code>str(number)</code>) then selecting it with an index ... <code>a = 1234; b = str(a); b[2] --&gt;&gt; '3'</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@PeterWood I can only read documentation of a problem I know the question of. I am too fresh to python to understand what the cause is of my bottleneck. wwi Thank you that helped</span>
<span class="comment-copy">There is no need to convert back to <code>int</code> (or to <code>str</code> at all, since <code>% 10</code> would work as well).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You are right! Edited it.</span>
