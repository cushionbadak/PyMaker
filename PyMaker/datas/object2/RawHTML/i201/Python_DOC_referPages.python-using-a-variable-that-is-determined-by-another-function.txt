<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I want to call the second function and have it use the result of the first, but am unsure of how to do this. I can't make "array" a local variable as it is dependent on the first function. Can someone please help? Thanks.</p>
<pre><code>def main(n):
    array = []
    for x in range(n):
        array.append(random.randint(0, 5))
    print(array)

def sortarray(list):
    newarray = []
    for i in range(len(array)):
        newarray.append(array.pop.array(array.index(max(x))))
    print(newarray)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Your first function must return something if you want to pass that result to second function. Please, see the following example:</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>def main(n):
    array = []
    for x in range(n):
        array.append(random.randint(0, 5))
    return array

def sortarray(array):
    newarray = []
    for i in range(len(array)):
        newarray.append(array.pop.array(array.index(max(x))))
    return newarray
</code></pre>
<p>And you could use them like the following:</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>print(sortarray(main(5)))
</code></pre>
<p>BTW, if you're interested in sorting - you definitely should checkout <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/sorting.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Sorting HOW TO</a>.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>
<p>That will give the following error:</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>&lt;ipython-input-1-d0f89860ca87&gt; in sortarray(array)
      8     newarray = []
      9     for i in range(len(array)):
---&gt; 10         newarray.append(array.pop.array(array.index(max(x))))
     11     return newarray

AttributeError: 'builtin_function_or_method' object has no attribute 'array'
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see it's pointing to the following line:</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>newarray.append(array.pop.array(array.index(max(x))))
</code></pre>
<p>And the problem is in the <code>array.pop.array</code> call. <code>array.pop</code> is a function.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Why you pass variable "list" to funcion sortarray but never use it?</p>
<p>Btw, you should not define your variable as "list". It is reserved word in python.
Although it may not cause error, but it will confuse someone who look into your code or mis-link by some IDEs.</p>
<p>This may what you want to implement.</p>
<pre><code>def main(n):
    array = []
    for x in range(n):
        array.append(random.randint(0, 5))
    print(array)
    sortarray(array)

def sortarray(array):
    newarray = []
    for i in range(len(array)):
        newarray.append(array.pop.array(array.index(max(x))))
    print(newarray)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">What is <code>list</code>? So you know how to pass argument to function; why not pass <code>array</code> if you need it in a function? (You need to get the returned value from first function before doing so).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you for your response. I know there are easier ways to sort, I am trying to come up with some on my own for practice.  When i run this, it gives an error message "object has no attribute array", even when the main function returns array?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That's next iteration to update your code. Please, see the updated answer - I will highligh couple of things.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I see. It seems like i've gotten the pop function working now. I just wanted it to pop out the highest number and append it to the new array. newarray.append(array.pop(array.index(max(array)))</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Cool! As the next step I would love to suggest you to convert those functions into generators. To play and see the difference.</span>
