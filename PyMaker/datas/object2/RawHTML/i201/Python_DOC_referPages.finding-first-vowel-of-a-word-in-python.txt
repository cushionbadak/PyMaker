<p>so I am having trouble finding the index of the first vowel of a inputted string. When putting in the string "elephant" , "hello" , "spa" they work properly, however when I input "spam" it does not work, it returned the number 3 instead of 2. I am having trouble finding why it satisfies the else statement but not the initial if condition. I am also trying to put a condition that if there are no vowels in the string, then it should print out the index of the last character in the string. Below is my code:</p>
<pre><code>def find_first_vowel(word):
    i = 0   
    while i &lt; len(word):
        i+= 1
        if word[i] in vowels:
            return i
        else:
            return len(word)-1
    return i

print(find_first_vowel("spam"))   
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Your code always return <code>len(word)-1</code> if the character in position <code>1</code> is not a vowel. Also <code>elephant</code> didn't work and <code>spa</code> works only because of the bug I mentioned, it returns <code>2</code> which is <code>len(word)-1</code> and not the index of the vowel found. Try debug your code line by line and you'll figure it out very quickly.</p>
<p>This could be a working code that return <code>-1</code> if there's no vowel, else return the index of the first vowel found.</p>
<pre><code>def find_first_vowel(word):
    i = 0   
    while i &lt; len(word):
        if word[i] in vowels:
            return i
        i += 1
    return -1
</code></pre>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>
<p>If you want to return the last character if there's no vowels just change <code>return -1</code> with <code>return len(word) - 1</code>. Here:</p>
<pre><code>def find_first_vowel(word):
    i = 0   
    while i &lt; len(word):
        if word[i] in vowels:
            return i
        i += 1
    return len(word) - 1
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You should use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#enumerate" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>enumerate</code></a> to handle tracking the index for you</p>
<pre><code>vowels = set('aeiou')

def find_first_vowel(word):
    for index, letter in enumerate(word):
        if letter in vowels:
            return index
    return index  # Returns last index if no vowels.  You could also return None, or raise an error
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Either <code>return</code> statement jumps out of your <code>while</code> loop immediately, without looking at the rest of the word. Additional problem: since you start with <code>i += 1</code>, the function never even looks at the first character, which would be <code>word[0]</code>.</p>
<p>I think your main issue is that you meant for your <code>else</code> statement to be executed if the <code>while</code> loop completed and exited without finding a vowel. As indented, though, it's part of the <code>if</code> statement in the <code>while</code> loop, and executes whenever the second character isn't a vowel. You want something more like this:</p>
<pre><code>i = 0
while i &lt; len(word):
    if word[i] in vowels:
        return i
    i += 1
</code></pre>
<p>And then whatever you want the function to return if the word has no vowels.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">What happens if the vowel is the first letter, wouldn't you always get back 1</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This works however I am trying to put the condition that if the inputted word has no vowels, then it should just print the index of the last character</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Just edit <code>return -1</code> with <code>return len(word)-1</code> in my code, but please notice that you would have the same result as if there was a vowel in the last character.</span>
