<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Can someone tell me why this doesn't throw an error?  It prints True when the user types in http:// and false when they type in https://.  I can't understand why it would work at all.</p>
<pre><code>URL = input("Enter an URL address: ")
URL.startswith("http://" or "https://")
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>"http://" or "https://"</code> is a boolean expression which evaluates to <code>"http://"</code>, because that's what an <code>or</code> statement is (because <code>"http://"</code> is the first True-ish value encountered in the <code>or</code> statement), you need to do this instead:</p>
<pre><code>URL.startswith("http://") or URL.startswith("https://")
</code></pre>
<p>Also, as @ShadowRanger suggested, you could make this shorter and faster by passing a tuple of accepted starting strings to the <code>startswith</code> method, it will then return <code>True</code> if any of the strings in the tuple matched with the start of the string:</p>
<pre><code>URL.startswith(("http://", "https://"))
</code></pre>
</div>

<span class="comment-copy">We can say "starts with a or b" but what we mean by that is "starts with a or starts with b". Python needs the conditions rather explicit.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">There's a better way actually; <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.startswith" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>startswith</code> also accepts a <code>tuple</code> of prefixes to check for</a>, and returns <code>True</code> if any of them match. So you could write <code>URL.startswith(("http://", "https://"))</code> and it would behave identically to the <code>or</code> separated version you wrote (just shorter to type, and faster to run).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ShadowRanger Brilliant, I just added your note to my answer.</span>
