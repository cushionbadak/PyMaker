<p>Environment: I'm using <code>conda</code> 4.6.7 on a Mac with High Sierra.</p>
<p>I got some legacy Python code, and first of all I'd like to run it. Of course, since this is research code, I didn't expect to find "fancy stuff (!!)" such as a test suite, but I was hoping that at least a <code>requirements.txt</code> file would be provided. Pipe dream. After GREPping the list of <code>import</code>s across the various files composing the project, I came up with the following list of packages to be installed:</p>
<pre><code>conda install os sys math time scipy numpy zipfile urllib.request shutil PIL skimage config itertools logging json re random collections matplotlib visualize glob random datetime tensorflow keras colorsys IPython

<p>I put all of them in a single call to <code>conda</code>, because, according to </p>

<p>you should </p>

<p>Install all the programs that you want in this environment at the
  same time. Installing 1 program at a time can lead to dependency
  conflicts.</p>

<p>(btw, is there a way to include a line break in the command, or does it have to be that long?)</p>
<p>However, <code>conda</code> is giving me the error:</p>
<pre><code>PackagesNotFoundError: The following packages are not available from current channels:

  - config

<p>This seems weird to me, because at least some of them are very common. These are the packages in my <code>conda</code> environment:</p>

<p>How can I solve the above problem?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Most of those packages (e.g. <code>math</code>, <code>random</code>, <code>itertools</code>....) are part of the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">python standard library</a>, so should be available with any standard installation of python (even if they don't show up in the output of <code>conda list</code>). Conda therefore does not install these separately or have them in its package lists. </p>
<p>Other issues with your attempt are with the names of packages. For instance, you are trying to install <code>scikit-image</code>, but using the  shortform name <code>skimage</code> (which is used <em>once it is installed</em> for import, <em>e.g.</em> <code>import skimage</code>). If you use <code>conda install scikit-image</code>, conda will find it.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Try to do this via a shell script. Go to the folder where your requirements.txt is located then</p>
<pre><code>while read requirement; do conda install --yes $requirement; done &lt; requirements.txt
</code></pre>
<p>otherwise you dont necessarily have to use conda - just go to the environment</p>
<pre><code>conda activate &lt;environmentname&gt;
pip install -r requirements.txt
</code></pre>
<p>for standard and some more ... packages </p>
<pre><code>conda install anaconda
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Yeah, I just got the package names from GREPping though the files, thus they were all <code>import</code> statements. That's probably why this <code>scikit-image</code> package is named that way. Any other names which look weird to you?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The only other one I don't know is <code>visualize</code>. That's maybe because it's just some obscure package I've never come across, or it's a part of the legacy code you're working with. Then, there's the <code>config</code> issue, which you can address by googling <code>python import config</code>. Other than that, I believe those are all in the standard library</span>
<span class="comment-copy">There is no <code>requirements.txt</code> file. The authors didn't think of writing one. This is researchers' code, and not particularly well written.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">you can simply add all the names in a txt file that you have put in the question. Although, you can get rid of half of them by simply doing a conda install anaconda, this will install a whole bunch of packages and when you do import you will see which is missing</span>
