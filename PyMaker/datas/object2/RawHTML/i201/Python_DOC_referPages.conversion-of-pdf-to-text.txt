<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18262293/how-to-open-every-file-in-a-folder">This post</a> is definitely something you should read. If you are newer to programming in general, you should also read up on Recursion and what it is (for-loops mainly). </p>
<p>Something like this may help you get to where you need to be but you will need to change it for your application. This uses 2 libraries that don't need to be installed manually (they come with python) <code>os</code> (which you are probably already using) and <code>glob</code>.</p>
<pre><code>import os
from pdf2image import convert_from_path
import glob

path = os.path.dirname(__file__)
for filename in glob.glob(os.path.join(path, '*.pdf')):
    pages = convert_from_path(filename)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">would you mind adding your code as formatted text instead of adding a link to an image?</span>
