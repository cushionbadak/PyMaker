<p>I have a pandas data frame with 100 columns and I want to create a dictionary for each column with the first column as key and I've been doing it manually. </p>
<p>Let me explain with a sample dataframe</p>
<p><code>ID     a     b     c
123    jon   foo   bar
789    pan   bam   fan
278    car   bike  boat</code></p>
<p>Let's consider the above table with column names <em>ID, a, b, c</em>. Now I am trying to create dictionaries for every column with ID being the key of the dictionary. </p>
<p>something like below</p>
<p><code>dicta = {ID: a}
 dictb = {ID: b}
 dictc = {ID: c}</code></p>
<p>What I am doing currently is:</p>
<p><code>dicta_ = dict(zip(df['ID'], df['a']))
 dicta = {k:v for k,v in dicta_.items()}</code></p>
<p><code>dictb_ = dict(zip(df['ID'], df['b']))
 dictb = {k:v for k,v in dictb_.items()}</code></p>
<p><code>dictc_ = dict(zip(df['ID'], df['c']))
 dictc = {k:v for k,v in dictc_.items()}</code></p>
<p>and the above code is fetching me the desired result but I have to do it manually for all the 100 columns which is not the most efficient way to do it.</p>
<p>I would really appreciate if I could get some help or suggestion to automate the process by writing a loop or function. Thanks in advance!</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>set_index</code> then use <code>df.to_dict()</code>:</p>
<pre><code>d = df.set_index('ID').to_dict()
</code></pre>
<p>then call the column with the value:</p>
<pre><code>d['a']

# {123: 'jon', 278: 'car', 789: 'pan'}

d['b']

# {123: 'foo', 278: 'bike', 789: 'bam'}
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">This seems like very basic functionality.  Have you gone through the Python tutorial? (<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/tutorial</a>)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@thebjorn, I'd really appreciate if you can provide me an approach for the above problem if you feel its a very basic functionality. Thanks:)</span>
