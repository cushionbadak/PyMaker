<p>I have a problem with a command of python. I want my program to read a specific line from my file, and here I haven't problem. The problem is when I have to convert the line in a float (I need of float to calculate some equation). My program is:</p>
<pre><code>f=open('coeff.txt')
lines=f.readlines()

k1=lines[0]

k1 = float(k1)


k2=lines[1]

k2 = float(k2)


k3=lines[2]

k3 = float(k3)

k4=lines[3]

k4 = float(k4)
</code></pre>
<p>And the file coeff.txt is:</p>
<pre><code>1.2*1e-1   

6.00*1e-34

1.13*1e-4

6.9*1e-16
</code></pre>
<p>that is 1.2*10^(-1)  , 6*10^(-34), 1.13*10^(-4), 6.9*10^(-16)</p>
<p>and I get the error:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ValueError: could not convert string to float: '6.00*1e-34\n'</p>
<p>(obviously that this error is referred to each line.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Can you help me, please?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Python doesn't know how to interpret <code>'6.00*1e-34\n'</code> as a float. You will have to clean your data before you can actually use it.</p>
<p>Eventually, you will want to have each line in a format like this:
<code>6.00e-34</code></p>
<p>Looking at it closely, it seems like the only differences are the <code>\n</code> at the end of the line, and the <code>1*</code> in the middle.</p>
<p>You can get rid of the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3267311/what-is-newline-character-n">newline character</a> at the end of the string (<code>\n</code>) by calling the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.strip" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>.strip()</code></a> method, and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.replace" rel="nofollow noreferrer">replace</a> <code>*1</code> with an empty string to get to the above format.</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>val = '6.00*1e-34\n'
cleaned_val = val.strip().replace('*1', '')
print(float(cleaned_val))
&gt;&gt;&gt; 6e-34
</code></pre>
<p>Edit: It seems like the presence of the newline character doesn't really matter - so you only need to replace the <code>*1</code> part of your string. I'm leaving it in anyway.</p>

<p>Your problem is the operator *</p>

<span class="comment-copy">what is inside that text file?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">here is a useful answer, that shows what are floats and what not. Maybe you just need to format your string before you convert it to a float. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/20929983/8411228">stackoverflow.com/a/20929983/8411228</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you're in control of what is in coeff.txt, it'd probably be better to drop the "*1" before the "e".  That's a non-standard notation.  Much better to just say <code>1.2e-1</code>, <code>6e-34</code>, <code>1.13e-4</code>, and <code>6.9e-16</code>, IMHO.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thank you so much!! i have resolved my problem!!  in fact now i have wrote my file "coeff.txt" as :   0.12 6.00e-34 1.13e-4 6.9e-16        and now it work</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I just tested converting a string to float with a \n inside and it just works. So your hint is not necessary. But it will of course also works, when you strip it.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">Looks like this has solved the problem @vahdet. So it might also be an answer. Can you explain, why the operator * was the problem?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">open() return a string(default) or bytes(b) objects, when float() receives a string it should contain a decimal number positive or negative and accept ONLY '+' or '-' sign operators.</span>
