<p>I need some help with appending a file path to "PATH" variable in Windows 10 from Jupyter Notebook (Python 3.6). I need to do it at run time from notebook because my user account is doesn't have admin rights.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> </p>
<p>I want to use <a href="https://graphviz.gitlab.io/_pages/Download/Download_windows.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">GrphViz 2.8 library</a>. For this library to work from Jupyter notebook, the location of dot.exe file i.e. <code>C:\Program Files (x86)\Graphviz2.38\bin\dot.exe</code> needs to be added to PATH environment variable.</p>
<p>I have seen that <code>os.getenv('Path')</code> command will get me the value of this Path variable but I couldn't find the equivalent set method to <strong>append</strong> my entry to this  Path variable.</p>
<p>I have also seen <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/53595397/777593">this post</a> which suggests using <code>kernal.json</code> But I didn't understand how to update the PATH variable. </p>
<p>Any example how to achieve this will be very much appreciated. </p>
<p>If it is not possible, then can you please suggest an alternative way of using GrpahViz without updating "Path" variable. </p>
<p>PS I can't use Online dot-file to SVG/PNG converters because I am using a package which requires GrpahViz to be available locally.</p>

<p>Try this:</p>
<pre><code>import os
os.environ['PATH'] += os.pathsep + r'C:\Program Files (x86)\Graphviz2.38\bin\dot.exe'
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Best would be to add te mentioned path to the PATH variable of your system. Alternatively you could, probably, use <code>os.putenv</code> or <code>os.environ</code> (see e.g. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/os.html</a>)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">path with the name of the executable?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes @albert, path to the executable file.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You write "path to the executable file" but this would, as far as I know, be "C:\Program Files (x86)\Graphviz2.38\bin"</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I think path to executable mean the full path of the file, include filename. Your case is likely more precisely called path to directory of the executable.
