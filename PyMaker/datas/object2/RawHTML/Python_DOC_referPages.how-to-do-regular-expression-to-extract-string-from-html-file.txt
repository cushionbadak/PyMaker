<p>I still cannot figure out how to extract links like this:</p>
<pre><code>http: example.com/AA-HDCM-300B.pdf
</code></pre>
<p>Since I want to extract the product part number <code>"AA-HDCM-300B"</code> which begins with <code>"AA-"</code>.</p>
<p>Does anyone what the extraction code will be?</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Please provide more examples of the links</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><a href="http://www.idview.com/IDVIEW/Products/Cameras/Covert/assets/IV-PC229XP.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer">idview.com/IDVIEW/Products/Cameras/Covert/assets/IV-PC229XP.pdf</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">So you want to extract <code>IV-PC229XP</code> from that link?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">YES. Absolutely. Do you know how to write the extraction code? I tried, but always failed.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Is the pdf filename always be the product number?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">But if I have thousands of links from HTML, and some don't contain the part number? So that is the reason why I'd like to use re to extract the string begins with some certain words.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">From what source you want to extract part number?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I did the web scraping and downloaded the html file for the links. Among those links I could see the product number. That is the reason why I would like to use re to extract product numbers from the html links.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Can you show examples of links which <code>don't contain the part number</code>?</span>
