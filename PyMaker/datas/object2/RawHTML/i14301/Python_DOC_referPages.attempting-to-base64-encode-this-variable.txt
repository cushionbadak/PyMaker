<p>I'm trying to encode the 'username' variable into Base64, then write it into a text file, and finally decode the Base64, and read/print it.    </p>
<pre><code>while True:

username = input("What is your username?: ")

file = open("newfile.txt", "w")
file.write(base64.b64encode(username))
file.close

file = open("newfile.txt", "r")
file.read(base64.b64decode(username))
break

<p>-TypeError- 'str' does not support the buffer interface</p>

<p>What I did here seemed the most logical out of what I've seen.</p>
<p>I am fairly new to Python, and have tried all the method's I've seen online to Base64 encode a variable, and none have worked.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>base64 expects and returns bytes (in python3); but strings must be written to files. here the example with explicit writing and more compact reading:</p>
<pre><code>import base64

while True:

    username_str = input("What is your username?: ")

    with open("newfile.txt", "w") as file_handler:
        username_bytes = bytes(username_str, 'utf-8')
        b64_bytes = base64.b64encode(username_bytes)
        b64_str = b64_bytes.decode('utf-8')
        file_handler.write(b64_str)
        # file_handler.close()
        # close not needed inside the context handler
    with open("newfile.txt", "r") as file_handler:        
        print(base64.b64decode(bytes(file_handler.read(), 'utf-8')).decode('utf-8'))
    break
</code></pre>
<p>btw: file is a reserved keyword and should not be used as variable.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">1) You're not writing anything to the file and 2) there's no trace of your attempts with base64 or the specific problems you encountered.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sorry, I'm fairly new this. I've updated it anyways.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">FYI: <code>file.read(base64.b64decode(username))</code> means <i>take <code>username</code>, <code>b64decode</code> it, then <code>read</code> the <code>file</code> with it</i>.....!?!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user3205119: You can't decode what you haven't read yet!  The decoding happens <i>after</i> reading.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The base64 encoding error is because in Python3 you need to pass <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/base64.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">base64.b64encode</a> a <i>byte</i> string, not a normal Unicode string. But as others have said  there are various other problems with your posted code, including that it's not indented properly.</span>
