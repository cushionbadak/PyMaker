<p>I have a C++ Visual Studio program called Test which takes two arguments. I have to run this program with large number of different arguments like:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>./test  -a  -b (a is arg1, b is arg2)</strong></li>
<li><strong>./test  -c  -d</strong></li>
<li>.</li>
<li>.</li>
<li>.</li>
</ul>
<p>How can I create a python script which runs this program multiple times if I provide the set of arguments? (instead of me running the above command multiple times). </p>
<p><strong>Soln:</strong>
This is the code I used:</p>
<pre><code>for commands in listargs:
    cmd = ["../../Test.exe", commands[0], commands[1]]
    result = subprocess.Popen(cmd, stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
    stdin, stderr = result.communicate()
    print stdin
</code></pre>
<p>I am giving the arguments in a list of 2-member tuples(listargs). Each tuple has the arguments for one execution. Or as <strong>abernet</strong> mentioned, we can give arguments in csv file. Thanks for helping me.</p>

<p>For this type of stuff, you should use <a href="https://docs.python.org/lib/module-subprocess.html" rel="nofollow"><code>subprocess</code></a>, possibly <code>subprocess.communicate</code>:</p>
<pre><code>p = subprocess.Popen(['./test', '-' + a, '-' + b])
p.communicate()
</code></pre>
<p>This is a very versatile command that will also allow you to redirect inputs and outputs. See <a href="http://pymotw.com/2/subprocess/" rel="nofollow">PMOTW</a>.</p>

<p>You haven't explained how you want to "provide the set of arguments".</p>
<p>Let's say you want to create a CSV file, like this:</p>
<pre><code>a,b
c,d
</code></pre>
<p>That's nice and simple to create in a text editor, or you can even do it in Excel.</p>
<p>Python has a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html" rel="nofollow"><code>csv</code></a> module in the standard library that knows how to read exactly that format, turning each line into a list of values.</p>
<p>And it has a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html" rel="nofollow"><code>subprocess</code></a> module that knows how to run a program with a list of arguments.</p>
<p>So, for example:</p>
<pre><code>with open('args.csv') as f:
    for args in csv.reader(f):
        subprocess.call(['./test'] + args)
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to store the output of each run in a file, or check the output and raise an exception on errors, etc., you can do almost anything you want with <code>subprocess</code>, you just have to read the docs.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">What do you mean by "c++ visual studio program"? Do you just mean an executable (which you happen to have compiled with Visual Studio's C++ compiler)?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">More importantly, how do you want to provide the set of arguments? Do you want to type in <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> at a prompt? Or create a CSV file with rows like <code>a,b</code>? Or â€¦?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks. It worked.</span>
