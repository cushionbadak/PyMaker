<p>I have been trying to create a Caesar cipher program. To make it as inclusive as possible I want to be able to use upper case letters as well. I know how to load a lower case alphabet:</p>
<pre><code>alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase * 2
</code></pre>
<p>(I have timed it by two to allow the user to encrypt all letters)
I would really like some help. It is my first time submitting a question and I would appreciate any help I get</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>There is <code>string.ascii_uppercase</code> as well as <code>string.ascii_lowercase</code> (<a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html#string.ascii_uppercase" rel="nofollow">documentation</a>). For testing if a letter is upper case and do something for uppercase letters in a message you can do this:</p>
<pre><code>for letter in message:
    if letter in string.ascii_uppercase:
        # do something
</code></pre>
<p>You can also use <code>isupper()</code> method (<a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#str.isupper" rel="nofollow">documentation</a>):</p>
<pre><code>for letter in message:
    if letter.isupper():
        # do something
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to check whether the whole message is upper case, then <code>isupper()</code> is actually better as it checks the whole string:</p>
<pre><code>if message.isupper():
    # do something
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If there is a <code>string.ascii_lowercase</code> then surely there is a <code>string.ascii_uppercase</code>. Give it a try.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use</p>
<p><strong>string.uppercase</strong>
This is locale-dependent, and value will be updated when locale.setlocale() is called.</p>

<p>This loop will make a string with all uppercase letters and save it in <em>letters_str</em></p>
<pre><code>letters_str = ''
for x in range(65,91):
    letters_str+=chr(x)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>string.ascii_uppercase</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I will add an if statement to determine whether the letter in the message is upper case or not</span>
<span class="comment-copy">About this <code>if</code> statement of yours, you can use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>isupper</code></a> method to determine if a message is upper case or not.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">string.ascii_letters provides both upper and lower</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you, you answered my next question before I asked it</span>
<span class="comment-copy">sorry, I need just uppercase</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@KateMarron and which part od ascii_uppercase provides you with something more than uppercase?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@zubergu Sorry, I thought I had checked that! I accidentally forgot the case at the end! Thank you</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@kate-marron - if you could paste the code snippet as a part of question then that help to answer the question more effeciently.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That's just pointless, there's no need for ascii character codes to generate all uppercase letters.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'd rather you put <code>string.ascii_lowercase.upper()</code> than see you try this.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What the question to be answered?</span>
