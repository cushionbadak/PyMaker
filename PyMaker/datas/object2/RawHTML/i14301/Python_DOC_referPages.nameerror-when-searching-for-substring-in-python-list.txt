<p>I have a list:</p>
<pre><code>mylist = ['item 101', 'element 202', 'string 303', 'member 404']
</code></pre>
<p>I want to identify the three digits associated with 'item', but 'item' is not always in the same position, so I cannot use <code>mylist[0]</code>.</p>
<p>I looked at the accepted answer in <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4843158/check-if-a-python-list-item-contains-a-string-inside-another-string">this StackOverflow post</a>, and tried the following:</p>
<pre><code>if any('item' in s for s in mylist):
    print(s)
</code></pre>
<p>I get the following error:</p>
<pre><code>NameError: name 's' is not defined
</code></pre>
<p>In researched that error, but I haven't been able to find any examples/solutions that fit this particular situation.</p>

<p>That error is happening because you are trying to look into s before s has been defined in the for loop. A simple work around for that would be to break the statements apart into:</p>
<p><code>for s in mylist:
    if 'item' in s:
       print(s)
</code></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The simpler way to approach your problem is by using a list comprehension</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; mylist = ['item 101', 'element 202', 'string 303', 'member 404']
&gt;&gt;&gt; [s for s in mylist if 'item' in s]
['item 101']
</code></pre>
<p>If you are assured that there is only one element like that in the list then you can aswell use list-indexes</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; [s for s in mylist if 'item' in s][0]
'item 101'
</code></pre>
<p>Or a better way would be to use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#next" rel="nofollow"><code>next</code></a> and a gen-exp.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; next(s for s in mylist if 'item' in s)
'item 101'
</code></pre>
<p>And to get the 3 digits from the string <code>'item 101'</code> you can do <code>mystr[5:9]</code> where <code>mystr</code> has the value <code>'item 101'</code></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>s only exists in the scope of the single statement:</p>
<pre><code>'item' in s for s in mylist
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to find all items you'll have to save them first into a list. I'm not sure if you want the index of each item or the text of each item or what but you could do:</p>
<pre><code>mylist = ['item 101', 'element 202', 'string 303', 'member 404']
items = [s for s in mylist if 'item' in s]
if any(items):
    print items[0]
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>I have tried the answer in your linked post too, and have run into the same problem. However, if you use a proper comprehension to create a list of booleans, it should work:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; mylist = ['item 101', 'element 202', 'string 303', 'member 404']
&gt;&gt;&gt; if any(['item' in s for s in mylist]):
...     print 'Found item'
</code></pre>
<p>prints out what is expected.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">The reason you are getting this error is because <code>s</code> is only in scope for the life of that generator expression. Once it is exhausted and <code>any()</code> returns it's value <code>s</code> will no longer be available.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you're assured there is only one it's best to use <code>next(s for s in mylist if 'item' in s)</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Aha! @orlp Yes. Thanks for that, I will add it to the post</span>
