<p>I thought I understood how assignment works, but after running these two pieces of code I realized I am pretty confused now.</p>
<p>This is in Python 3.3:</p>
<pre><code>numbers=[1,4,3]
hello=numbers.reverse()
print(hello)
None
</code></pre>
<p>When I <code>print(numbers)</code> instead, I get <code>[3,4,1]</code> which is what I was expecting when printing <code>hello</code>.</p>
<p>On another example:</p>
<pre><code>numbers='yeah'
hello=numbers.capitalize()
print(hello)
Yeah
</code></pre>
<p>How come when assigning a list to second variable, like the first example shows, I get None when printing that second variable, but when assigning a string this does not happen? I ran it in the Python visualizer, but this still does not answer my question as to how/why this is.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>That's because <code>numbers.reverse()</code> reverses the list <strong>in place</strong>.</p>
<p>Your code shoud be:</p>
<pre><code>numbers=[1,4,3]
numbers.reverse()
print(numbers)
</code></pre>
<p>or if you don't want to modify original list <code>numbers</code>, copy numbers to hello:</p>
<pre><code>from copy import copy
numbers=[1,4,3]
hello=copy(numbers)
hello.reverse()
print(hello)
</code></pre>
<p>The documentation of the methods will always tell you if the method works <strong>in place</strong> (i.e. it change the object you are calling the method on to), or if it <strong>returns</strong> the result</p>

<p>As in document specified, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists" rel="nofollow"><code>list.reverse()</code></a> "reverse the elements of the list in place" while <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.capitalize" rel="nofollow"><code>str.capitalize()</code></a> "return a copy of word with only its first character capitalized."</p>
<p>One works in-place while the other returns the result.</p>
