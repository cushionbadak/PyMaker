<p>One can can implement the method <code>__str__(self)</code> to return a string. Is there an <code>__list__(self)</code> counterpart? (<code>__list__</code> doesn't work!)
Is .toList() the way to go?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>There is no direct counterpart, but <code>list()</code> is implemented by iterating over the argument. So implement either <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#iterator-types" rel="noreferrer">the iterator protocol</a> (<code>__iter__()</code>) or <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/reference/datamodel.html#emulating-container-types" rel="noreferrer">bound indexing</a> (<code>__len__()</code> and <code>__getitem__()</code>).</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">There is no magic method called <code>__list__</code>. So, you may have to live with an instance method.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What is the reason for not emulating the container type directly as suggested in the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.3/reference/datamodel.html#emulating-container-types" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation</a>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Can you post your model and what exactly it is you are trying to do?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">plus the fact that this makes it conformant with everything else in the language, too.</span>
