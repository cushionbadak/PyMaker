<p>I'm new to programming and I'm making a small game as practice. A thing that I would like to implement is saving character's attributes as variables in an executable .py file and then to import that as a module to use those variables. </p>
<p>The problem is that I would not like to hard-code the savefiles' names (so to give the player freedom to choose a savefile's name and to have multiple savefiles without them overwriting each other).</p>
<p>So is there a way to basically make the module name a variable? Or perhaps there's an easier way of going about this.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>import importlib
module = importlib.import_module(module_name, package=None)
</code></pre>
<p>where <code>module_name</code> would be the variable.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If I understand your question correctly - You want to store attributes of a character and want to be able to retrieve them later is that right? </p>
<p>The way to do is to use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html" rel="nofollow">pickle</a>. Where you can serialize an object and store it to a file and later load it again. eg. If you've those attributes as a dictionary - you can do something like following</p>
<pre><code>import pickle
x = pickle.dumps({'speed':100, 'agility':200})
char = pickle.loads(x)
</code></pre>
<p>Note: All objects are not 'pickle'able - read the above document. </p>
<p>With regards to your original question - yes a module can be attributed to a variable simply as follows</p>
<pre><code>import BeautifulSoup as bs4 
</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code>import BeautifulSoup
bs4 = BeautifulSoup
</code></pre>
<p>But I don't think that's what you are specifically looking for. </p>
<p>Hope that helps.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You might want to use an actual serialization mechanism for saving values to disk, rather than trying to write out executable Python files. Perhaps the <a href="https://docs.python.org/library/json.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>json</code></a> library could be of help? <code>json.dump(my_dict, file_obj)</code> will save the contents of a dictionary named  <code>my_dict</code> into the file object (from <code>open()</code>) named <code>file_obj</code>, and then you can read them back out again with <code>json.load(file_obj)</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you! I'll need to research json but it does seem like a very viable option.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hey! Thanks for your advice. I'll have to study Python a bit more before I can get to pickling since when I tried reading the pickle doc I just got overwhelmed and couldn't understand much.  But at least now I know what to look for! Thanks again</span>
