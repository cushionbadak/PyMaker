<p>I am pulling from a db and have a row that has a timestamp and I want it to show up as a date in my python script. 
Here is an example of the data</p>
<pre><code>1422471599
1422471599
1422471599
</code></pre>
<p>Here is what I am trying to do in sql</p>
<pre><code>convert(timestamp, cast(time as varchar(12)))
</code></pre>
<p>I would also be willing to try and convert this in python</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You could use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.date.fromtimestamp" rel="nofollow">datetime.fromtimestamp</a>:</p>
<pre><code>from datetime import date

s = 1422471599

print(date.fromtimestamp(s)
2015-01-28
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre>select timestamp 'epoch' + your_column *  interval '1 second' from your_table;

<span class="comment-copy">any idea how to do that in the query? It would make my script a lot faster</span>
<span class="comment-copy">my df is in pandas format as well if that helps</span>
<span class="comment-copy">so you have a dataframe or what exactly? Where are <code>1422471599 ..</code> coming from?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">its a df after I pull the data from a database. I use the pandas package to get it in a df</span>
<span class="comment-copy">So you want to convert the column from timestamp to date?</span>
