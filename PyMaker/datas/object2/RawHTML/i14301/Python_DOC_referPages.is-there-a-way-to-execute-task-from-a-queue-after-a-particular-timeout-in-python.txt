<p>Let us assume that I have <code>n</code> different number of tasks and a stream of tasks are coming with different given <code>time(t)</code>. Is there a way to ensure that each task gets executed after their given <code>time(t)</code>? I'm using python to create and execute these tasks.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Keep the required execution times in a sorted list.<br/>Wait till the time present at the beginning of the list.<br/>Remove the first item from the list and execute the task.<br/>Repeat.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">in this approach every time a new job with time( t) comes in the queue, I'll have to rearrange the queue. And this will increase the time complexity of the problem.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Perhaps it's impossible to reach the O(1) complexity for both <code>insert</code> and <code>remove</code> operations. Anyway, look at the <code>bisect</code> module: <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/bisect.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/2/library/bisect.html</a>, namely the <code>bisect.insort</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Shail. How big is your queue?? <code>append</code> followed by <code>sort</code> is O(n) when the <code>list</code> is presorted. Usually this works well enough and is easily understood.</span>
