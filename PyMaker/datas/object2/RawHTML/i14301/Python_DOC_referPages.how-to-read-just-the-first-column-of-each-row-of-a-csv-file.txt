<p>How to read just the first column of each row of a CSV file in Python?</p>
<p>My data is something like this:</p>
<pre><code>1 abc    
2 bcd    
3 cde
</code></pre>
<p>and I only need to loop trough the values of the first column. </p>
<p>Also, when I open the csv File in calc the data in each row is all in the same cell, is that normal?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>import csv
with open(file) as f:
    reader = csv.reader(f, delimiter="\t")
    for i in reader:
        print i[0]
</code></pre>
<p><strong>OR</strong></p>
<p>change the delimter to space if necessary.</p>
<pre><code>reader = csv.reader(f, delimiter=" ")
</code></pre>
<p>without csv module,</p>
<pre><code>import csv
with open(file) as f:
    for line in f:
        print line.split()[0]
</code></pre>

<p>You can use <code>itertools.izip</code> to crate a generator contains the columns and use <code>next</code> to get the first column.Its more efficient if you have a large data and you want to refuse of multi-time indexing!</p>
<pre><code>import csv
from itertools import izip
with open('ex.csv', 'rb') as csvfile:
     spamreader = csv.reader(csvfile, delimiter=' ')
     print next(izip(*spamreader))
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>To get just the first column as a list:</p>
<pre><code>with open('myFile.csv') as f:
    firstColumn = [line.split(',')[0] for line in f]

<p>for the second part of your question:</p>
<p>when opening csv-documents in LibreOffice Calc (openoffice should work the same way) I get a Dialog where I am asked a few things about that document, like charakter encoding and as well the type of separator. If you select "space", it should work. You have a preview at the bottom of this dialog.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Are the columns separated by a blank?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Given that there is a standard module for <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#module-csv" rel="nofollow noreferrer">CSV handling</a> - what is the problem exactly?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">In what way is it comma separated values?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@PeterWood It's fairly common to find <code>csv</code> files which use different delimiters. about 80% of the <code>csv</code> files I come across are tab, space or pipe delimited. Even had a couple which ended up being xml.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Might be a good idea to simply do a <code>line in f</code> instead of doing <code>f.readlines()</code> edited accordingly.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks! I accepted a version of the edit that is a definite improvement.</span>
