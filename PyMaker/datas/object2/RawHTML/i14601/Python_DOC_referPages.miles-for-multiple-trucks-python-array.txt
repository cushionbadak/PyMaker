<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I'm new to python and programming in general. This problem is asking for a parallel array for 10 trucks , an array for miles, an array for gallons, and another for costs per gallon.  If anyone has a recommendation on helpful sites or videos I could take a look at to figure python out that would be awesome! Thanks for the help in advance. So far I have this..</p>
<pre><code>size = 10
miles[size]
gallons[size]
costs[size]

for index == 1 in size - 1:
    print("Enter the miles, gallons, and costs of fuel for truck 1.", index + 1)
miles[index] = int(input("miles:" )
gallons[index] = int(input("gallons:" )
costs[index] = int(input("costs:" )
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Something like this should work:</p>
<pre><code>size = 10
miles = []
gallons = []
costs = []

for index in range(size):
    print("Enter the miles, gallons, and costs of fuel for truck {}.".format(index + 1))
    miles.append(int(input("miles:")))
    gallons.append(int(input("gallons:")))
    costs.append(int(input("costs:")))
</code></pre>
<p>There were a few issues with your original version:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>As stated in the comments, you don't (generally) initialise a Python list to start at a certain size, instead you create it empty and then add as much stuff into it as you need.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>for</code> loop need to be in the form of <code>for &lt;var&gt; in &lt;iterable&gt;</code>. Then you can use <code>range(x)</code> as your iterable, in Python 2.7 <code>range</code> will return a list of all the numbers in that range, in Python 3 it returns an iterator (which is more memory efficient). <code>range(3)</code> will allow you to iterate over 0, 1 and 2 (for a total of 3 iterations).</p></li>
<li><p>The print statement can be tidied up a bit. By using <code>&lt;string&gt;.format()</code> you can make the output a lot easier. See <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html#format-examples" rel="nofollow">https://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html#format-examples</a> for the full documentation.</p></li>

<span class="comment-copy">What problem are you facing? Error, unexpected output?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">im getting an invalid syntax error for line 6 ==</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That's not how Python lists work - you don't size them up-front like arrays in other languages. Also, indentation is important - your <code>input</code> is <b>outside</b> your <code>for</code> loop. Try following a tutorial, e.g. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">The obvious issues here are that your for loop should be something like <code>for index in range(size)</code>. Then the print should be something like <code>print("Enter ... for truck {}".format(index + 1))</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">does it seem correct so far? would a list be easier seeing as i am using python</span>
<span class="comment-copy">for some reason line 9 <b>gallons</b> is giving me an invalid syntax</span>
<span class="comment-copy">There were 3 <code>(</code> but only 2 <code>)</code> on all those input lines. I've fixed this but you should have spotted it! Your original code had a similar issue ;-)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I see what you are saying. Thanks for the help everyone</span>
