<p>I would like to ask how to skip the receive function.</p>
<pre><code>def client():
    try:
        b = bytes.decode(h.recv(1024))
        print("The recieved message : ",b)
        b1 = str.encode(b)
        c.sendall(b1)
        h.sendall(b1)
        y.sendall(b1)
    except Exception:
        pass
    try:
        g = bytes.decode(y.recv(1024))
        print("The recieved message : ",g)
        g1 = str.encode(g)
        c.sendall(g1)
        h.sendall(g1)
        y.sendall(g1)
    except Exception:
        pass
</code></pre>
<p>So what I need to do is to check if there is a message coming from the client:</p>
<ul>
<li>If yes, print it and send it.</li>
<li>if no, skip the function go to check with the other clients.</li>
</ul>

<p>You need the polling mechanism. The simplest is <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/select.html#select.select" rel="nofollow"><code>select</code></a></p>
<pre><code>import select

def client():
    sockets, _, _ = select.select([h, y], [], [])
    # If h or y has data, select exits and returns these sockets

    for sock in sockets:
        try:
            data = sock.recv(1024)
            if data == '':
                # sock was disconnected handle that
                continue

            # Process data here
        except Exception:
            continue
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">still It is not receiving the message from the clients.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user4823915: From code you posted (<a href="http://pastebin.com/PugZRPXn" rel="nofollow noreferrer">pastebin.com/PugZRPXn</a>): you should call <code>select.select</code> <i>under</i> the while loop. You're also call <code>sendall(g1)</code>, but <code>g1</code> is no longer defined, use data instead: <code>c.sendall(data)</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">I tried that as well it is not working, I think it is not get the message because it can't print it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user4823915: I've fixed my answer, I forgot that select returns tuple of three lists :( Please do not silence exceptions in your code.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, It work now. If you just can explain what is going on ( why we use select and what is the purpose of it) to give better understanding</span>
