<p>here I want to call web service function only once throughout the program.
how to accomplish this anybody suggest me</p>
<pre><code>import sys,os

def web_service(macid):
        # do something

if "__name__" = "__main__" :
      web_service(macid)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This is how I would to that:</p>
<pre><code>i_run_once_has_been_run = False

def i_run_once(macid):
    global i_run_once_has_been_run

    if i_run_once_has_been_run:
        return

    # do something

    i_run_once_has_been_run = True
</code></pre>
<p>@Vaulstein's decorator function would work too, and may even be a bit more pythonic - but it seems like a bit overkill to me.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Using class,</p>
<pre><code>class CallOnce(object):
    called = False

    def web_service(cls, macid):
        if cls.called:
            print "already called"
            return
        else:
            # do stuff
            print "called once"
            cls.called = True
            return


macid = "123"
call_once_object = CallOnce()
call_once_object.web_service(macid)
call_once_object.web_service(macid)
call_once_object.web_service(macid)
</code></pre>
<p>Result is,</p>
<pre><code>I have no name!@sla-334:~/stack_o$ python once.py 
called once
already called
already called
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>"__name__" = "__main__"</code> will not work. You might want to do <code>__name__ == "__main__"</code>. Assignment operator (<code>=</code>) is not the same as equality operator (<code>==</code>). Also check <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/__main__.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>__name__</code></a>, it is not <code>"__name__"</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@thefourtheye I think you meant <code>__name__ == "__main__"</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>if __name__ == '__main__':</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@thefourtheye  i want to call webservice function only once.how to achieve this . Can you suggest me,if <b>name</b> == '<b>main</b>": that i know</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Generic solution: Once it has been called, set a variable to <code>true</code> or something, check if that variable is <code>true</code>, <code>return</code> immediately. Or you'll have to give a few more details about why you want this.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What if you have two functions you only want to run once?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@PeterWood then you would use two globals, I guess. I think at that point the decorator makes sense, but for a single function just a global boolean is best.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What would you name the other global?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Good point - see my edit. I guess if <code>i_run_once_also()</code> were in play we would name the global <code>i_run_once_also_has_been_run</code>. But again, I think the decorator solution is better there.</span>
