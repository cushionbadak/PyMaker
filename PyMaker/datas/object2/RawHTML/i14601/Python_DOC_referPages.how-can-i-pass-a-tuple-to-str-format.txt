<p>I'm trying to use the <code>str.format()</code> function to print a matrix in columns.</p>
<p>This is the line that goes wrong:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; "{!s:4}{!s:5}".format('j',4,3)
'j   4    '
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; "{!s:4}{!s:5}".format(b)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
IndexError: tuple index out of range
&gt;&gt;&gt; b
('dat', 'is')
</code></pre>
<p>What am I doing wrong?</p>
<p>Edit:
I think I know what the problem is: I'm passing a tuple with two elements, which is than passed on to the function as a tuple with one element, my original tuple. Hence this error. so the question is rather how to pass this tuple to the format function...</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can unpack the tuple if you can be certain of its length.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; "{!s:4}{!s:5}".format(*b)
'j   4    '
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>EDIT: Sorry I answered your question too soon before I fully understood it. I think you want to unpack the tuple, exactly as in progo's answer.</p>
<p>It depends slightly on what version of Python you're using. The following works for Python 3.5 (and probably all Python 3).</p>
<p>Code:   </p>
<pre><code>b = ("dat", "is")
"{0}".format(b)
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>"('dat', 'is')"
</code></pre>
<p>Also check the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html" rel="nofollow">Python docs on string formatting</a>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">It also works in Python 2.x. You are only trying to print one value <code>{0}</code>, and that's what you get - the value of <code>b</code>. <code>"{0}, {1}".format(b)</code> fails (as does <code>"{1}".format(b)</code>). This doesn't answer OP's question.</span>
