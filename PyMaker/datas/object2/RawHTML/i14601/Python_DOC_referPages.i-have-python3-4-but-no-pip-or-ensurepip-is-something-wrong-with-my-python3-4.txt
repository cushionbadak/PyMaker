<p>I've read in multiple places that python3.4 ships with pip. My OS is Lubuntu 14.04 and the default python version is Python 2.7.6 but in</p>
<pre><code>/usr/bin
</code></pre>
<p>it says I have python3.4 installed (when I run python3 -V it says I have Python 3.4.0). I made this post earlier last week:
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29712519/how-to-use-pip3-with-python-3-4">How do I use pip 3 with Python 3.4?</a></p>
<p>One of the comments to the reply said that "It may be worth mentioning that python3.4 should always ship pip by default. So python3 -m pip should work out of the box. If not, there's python -m ensurepip to bootstrap pip. get-pip.py should not be necessary here."</p>
<p>I can confirm that I do not have pip because I did</p>
<pre><code>pip -V
</code></pre>
<p>and it said that pip is currently not installed. I tried running</p>
<pre><code>python3 -m pip
</code></pre>
<p>and it said</p>
<pre><code>/usr/bin/python3: No module named pip
</code></pre>
<p>I then tried</p>
<pre><code>python -m ensurepip
python3 -m ensurepip
</code></pre>
<p>and it said</p>
<pre><code>/usr/bin/python: No module named ensurepip
/usr/bin/python3: No module named ensurepip
</code></pre>
<p>With that said, is there something wrong with my version of python3 because it does not have pip or ensurepip? I'm asking because I've read in multiple places (for example, in my previous question) that python3.4 comes with pip and I don't think that is true for my case. </p>
<p>My end goal is to run Django1.8 using python 3.4.3.</p>

<p>On Ubuntu and other Debian derivatives you have to install <code>python3-pip</code> to get Python3â€™s pip.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Ubuntu, Lubuntu, same thing when it comes to this kind of thing. A <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+install+pip+on+ubuntu" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Google Search</a> turns out a lot of results.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@jakekimds I'm not sure if you read my post / question but I already know how to install pip. Thanks though.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>python -m ensurepip</code> is using the python2 interpreter, did you actually try installing with get-pip?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user2719875 I thought your post was about if PIP ships with Python3 by default? I just installed Python 3 and PIP didn't come with mine either.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@jakekimds okay thanks. I'm now under the impression that python3.4.0 has no pip / ensurepip but python3.4.3 does. What's confusing me is that over here: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.4.html#whatsnew-pep-453" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.4.html#whatsnew-pep-453</a> it says "The version of pip included with Python 3.4.0 is pip 1.5.4". For now, I'll just install python3.4.3.</span>
