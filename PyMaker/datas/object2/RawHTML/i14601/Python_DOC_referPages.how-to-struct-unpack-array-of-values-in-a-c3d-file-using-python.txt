<p>I'm coding my own script to retrieve values from a c3d motion capture data file. Data are stored as integer in an array of dimension 1x14. How can I retrieve these values ?</p>
<p>Thank you for any help,</p>

<p>I don't know the c3d file format at all, but if you know what kind of integers your data contains, it's easy to unpack them. You just need to give <code>struct.pack</code> an appropriate <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html#format-strings" rel="nofollow">format string</a>.</p>
<p>For 16 bit integers, the format code you'll want is <code>h</code> or <code>H</code> (depending on whether the numbers are signed or unsigned). You also may need to start the string with a specifier of the byte ordering (<code>&lt;</code> or <code>&gt;</code> for little-endian and big-endian, respectively) if the integers are not stored with the same byte ordering that your CPU uses natively.</p>
<p>Try something like this:</p>
<pre><code>parsed_ints = struct.unpack("&lt;14h", raw_data) # 14 little-endian signed 16-bit ints
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">What kind of integers are they? 32-bit? 16-bit? Big-endian or little-endian? Signed or unsigned? Once you know, it should be quite easy to build the format string required by <code>struct.unpack</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It should be 16-bit integers</span>
