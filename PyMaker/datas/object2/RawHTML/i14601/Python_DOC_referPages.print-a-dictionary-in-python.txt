<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have a file that looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>5 John Doe 
3 Jadzia Kowalska
13 Heather Graham
44 Jane Doe
</code></pre>
<p>I read it in, split it up and save it up in a dictionary with the number as the key and a list as the value and each word as a separate string in the list.  I want to print each id followed by its name out to the command line but I am unsure how to do so since each name is a list of strings. Would I need a triple for loop? Any help would be greatly appreciated!</p>
<pre><code>import sys


filename=sys.argv[1]

#reads file into list
with open(filename) as f:
   filecontent = f.readlines()

names=[]
ids=[]

for i in filecontent:
    split=i.split()
    names.append(split[1:])
    ids.append(split[0])


d= dict.fromkeys(ids,names)
sorted(d, key=d.get)

for id, name in d:
  print id, name
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Use:</p>
<pre><code>for id, name in d:
  print id, ' '.join(name)
</code></pre>
<p>The way this works is that</p>
<pre><code>' '.join(['first', 'last'])
</code></pre>
<p>Joins all elements in the list with an empty space as its separator. This would also work if you wanted to create a <code>CSV</code> file in which case you would use a comma as the separator. For example:</p>
<pre><code>','.join(['first', 'second', 'third']) 
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to print with a space between ID and the name, use</p>
<pre><code>print "{0} {1}".format(id, ' '.join(name))
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Loop over the dicts <code>.items()</code> and use string formatting and <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#str.join" rel="nofollow">str#join</a> to make the name.</p>
<p><code>.join</code> takes an iterable (list of strings in your example) and concatenates them onto the empty string from which you call join on.</p>
<pre><code>for id, name in d.items():
   print "{0} {1}".format(id, ' '.join(name))
</code></pre>
<p>should yield what you're looking for.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.join" rel="nofollow">str.join</a> to concatenate lists into a single string.</p>
<p>You can also use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.format" rel="nofollow">str.format</a> to make it easier to build strings:</p>
<p>Both of these functions should also be available in Python 2.x unless you're using a very old version.</p>
<p>You also have an issue with how you build your dictionary, <code>dict.fromkeys</code> sets all values to the same value (the one you provide). You should use <code>dict(zip(ids, names))</code> instead.</p>
<p>And finally, the way you're using <code>sorted</code> is wrong since <code>sorted</code> returns a sorted <em>copy</em>. In this case you'll end up with a sorted copy of the keys in the dictionary that is immediately thrown away. Use <code>sort</code> together with <code>.items()</code> when iterating instead:</p>
<pre><code>d=dict(zip(ids, names))
for id, name in sorted(d.items(), key=lambda i: int(i[0])):
    print("ID:{}, name: {}".format(id, " ".join(name)))
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">why dont you use pprint &amp; if possible could you post the expected output, so tat it will be easy to understand the problem you are trying to solve</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you. For some reason it gives me an error message saying it needs more than one value to unpack.  Why would it give me that error message?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Am I splitting and parsing the file correctly?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It should be <code>for id,name in d.items()</code>.  The default is only to iterate over the keys.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you.  Now it is giving me an error saying it expected a string but found a list...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">There's an issue with how you create your dictionary, I've updated my answer with a fix to that</span>
