<p>The Python <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.abc.html" rel="noreferrer"><code>collections.abc</code></a> module contains many handy ABCs for checking various features of objects, but one that doesn't appear to belong is <code>Callable</code>. No standard collection is callable, and <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3119/" rel="noreferrer"><code>PEP 3119</code></a> doesn't provide any reasoning or even mention the Callable ABC, so why is it in this package instead of somewhere else?</p>
<p>Context:
I'm writing a Python-&gt;Java compiler for fun, and I just wanted to see if there was any reasoning behind the decision so I could list that reasoning in my code.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The module originates from PEP-3119 which proposes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specific ABCs for containers and iterators, to be added to the collections module.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But since then, it evolved to be something more. And now a module description does not mention containters and iterators explictly. It says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This module provides abstract base classes that can be used to test whether a class provides a particular interface; for example, whether it is hashable or whether it is a mapping.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I believe it is a <code>collections</code> submodule just because it was a part of it in the past:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>New in version 3.3: Formerly, this module was part of the collections module.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">a reasonable question ... however Im not sure its actually related to programing and programming problems. so it might get smooshed</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@JoranBeasley I'll throw in some context then.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Where should it be instead? A new <code>functools.abc</code> module? It would be pretty lonely there, wouldn't it?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Maybe it's a <i>clue.</i> There are no callable collections... yet!</span>
