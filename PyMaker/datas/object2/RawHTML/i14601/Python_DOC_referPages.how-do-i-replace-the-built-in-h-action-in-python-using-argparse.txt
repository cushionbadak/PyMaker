<p>I am creating a command line tool in python, and I'm using argparse to parse my input. </p>
<p>I want to use '-h' as an action, but that is already automatically assigned to --help. How can I override this and have an -h action?</p>

<span class="comment-copy">@jonrsharpe I needed it the other day, because I was building a wrapper around some other specialised software. I wanted to keep the flags identical between the wrapper and the software.</span>
