<p>I want to retrieve <code>transcripts.gtf</code> files from <code>"/output_folder/sample/cufflinks/"</code> to <code>assemblies.txt</code>. Is the above code correct or not. Please help me out. Thank you !!</p>

<p>You can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/os.html#os.walk" rel="nofollow">os.walk</a> :</p>
<pre><code>import os
import shutil
from os.path import join

destination =  "/output_folder/assemblies.txt" # Absolute path, or use join
folder_to_look_in = "/output_folder/sample/cufflinks/" # Absolute folder path, or use join
for _, _, files in os.walk(folder_to_look_in):
    for file_name in files:
        if file_name.endswith("transcripts.gtf"):
            try:
                # 'a' will append the data to the tail of the file
                with open(destination, 'a') as my_super_file:
                    my_super_file.write(file_name)
            except OSError as e:
                print "I/O error({0}): {1}".format(e.errno, e.strerror)

<p>I think I finally understand what you are trying to achieve. Use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/glob.html" rel="nofollow">glob.glob()</a> function:</p>
<pre><code>import glob
destination = "output_folder/assemblies.txt"
source = '/output_folder/sample/cufflinks/*/*transcripts.gtf'
with open(destination, 'w') as f:
    f.write('\n'.join(glob.glob(source))+'\n')
</code></pre>
<p><code>f.write('\n'.join(glob.glob(source))+'\n')</code> is the equivalent of:</p>
<pre><code>s = ''
for path in glob.glob(source):
    s += '{}\n'.format(path)
f.write(s)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">you have code Review for reviewing your code! <a href="http://codereview.stackexchange.com/">codereview.stackexchange.com</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@e-nouri <a href="https://codereview.stackexchange.com">Code Review</a> is for "my code works, help me make it better!" And not for "does this thing even work?"</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This question would be closed as off-topic, so regardless of whether or not you consider it "a code review", you shouldn't recommend questions that would be closed on that target site. If this question isn't a good fit for SO, explain why and recommend changes that would make it a better fit for SO. It doesn't belong on <a href="https://codereview.stackexchange.com">Code Review</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@e-nouri code review has a rule that the code must be working code, if the author doesn't know if it's correct (same as working in mine eye's). See <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/253975/be-careful-when-recommending-code-review-to-askers" title="be careful when recommending code review to askers">meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/253975/â€¦</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">just i asked this in code review. i got a msg saying it doesn't belong there</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I don't want to move the file. Just the path of the files should be given into the text file.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">for eg: the text file should contain like this /sample1/transcripts.gtf /sample2/transcripts.gtf /sample3/transcripts.gtf /sample4/transcripts.gtf /sample5/transcripts.gtf /sample6/transcripts.gtf</span>
<span class="comment-copy">There you go ! Please next time try to get something working on your own, it is the best way to improve your coding skills !</span>
<span class="comment-copy">yes, I'm still learning. thankyou</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user3351523 It would have been super helpful with the example you provide here in your original question. Good questions in general receive good answers.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">this looks fine. thankyou</span>
<span class="comment-copy">W will wipe the file if you run the script 2 times</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@e-nouri That is correct. You can use <code>'a'</code> instead of <code>'w'</code>, if you want to append.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@tommy what does this tell f.write('\n'.join(glob.glob(source))+'\n')</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user3351523 I updated the answer with an explanation.</span>
