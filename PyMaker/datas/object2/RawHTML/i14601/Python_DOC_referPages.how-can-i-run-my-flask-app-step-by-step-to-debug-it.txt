<p>I want to run IPython interactively while running my Flask app.  I tried <code>ipython -i app.py</code> but I don't get a prompt until after the app exits.  I want to do this so I can debug each step of the program.  How can I run my app and be able to examine it?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The <code>-i</code> flag runs the given program and then puts you in an interactive session <em>after it has run</em>.  There is no way to debug the program using this flag.</p>
<p>Instead, you want to use a debugger.  <code>python -m pdb app.py</code> will start <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html" rel="nofollow">pdb</a>, a console debugger.  There are other debuggers available, such as the graphical one built into IDEs such as PyCharm and PyDev, or more advanced console ones such as <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pudb" rel="nofollow">pudb</a>.</p>

<p>Implemented with <code>thread</code></p>
<pre><code>from flask import Flask                                                         
import thread
data = 'foo'
app = Flask(__name__)
@app.route("/")
def main():
    return data
def flaskThread():
    app.run()
if __name__ == "__main__":
    thread.start_new_thread(flaskThread,())
</code></pre>
<p>And open the <code>IPython</code> Command prompt and type the command <code>run -i filename.py</code> </p>

<span class="comment-copy">What's not working with <code>ipython -i app.py</code>? Is it displaying an error or anything?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Let me guess: The event loop of flask does not return and you won't get any prompt?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">no it's not returning any error but after exiting from flask. It will return to ipython prompt.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@RahulKP That's is kinda point of <code>ipython -i</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Try <code>python app.py</code></span>
