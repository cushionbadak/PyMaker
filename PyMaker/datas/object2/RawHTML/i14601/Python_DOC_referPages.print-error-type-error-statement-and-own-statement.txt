<p>I want to try a statement and if there is an error, I want it to print the original error it receives, but also add my own statement to it.</p>
<p>I was looking for this answer, found something that was almost complete <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1483429/how-to-print-an-error-in-python">here</a>.</p>
<p>The following code did almost all I wanted (I'm using Python 2 so it works):</p>
<pre><code>except Exception, e: 
    print str(e)
</code></pre>
<p>This way I can print the error message and the string I wanted myself, however it does not print the error type (<code>IOError</code>, <code>NameError</code>, etc.). What I want is for it to print the exact same message it would normally do (so <code>ErrorType: ErrorString</code>) plus my own statement.</p>

<p>If you want to print the exception information, you can use the <code>traceback</code> module:</p>
<pre><code>import traceback
try:
    infinity = 1 / 0
except Exception as e:
    print "PREAMBLE"
    traceback.print_exc()
    print "POSTAMBLE, I guess"
</code></pre>
<p>This gives you:</p>
<pre><code>PREAMBLE
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "testprog.py", line 3, in &lt;module&gt;
    infinity = 1 / 0
ZeroDivisionError: integer division or modulo by zero
POSTAMBLE, I guess
</code></pre>
<p>You can also rethrow the exception without <code>traceback</code> but, since it's an exception being thrown, you can't do anything afterwards:</p>
<pre><code>try:
    infinity = 1 / 0
except Exception as e:
    print "PREAMBLE"
    raise
    print "POSTAMBLE, I guess"
</code></pre>
<p>Note the lack of <code>POSTAMBLE</code> in this case:</p>
<pre><code>PREAMBLE
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "testprog.py", line 2, in &lt;module&gt;
    infinity = 1 / 0
ZeroDivisionError: integer division or modulo by zero
</code></pre>

<p>From <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html" rel="nofollow">python docs</a>:</p>
<pre><code>try:
    raise Exception('spam', 'eggs')
except Exception as inst:
    print(type(inst))    # the exception instance
    print(inst.args)     # arguments stored in .args
    print(inst)          # __str__ allows args to be printed directly,
</code></pre>
<p>Will be print:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;type 'exceptions.Exception'&gt;
('spam', 'eggs')
('spam', 'eggs')
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Ah, that is even easier indeed.   I think my ideal scenario would be if I can print my own statement behind the error message, since it is more readable this way. But I also figured that when raising, you can't do anything after. So unless there is an easy way to extract the whole error message (including traceback) I think your answer is the best I can do :)  Thanks!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Just a note though: Since you are now not using the error string 'e' in your except clause, can't you just change "except Exception as e:" to "except:" now?</span>
