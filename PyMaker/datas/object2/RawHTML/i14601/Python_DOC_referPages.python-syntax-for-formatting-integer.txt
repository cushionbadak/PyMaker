<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I am new in python. In the following line
    '{0:6}{1:02d}'.format(date, hour)</p>
<p>I figured out that hour should be 0 filled to two digits. But I can't figure out what it is formatting date to be. afaik, both date and hour are int values here.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Try it and see:</p>
<pre class="lang-python prettyprint-override"><code>a = 10
b = 6
print('{0:6}{1:02}'.format(a, b))
#output =&gt; '    1006'
</code></pre>
<p>So like 02 adds "0"s to the variable until it is of 2 length. Just adding a number (6) will add spaces to the front until the variable length is 6.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>{0:6}</code> is just going to take the 0th argument (<code>date</code>) and print it with a minimum of 6 characters.  It can be an integer, a string, ...  Nothing else special there.  It is a guess at what format was intended for <code>date</code> (ie. May1st, 5/1, ...)</p>
<p>You are correct about the interpretation of the <code>{1:02d}</code> which is the <code>hour</code> field print in a minimum of 2 decimal digits with 0's to pad.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">an example would be better.</span>
