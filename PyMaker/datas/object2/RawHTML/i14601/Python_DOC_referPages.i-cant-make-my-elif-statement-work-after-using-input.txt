<p>So I'm making a quick text based application and made a guess at doing this. I want my program to accept an input from the user and create different outcomes when a user inputs a direction. It just is going to the if no matter what I type. I took a shot in the dark and this is my code.</p>
<pre><code>print ("Would you like to go left or right?")
input()
if ("left"):
    print ("Welcome to the cleanliness room *squeak!*.")
    print ("Would you like to go forward,or backwards?")
elif ("right"):
    print ("Inhale my dong enragement child.")
    print ("GAME OVER")
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>input()</code> <em>returns</em> a result, but you ignored it and nothing happened with it. <code>if ("left"):</code> just asks if the string <code>"left"</code> is not empty. It is indeed not empty.</p>
<p>Store the return value of <code>input()</code> in a new variable, then test that variable for equality with <code>==</code>:</p>
<pre><code>print ("Would you like to go left or right?")
answer = input()
if answer == "left":
    print("Welcome to the cleanliness room *squeak!*.")
    print("Would you like to go forward,or backwards?")
elif answer == "right":
    print("Inhale my dong enragement child.")
    print("GAME OVER")
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">That... isn't really code. I mean it runs without error, but it doesn't make <i>any sense at all</i>. You don't actually assign the user's input, so you can never refer to it again, and <code>if "left":</code> (the parentheses are redundant) is really just <code>if "left" != "":</code> or <code>if True:</code>, and <b>doesn't relate at all to the <code>input</code></b>, so you can hopefully see why you never hit the <code>elif</code> case. Maybe take a tutorial?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Oh, and if you <i>"made a guess"</i> or <i>"took a shot in the dark"</i>, that <b>isn't really programming</b>; read <a href="https://pragprog.com/the-pragmatic-programmer/extracts/coincidence" rel="nofollow noreferrer">pragprog.com/the-pragmatic-programmer/extracts/coincidence</a></span>
