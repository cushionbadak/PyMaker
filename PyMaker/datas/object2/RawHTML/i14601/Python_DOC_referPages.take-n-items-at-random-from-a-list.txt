<p>I have a list L and want to return a list of n items from it, at random.</p>
<p>Right now I am relying on itertools.combinations and then picking one at random, but I have to wait a while until the list looks like something that isn't stuck with a lot of items near the start of the list, so it's not really "random."</p>

<p>use <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/random.html#random.sample" rel="nofollow">random.sample</a> to sample K items from a list of population n.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Ok.so can you show us your code?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Kasra I already explained it. I use itertools.combinations and then (manually) take one at random.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You can ask another question with your code! then you'll get the desire answer!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I didn't notice random.sample. Thanks! I can accept in 8.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ArukaJ: If this answers your question you may want to accept it as an accepted answer.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why <code>%a</code>?  <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.randint" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>randint</code></a> returns a value in the range <code>[a, b]</code> already.  You should generally never modulo random data.  Furthermore this will generate duplicate results, as you are sapling "with replacement".  Just use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.sample" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>sample</code></a> as was already suggested; it's easier and faster.</span>
