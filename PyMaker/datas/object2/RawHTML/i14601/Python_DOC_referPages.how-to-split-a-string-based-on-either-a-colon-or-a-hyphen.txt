<pre><code>a = '4-6'
b= '7:10'
</code></pre>
<p>I have already tried</p>
<pre><code>a.split('-')
a.split(':')
</code></pre>
<p>how can i write code that can take in either string and get rid of both colons and hyphens? Is there a better way besides splitting the same string twice?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>To split on more than one delimiter, you can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.split" rel="nofollow"><code>re.split</code></a> and a character set:</p>
<pre><code>import re
re.split('[-:]', a)
</code></pre>
<p>Demo:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import re
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = '4-6'
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = '7:10'
&gt;&gt;&gt; re.split('[-:]', a)
['4', '6']
&gt;&gt;&gt; re.split('[-:]', b)
['7', '10']
</code></pre>
<p>Note however that <code>-</code> is also used to specify a range of characters in a character set.  For example, <code>[A-Z]</code> will match all uppercase letters.  To avoid this behavior, you can put the <code>-</code> at the start of the set as I did above. For more information on Regex syntax, see <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntax" rel="nofollow">Regular Expression Syntax</a> in the docs.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can replace one by the other then split the entire string:</p>
<pre><code>parts = your_string.replace('-', ':').split(':')
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Are you trying to make a list of all elements seperated by either a '-' or ':'. Or just remove those characters from the string and return the new string sans thats character?</span>

<span class="comment-copy">You should mention that this is called a regular expression.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I think regular expressions should be avoided in the case of beginners.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MalikBrahimi - Why?  In my opinion, they are a very useful tool that every programmer should be aware of.  Now that's not to say they should be used <i>everywhere</i>, but in this case, a Regex solution is nice and simple.</span>
