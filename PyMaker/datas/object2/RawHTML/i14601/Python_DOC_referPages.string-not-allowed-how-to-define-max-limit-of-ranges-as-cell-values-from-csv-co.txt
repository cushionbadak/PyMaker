<p>Hopefully the incorrect code still conveys what I'm trying to do. I get a string error using enumerate (and range) b/c 'count' is interpreted as a string when I instead want it to be interpreted as an integer value. I want to create arrays with integer values from 0 to the count value. If it helps, my purpose is to create a single list of values when only the frequency of each value is given. Thanks!</p>
<pre><code>import csv, sys

outputCSV = open(r"C:\Users\Out.csv")
inputCSV = open(r"C:\Users\Slope.csv")

reader = csv.reader(inputCSV, delimiter = ',')
writer = csv.writer(outputCSV, delimiter = ',')

for row in reader:
    count = row[1]
    countArray = enumerate(0, count) #make list of consecutive integers from 0 to value of count

    while i &lt;= max(countArray):
        print row[0]                #print row value as many times as there are integers in the range 0 through the max of countArray. The printed row value should have same index as the current count index.
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>From what I understood, each row in your CSV file has a number and a count; and you want to create, for each row, a list with the number repeated count times.</p>
<p>As you have used it, you will not get a string error - you are using enumerate wrong since it expects an iterable as the first argument. But in this case, enumerate is not needed anyways.</p>
<p>In general though, what you read from the csv will be a string, so you need to convert it into an integer. You could do something like this:</p>
<pre><code>for row in reader:
    count = int(row[1])
    num = int(row[0])
    for i in range(count):
        print(num)
</code></pre>
<p>Or you could use comprehension and get all the lists at once:</p>
<pre><code>nums = [[int(row[0])] * int(row[1]) for row in reader]
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>There are several problems here. I am not sure what you are trying to do.</p>
<p>1) To get rid of the error, just transform your count into an integer:</p>
<pre><code>count = int(row[1])
</code></pre>
<p>2) To create a list that ranges between 0 and count:</p>
<pre><code>countArray = range(count+1)
</code></pre>
<p>3) you have an infinite loop:</p>
<pre><code># i is not initialized =&gt; another error
while i &lt;= max(countArray): # max(countArray) = count =&gt; why create the array in the first place?
    print row[0]            # i is not altered so i &lt;= max(countArray) is always True =&gt; infinite loop:
</code></pre>
<p>Maybe what you want is something like:</p>
<pre><code>for i in countArray:
    print row[0] # That loop works but i don't know if it does what you need 
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">@Julien Spronck Either of you know why I would be getting the following when I use int(row[1])?  ---invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'COUNT' Thanks for the tips.        *edit, oh nevermind, that's the header!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That must be the header I suppose? The first row probably has (COUNT, NUM) or something. You should skip that line - see this: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14257373/skip-the-headers-when-editing-a-csv-file-using-python" title="skip the headers when editing a csv file using python">stackoverflow.com/questions/14257373/â€¦</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">the string 'COUNT' cannot be converted into an integer. I'm guessing that's the first line of your file, that needs to be skipped.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks again guys, I'm now wondering what my error is with writing the num returns to a column in an output csv. I'm trying this as the last line in the second for loop ------  writer.writerow(num)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">you can't "writerow" a number - it expects an iterable. Refer <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.csvwriter.writerow" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.csvwriter.writerow</a></span>
