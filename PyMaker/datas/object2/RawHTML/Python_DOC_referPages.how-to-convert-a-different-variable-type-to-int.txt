<p>I researched everywhere to find out how to convert string to int and I found some answers,but when I used them I am not getting the result I wanted.Any help will be accepted gratefully.I have inserted my code into this question.</p>
<pre><code>print("Type your age ")
character_age = input()
print("So your age is "+character_age)
print("If your father is 20 years older what will be your fathers age ?")
age_character = int(character_age)
print("Father's age is " +age_character)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><strong>Input:</strong></p>
<pre><code>print("Type your age ")
character_age = input()
print("So your age is "+character_age)
print("If your father is 20 years older what will be your fathers age ?")
age_character = int(character_age)+20 #add 20 with character age
print("Father's age is " + str (age_character )) # convert back into string for print
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>
<pre><code>Type your age
5
So your age is 5
If your father is 20 years older what will be your fathers age ?
Father's age is 25

<p><code>print()</code> is throwing TypeError. You cannot concatenate a <code>string</code> with an <code>int</code>. You would need to convert your <code>int</code> to a <code>string</code> using the <code>str</code> function</p>
<pre><code>print("Type your age ")
character_age = input()
print("So your age is "+character_age)
print("If your father is 20 years older what will be your fathers age ?")
age_character = int(character_age)
print("Father's age is " +str(age_character))
</code></pre>
<p>Change <code>print("Father's age is " +age_character)</code> to:</p>
<pre><code>print("Father's age is " +str(age_character))
</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code>print("Father's age is",age_character)
</code></pre>

<p>You're already correctly converting the string <code>character_age</code> to an integer with the <code>int</code> constructor, although to be able to concatenate with another string you'll need to convert it back to a string, and since the printed message says the father's age should be 20 years older, you'll want to add 20 to it before converting to a string:</p>
<pre><code>age_character = int(character_age) + 20
print("Father's age is " + str(age_character))
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>What do you mean you are not getting the result you want ? </p>
<pre><code>age_character = int(character_age)
</code></pre>
<p>The age_character variable already converted age into int. The only problem is you are trying to print a combination of string and int. You have convert it to string.</p>
<pre><code>print(type(age_character))
print("Father's age is " + str(age_character) )
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can just use <code>int()</code>:</p>
<pre><code>x = '10'
int(x)
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to print an integer variable, you need to convert it back to a string using <code>str()</code>, as on your last line:</p>
<pre><code>print("Father's age is " + str(age_character))
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You cannot print a integer directly by using '+' operator as both datatypes are different. You need to convert that to a string.Try the below it will work.</p>
<pre><code>print("Father's age is " + str(age_character))
</code></pre>
<p>The remaining code is correct</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can do this like that(no need to convert into Strings):
make sure your (character_age must be an integer)</p>
<p>code:
{{ print "So your age is {character_age}".format(character_age=character_age) }}</p>
<p>{{ print "Father's age is {age_character}".format(age_character=age_character) }}</p>

<p>Python's built in function <code>int()</code> can be used for this purpose.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = "10"
&gt;&gt;&gt; int(a)
10
</code></pre>
<p>However, this works provided the string is convertible.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = "45.2"
&gt;&gt;&gt; int(a)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
