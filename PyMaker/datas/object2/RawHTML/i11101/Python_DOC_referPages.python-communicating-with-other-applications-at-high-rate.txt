<p>I have a Python function <code>get_messages()</code> that is able to retrieve messages from another application via a dll. These messages arrive at a rate of about 30hz, and I need to fill a buffer with these messages, while the main Python application is running and doing things with theses messages. I believe the filling of the buffer should occur in a separate thread. My question is: what is the best Pythonic way to retrieve these messages ? (running a loop in a separate thread is probably not the best solution). Is there a module that is dedicated to this sort of tasks?</p>

<p>Answer according to Doug Ross: consider the Asyncio module.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You may want to consider the <code>asyncio</code> module, a new addition in python 3.4. It comes with an event loop that achieves non-blocking I/O similar to JavaScript. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">thx. Do you know a comprehensive introduction to asyncio? the manual is somewhat hard.</span>
