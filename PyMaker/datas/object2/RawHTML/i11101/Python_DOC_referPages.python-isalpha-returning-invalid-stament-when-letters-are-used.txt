<p>So whilst programming part of my homework, I decided to include validation within my program. However whilst adding in validation using the <code>.isalpha()</code> command, when having a sentence with letters in it, I get the error message for when typing in numbers. Sorry, cant display all of my program but i have included a test bed of code I programmed to test whether the <code>.isalpha()</code> command works, for validating whether only alphabetic letters are entered. Test data entered = one of several testing examples</p>
<pre><code>word = input("enter a word")
if word.isalpha():
    print("Word accepted")
else:
    print("Invalid letters only")
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you enter more than one word, there are non-alpha characters in your input (spaces in the case of the input <code>"testing example one of several"</code>). Those cause <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.isalpha" rel="nofollow"><code>isalpha</code></a> to fail.</p>
<p>Also, your error message is misleading - a single non-alpha character is enough to trigger the error, not "invalid letters only".</p>
<pre><code>In [1]: "Hello".isalpha()
Out[1]: True

In [2]: "Hello Hello".isalpha()
Out[2]: False

In [3]: "Lotsoflettersandonedigit1".isalpha()
Out[3]: False
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to allow spaces in your input as well (but no punctuation or digits or other non-letter characters), you could do</p>
<pre><code>if all(s.isalpha() for s in word.split()):
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">What is your input?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is hard to answer unless you tell us what you typed in for <code>word</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Test data entered = testing example one of several</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Nope, Python 3.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What is your input which gives the unexpected result?</span>
