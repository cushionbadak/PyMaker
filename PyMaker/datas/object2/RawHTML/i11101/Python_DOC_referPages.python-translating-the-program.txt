<p>Given a string with codon letters I can´t figure what the following program is explicitly doing. I know that it goes through the whole string but what is it doing exactly ?  </p>
<pre><code>s = "AVGGGKGDEMAWTWVRPMGVIDWEEGGVKLVAGLLP"

[i for i in range(1,len(s)) if s[i] in 'VE' and s[i-1]!= 'W'] ? 
</code></pre>
<p>The response is [5, 28]. </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This list comprehension goes through string <code>s</code> one index at a time and checks 2 conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the character at index <code>i</code> in the string <code>'VE'</code>?</li>
<li>Is the character before the character at index <code>i</code> not equal to <code>'W'</code>?</li>
</ul>
<p>If both those conditions are <code>True</code> then <code>i</code> is added to a new list (which in this example isn't being saved).</p>
<p>The output is telling you the characters at index 5 and index 28 meet these conditions (the output doesn't seem to be right for this string though). Remember strings are 0 indexed, meaning the first letter of the string is accessed via <code>s[0]</code>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">If the current character is either V or E and the one before it is not W, save the index (location) of that character. Try running it again. The response I get is <code>[1, 8, 19, 24, 27, 30]</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank You a lot ! You are right...I copy paste the wrong string... I was trying to exercise and I put a different one. You are right. That´s the answer.</span>
