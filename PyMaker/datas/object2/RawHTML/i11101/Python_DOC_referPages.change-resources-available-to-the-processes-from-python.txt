<p>Is there a way to change resources available to a running process from <code>Python</code>? Namely I would like to change <code>Max open files</code> <code>soft</code>:<code>hard</code> limit.</p>
<p>I know I can use <code>ulimit -n 1024000</code> and spawn process from that shell, but that would require stopping that process beforehand.</p>
<p>I'm also aware of <code>prlimit</code>, but it's not available in <code>Wheezy 7.6</code> with <code>util-linux 2.20.1-5.3</code>.</p>
<p>Python <code>resource</code> module apparently allows changing limits just for itself...</p>
<p>I have found the following <a href="https://gregchapple.com/updating-ulimit-on-running-linux-process/" rel="nofollow">blog article</a>, which explains how to do it with <code>gdb</code> and I'm just hoping that something similar exists in <code>Python</code>.</p>
<p>Essentially I think I'm asking how to make <code>setrlimit</code> system-call for a running process from the Python program.</p>

<p>Take another look at the <code>resource</code> library. The function <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/resource.html#resource.prlimit" rel="nofollow"><code>resource.prlimit()</code></a> takes a <code>pid</code> as its first argument, and raises <code>ProcessLookupError</code> if a process by that ID cannot be found. So I believe it's exactly what you're looking for.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/resource.html#resource.prlimit" rel="nofollow">resource.prlimit(pid, resource[, limits])</a></p>
<p>Combines <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/resource.html#resource.setrlimit" rel="nofollow">setrlimit()</a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/resource.html#resource.getrlimit" rel="nofollow">getrlimit()</a> in one function and supports to get and set the resources limits of an arbitrary process. If pid is 0, then the call applies to the current process. [...]</p>
<p>When <code>limits</code> is not given the function returns the resource limit of the process pid. When <code>limits</code> is given the resource limit of the process is set and the former resource limit is returned.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The catch is that this function is not present in Python 2.7. Hopefully you can dip your toes in python 3 for this one task. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">Sorry, I perhaps tagged my question incorrectly. It should also work from <code>python2.7</code>, hence I updated question tags. Though thank you, it's good to know <code>python3</code> has this functionality.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I just noticed that it's not available from python 2.7. Editing.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You should just switch to python 3 anyway, for lots of other reasons... :-)</span>
