<p>I am quite new to Python. In school we have to create a maths game, and I am creating a 9 times table game. However, it tells me the answer is incorrect even if it is correct? please help!</p>
<pre><code>import random
print(" Hello there!")#prints hello there
print("What is your name?")#asks user for a name
name= input()#sets name to the input
print(name, ", are you ready to test your nine times table? ")#asks user if they are ready to test their 9 times table
print (name, ", here we go!")#prints here we go
print ("Question 1:")#prints Question 1:
number1 = random.randint(1,12)#sets number1 to a random value from 1 to 12
answer= 9*number1#sets answer to 9 times number1
print ("what is 9 times", number1, "?")#asks what is 9 times number 1
if answer==input():
    print ("well done," , name,"thats correct!")
else:
    print("sorry, the correct answer was", answer, )

<p>Your issue is that you are comparing a string (<code>input()</code>) to a number (<code>answer</code>).</p>
<p>You can fix this by doing:</p>
<pre><code>if answer==int(input()):
</code></pre>
<p>This converts your <code>input()</code> to an <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int" rel="nofollow"><code>int</code></a>. As a benefit, it will also throw an error if the user puts in something other than an <code>int</code>.</p>
<p>This assumes that you'll continue to do integer multiplication. If not, you may want to look at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#float" rel="nofollow"><code>float()</code></a></p>

<span class="comment-copy">If you are using Python 3 (seems like it), this <code>if answer==input():</code> is comparing strings with numbers.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>print(" Hello there!")#prints hello there</code> Don't do this! Comments are for explaining what is not obvious about a program, not for reading it aloud. This kind of noise only makes your code <i>harder</i> to read and work with.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">similarly you could cast <code>answer</code> to a <code>str</code>, that way if the user entered a non-number it would just be considered not equal instead of raising an error.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">While true, since this is a mathematical test, it makes more sense to get that type of error. At least to me. You could then give error messages such as "please enter a number" instead of just "that is not equal".</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I agree, although with the <code>input()</code> imbedded in the condition and the possibility that the OP is not familiar with <code>try:except:</code> I thought it was a valid point to add.</span>
