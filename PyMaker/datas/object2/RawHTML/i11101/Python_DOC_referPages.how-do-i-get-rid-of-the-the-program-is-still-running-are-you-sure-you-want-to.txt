<p>that's the code, but when I run it and type the wrong password it shows this warning:<a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/O1X3F.png" rel="nofollow">And I want it to run without this message so it just instantly closes</a></p>

<p>To avoid the message when running from IDLE, do not use <code>quit()</code> or <code>exit()</code> in a program.  They are not part of the language and are not intended for this use.  They are (usually) added by the site package for <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#quit" rel="nofollow">interactive use only</a>. In particular, they were added so that people could more easily exit the interactive interpreter when running in a terminal window -- without knowing the magic control code needed on a particular system -- and without closing the terminal window itself.</p>

<p>On Unix, <code>^D</code>, End of File, exits, but on DOS and still on Windows, <code>^Z&lt;Return&gt;</code> is used instead.  Few beginners know this.  Other interactive programs use <code>quit</code> and <code>exit</code>, so we added those as synonyms.</p>
<p>With IDLE, <code>^D</code> in the shell closes the shell on all systems, but not editor windows.  It is the same as clicking the close button on the title bar.  At least on Windows, <code>^Q</code> == <code>quit()</code> and closes everything.</p>
<p>To exit a program when not as the bottom of a file, use <code>raise SystemExit</code> or <code>sys.exit()</code>.</p>
<p>As the expansion of the acronym says, IDLE is a <em>development</em> environment.  It is a feature of IDLE that testing a program within IDLE does not kill IDLE itself, at least not without warning.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Those solutions aren't what the person is looking for. The intended solution is for the Python shell to close upon exit, but without a prompt as called by <code>exit()</code> or <code>quit()</code>.</span>
