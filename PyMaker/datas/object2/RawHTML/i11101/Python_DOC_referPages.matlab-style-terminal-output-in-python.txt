<p>I wasn't able to find this question in a few searches. Consider the following MATLAB struct:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; s = struct('field_a', 1:10, 'field_b', 1:1000);
&gt;&gt; disp(s)
s =
    field_a: [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10]
    field_b: [1x1000 double]
</code></pre>
<p>In a python dictionary (ignore the +1 differences), it might be:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; d = {'field_a': np.arange(10), 'field_b': np.arange(1000)}
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(d)
    &lt;&lt;floods terminal with output&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Is it possible to get python to print out something like:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print(d)
{'field_b': array([1, 2, ..., 998, 999]), 'field_a': array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])}
</code></pre>
<p>I wouldn't necessarily want this to be limited to numpy data types but any multi-item element that can get unwieldy. And obviously, I would like to be able to inspect all values if needed, at any time.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Yes, it is possible. All you need to do is to subclass the <code>dict</code> class and provide your custom implementation of the <code>__str__()</code> method.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Not sure whether you should want to overload <code>print</code>, but I suppose one could create <code>myprint</code> and easily catch some situations where you want to deviate from how print behaves (and otherwise just call print).</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pprint.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>pprint</code></a> might be able to do something similar, and of course using a MATLAB-like environment such as <code>ipython</code> might be more to your taste than the simple python interactive shell.</span>
