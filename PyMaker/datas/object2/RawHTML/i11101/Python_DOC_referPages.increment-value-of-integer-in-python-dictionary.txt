<p>So I write an app that counts amount of yellow cards in football matches through all the games of the tournament.
So let's say I count all Brazil's goals and I need to increment the amount of yellow cards with each game I go through in a loop.
So I have this dictionary cards_per_team_dictionary that looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>['Brazil', 0]
</code></pre>
<p>and I wan't to increment the int value with each game. 
I tried the following but it doesn't seem to work:</p>
<pre><code>def add_yellow_cards_per_team(team_name, cards_num):
    cards_per_team_dictionary[team_name] += cards_num
</code></pre>
<p>I get an error:</p>
<pre><code>cards_per_team_dictionary[team_name] += cards_num TypeError: 'set' object is not subscriptable 
</code></pre>
<p>And also this:</p>
<pre><code>def add_yellow_cards_per_team(team_name, cards_num):
    cards_per_team_dictionary[team_name] + cards_num
</code></pre>
<p>But it seems to overrun the previous integer instead of adding up to it.
Thanks in advance!</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You have created a <em>set</em> not a <em>dict</em>:</p>
<pre><code>In [4]: d = {"Brazil",0}

In [5]: d["Brazil"] += 3
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

----&gt; 1 d["Brazil"] += 3

TypeError: 'set' object is not subscriptable
</code></pre>
<p>To create a dict, you add key/value pairs separated by a colon i.e  <code>key:value</code>:</p>
<pre><code>In [6]: d = {"Brazil":0}

In [7]: d["Brazil"] += 3

In [8]: d
Out[8]: {'Brazil': 3}
</code></pre>
<p>Both a dict and set literals use <code>{}</code>, one difference being <code>d = {}</code> creates an empty dict where <code>st = set()</code> is needed to create an empty set. </p>
<p>If you want to add a key value pairing:</p>
<pre><code> d[key] = value
</code></pre>
<p>But for repeating keys you can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#dict.setdefault" rel="nofollow">dict.setdefault</a>:</p>
<pre><code>data = [("Brazil", 4),("Argentina",6)]
d = {}
for team, count in data:
    d.setdefault(team, 0)
    d[team] += count
</code></pre>
<p>A more efficient option is to use a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.defaultdict" rel="nofollow">defauldict</a>:</p>
<pre><code>from collections import defaultdict
d = defaultdict(int)
for team, count in data:
    d[team] += count
</code></pre>
<p>In both cases if the key does not exist it is added with the new value, if it does exist the value for the key is increased.</p>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>cards_per_team_dictionary[team_name] += cards_num</code> should definitely work if your dict is like <code>{"Brazil" 0}</code>. Add a runnable example that reproduces your issue</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I am getting:     cards_per_team_dictionary[team_name] += cards_num TypeError: 'set' object is not subscriptable</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ok, then you have created a set somewhere , add exactly what the dict looks like.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I initiated a dictionary in the beginning of the code:  cards_per_team_dictionary = {'Brazil', 0}</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is confusing.. your comment says {'Brazil', 0} but in your revised question you say ['Brazil', 0] which is neither a set or a dictionary -- its a list.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, Padraic, how do I initialise the dictionary properly though so it knows that it's a key:value dict?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@PavelZagalsky: Did you actually read the answer?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The issue is I need to add various teams to this dictionary through each iteration as the key and increase value per team if needed</span>
<span class="comment-copy">d[key] = value but I think a collections.defaultdict is what you really want. I will edit in a few minutes</span>
