<p>I´ve a "binary" file with variable size record. Each record is composed of an amount of little endians 2 byte-sized integer numbers. I know the start position of each record and it´s size.</p>
<p>What´s the fastest way to read this to a Python array of integer?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I don't think you can do better than opening the file and reading the size of each recorde then use <code>struct.unpack('&lt;i', buff)</code> for each integer you want to read, <code>file.read(2)</code>, will get you 2 integers.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">please, don't shorten the verb 'have' in simple tenses</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@AndrewLavq Wow!, is that an SO recommendation.  The OP might not be speaking American English, and other cultures use that idiom</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@AndrewLavq: <a href="http://english.stackexchange.com/q/8">This has been covered</a>; by British usage, "I've a something" is legit.</span>
