<p>As the title says,I want to know if the python which comes pre installed on mac is cpython. I mean logic says it probably is,but I couldn't find it being written anywhere officially so wanted to confirm.<br/><br/>
 I want to download a few things and for compatibility they require the installed python to be cpython/iron python.</p>

<p>With command <code>Python --version</code> you get the information like that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[GCC 4.0.1 (Apple Computer, Inc. build 5367)] on darwin</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is almost affirmative that it is <code>cpython</code> with <code>gcc</code> as compiler.</p>
<p>An alternative(which is more <strong>official</strong>) is to check with python code:</p>
<pre><code>import platform
platform.python_implementation()
</code></pre>
<p>The function <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/platform.html#platform.python_implementation" rel="nofollow">python_implementation</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Returns a string identifying the Python implementation. Possible
  return values are: ‘CPython’, ‘IronPython’, ‘Jython’, ‘PyPy’</p>
