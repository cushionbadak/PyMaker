<p>Your function <code>woodtype</code> appears to be poorly indented, and has no return statement, so it returns <code>None</code>.</p>
<p>by adding a return you should be able to solve the issues, e.g.</p>
<pre><code>def woodtype(wood):
    MAH=float(75.00)
    OAK=float(100)
    coffetab=float(0)

    if wood=="mahogany":

        coffetab=OAK

    return coffeetab

<span class="comment-copy">Your function <code>woodtype(wood)</code> doesn't return anything, so the variable is assigned <code>None</code>.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">StackOverflow is a Q&amp;A site, not a help forum. The distinction is critical: We care about quality in our questions as much as in our answers, because the questions are content too. Please try to follow the rules at <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve">stackoverflow.com/help/mcve</a>; to minimize the content of code sections to focus on a single, specific error with everything unneeded to create that error removed; and to reflect the nature of that error in your question's title (which is how other people with the same problem are expected to find that question and its answers).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You have defined <code>woodtype</code> as a function.  It will not compare equal to any string.  So comparing it to <code>"mahogany"</code> or <code>"oak"</code> is pointless.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Still does nothing. <code>wood</code> would be valid instead of <code>woodtype</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">def wood:( )     MAH=float(75.00)     OAK=float(100)     coffetab=float(0)      if wood=="mahogany":         coffetab=MAH     elif wood=="oak":         coffetab=OAK      return coffeetab</span>

<span class="comment-copy">the updated version in my answer will work, in the original the if statement was checking a non-existent variable</span>
