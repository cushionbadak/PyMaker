<p>How do i save the inputs of program into a file from the program. 
Python only:
i need to add it to this: </p>
<h1>TASK 2 AGAIN</h1>
<pre><code>sentence = input("Please input a sentence: ")
print(sentence)
word=input("Please enter word and position wil be shown: ")
if word in sentence:
    print("Found word")
else:
    print ("Word not found")
</code></pre>
<p>But i haven't got a clue</p>

<p>Your question seems to have two main parts to it: how do I get inputs in Python and how do I save data to a file in Python.</p>
<p>To get input from the terminal:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; data = input('Input: ')
&gt;&gt;&gt; Input: hello, world!
</code></pre>
<p>To save to a file:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; with open('output.txt', 'w') as f:
&gt;&gt;&gt;    f.write(data)
</code></pre>
<p>You can find more information about inputs <a href="http://anh.cs.luc.edu/python/hands-on/3.1/handsonHtml/io.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> and file i/o <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#reading-and-writing-files" rel="nofollow">here</a></p>
<p>Edit 0: @Gazzer, if you want to save <code>sentence + input</code> you'll need to do <code>f.write(sentence + input)</code> rather than using <code>.save()</code>.</p>
<p>Edit 1: @Gazzer, I got something like the below to work (<em>note: the code does not show position of the found word</em>):</p>
<pre><code>sentence = input("Please input a sentence: ")
word = input("Please enter word and position wil be shown: ")
with open('output.txt', 'w') as f:
    f.write('{} {}'.format(sentence, word))
</code></pre>
<p>If you run into more issues, there are hundreds of resources all over the web to ask for help.  Stack Overflow, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming" rel="nofollow">learnprogramming</a>, and many more.</p>
<p>Next time you ask a question, it is really helpful for those answering if you provide a code snippet you are working on and what the problem/errors are.</p>

<p>I assume this is what you're asking for</p>
<pre><code>text_file = open("Output.txt", "w")

text_file.write(stuff)

text_file.close()
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">I did try that.. I got an error message saying that write wasn't not defined</span>
<span class="comment-copy">But thank you very much for your help</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes that is what i was looking for thank you!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">sentence = input("Please input a sentence: ") print(sentence) word=input("Please enter word and position wil be shown: ") if word in sentence:     print("Found word") else:     print ("Word not found") text_file = open("Output.txt","w") text_file.save(sentence + input) text_file.close() It doesn't work in this code</span>
<span class="comment-copy">1) The code you just commented doesn't include "text_file.write" try that... 2) You've posted a question that has already been answered: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5214578/python-print-string-to-text-file" title="python print string to text file">stackoverflow.com/questions/5214578/â€¦</a> and you are just asking for answers not for help</span>
