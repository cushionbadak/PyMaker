<p>I am trying to create a python script that well periodically connect to haproxy socket, send a "show info" command and exit. This script will be used along with keepalived in order to determine, through this script, when to switch master/slave servers. Therefore, my goal is that my python script been non-blocking.  </p>
<p>Within my script, i have initiated a SysLogHandler to send to my local syslogd various messages (exceptions e.t.c). However, i don't know if SysLogHandler is Blocking or not.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html" rel="nofollow">python documentation</a> on logging is the main point where you should start.</p>
<p><code>SysLogHandler</code> is a subclass of <code>Handler</code>(There are many more. See the docs).</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logging.Handler.handle" rel="nofollow">This</a> is the relevant part that you are looking for I think.</p>
<p>I went a bit further and checked the actual implementation of Handler.
You can see that <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/b9fc317468d6a57eba41a88eb07b231232c2441c/Lib/logging/__init__.py#L796" rel="nofollow">it uses</a> <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/threading.html#threading.RLock" rel="nofollow">threading.RLock()</a>.</p>
