<p>I have a code that runs in Python 2.7 but not in 3.5 and I can't find the reason. It has to do with importing.</p>
<p>The root folder has a subfolder called <code>s</code>. From the root folder, I am running the script <code>a.py</code> which includes the line <code>from s import *</code>.</p>
<p>In the folder <code>s</code>, there is a file called <code>b.py</code> which has the import line: <code>from c import c</code>
which tries to import the class saved in <code>c.py</code> which is located in the subfolder <code>s</code> as well.</p>
<p>When I run the script <code>a.py</code> from the root folder, I get the <code>ImportError</code> saying "No module named <code>c</code>".</p>
<p>In Python 2.7 this runs without problems. Can someone please suggest what may be the issue and how this should be done differently in Python 3.5?</p>

<p>Implicit imports within packages are not available for Python 3, so to get this to work you will need to use an explicit relative import:</p>
<pre><code>from .s import *
</code></pre>
<p>This should work for both Python 2 and Python 3.  This also makes your intention more clear that you want to import from a relative package, not an installed package.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Interesting. The configuration you described throws an ImportError in python2, and neither throws nor loads the module c in python3 for me.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Did you see <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12172791/changes-in-import-statement-python3" title="changes in import statement python3">stackoverflow.com/questions/12172791/…</a>?  It looks related (i.e., "In Python 3, implicit relative imports within packages are no longer available").</span>

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks so much, so simple :). I needed exactly that - the relative import stuff in p[ython 3 is a bit different. Thank you</span>
