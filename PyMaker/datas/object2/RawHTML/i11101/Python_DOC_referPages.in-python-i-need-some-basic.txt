### This is the Raw data input portion and the ablity to stop the program and exit
    name = input("Enter a name or type done:")
    if name == 'done' : break
    Age = input("How old are they?")
    Gender = input("What is their gender M/F?")
### This is where I use .append to create the entry of the list     
    people.append(name)
    people.append(Age)
    ages.append(Age)
    people.append(Gender)
print("list of People:", people)

print(ages)

<p>The problem is, that <code>input</code> always returns a string. Just use <code>int</code> to turn it into an integer:
</p>
<pre><code>Age = int(input("How old are they?"))
</code></pre>
<p>But be aware that this will throw a <code>ValueError</code>, if you don't enter a number. You can handle the error using a try/except, if you want to. You could cancel the input for the current person and print an error message and then start with a new person:</p>
<pre><code>try:
    Age = int(input("How old are they?"))
except ValueError:
    print("Invalid input.")
    continue
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks that worked</span>
<span class="comment-copy">would you know any code to count number of M and F that get inputed</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>Gender.count('M')</code>.  Seriously though.. You'll find everything you need in the python <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs</a>.</span>
