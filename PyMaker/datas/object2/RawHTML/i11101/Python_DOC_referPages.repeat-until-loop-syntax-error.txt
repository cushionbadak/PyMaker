<p>I'm still getting a handle on python and have been trying to implement a REPEAT UNTIL loop using online tutorials. Everything seems to be in order but I keep getting a syntax error but I absolutely cannot find an error with my syntax! Can someone help me? My code is;</p>
<pre><code>while detvar != "SABRE":
            REPEAT 
            detvar=input("Please Pass a Valid Detector or Parameter Set");
           UNTIL detvar = "SABRE"
</code></pre>
<p>detvar is my string variable the error is for the 'detvar' on the last line. </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This is all you need:</p>
<pre><code>detvar = "" # allow for at least one iteration
while detvar != "SABRE":
    detvar=input("Please Pass a Valid Detector or Parameter Set")
</code></pre>
<p><code>REPEAT</code> and <code>UNTIL</code> are not valid expressions in Python. Instead, you want to use <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-while-statement" rel="nofollow"><code>while condition != value</code></a>, which is what you originally had.</p>
<p>The <code>while</code> statement allows you to continue iterating as long as a condition holds true. Alternatively, you can repeat until something is true by negating the condition.</p>
<p>So, <code>while detvar != "SABRE":</code> iterates the body of the loop (which is everything indented under the colon) until <code>detvar</code> is equal to <code>"SABRE"</code>.</p>
<p><hr/>
Edit: In accordance with Bryan Oakley's comment, <code>detvar</code> is initialized as a value that is not <code>"SABRE"</code> so that the loop body executes at least once.</p>

<p>This is a horribly worded question, and I have no idea what this code is meant to accomplish, but I'll see if I can decipher this. There's no need to use "REPEAT," just do</p>
<pre><code>while devtar != "SABRE":
    devtar = input("Please Pass.(whatever this is).. Set")
</code></pre>
<p>It should exit the loop when devtar = "SABRE" automatically. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">Please provide a link to the tutorials that say <code>REPEAT</code> is a valid Python keyword.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No way, dude! This is Pascal-like syntax, not Python! Please stop trying to write code and read the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs</a> first!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Please also include the error message.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It doesn't work because python doesn't support that syntax.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The error message was just "invalid syntax". But if repeat/until isn't relevant for Python than that makes complete sense.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">this isn't exactly the same. The repeat guarantees at least one iteration, whereas your solution does not (unless detvar is explicitly set to something other than <code>"SABRE"</code>)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Using your answer, I have gotten it to work. Thank you!</span>
