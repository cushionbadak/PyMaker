<p>How is Python itself tested?  Not, "How do I write unit tests in Python?" but "Where is the compliance suite against which CPython, Pypy, and so on run tests to assert they're Python version-X.Y conformant?"</p>
<p>The python website mentions pythontest.net, but that appears to be just a target for test facilities, not part of or a resource for the compliance suite itself.</p>

<p>The CPython source code includes a <a href="https://hg.python.org/cpython/file/2.7/Lib/test" rel="nofollow">test suite</a> that is considered to be the compliance suite. This suite is used to test other Python implementations, see for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/pypy/pypy/src/a0105e0d00dbd0f73d06fc704db704868a6c6ed2/lib-python/2.7/test/?at=default" rel="nofollow">PyPy copy of the suite</a>.</li>
<li>the <a href="https://hg.python.org/jython/file/tip/lib-python/2.7/test" rel="nofollow">Jython copy</a></li>
<li>the <a href="https://github.com/IronLanguages/main/tree/ipy-2.7-maint/Languages/IronPython/Tests" rel="nofollow">IronPython test suite</a>, which is a subset tuned to what IronPython supports (only a subset of the CPython standard library is included in IronPython)</li>
</ul>

<span class="comment-copy">The CPython test suite is often installed right along with the standard library (though different distributions may leave it out or package it separately). Try <code>python -m test</code> to run it if it's available on your system!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Which by the way is documented in the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/test.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation of the standard library</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Blckknght: I linked to the Python 2.7 version, because that's what the 3 big re-implementations support right now. In Python 2.7, you run the suite with <code>python -m test.regrtest</code> instead.</span>
