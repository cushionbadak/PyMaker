<p>My goal is simple</p>
<p>I have a list, in e.g:</p>
<pre><code>a = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
</code></pre>
<p>And I want split that randomly and evenly into two different lists, in e.g:</p>
<pre><code>b = ['c', 'a']
c = ['d', 'b']
</code></pre>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use <code>random.suffle</code> to reorder the list and list slicing to capture the needed segments after the shuffle:</p>
<pre><code>import random
a = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
random.shuffle(a)
b = a[:2]
c = a[2:]
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>['b', 'd']
['c', 'a']
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You could try something like this</p>
<pre><code>a = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd',...]
import random
random.shuffle(a) # shuffles the list randomly, as the names imply. 
</code></pre>
<p>Thanks goes to @Ajax1234 for this part, then</p>
<pre><code>a1 = a[0::2] # you'll get the even-index elements 0,2,4, ...
a2 = a[1::2] # the odd-index elements 1,3,5,...
</code></pre>
<p>If the length of the list is not an even number, one of the lists will be longer.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can try random.sample with argument 2 :</p>
<pre><code>import random
a = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']

final=[]
for i in range(0,2):
    var=random.sample(a,2)
    if  var not in final:
        final.append(var)

print(final)

<span class="comment-copy">Welcome to SO. Unfortunately this isn't a discussion forum or tutorial service. Please take the time to read <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/how-to-ask">How to Ask</a> and the other links on that page.  You should invest some time working your way through <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the Tutorial</a>, practicing the examples. It will give you an introduction to the tools Python has to offer and you may even start to get ideas for solving your problem.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It is your question that is off topic...</span>

<span class="comment-copy">@NOBODY, FYI, you are being borderline abusive to the people who have responded to you.  People comment to help you, and to do that we need to understand WHAT you have done and WHY you are doing it.  The "why" is important because you may be going down the wrong path (like learning on Python 2.6 instead of 2.7 or 3.x), though you may have a valid reason for doing what you are doing.  Just a heads up that abusing people can get you banned from SO.  Cheer up and be grateful that people are willing to invest their time to help you at all.</span>
