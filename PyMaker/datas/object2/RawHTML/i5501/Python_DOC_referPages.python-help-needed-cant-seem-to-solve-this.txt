<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I'm suppose to write a code to give me the output of a value between <code>0</code> and <code>86400</code> and the current time in the 24 hour clock. However I am getting stuck when it comes to writing the formulas for the 24 hour clock and the print function. Here's the code I have written so far.</p>
<pre><code>total_time = float('70000')
hours = int(total_time / 3600.0)
minutes = int((total_time - (hours * 3600.0)) / 60.0)
seconds = int(((total_time) - (hours * 3600) - (minutes * 60)))
print("Enter a value between 0 and 86400", total_time) print("The current time is",hours.minutes.seconds)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Firstly, get the current hour, minute and seconds:</p>
<pre><code>import datetime

now = datetime.datetime.now()

# The current time:
hour = now.hour
minute = now.minute
second = now.second
</code></pre>
<p>Then simply output it:</p>
<pre><code>print("Current time: {}:{}:{}".format(hour,minute,second))
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>It seems to me you are asking the user to enter a number between 0 and 86400 and then you want to translate that to <code>hh:mm:ss</code> format. But your code is not getting any input from the user, and the last line of the code has syntax errors.</p>
<p>To get you started, you need to fix your <code>print()</code> calls at the end. Put one statement to a line, and use commas not fullstops:</p>
<pre><code>print("Enter a value between 0 and 86400", total_time) 
print("The current time is",hours,minutes,seconds)
</code></pre>
<p>That will give you the output:</p>
<pre><code>Enter a value between 0 and 86400 70000.0
The current time is 19 26 40
</code></pre>
<p>Which is correct, in the sense that an offset of 70,000 seconds from 0h00 today is 19h26m40s. </p>
<p>If you want to get actual user input, then you need to ask for it, at the top of your program, <em>before</em> you do the calculations, in an <code>input()</code> call:</p>
<pre><code>total_time=float(input("Enter a value between 0 and 86400: "))
</code></pre>
<p>If you want pretty formatting of the answer then do</p>
<pre><code>print(f"The current time is {hours:02d}:{minutes:02d}:{seconds:02d}")
</code></pre>
<p>None of this relates to finding the current time, which Suraj Kothari's answer addresses.</p>
