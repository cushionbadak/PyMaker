<p>I have a data analysis tool that I wrote in Python. I want to be able to schedule this tool to be run as new data comes in, which I can do in Visual Basic.Net.  What I want to do is have a VB process spawn the python process and then send the data it receives from the python off to be reported, but I haven't been able to find much online for this kind of scenario.  What tools should I be using here to make this happen?</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong>
What I ended up doing was using .Nets's System.Diagnostic.Process class to start the Python process, and then simply read off of the standard output stream.  <a href="https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/silverlight/en-US/078fac06-853b-4e2b-9659-8a8f5cb2d26c/readwrite-data-to-stdinout-using-vb?forum=vbgeneral" rel="nofollow noreferrer">This site</a> explained how to do this on the VB side.</p>

<p>You could go for a file based approch: </p>
<ul>
<li><p>vb tells python about the file to create as well as the data and waits till processing is done, reads the file in again</p></li>
<li><p>You could use a shared database</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Or interprocess communication:</p>
<ul>
<li>you could use "the ususal" interprocess communication stuff: named pipes (<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39089776/python-read-named-pipe">Python read named PIPE</a>), client/server (<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27893804/udp-client-server-socket-in-python">UDP Client/Server Socket in Python</a>) , sockets (<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7749341/very-basic-python-client-socket-example">(Very) basic Python client socket example</a>), ...</li>
</ul>
<p>A good starting point would be the python documentation on <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipc.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">interprocess communication</a></p>

<span class="comment-copy">Why don't you use the <code>subprocess</code> module?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@juanpa.arrivillaga It is already tagged with subprocess and he spawns a python from VB. can you return more information that a returncode to the process that spawned the python processing by it (never used it so far)? Or do you mean spawning the VB from python when done processing?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I meant use the Python <code>subprocess</code> module to do the spawning, which provides IPC out of the box.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">As far as I can tell, the subprocess module does the opposite of what I want.  I don't need to spawn another process from the Python code.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@scottmermelstein thx for the edit :) was not quite finished adding other SO-Threads in</span>
