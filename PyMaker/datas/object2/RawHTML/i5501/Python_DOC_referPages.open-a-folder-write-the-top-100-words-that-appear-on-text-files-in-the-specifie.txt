<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I want to code a class called <code>LexicalAnalyzer</code> and within this class I have to code the following functions based on a folder directory.
<code>gettop100words</code>: returns a <code>dictionary</code> of the frequency of the overall top 100 words found in the text files of the said folder, not caring for CAPS.</p>
<p><code>get_letter_frequencies</code>: returns a <code>dictionary</code> of frequency of the letters (a-z)</p>
<p>How do I write this <code>LexicalAnalyzer</code> ?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Just do for loop inside of the file(text file ofc) and add every word and how many times it occurs and return the dictionary. To split words just add the whole text of the file in one string amd use split function to separate the words into list and loop through it and do the dictionary thing i told you at the begging.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<ol>
<li>Use in <code>fileinput</code> to iterate over files</li>
<li>Use in <code>collections.Counter</code> for counting objects(words, letters)</li>
</ol>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p><strong>Environment:</strong></p>
<pre><code>$ tree /tmp/test
/tmp/test
├── file1.txt
├── file2.txt
└── file3.txt

0 directories, 3 files
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Data:</strong></p>
<pre><code>$ tail -vn +1 /tmp/test/*.txt
==&gt; /tmp/test/file1.txt &lt;==
hello world
world foo bar egg
spam egg baz
end

==&gt; /tmp/test/file2.txt &lt;==
foo xxx yyy
qqq foo
eee ttt def
cmp

==&gt; /tmp/test/file3.txt &lt;==
Foo BAR
SpAm
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Snippet:</strong></p>
<pre><code>import os
import fileinput
import collections

DIR = '/tmp/test'

files = [os.path.join(DIR, filename) for filename in os.listdir(DIR)]
words = collections.Counter()
letters = collections.Counter()

with fileinput.input(files=files) as f:
    for line in f:
        words.update(line.lower().split())

for word in words:
    letters.update(word)

# top 3 word
print(words.most_common(3))

# top 5 letters
print(letters.most_common(5))
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>
<pre><code>[('foo', 4), ('egg', 2), ('spam', 2)]
[('e', 7), ('o', 4), ('y', 3), ('l', 3), ('q', 3)]
</code></pre>
