<p>I'm trying to get <code>pygrib</code> to work in Python 3.5.
I have imported it in my program, I have assigned the grib file to a variable (grib).</p>
<p>But when I try to run the command: </p>
<p><code>grbs=pygrib.open(grib)</code></p>
<p>I get the following error:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>File "", line 1, in 
      print(sys.getdefault_encoding())</p>
<p>AttributeError: module 'sys' has no attribute 'getdefault_encoding'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No google search led me to any understanding of the problem.</p>
<p>What does this error actually mean?</p>

<p>Problem resolved by re-installing! Thanks for your help.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I don't think the under-scroll should be there. See the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.getdefaultencoding" rel="nofollow noreferrer">doc</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks Tim, You mean there would be an error in their program? If this is the case, where do I access the program to remove the extra underscore?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Error seems to be in:    File "pygrib.pyx", line 391, in pygrib.open.__cinit__ (pygrib.c:2902)    File "pygrib.pyx", line 2070, in pygrib._strencode (pygrib.c:32191)  NameError: name 'default_encoding' is not defined  But where are these files?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Can you show us the actual program? I just installed &amp; used it without issues.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks Tim, that's ointeresting. Yes I'll post it in the morning. May be versions or dependencies...</span>
