</code></pre>
<p>I have used some for lop in python 3  but here i don't understand how these 3 for loops are working together are they seprate statements or anything else
Thanks in advance!!

<p>As ShadowRanger tagged, the magic phrase (to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">look up</a> in the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#atoms" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation</a>) is “list comprehension” (see also the similar <em>generator expression</em>).</p>

<span class="comment-copy">What exactly is it you don't understand? This is a list comprehension, you can write it as nested for loops if you want</span>

<span class="comment-copy">@PatrickHaugh as i understand from the python docs page the first two for loops can be written as this - <code>for y,b in zip(s,a): for z,c in zip(y,b):  list.append(abs(z-c))</code> but what about the third one <code>for a in pre</code>.... Can you please write the asked code in the simple for loops without list-comprehension Thanks –</span>
