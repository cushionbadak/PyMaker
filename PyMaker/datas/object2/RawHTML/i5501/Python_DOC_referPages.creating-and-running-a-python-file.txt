<p><strong>Solution 1</strong>:  [From within your interactive shell]</p>
<p>If you want to execute a python <em>within your interactive shell</em> (as you are now, judging from your &gt;&gt;&gt;) you can use the <code>%run</code> function. Assuming your file sample.py is in the same directore as where you are running the interactive shell. </p>
<p>Example:  </p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; %run ./sample.py
</code></pre>
<p>(This assumes your script is located in the same directory where your interactive terminal is running. If not, see <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/28462540/9216538">https://stackoverflow.com/a/28462540/9216538</a> on how to change the current directory).</p>
<p><strong>Solution 2</strong>:  [From the command line in your normal terminal]</p>
<p>The standard option is to do this directly <em>from the normal command line in your terminal</em>. Open a regular terminal. Go to the directory where your python file is located with <code>cd path-to-file</code>.   </p>
<p>Example:  [run this in your normal terminal]</p>
<pre><code>python sample.py
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">I assume you are trying to run a python file from the terminal. If that is the case, you should type the command at the command line: <code>$ python sample.py</code>. I think the problem is that you first dropped to the Python REPL and tried to execute the command.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What command could be used?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The run script or execute script command?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Honestly for you man I recommend you download an IDE like pycharm</span>
<span class="comment-copy">the run script command.</span>
