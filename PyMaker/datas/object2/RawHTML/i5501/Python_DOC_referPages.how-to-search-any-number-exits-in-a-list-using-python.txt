<p>Use regular expression.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Where is number in above list? Can you please share another example.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It can be anything. Which I am not aware.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">what if integer present,  edit question with whats your expected output</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You say "only number, actually dotted decimal number". That's not a number! That's a string with numbers and dots. Is your real question: "I want to find something that looks like an IP address."?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">One way to do it would be to create an <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipaddress.html#ip-addresses" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>IPv4Address</code></a>. If you don't get an <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipaddress.html#ipaddress.AddressValueError" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>AddressValueError</code></a> it's an IP address.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This will also match <code>999.999.999.999</code>, which cannot be an IP number.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks a lot. It worked.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The answer matches any combination, even if it is out of range @sivabalasenna ,  your IP address should in only <code>255.255.255.255</code> and should not cross <code>255</code>, How this answer achieve that</span>
<span class="comment-copy">OP is taking output of some system command and want to extract IP address from that output. That's why I didn't check the validity  of IP address. IP validation check would be more useful if you are parsing file output or doing some input validation.</span>
