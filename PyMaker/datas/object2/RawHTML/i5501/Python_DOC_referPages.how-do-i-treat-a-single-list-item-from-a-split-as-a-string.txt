<p>This is the first time I've written any Python. I have a string similar to the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Certificates (n): 389429732C9805 36124C3CF2C18 F2C187AA389429</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>n is how many certificates are included (just for humans to read, I don't parse it)</em></p>
<p>I want to split the string, first removing the label and then separating each certificate. So this is what I have working (note that this is one segment of a longer string I have already split):</p>
<pre><code>for subitem in item.split("): ")[1:]:
    for idx, cert in enumerate(subitem.split(" ")):
</code></pre>
<p>Although it works, it seems stupid to have the outer loop when I always have only one item but I also don't want to split at a fixed position as the <code>n</code> value can differ in length. I also noted that using <code>item.split("): ")[1:][0]</code> takes each letter individually when I try to do it as one line (which is not what I want).</p>
<p>The following attempt failed:</p>
<pre><code>for idx, cert in enumerate(item.split("): ")[1][0].split(" ")):
</code></pre>
<p>How can I use just the last element and drop the outer loop? Can I do it with the inner loop all in one line?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If example format is correct you can split by spaces one time</p>
<pre><code>for idx, cert in enumerate(item.split()[2:]):
   print(idx, cert)
</code></pre>
<p>result</p>
<pre><code>0 389429732C9805
1 36124C3CF2C18
2 F2C187AA389429

<p>How did exactly your attempt fail? I've copypasted the code from your post and it works:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; item = "Certificates(n): 389429732C9805 36124C3CF2C18 F2C187AA389429"
&gt;&gt;&gt; for idx, cert in enumerate(item.split("): ")[1:][0].split(" ")):
...    print 'Item no', idx, 'is', cert
...
Item no 0 is 389429732C9805
Item no 1 is 36124C3CF2C18
Item no 2 is F2C187AA389429
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You could also use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.partition" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>str.partition</code></a> to break up the string into <code>('Certificates(n', '): ', '389429732C9805 36124C3CF2C18 F2C187AA389429')</code>, then you could split the last string with <code>split()</code>:</p>
<pre><code>s = "Certificates(n): 389429732C9805 36124C3CF2C18 F2C187AA389429"

for idx, cert in enumerate(s.partition('): ')[-1].split()):
    print(idx, cert)
</code></pre>
<p>Which Outputs:</p>
<pre><code>0 389429732C9805
1 36124C3CF2C18
2 F2C187AA389429
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Ah OK, even simpler (I didn't see this approach). Thanks!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">glad to help. good luck!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Actually, I have a space before the '('  (my question had a typo) so I can't use your approach, but +1 anyway because this is a really useful shorthand</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@NickCardoso <code>for idx, cert in enumerate(item.split()[2:]):</code> :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I've updated the answer</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, I made a typo in what I pasted here (I was going back and forth) I had actually tried without the colon and it gave me "D" as the certificate value. (I've just now discovered this works by accident!)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">So you fixed a non-working code by making a typo when copypasting? : D</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes! (well, when trying to recreate my attempts anyway) thanks for pointing it out</span>
