<p>Kinda new to this, and writing a script that loads in latitudes and longitudes from a CSV file and converts the formatting for another program to read...finally got it all to work.</p>
<p>I was wondering how I might set this up so I could maybe run ./converter.py filename.csv from a command prompt rather then having the filename embedded in the script?</p>
<p>Currently I have this:</p>
<pre><code>csv_file = open('Vicksburg_9mph_dm.csv') #Defines name of file to open
csv_reader = csv.reader(csv_file, delimiter=',') #Opens file as CSV File
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Since you said you have a working program (albeit hardcoded for filenames), I'll provide a solution:</p>
<pre><code>import sys
import csv

with open(sys.argv[1], 'r', newline='') as f:
    r = csv.reader(f, delimiter=',')
    # do your work you already do
</code></pre>
<p>A couple notes:</p>
<p><code>sys</code> module contains access to pass CLI arguments</p>
<p><code>sys.argv</code> is a list of argument variables as discussed in the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.argv" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs</a>.</p>
<p><code>with open()</code> syntax is referred to as a <em>context manager</em>. In your provided code, you technically never called <code>close()</code> so the file remained open. When you exit the <code>with</code> block, the file with automatically close.</p>
<p><code>newline=''</code> flag is specific to Python 3, if you do not have that version simply omit it</p>
