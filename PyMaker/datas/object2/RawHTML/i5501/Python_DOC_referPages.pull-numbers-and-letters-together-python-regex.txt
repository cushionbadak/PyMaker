<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I am looking to delete any text from a string in python that matches something along the lines of "\nPage 10 of 12\n" where 10 and 12 are always different numbers (looping through 300+ documents that all have different page lengths). Example of some text that is in my string below (and then what i would want the output to be):</p>
<pre><code>thisisaboutthen\n\n\nPage 2 of 12\n\nnowwearegoing\n\nPage 3 of 12\n\n\n\

Output -&gt; thisisaboutthennnowwearegoing
</code></pre>
<p>I am trying the code:</p>
<pre><code>page = r'\nPage \b\d+\b of \b\d+\b\n+'
return re.sub(page, '', string)
</code></pre>
<p>But I can't get it to work. I tried to refer to this link <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4289331/python-extract-numbers-from-a-string">Python: Extract numbers from a string</a> for help but I can't seem to combine numbers and letters together.</p>
<p>I'm new to regex in python and any help would be great. I have been able to get regex to work when it is just letters or just numbers, but running into problems when combining them.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>

<p>One way might be</p>
<pre><code>import re

string = """thisisaboutthen


Page 2 of 12

nowwearegoing

Page 3 of 12



"""

string = re.sub(r'\s*Page \d+ of \d+\s*', '', string)
print(string)
</code></pre>
<p>Which yields</p>
<pre><code>thisisaboutthennowwearegoing
</code></pre>

<p>I'm not sure about the context, but instead of specifying line breaks (<code>\n</code>) and spaces you can use <code>\s</code>. With <code>+</code> you say <em>regex</em> one or more.</p>
<pre><code>import re
string = 'thisisaboutthen\n\n\nPage 2 of 12\n\nnowwearegoing\n\nPage 3 of 12\n\n\n'
pattern = r'\s+Page\s+\d+\s+of\s+\d+\s+'
print(re.sub(pattern, '', string))
</code></pre>
<p>With <code>\d</code> you choose numbers, With <code>\s</code> you choose space characters (space and \t, \n, \r, \f, \v). It may be useful to use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.IGNORECASE" rel="nofollow noreferrer">re.IGNORECASE</a>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">All you need is a <code>+</code> before <code>Page</code>: <code>\n+Page \b\d+\b of \b\d+\b\n+</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Your pattern looks good. However the word-boundaries are useless, you can remove them. Show more code. Also, are you sure that newline sequences are only <code>\n</code> and not <code>\r\n</code> or <code>\r</code> or something more exotic? How many newlines do you want to keep?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Are you sure that <code>string</code> contains the whole text and not only a single line? (because obviously a single line can't contain two or more newline sequences as your pattern describes it). In this case, I repeat my previous advice: Show more code.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you Jan this worked perfectly. Also thanks for the helpful link - much easier than testing in python</span>
<span class="comment-copy">for some reason this still didn't work, but Jans above did with the * instead of +. Thanks for explaining the use of \s though that will be helpful</span>
