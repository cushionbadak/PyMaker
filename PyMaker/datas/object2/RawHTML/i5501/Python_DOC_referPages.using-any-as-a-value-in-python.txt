<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I'm writing a function like this (in the context of AWS/SNS):</p>
<pre><code>def validate(message, topic=None):
    if topic == any or topic == message.topic:
        accept()
    else:
        reject()
    ...
</code></pre>
<p>The value <code>any</code> in the condition is actually the built-in function <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#any" rel="nofollow noreferrer">any</a>. But here I'm not using it for its designed purpose, but as a constant, to indicate that any topic would be accepted without colliding with any possible existing topic value (which are strings).</p>
<p>I have the feeling this is not a good idea, but I can't find a good reason why it isn't. Also, I've tried googling this, but "any" is too common a word and I haven't had luck finding a discussion about this.</p>
<p>Is this right, wrong, pythonic?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Not sure what you want, but using <code>any</code> as value is wrong unless it's correct to call <code>validate</code> with <code>any</code> as second parameter:</p>
<pre><code>validate(msg, any)
</code></pre>
<p>To check if <code>topic</code> is not <code>None</code> use <code>topic is not None</code>.</p>
<pre><code>def validate(message, topic=None):
    if topic is not None or topic == message.topic:
        accept()
    else:
        reject()
    ...
</code></pre>
<p>It's possible that you want <code>and</code> instead <code>or</code>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I think passing a string is more safe.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That being said, if you want to proceed, then you should use <code>is</code>. But a problem is, that people might get the idea that they can pass any function (not <i>the</i> any function :). Or what if someone passes a partial function?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What about simply <code>if topic or ...</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">But <code>topic == any</code> will always return False. Or are you shadowing <code>any</code> name?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Caleth <code>if topic is not None or ...</code> surely?</span>
