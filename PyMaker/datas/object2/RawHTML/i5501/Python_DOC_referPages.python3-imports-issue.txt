<p>So... I am attempting to teach myself Python.</p>
<p>In such, I am attempting to build something that I appear to have no clue about...</p>
<p>I have a "workingdir" structure such as:</p>
<pre><code>/
-- classes/
-- -- install
-- myfile
</code></pre>
<p>In <code>myfile</code> I am simply attempting to "import" the file <code>install</code> by using:
<code>import classes.install</code></p>
<p>Which fails with: <code>ImportError: No module named 'classes.install'</code></p>
<p>I have attempted the following as well, and all end the same way, with the same error:</p>
<p><code>import .classes.install</code></p>
<pre><code>sys.path.append(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '..'))
import classes.install
</code></pre>
<p>As well as putting an empty <code>__init__.py</code> file inside the classes directory</p>
<p>the file <code>install</code> simply contains:</p>
<pre><code>class gyo_install():

    inst = False

    # check if we have everything we need installed.
    def __init__():
        print("Hello World")
</code></pre>
<p>What am I doing wrong?  I've searched and searched and searched, everything I see points to the same solutions I've attempted, and none of them work.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Python looks for files with a .py extension when importing modules. So a file named myfile will not be recognized simply by the command <code>import myfile</code>. The pythonic way to ensure that the interpreter will find the module is to ensure it has a .py extension. Renaming myfile to myfile.py and install to install.py and then changing the import command to</p>
<pre><code>import classes.install
</code></pre>
<p>should solve the problem.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Create <code>__init__.py</code> inside install directory. </p>
<p>Explanation: You can import from a file that is in your current directory or from a package. A package is a directory with <code>__init__.py</code> inside. In fact, a package can contain only this single file.</p>
<p>You can read <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the documentation</a> for further information.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Suggest renaming myfile to myfile.py and install to install.py. Then try <code>import classes.install</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks Ron.  That did do the trick, but I wonder why?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Because python is not automatically recognizing python syntax but needs the scripts to be suffixed with <code>.py</code> when scanning for the imports.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@RonNorris can you answer the question, instead of comment, so I can accept it?  Please throw in a why as well, for future searchers ;)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">can you edit this and add a why it is necessary?</span>
