<p>I want to rename multiple files in a directory, if they start with "#", for example:</p>
<p>#222_message_split -&gt;               222_message_split</p>
<p>#013_message_split2 -&gt;                 013_message_split2     </p>
<p><strong>edit: I tried this:</strong></p>
<pre><code>for filename in os.listdir(PATH):
    if filename.startswith("#"):
        os.rename(filename, filename[1:])
</code></pre>
<p><strong>edit2: with the help of pstatix I got the code to work, now checking subdirectories for "#_____" files as well.</strong></p>
<pre><code>for root, dirs, files in os.walk(PATH):
for dir in dirs:
    if dir.startswith("#"):
        org_fp = os.path.join(root, dir)
        new_fp = os.path.join(root, dir[1:])
        os.rename(org_fp, new_fp)
</code></pre>

<p>You were close, although your indentation was off:</p>
<p><strong>Original Question:</strong></p>
<pre><code>for filename in os.listdir(PATH):
    if filename.startswith("#"):
        org_fp = os.path.join(PATH, filename)
        new_fp = os.path.join(PATH, filename[1:])
        os.rename(org_fp, new_fp)
</code></pre>
<p><code>os.listdir()</code> doesn't return the full path even if <code>PATH</code> was a full path; only basenames are listed. So you must provide a full path for <code>os.rename()</code> to function correctly; done using <code>os.path.join()</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Requested Update:</strong></p>
<pre><code>for root, dirs, files in os.walk(PATH):
    for file in files:
        if file.startswith("#"):
            org_fp = os.path.join(root, file)
            new_fp = os.path.join(root, file[1:])
            os.rename(org_fp, new_fp)

<span class="comment-copy">Okay. Well, what have you tried?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">add your code to the qusetion</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I edited my question and added the code :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">that works perfect thank you a lot pstatix! unfortunately I have to bother you even more, because I would like my code to traverse every subfolder as well, what do I have to add to my code to achieve this?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@DanielSeidl Please see my updated solution</span>
<span class="comment-copy">again, thanks a lot, I will try this updated code and check the docs ect., glad that you helped me!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@DanielSeidl You selected as the answer to your question; did you verify it worked?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">did that before reading the update, since it is the answer to the initial question I asked. Until now I can't get it to work, but I am still trying to get into the docs and the post you linked, since I am coding for about a month now only. Will try to understand what you did, and what "walk()" really does :) basically I have a directory containing folders, which are containing subfolders and so on, in some there are files/folders starting with the # -&gt; the thing I want removed.</span>
