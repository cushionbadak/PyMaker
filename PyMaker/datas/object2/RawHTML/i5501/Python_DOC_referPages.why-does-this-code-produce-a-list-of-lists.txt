<p>I have a function:</p>
<pre><code>def csvToList( filename ):
    with open(filename, 'r') as fp:
        reader = csv.reader(fp)
        myList = list(reader)
    return myList
</code></pre>
<p>and call it with:</p>
<pre><code>fruitList = csvToList('fruit.csv')
</code></pre>
<p>The contents of fruit.csv is:</p>
<pre><code>apple,orange,kiwi,tomato
</code></pre>
<p>The value of fruitList is a list of lists:</p>
<pre><code>[['apple', 'orange', 'kiwi', 'tomato']]
</code></pre>
<p>Why does this code produce a list of lists and not just a simple "flat" list, like this:</p>
<pre><code>['apple', 'orange', 'kiwi', 'tomato']
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The reader produces <em>rows</em> from a CSV file. See the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.reader" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Each row read from the csv file is returned as a list of strings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It doesn't matter here that your file only consists of 1 row; <code>list(reader)</code> produces a list of <em>all</em> the rows, be that 0, 1 or 20 million. So a file with just 1 row gives you a list containing that single row as a list.</p>
<p>If you only ever expect one row, iterate one step with the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#next" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>next()</code> function</a>:</p>
<pre><code>def csvToList( filename ):
    with open(filename, 'r') as fp:
        reader = csv.reader(fp)
        return next(reader, [])
</code></pre>
<p><code>next(reader, [])</code> tells the function to return an empty list if <code>reader</code> doesn't produce anything at all.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Because each row in a file is a list, and you can have 0 or more rows?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Because there can be multiple rows.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">If you only expect one row, what's the difference between returning <code>next()</code> or <code>reader[0]</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Idlehands: <code>reader</code> is not a sequence, you can't us indexing. It is an <i>iterable</i>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Derp, just because it was an iterable I assumed it automatically supported indexing.  Thanks for clearing that up.  Should get more familiar with <code>csv</code> module.</span>
