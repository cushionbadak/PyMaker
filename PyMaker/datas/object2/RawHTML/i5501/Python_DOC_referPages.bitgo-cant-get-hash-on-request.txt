<p>What is the key to call from BitGo API to get from a webhook immediately an address receive BTC.</p>
<p>From my ngrok, I saw this</p>
<pre><code>{
    "hash": "26ba9cc3218962417f529803d82dd63850b895fbee74517dff",
    "type": "transaction",
    "coin": "bitcoin",
    "walletId": "2Mzb4KMAp"
}
</code></pre>
<p>So when I did the following in the 'hook callback url', I'm getting error. 500 Error.</p>
<pre><code>1. txId  =  request.POST.get('hash')
2. txId = request.GET['hash']
3. txId = request.POST['hash']
</code></pre>
<p>How do I get the hash since all the above method failed. I'm using Python/Django.</p>

<p>The BitGo API will uses POST to send JSON data to your endpoints: <a href="https://bitgo.github.io/bitgo-docs/#webhook-notifications" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://bitgo.github.io/bitgo-docs/#webhook-notifications</a></p>
<p>You'll likely need to convert the body of their POST request from JSON into a Python dict you can access more easily. You can do this with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html#json.loads" rel="nofollow noreferrer">json.loads</a>:</p>
<pre><code>bitgo_data = json.loads(request.body)
hash = bitgo_data['hash']
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Can you provide any extra details about the error you're seeing? "500 Error" could be a LOT of things in your code.    It looks like BitGo POSTs to you with JSON.  If you're unable to read from the dictionary, you may need to use <code>json.loads(request.body)</code> to get a dict you can access.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks @Alex it works. Can you post this as an answer?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Done! Super glad to hear that it helped. :)</span>
