<p>Just wondering why its having this sort of error but it works fine without the "and lvl &gt;= list"</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>In Python, <code>list</code> is a datatype. What you're doing wrong is you're essentially trying to see if 5 is greater than books on a bookshelf. You'll want to do:</p>
<pre><code>lvl = int(input("Level(1-15) =&gt; "))
val = 1 # I don't know why this exists, but okay.

# If the value 'lvl' is not in the range of 1 - 15
if lvl not in range(1, 16): 
    print("Invalid Input. Please enter an integer value between 1 to 15")
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I think your code should actually be written like this:</p>
<pre><code> lvl = int(input("Level(1-15) =&gt; "))

 ... 

 if lvl &lt; 1 and lvl &gt;= 16:
   print("Invalid Input. Please enter an integer value between 1 to 15")
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Specifically, regarding why your code seems to "work" when you remove the <code>and lvl &gt;= list</code> is actually because <code>list</code> is a reserved keyword for the type <code>list</code>:</p>
<pre><code> &gt;&gt;&gt; list
 &lt;type 'list'&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>And so your code naturally errors when you are trying to compare the integer <code>lvl</code> and the type <code>list</code>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>range(...)</code> already returns a list. No need to do <code>list(range(...))</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">You are comparing apples with CDs.. How can you check if a number is bigger than a list?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What are you trying to achieve? <code>list</code> is no variable (and should not be), because it is a data structure in python. <code>lvl</code> is an integer in your case. Do you want to check, whether <code>lvl</code> is contained in the list from <code>1..15</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ohh i see thanks for the help. Didn't really thought about what i was comparing</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@rocksteady The error means OP is using Python 3. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-range" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><b><code>range</code></b></a> does not return a list in Python 3.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you're answering, I think you should let OP know what mistakes he's doing, like the fact that he didn't even assign the value returned by <code>list()</code> to a variable, and why comparison between numbers and lists are not working, and how one could achieve that through <code>__ge__</code> magic methods, and so on. Otherwise it's not very helpful</span>
<span class="comment-copy">yea, just added that edit</span>
