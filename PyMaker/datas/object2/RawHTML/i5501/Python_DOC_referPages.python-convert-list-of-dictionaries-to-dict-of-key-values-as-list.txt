<p>I have a list of objects as below :</p>
<pre><code>avariable = [{'id':1,'color':'pink'},{'id':1,'color':'blue'},{'id':2,'color':'green'}]

<p>I want to convert it to :</p>
<pre><code>{
"1" : [{'id':1,'color':'pink'},{'id':1,'color':'blue'}],

<p>How to achieve this output, please help.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>As the suggestions have spoken, you need <code>itertools.groupby</code> -</p>
<pre><code>from itertools import groupby

avariable = [{'id':1,'color':'pink'},{'id':1,'color':'blue'},{'id':2,'color':'green'}]
groups = []  
uniquekeys = []  
for k, g in groupby(sorted(avariable, key=lambda x: x['id']), lambda x: x['id']): 
    # Store group iterator as a list 
    groups.append(list(g))        
    uniquekeys.append(k)

print({ str(i):j for i, j in zip(uniquekeys, groups) })
</code></pre>
<p>The output - </p>
<pre><code>{'1': [{'id': 1, 'color': 'pink'}, {'id': 1, 'color': 'blue'}], '2': [{'id': 2,
'color': 'green'}]}
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Without using any additional libraries. </p>
<pre><code>avariable = [{'id':1,'color':'pink'},{'id':1,'color':'blue'},{'id':2,'color':'green'}]

new_dict = {}
keys = set([i['id'] for i in avariable])

for key in keys:
    temp = []
    for l in avariable:
        if l['id'] == key:
            temp.append(l)
        new_dict[key] = temp


print(new_dict)
{1: [{'color': 'pink', 'id': 1}, {'color': 'blue', 'id': 1}],
 2: [{'color': 'green', 'id': 2}]}
</code></pre>
<p>one liner (dictionary comprehension):</p>
<pre><code>new_dict = {key: [l for l in avariable if l['id'] == key] for key in set([i['id'] for i in avariable])}       
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Hint: use <code>groupby</code> from the itertools package. Don't forget to sort if needed</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hint: <code>itertools.groupby</code>, please indicate what you''ve done.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">itertools.groupby works</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You should have waited for the OP's response, but anyway!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@UbdusSamad can you please elaborate your comment</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sure, I meant  that the hints were enough for you, that's why no one gave the full answer and left it for you as you should have been able to figure it out by now, but since you were not giving any response, I thought that you have either figured it out and didn't remember or care to update us on it or you just abandoned the search for answer.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">as soon as I received the hint, I have started implementing it with the library and have even responded in comment to the hint. and I do care to give feedback for every helpful answer/comment.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">itertools is <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">not an additional library</a></span>
