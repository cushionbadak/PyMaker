<p>I'd use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html#module-pickle" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>pickle</code></a> module to save the data, and instead of creating a separate file for each user, I'd save them all in dictionary and save it.</p>
<p>Here's what I mean:</p>
<pre><code>import pickle

# Read the existing database if any, otherwise create an empty version.

except FileNotFoundError:
    database = {}
    db_updated = True

# Then interact with user or do other operations to it.

step = str(input("Do you have an account (yes or no)? "))

    database[username] = data

    if username not in database:
        print('Error: username {!r} not found in database'.format(username))

<p>There's also info about <code>pickle</code> in my <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4529815/saving-an-object-data-persistence/4529901#4529901">answer</a> to the question <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4529815/saving-an-object-data-persistence"><em>Saving an Object (Data persistence)</em></a>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">if your account is list of file paths as string, you need to do <code>for filepath in accounts: with open(filepath) as f</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">This line: <code>account = open("%s.txt" %username, "a+")</code> already "puts" an open file in the variable <code>account</code>. Then you put that opened file object in a list and try to open that again.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">so what would be the fix</span>
<span class="comment-copy">i tried the for filepath thing but for that had to delete "with open(account) as f:"</span>
