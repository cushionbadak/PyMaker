<p>How would I take the results from the following code and assign a variable to it?</p>
<pre><code>for I in word: print (I + 117)
</code></pre>
<p>For example, if the results came out to be <code>100,101,102,103</code> how would I get a variable set to <code>"100,101,102,103"</code> without manually entering every number into a variable. Also, I know that it says "your encrypted string is" and I know that that's not really encrypted, but I just got into this so I was just playing around.</p>
<pre><code>word = eval(input("What would you like to say"))

print (word)

encrypt = 117

print ("Your encrypted string is:")

for I in word:

print (I + 117)
</code></pre>
<p>assuming I have ASCII codes set to their appropriate values</p>
<p>Thanks to many people (most notably yukashima huksay and ZYYYY) I have my final code here:</p>
<pre><code>word = eval(input("What would you like to say"))
print (word)
changedword = (', '.join(str(I + 15) for I in word))
print ("Your encrypted string is:" + changedword)
</code></pre>
<p>Assuming all ASCII codes set as variables.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You should do this:</p>
<pre><code>a = ','.join([x for x in word])
</code></pre>
<p>Please note that you can use any string instead of <code>','</code> for example <code>', '</code> or <code>'\n'</code> or basically whatever you can store in a string.</p>
<p>You can also put a function of x instead like <code>[foo(x) for x in word]</code> or <code>(2*x + 1)</code></p>
<p>And finally you can also use in-line if/else statements like:</p>
<pre><code>[foo(x) if x&gt;1 else bar(x) for x in word]
</code></pre>
<p>And also:</p>
<pre><code>[foo(x) for x in word if x is not None]
</code></pre>
<p>The error you are getting is because you are adding a number to a character perhaps what you want to do is:</p>
<pre><code>word = 'mokhlesim'
shift = 117
print(','.join([chr(ord(x)+shift) for x in word]))
</code></pre>
<p>result: è,Ö,á,Ö,â</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>str.join(iterable)</code> would give you what you want.</p>
<p>I don't think <code>eval()</code> is a good practice here. <code>word = input("somethin")</code> is enough for python3.</p>
<p>Also you may want to know about <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">list comprehensions</a> which makes code more concise.</p>
<p><code>eval(exp)</code> is to use to parse and evaluate <code>exp</code> as a python expression. For example</p>
<pre><code>x = 1
a = eval("x + 1")
print(a)
#should print 2
</code></pre>
<p>I think you may want something like</p>
<pre><code>word = input("give me something\n")
a = ','.join([chr(ord(c) + 117) for c in word])
print(a)
#if i type in here, it should print "Ý,Ú,ç,Ú"
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Post all code here directly as text. Posting text as an image just needlessly complicates matters.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">BTW, you can convert integers to and from ASCII using <code>ord()</code> and <code>chr()</code>. For example <code>chr(97)</code> is <code>'a'</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Dom please let me know if there is anything more you need about it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">trying to add that in didn't work because it's not originally a string, it's just a list of numbers in a separate variable. sorry for the late reply I was trying everything out. Also, thanks for the very fast reply, I greatly appreciate it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">at least I think that's the problem like I said I'm very new to this.when trying to run it tells me  "TypeError: sequence item 0: expected str instance, int found"</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That is because you are adding a number to a character.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">keep getting TypeError: ord() expected string of length 1, but int found</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I would be converting to and from ASCII code, so I would have to have eval in order to get the var recognized as variables, correct?</span>
