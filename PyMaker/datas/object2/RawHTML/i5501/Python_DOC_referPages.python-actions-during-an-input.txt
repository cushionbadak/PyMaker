<p>This is similar to this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39820909/do-action-while-raw-input-is-empty">here</a>.</p>
<p>I am trying to do <strong>other actions during an input</strong> for a chat system i'm working on using sockets, but the method in the link doesnt seem work in python 3, with this <em>slightly</em> modified code:</p>
<pre><code>import thread
import time

waiting = 'waiting'
i = 0

awesomespecialinput = None

def getinput():
    global var
    awesomespecialinput = input("what are you thinking about")

thread.start_new_thread(getinput,())


while awesomespecialinput == None:
    waiting += '.'
    print(waiting)
    i += 1
    time.sleep(1)

print('it took you',i,'seconds to answer')
</code></pre>
<p>And output:</p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/pi/python/inputtest2.py", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
    import thread
ImportError: No module named 'thread'
</code></pre>
<p>I have no knowledge about threads, but would like to have some useful foresight on threads, if anything.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>
<p>changed code:</p>
<pre><code>import threading
import time

waiting = 'waiting'
i = 0

awesomespecialinput = None

def getinput():
    global awesomespecialinput
    awesomespecialinput = input("what are you thinking about")

threading.start_new_thread(getinput,())


while awesomespecialinput == None:
    waiting += '.'
    print(waiting)
    i += 1
    time.sleep(1)

print('it took you',i,'seconds to answer')
</code></pre>
<p>output:</p>
<pre><code>AttributeError: module 'threading' has no attribute 'start_new_thread'
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>In Python 3 you can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html#threading.Thread" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>threading.Thread</code></a> with your <code>getinput</code> function as <code>target</code> parameter:</p>
<pre><code>import threading
import time


waiting = 'waiting'
i = 0
awesomespecialinput = None

def getinput():
    global awesomespecialinput
    awesomespecialinput = input("what are you thinking about")

threading.Thread(target=getinput).start()

while awesomespecialinput is None:
    waiting += '.'
    print(waiting)
    i += 1
    time.sleep(1)

print('it took you', i, 'seconds to answer')
</code></pre>
<p>(The <code>start_new_thread</code> method you're trying to use is not available in Python 3's <code>threading</code> module as that's a higher-level wrapper around the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/_thread.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>_thread</code></a> API.)</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Use module <code>threading</code> instead (needs different way to start thread) and, by the way, add <code>awesomespecialinput</code> to <code>global</code> declaration in your <code>getinput()</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">when I run this, it prints      waiting.what are you thinking about  What I expect for it to print is:      waiting.     waiting..     what are you thinking about --     waiting.     waiting..     waiting...     what are you thinking about --     waiting.     waiting..     waiting...     waiting....     what are you thinking about --     waiting.     waiting..     waiting...     waiting....     waiting.....     what are you thinking about  is this possible? sorry if i'm asking for too much</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@crazicrafter1 Do you mean it prints "waiting" before it asks for input?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I didn't realize the last comment I made would be so dense, the expected output is supposed to be this: <a href="https://imgur.com/a/GtzOZ" rel="nofollow noreferrer">imgur.com/a/GtzOZ</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">'waiting.what are you thinking about'</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@crazicrafter1 Are you sure you're not running the thread multiple times?</span>
