<p>I am trying to read a lot of excel files from a directory. When I run the following code, it gives me this error:</p>
<pre><code>FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '35TP2_TR1.xlsx'   
</code></pre>
<p>Code:</p>
<pre><code>#GUI
root=Tk()
root.withdraw() #closes tkinter window pop-up
path=filedialog.askdirectory(parent=root,title='Choose a folder')
path=path+'/'

print('Folder Selected',path)
files=os.listdir(path)
print(files)
length=len(files)

print('Files inside the folder',files)

data=[None]*length  

for s in range(0,length):
    data[s]=pd.read_excel(files[s],parse_cols="A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,N,O",skiprows=2)
</code></pre>
<p>this way, I was reading from the local folder, which is why it couldn't find the file. 
Thanks. </p>

<p>Like it says, <code>35TP2_TR1.xlsx</code> is not a file or a directory, because the script can't find it from the relative path (i.e the script is not located in the same folder than the .xlsx file).</p>
<p>You could try <code>os.path.abspath(file[s])</code> to get the absolute path of the file.</p>
