<p>I am trying to write a code for random walk, and in the direction part, I met this problem. I want the direction to be any degrees, what I do is try to use py.arrange to generate as many numbers as possible between -1 and 1. I want to ask is there any better solutions to go through all the numbers between -1 and 1? Thanks!</p>
<p>Here is my code:</p>
<pre><code>def fill_walk(self):
    while len(self.x_values)&lt;self.num_points:
        x_direction=choice(np.arange(-1,1,0.00001))
        x_distance=(int(1))
        x_step=x_direction*x_distance

        y_direction=choice(np.arange(-1,1,0.00001))
        y_distance=(int(1))
        y_step=y_direction*y_distance
</code></pre>

<p>Well, since you asked for "a better solution": the random walks do not have to be simulated (even though this might be cool). You can get the matlab code of the original publication <a href="http://leogrady.net/publications/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" title="on the authors website">on Leo Gradys website</a>, this might helt implementing something similar in python. </p>
<p>If you just want the random numbers, I'd refer to the comment of Patrick Haugh and use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.uniform" rel="nofollow noreferrer">random.uniform(-1, 1)</a>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Isn't a random walk associated with random?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">There is an infinite number of numbers between <code>-1</code> and <code>1</code>. Constrained to floating point numbers: there is a <i>very, very large</i> number of numbers between <code>-1</code> and <code>1</code>. Do you really need all of them?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What do you mean by "all numbers between -1 and 1"? If mean integer, it is zero, if it is not integer, then it is not a finite set of numbers.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">why do you need a range of numbers between <code>-1</code> and <code>1</code> for a random walk?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.uniform" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>random.uniform(-1, 1)</code></a></span>
