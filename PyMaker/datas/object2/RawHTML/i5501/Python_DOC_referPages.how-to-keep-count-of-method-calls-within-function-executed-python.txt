<p>My question is how to keep count of "method calls within function"? </p>
<p>I mean in the example below the replacement activity has happened twice inside the function. But all I can do is run a counter to check:how many times the function has been executed. </p>
<pre><code>def replace (newString,i=[0]):
    oldString = 'This is word. This is another sample word.'
    newString = oldString.replace('word', 'WORD')
    print(newString)
    i[0]+=1
    return i[0]
</code></pre>
<p>How to count the execution of method calls within the function and throw an output to keep track of it in python?</p>
<pre><code>Output: 
This is WORD. This is another sample WORD.
1

Expected output:
This is WORD. This is another sample WORD.
2
</code></pre>

<p><strong>RegEx Approach</strong></p>
<pre><code>import re
def replace(newString):
    oldString = 'This is word. This is another sample word.'
    newString = (re.sub('word', 'WORD', oldString))
    print newString
    print len(re.findall("WORD", newString))

<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>This is WORD. This is another sample WORD.

<span class="comment-copy">It doesn't really make sense because the <code>oldString.replace()</code> method happens only once. so why would it be 2?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I agree, but how to keep track of method call? Cause method call replaces twice.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It seems like you're just looking for the number of elements replaced, i.e. the number of times <code>'word'</code> occurs in <code>oldString</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">You might check out the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/profile.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">profiling tools</a> python offers.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It replaces two occurrences but it is called only once.</span>
