  all numbers are same but i want like this output only

<p><code>set()</code> it!</p>
<p>Just use <code>set()</code> on the list you want to remove duplicates from. Then <code>list()</code> it to cast it to a list.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/datastructures.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">list comprehensions</a> in python to achieve this. </p>
<p>Suppose you have multiple lists, and want to put all of the unique elements from these lists into one array, you can code it this way.</p>
<pre><code>number_list_1 = [1,2,3,4,5]
number_list_2 = [4,3,2,1,6]
number_list_3 = [2,4,1,3,7]
no_dupes = []

[no_dupes.append(item) for item in number_list_1 if item not in no_dupes]
[no_dupes.append(item) for item in number_list_2 if item not in no_dupes]
[no_dupes.append(item) for item in number_list_3 if item not in no_dupes]

print str(no_dupes)
</code></pre>
<p>This would return: <code>[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]</code></p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This is a rather unclear question, but to remove duplicates from a list:</p>
<pre><code>nums = [1,2,3,3,4,5,6]
x = []
for i in nums:
    if i not in x:
        x.append(i)

[print(i) for i in x] # output -&gt; 1 2 3 4 5 6
</code></pre>
<p>And to only get uniques from several lists:</p>
<pre><code>nums = [1,2,3,3,4,5,6]
nums2 = [2,1,3,4,4,5,7,8]

lists = nums + nums2

x = []
for i in lists:
    if i not in x:
        x.append(i)

[print(i) for i in x] # output -&gt; 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
</code></pre>
<h1>Edit and answer</h1>
<p>To get only unique sets of numbers:</p>
<pre><code>nums1 = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
nums2 = [3,2,1,6,5,4]
nums3 = [4,3,2,5,1,6]
nums4 = [2,3,4,5,6,7]

s1 = set(nums1)
s2 = set(nums2)
s3 = set(nums3)
s4 = set(nums4)

sets = [s1, s2, s3, s4]
uniq = []
for s in sets:
    if s not in uniq:
        uniq.append(s)

for u in uniq:
    [print(i, end=' ') for i in u]
    print() # output -&gt; {1,2,3,4,5,6} and {2,3,4,5,6,7}
</code></pre>
<p>Using sets is not required, but will ensure you have no duplicates inside the original lists and things will be easier in other ways as well.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">It is not really clear to me what the expected output should be. Why not simply use <code>numbers</code> immediately?</span>

<span class="comment-copy">@WillemVanOnsem I think OP has multiple list and he want to keep only unique elements.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why would you want to do all that work, and only keep the <code>[1,2,3,4,5,6]</code> list?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thats worked but how can i apply this to my code</span>
<span class="comment-copy">i cant upvote why i dont know</span>
<span class="comment-copy">no i'am saying that we have three arrays 1,2,3,4; 4,3,2,1 and 2,4,1,3 and these 3 arrays contain same numbers how can i show only one unique array</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If all the three arrays are going to always have the same numbers, they why not just sort one of them? <code>array.sort()</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">how to work array.sort() with my codes?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Well that is kind of up to you to figure out. It is still very unclear what you are trying to do, or what problem you are trying to solve. I only mentioned <code>array.sort()</code> because you said all lists will contain the same numbers, but in different order. So why even process them at all, is what I was thinking.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It might be better to use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#sets" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>set</code></a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@internet_user It's convenient, yes. But it seems quite clear OP doesn't have a lot of experience. So it's worth stating how to manually check for duplicates.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">i answered my question below for clear the question</span>
