<p>So, I have just started using PyCharm because I want to get more into Python (have more experience with other languages), and have run into a conundrum that there has to be a solution for. Some custom function I created relies on a module being imported in a particularly verbose way, so I don't want to have to copy-paste the same two lines every time I want to code, as opposed to simply typing <strong>import numpy as np</strong>.</p>
<p>So is there a way to <em>automatically run some code on my environment's start</em>? Particularly to import some modules? I looked around PyCharm's settings, and have found nothing, so I'd be extremely grateful if anyone can help me out</p>

<p>Do <code>File | Settings | Tools | Startup Tasks</code>  (or <code>Ctrl-Alt-S</code>).</p>
<p>Then: <code>Build, Execution, Deployment &gt; Console &gt; Python Console</code></p>
<p>This gives you a dialogue with an edit box <em>Starting script</em>. Put your import code there. That will run every time you open a new console.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Are you using a virtual environment?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It's not entirely clear what you want to accomplish: are you looking to <i>install</i> modules automatically, or just add the <code>import</code> lines to the beginning of a file automatically, so you don't have to enter them by hand when writing code?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Just add the import lines at the beginning of my environment's startup.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Actually, I think it was working for a bit, but now it is not. I double-verified I put the script in the right place but it does not show up/work in my scratch files. <a href="https://imgur.com/a/Ul8Q2" rel="nofollow noreferrer">imgur.com/a/Ul8Q2</a>  Could you help me out some more?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It will only work in console sessions. You have to put it in explicitly at the top of a saved program. Otherwise the program would fail when run outside of PyCharm.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you want boilerplate import code in <i>every</i> file, consider using a template: <code>File | Settings | Editor | File and Code Templates</code>. Either edit the Python Script template to include the code you want, or create a new one.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><a href="https://imgur.com/a/XPrMr" rel="nofollow noreferrer">imgur.com/a/XPrMr</a> I have done as you said, and even restarted PyCharm a couple times for good measure, but it still is not recognizing my function. Any idea on why?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you add code to a template, then you have to <i>create a new file</i> using that template, if you want to see new code in the resulting file. Changing the template doesn't retrofit new code into files you have already created. If you want a set of <code>import</code>s to run every time you start the interpreter (not just a Python console but at every execution) maybe you should look at writing <code>sitecustomize.py</code> (<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/site.html9" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/site.html9</a>). I hesitate to recommend this because it can have baffling side-effects if you're not careful.</span>
