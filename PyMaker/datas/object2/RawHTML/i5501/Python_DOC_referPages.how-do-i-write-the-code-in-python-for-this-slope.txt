<li><p>I would advice to use <code>raw_input</code> rather than <code>input</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>If you use python 2.x, <code>/</code> is floor division if both arguments are <code>int</code>, so to be on the save side make sure the input is converted to <code>float</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Be careful with operation order of <code>+</code> and <code>/</code>: If <code>+</code> should be evaluated before <code>/</code> you need to put it in <code>()</code></p></li>
<li><p>You need to print the variable <code>slope</code>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>So:</p>
<pre><code>x1 = float(raw_input('x1'))  # point 1 and point 2 (conversion to float)
x2 = float(raw_input('x2'))
y1 = float(raw_input('y1'))
y2 = float(raw_input('y2'))

slope = (y2-y1) / (x2-x1)  # point 3: () are needed here

print("The slope is {0}".format(slope))  # point 4
</code></pre>
</div>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>input</code> will ask the user for input. If you want to convert from a string to a float, use <code>float</code>, or simply write down the floating number, as in <code>x2 = 5.6</code>. In addition, your formula is incorrect; division has a higher precedence than subtraction, so you need additional parentheses.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Look at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input" rel="nofollow noreferrer">what the input function does</a> - it asks users what to assign to those variables. If you changed your code so that those lines were just <code>x1 = 0.0</code>, <code>x2 = 5.6</code> etc then your code would work. To ask a user for those values you'd change those lines to <code>x1 = float(input("Enter x1: "))</code>, so that the user could enter their own values.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I’d make it a function to not repeat 4 Times’.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@AntonvBR I agree with you, however, given the level of the question it might be that the OP is not yet familiar with function definitions, so I decided not to add further complexity.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>raw_input</code> is Python 2, <code>print()</code> is Python 3.</span>
