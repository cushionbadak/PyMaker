<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I am trying to go through a long list of words, and print both the lowercase word and the uppercase word (default) to the screen in the same line. Here is my code: </p>
<pre><code>for word in word_list:

    print("Here is: {0} and {1}".format(word.lower(), word))
</code></pre>
<p>However, this has the output (showcasing only two words): </p>
<pre><code>Here is: word1 
 and WORD1

Here is: word2 and WORD2
</code></pre>
<p>I have not been able to get rid of the newline between word1 and WORD1. It does not appear to happen for the last word I try and print. Any ideas as to why, and how to overcome this?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Here's an example to reproduce your issue: </p>
<pre><code>In [1411]: word = 'WORD1\n'

In [1412]: print("Here is: {0} and {1}".format(word.lower(), word))
Here is: word1
 and WORD1
</code></pre>
<p>Notice the trailing newline. One of your list elements has those. You can remove it using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.strip" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>str.strip</code></a>.</p>
<pre><code>In [1413]: word = word.strip(); print("Here is: {0} and {1}".format(word.lower(), word))
Here is: word1 and WORD1
</code></pre>
<p>You can also use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.rstrip" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>str.rstrip</code></a>, (<code>r</code> =&gt; right) if there's only the possibility of <em>trailing</em> whitespace chars (not leading ones).</p>
<p>On a related note, I'd recommend taking a look at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Rubber Duck Debugging</a>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">using <code>word.strip()</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">so the value of <code>word</code> is <code>'WORD1\n'</code>, not <code>'WORD1</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Worked perfectly. Thank you very much!</span>
