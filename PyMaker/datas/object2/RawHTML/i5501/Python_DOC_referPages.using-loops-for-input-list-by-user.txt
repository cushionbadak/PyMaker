<p>I want to make this code much more elegant, using loop for getting user input into a list and also making the list as a list of floats withot having to define each argument on the list as a float by itself when coming to use them or print them...
I am very new to python 3.x or python in general, this is the first code i have ever written so far so 'mercy me pardon!' </p>
<pre><code>Name = "john"
Place = "Colorado"
print (("Hello %s What's up? \nare you coming to the party tonight in %s\n 
if not at least try to make simple calculator:") % (Name, Place))

print ("you will input 2 numbers now and i will devide them for you:")
calc =list(range(2))
calc[0] = (input("number 1:"))
calc[1] = (input("number 2:"))
print (float(calc[0])/float(calc[1]))
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Since you are saying you are new to Python, I'm going to suggest you experiment with a few methods yourself. This will be a nice learning experience. I'm not going to give you answers directly here, since that would defeat the purpose. I'm instead going to offer suggestions on where to get started. </p>
<p>Side note: it's great that you are using Python3. Python3.6 supports f-strings. This means you can replace the line with your <code>print</code> function as follows.</p>
<pre><code>print(f"Hello {Name} What's up? "
"\nare you coming to the party tonight in {Place}"
"\n if not at least try to make simple calculator:")
</code></pre>
<p>Okay, you should look into the following in order:</p>
<ul>
<li>for loops</li>
<li>List comprehension</li>
<li>Named Tuples </li>
<li>functions</li>
<li>ZeroDivisionError</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Are you looking for something like this :</p>
<pre><code>values=[float(i) for i in input().split()]
print(float(values[0])/float(values[1]))
</code></pre>
<p>output:</p>
<pre><code>1 2
0.5
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>By using a function that does the input for you inside a list comprehension that constructs your 2 numbers:</p>
<pre><code>def inputFloat(text):
    inp = input(text)   # input as text
    try:                # exception hadling for convert text to float
        f = float(inp)  # if someone inputs "Hallo" instead of a number float("Hallo") will
                        # throw an exception - this try: ... except: handles the exception
                        # by wrinting a message and calling inputFloat(text) again until a
                        # valid input was inputted which is then returned to the list comp
        return f        # we got a float, return it
    except:
        print("not a number!") # doofus maximus user ;) let him try again
        return inputFloat(text) # recurse to get it again
</code></pre>
<p>The rest is from your code, changed is the list comp to handle the message and input-creation:</p>
<pre><code>Name = "john"
Place = "Colorado"
print (("Hello %s What's up? \nare you coming to the party tonight in %s\n"+
        " if not at least try to make simple calculator:") % (Name, Place))

print ("you will input 2 numbers now and i will devide them for you:")

# this list comprehension constructs a float list with a single message for ech input
calc = [inputFloat("number " + str(x+1)+":") for x in range(2)] 
if (calc[1]):  # 0 and empty list/sets/dicts/etc are considered False by default
    print (float(calc[0])/float(calc[1]))
else:
    print ("Unable to divide through 0")
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>"
Hello john What's up?
are you coming to the party tonight in Colorado
 if not at least try to make simple calculator:
you will input 2 numbers now and i will devide them for you:
number 1:23456dsfg
not a number!
number 1:hrfgb
not a number!
number 1:3245
number 2:sfdhgsrth
not a number!
number 2:dfg
not a number!
number 2:5
649.0

<span class="comment-copy">This is a good list of subjects to investigate.. will do! thanks mate.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sure. Feel free to continue discussing here. I can answer more detailed questions if required. Welcome to Python!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">what is the purpose of the .split()?</span>
