<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>i have a list contains some values.I want to check if any of the element is presented in another list with if statement.
I have done something like if condition with list comprehension this but not working as expected.
my code is </p>
<pre><code>fileop=["create","open","append","delete","move","copy"]   
a=raw_input("enter a command\n")    
tokens=a.split(" ")

def data(i):    
     return i

if [data(i) in tokens for i in fileop] in tokens:    
     print "file operations"

     if "create" in tokens:    
        print "create"    
     elif "open" in tokens:    
        print "open"
     elif "delete" in tokens:    
         print "delete"
</code></pre>
<p>If my input is like delete file.how to get the correct keyword.</p>

<p>You’re close to two different solutions here! One is to make a list (well, an iterable) of true or false values indicating whether each item of <code>fileop</code> is in <code>tokens</code>, then check if <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#any" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><em>any</em></a> one is true:</p>
<pre><code>if any(data(i) in tokens for i in fileop):
</code></pre>
<p>The other is to check if the set intersection between the tokens and the operations isn’t empty:</p>
<pre><code>if set(tokens) &amp; set(fileop):
</code></pre>
<p>The former is more typical, but this might have been what you were going for with the second <code>in tokens</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you want to know the tokens corresponding to file operations in the input, we can do:</p>
<p><code>operations = [token for token in tokens if token in fileop]</code></p>
<p>operations will be a list containing all tokens that represented a file operation</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p><code>tokens = ["open", "move", "rename"]</code></p>
<p>operations will contain ["open", "move"]</p>
<p>If you want to print the list:
<code>for fileop in [token for token in tokens if token in fileop]: print fileop</code></p>
<p>Hope this answers your question.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">It is not clear to me what you are trying to accomplish</span>
<span class="comment-copy">not sure what you want but I am guessing [x for x in tokens if x in fileop]</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@StephenRauch- it is for checking a list with another.That is any of the element in fileop is presented in tokens (list).i can do it like 'if "create" in tokens or "open in tokens" or  "delete in tokens": '.But i am just trying to implement it using list comprehension.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Please provide a sample input and output. Your code may look like Python, but it's using constructs that only mean something to you. We could help you convert those constructs to proper Python, but only if we know what they are meant to do.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">My guess is you want <code>any</code> at some point if you want an if statement</span>
