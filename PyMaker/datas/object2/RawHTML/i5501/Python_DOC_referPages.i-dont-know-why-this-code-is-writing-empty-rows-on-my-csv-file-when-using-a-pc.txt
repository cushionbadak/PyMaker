<p>You need to specify the newline character when you open the file.  On Windows, the default ends up adding an extra <code>'\r'</code>.</p>

<p>The python csv module does it's own universal newline handling, so from the python documentation you open file objects in the following two ways.</p>
<p>On <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/csv.html#csv.writer" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python 2.7.x</a> you need to open files using the 'b' flag</p>
<pre><code>myFile = open('quotes.csv', 'ab')
</code></pre>
<p>On <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/csv.html#csv.writer" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python 3.x</a> you need to pass the newline option</p>
<pre><code>myFile = open('quotes.csv', 'a', newline='')
</code></pre>
<p>Some systems are affected by this (windows) and some aren't, as you have seen.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">According to the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#id3" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>csv</code> docs</a>, <code>newline=''</code> allows <code>csv</code> to do it's internal newline handling correctly.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thank you that worked</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Nicely done. It could be improved by turning <i>python documentation</i> into a link. Better yet, turn the <i>Python xx</i> references into links to the appropriate documentation.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes @Ken, totally should have done that. Added in now.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Excellent! I wish I could upvote twice. :-) You'll get the extra votes from others that see the effort, though. Thanks!</span>
