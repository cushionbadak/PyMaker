<p>I want to build a http server to broadcast the temperature  and update every 1 minute. I used microhttpd in C, now I want to write in Python. Which module should I use? </p>
<p>Hope to have your suggestions.</p>

<p>Python comes with the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http server module</a> which would be perfect for something like this.</p>
<p>You could get started with this <a href="https://daanlenaerts.com/blog/2015/06/03/create-a-simple-http-server-with-python-3/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">tutorial</a> - I just looked it up so I haven't read it closely but it looks like it would cover most of what you need. </p>
