<p>How would I find all possibilities of a 10 char string using the chars "a","b" and "c". I know there are 3^10 possibilities but I'm not sure how to code it. I know there's a good chance there's already an answer for this but I just can't find it. Thanks.</p>
<p>EDIT</p>
<p>I've already tried to do it using the itertools module, in particular using the permutations and combinations modules but all to no avail.</p>

<p>Look at the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">itertools</a> module. <code>map("".join, itertools.product('abc', repeat=10))</code> should do the job.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Take a look at the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>itertools</code></a> module.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I have and I've tried to use itertools.permutations but I haven't been able to get it to work.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Can you show what you've tried and describe how it didn't meet your requirements?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm sorry I didn't do it on this computer so I don't have the code with me. I think I deleted it when it didn't work anyway.</span>
