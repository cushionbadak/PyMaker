<p>In a project I have a function that creates a folder when it doesn't exist yet with the os package.</p>
<p>Now I run into the error then when this folder is created (I run the script with the IDE pycharm) nobody has access, hence the error "IOError: [Errno 13] Permission denied" occurs.</p>
<p>The project runs in a virtual environment, python2.7 and the function is in the gist of:</p>
<pre><code>if not os.path.exists(folder):
   os.makedirs(folder)
</code></pre>
<p>What is causing the folder to be inaccessible? Any insights why this is occurring? If I missed any relevant information please let me know.</p>
<p>(changing the permission rights per folder is no solution as the folders need to be created on the fly by user input)</p>

<p>According to the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation</a> you can set the permission on directory with:</p>
<pre><code>os.makedirs(folder, mode=0o777)
</code></pre>
<p>Beware that mode is not string but octal</p>

<span class="comment-copy">The documentation indicates that the default mode is 0777. Somehow, the nested folder is <i>not</i> created with access rights for everyone..  From the docs: <i>Recursive directory creation function. Like mkdir(), but makes all intermediate-level directories needed to contain the leaf directory. Raises an error exception if the leaf directory already exists or cannot be created. The default mode is 0777 (octal).</i></span>
