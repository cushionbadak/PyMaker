<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have a TEXT FILE that looks like:</p>
<pre><code>John: 27
Micheal8483: 160
Mary Smith: 57
Adam 22: 68
Patty: 55
</code></pre>
<p>etc etc. They are usernames that is why their names contain numbers occasionally. What I want to do is check each of their numbers (the ones after the ":") and get the 3 names that have the numbers that are closest in value to a integer (specifically named targetNum). It will always be positive.</p>
<p>I have tried multiple things but I am new to Python and I am not really sure how to go about this problem. Any help is appreciated!</p>

<p>You can parse the file into a list of name/number pairs. Then <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#list.sort" rel="nofollow noreferrer">sort</a> the list by difference between a number and <code>targetNum</code>. The first three items of the list will then contain the desired names:</p>
<pre><code>users = []

with open("file.txt") as f:
    for line in f:
        name, num = line.split(":")
        users.append((name, int(num)))

targetNum = 50
users.sort(key=lambda pair: abs(pair[1] - targetNum))
print([pair[0] for pair in users[:3]])  # ['Patty', 'Mary Smith', 'Adam 22']
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You could use some regex recipe here :</p>
<pre><code>import re

pattern=r'(\w.+)?:\s(\d+)'
data_1=[]
targetNum = 50
with open('new_file.txt','r') as f:
    for line in f:
        data=re.findall(pattern,line)
        for i in data:
            data_1.append((int(i[1])-targetNum,i[0]))

print(list(map(lambda x:x[1],data_1[-3:])))
</code></pre>
<p>output:</p>
<pre><code>['Mary Smith', 'Adam 22', 'Patty']
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">What multiple things have you tried?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">checking how close 2 numbers are is usually done with subtraction.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Are the numbers unique?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@EugeneYarmash Yes they are</span>
