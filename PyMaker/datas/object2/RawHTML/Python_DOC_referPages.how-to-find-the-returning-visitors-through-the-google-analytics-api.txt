<p>It is visible on the Audience Overview page as a pie chart of Percent New Visitors vs % Returning Visitors</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Clarification: The pie chart actually shows % of Sessions by new and returning visitors, not % returning users. As zborovskaya stated, there is a ga:percentNewSessions which can be used (100 - %new = %returning session).</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>There is no metric 'Percent New Visitors' and 'Percent Returned Visitors'. But you can use <code>ga:userType</code> and calculate %.</p>
<p>And also metric <code>ga:percentNewSessions</code> exists - the percentage of sessions by users who had never visited the property before. May be it will be helpful.</p>
