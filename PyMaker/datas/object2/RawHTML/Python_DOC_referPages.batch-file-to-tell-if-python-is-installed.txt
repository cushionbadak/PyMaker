<p>I am writing a windows batch file, and I would like to know if there is a way to detect if python is properly installed on a computer.  I need to run a .py file from the batch file, but first I need to check (also within the batch file) if that extension if recognized and can be run, without knowing the full file path to "python.exe".  Can this be done?</p>
<p>Update:
For clarification, I have now learned that python is not currently in the path.  The suggestions involving "where python", and "python â€”version 2" don't work for me - I get an error stating "python is not recognized as an internal or external command, etc".  Thanks for the help so far, is there another way to do this?</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"><code>&gt;nul 2&gt;nul assoc .py &amp;&amp; echo Associated|| echo Not available
</code></pre>
<p>This relies on no overrule by use of i.e. context menu "<em>Open With</em>" -&gt; "<em>Choose default program</em>".</p>
<p><code>errorlevel</code> also can be used to test:</p>
<pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"><code>&gt;nul 2&gt;nul assoc .py

if errorlevel 1 (
    echo Not available
) else (
    echo Associated
)
</code></pre>
<p>View <code>assoc /?</code> for detailed help on the command.</p>

<p>Open notepad paste in the code below and then save it as a .bat file 
(Remember to select all files in the little dropdown when saving) </p>
<p>You can use the following to check if python v. 2 or above is detected:</p>
<pre><code>python --version 2&gt;NUL
if not errorlevel 0 goto ...
</code></pre>
<p>Where '...' is in case python is NOT detected.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">perhaps just try <code>where python</code> I could have given a proper answer, but your quetion is off topic as you show no attempts of your own.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It's not clear if by "properly installed" do you mean also exact version check etc or just a python executable. Also, if you are interested in cases where it's installed but not in the path etc.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Michael Heath, Thank you so much, that's just what I was looking for!  I knew there had to be a simple solution to this!  Can you post that as an answer so I can mark it as accepted?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I would rather do <code>if not errorlevel 0 ...</code>  but typically we do not answer off topic questions.</span>
