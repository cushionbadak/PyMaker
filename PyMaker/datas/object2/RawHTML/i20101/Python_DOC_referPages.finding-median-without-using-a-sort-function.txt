<p>As a homework assignment I have to write a script which finds the median of 3 given numbers without using a standard sort function of Python.</p>
<p>This is my first week in class and my first programming experience so I find it very difficult to get any further than I am right now.</p>
<p>Here's what I have so far:</p>
<pre><code>def med3(a,b,c):
    list = [a, b, c]
    newlist = []
    if list:
        minimum = list[0]
        for x in list:
            if x &lt; minimum:
                minimum = x
                newlist.append(minimum)
                list.remove(minimum)
            elif x &gt;= minimum:
                newlist.append(x)
                list.remove(x)

    return newlist[1]
</code></pre>
<p>This seems to do the trick, but only for the first two entries of the list. The loop doesn't include the third entry.</p>
<p>How can I make the script include all three entries?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!
Sander</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>sum([a, b, c]) - min(a, b, c) - max(a, b, c)</code> - no sorting!</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You are modifying the list in-place while looping over it, which has consequences for what elements you see:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; numbers = [1,2,3]
&gt;&gt;&gt; for i in numbers:
...     if i == 2: numbers.remove(i)
...     print i
... 
1
2
</code></pre>
<p>Note how <code>3</code> is never printed; by removing the second entry in the list, we've shortened it by one element and the loop finds the list exhausted early.</p>
<p>Note that you don't <em>need</em> to loop over the items, a few simple comparisons will tell you what item is the median if you think about it for a second. :-)</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>There are a number of simpler ways to go about this, but as for your approach:</p>
<p>You're modifying <code>list</code> inside of your loop. Don't do that. :)</p>
<p>In your case, you should be removing elements from newlist:</p>
<pre><code>def med3(a,b,c):
    list = [a, b, c]
    newlist = []
    if list:
        minimum = list[0]
        for x in list:
            if x &lt; minimum:
                minimum = x
                newlist.pop()
                newlist.append(minimum)
            elif x &gt;= minimum:
                newlist.append(x)
    return newlist[1]
</code></pre>
<p>But as an exercise, you might want to think about a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Why are you putting the elements in a list and looping over them? What advantage does this have over comparing a,b,c with simply if statements?</p></li>
<li><p>Why the <code>if list:</code>? </p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The fastest way to do it:</p>
<pre><code>def medianFast(a, b, c):
    if a &gt; b:
        if b &gt; c: 
            return b
        elif a &gt; c:
            return c
        else:
            return a
    else:
        if b &lt; c: 
            return b
        elif a &gt; c:
            return a
        else:
            return c
</code></pre>
<p>Guarantees you 3 comparisons at the worst case and 2 comparisons in the best case. 2,5 comparisons in average.</p>
<p>Using <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#conditional-expressions" rel="nofollow">ternary conditional</a> we can write it shorter as:</p>
<pre><code>def medianTernary(a, b, c):
    return (b if b &gt; c else (c if a &gt; c else a)) if a &gt; b else (b if b &lt; c else (a if a &gt; c else c))
</code></pre>
<p>If you could use sorting you would have the shortest version:</p>
<pre><code>def medianSorted(a, b, c):
    return sorted([a, b, c])[1]
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Too much work. Define what "median" means in the context of 3 numbers without using loops and lists.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You have a lot of code there that really isn't needed. Also since this is homework, its for you to figure out, not for us to do it for you...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Welcome to Stack Overflow! You have many unnecessary steps here. For example, <code>if list:</code> is unnecessary: you've just defined the list. But in general you don't need lists or loops. Hint: you can do this using three <code>if</code> statements that each use an <code>or</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I would suggest to find out a technique to find the median of 3 given numbers <i>in your head</i>. Write down this technique in English as if giving a recipe to someone else. Finally code this technique using a programming language. (Call your text a <i>pseudocode</i> and you're a real programmer ;-)</span>
