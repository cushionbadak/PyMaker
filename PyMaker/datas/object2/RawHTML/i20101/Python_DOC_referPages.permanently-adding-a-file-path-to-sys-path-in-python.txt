<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I had a file called <code>example_file.py</code>, which I want to use from various other files, so I decided to add <code>example_file.py</code> to <code>sys.path</code> and import this file in another file to use the file. To do so, I ran the following in <code>ipython</code>. </p>
<pre><code>import sys
sys.path
sys.path.append('/path/to/the/example_file.py')
print(sys.path)
</code></pre>
<p>I could see the path I had just added, and when I tried to import this file from another directory path like this:</p>
<pre><code>import example_file
</code></pre>
<p>it worked just fine, but once I came out of <code>ipython</code>, entered it again, and checked the <code>sys.path</code>, I saw that the path which I had added was not present, so can anyone let me know how to add a path to sys.path permanently in python. Thank you in advance for your help. </p>

<p>There are a few ways.  One of the simplest is to create a <code>my-paths.pth</code> file (as described <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/site.html">here</a>).  This is just a file with the extension <code>.pth</code> that you put into your system <code>site-packages</code> directory.  On each line of the file you put one directory name, so you can put a line in there with <code>/path/to/the/</code> and it will add that directory to the path.</p>
<p>You could also use the PYTHONPATH environment variable, which is like the system PATH variable but contains directories that will be added to <code>sys.path</code>.  See <a href="http://docs.python.org/tutorial/modules.html#the-module-search-path">the documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Note that no matter what you do, <code>sys.path</code> contains <em>directories</em> not files.  You can't "add a file to <code>sys.path</code>".  You always add its directory and then you can import the file.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Make your code a proper package, make it easy_installable and be happy for the rest of your life (instead of tinkering). Apart from that: every documentation tells you CLEARLY that <code>sys.path.append()</code> accepts a directory containing file AND NOT SINGLE PATH TO A FILE.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">Don't confuse the system path with <code>PYTHONPATH</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">ok thanks thats fine i have added my directory which consists of file and its working when i imported the file from another location, bu the problem when i came out of ipython and again looed in to check my path, it does n't appear, i dont want to do it each time when i entered the code, i want to add the directory path to sys.path permanatly, how to do this</span>

<span class="comment-copy">The <code>site</code> package was perfect.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">fixed my issue with <code>sys.path.append('C:\\python34\\lib\\site-packages')</code> thank you!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">For posterity: the <code>.pth</code> file is what the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/site.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">site-module documentation</a> calls a <code>path configuration file</code>. Of note about the path configuration file: <code>no check is made that the item refers to a directory rather than a file. No item is added to sys.path more than once. Blank lines and lines beginning with # are skipped. Lines starting with import (followed by space or tab) are executed.</code></span>
