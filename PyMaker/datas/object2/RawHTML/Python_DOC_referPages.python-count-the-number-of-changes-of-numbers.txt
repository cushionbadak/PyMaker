<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I know the title is confusing, I didn't know how else to explain it, so here is a better explanation:</p>
<p>I have a file where each line is written as followed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a,b,c</p>
</blockquote>
<p>where a,b and c are numbers. Here, the numbers a are irrelevant. Here, b are supposed to be some kind of coordinates and c is a group number.</p>
<p>For each c, I need to find the counts of each kind of movements the group made.</p>
<p>For example, let's say my file is something like that:</p>
<pre>23,20,789
25,7,789
29,7,789
32,20,789
0,2,870
3,40,870</pre>
<p>So I need to count how many times the group 789 moves from 1 to 1, 1 to 2, ..., 7 to 7, ... 20 to 7, 20 to 8, ... and so on until 117 to 117.
And do this for each group.</p>
<p>Of course, there will be lots of zeros which is ok.
So for example here I should find:</p>
<p>For the group 789: 1 move from 20 to 7, 1 move from 7 to 7, 1 move from 7 to 20 and 0 move for all the other combination of movement. </p>
<p>For the group 870: 1 move from 2 to 40 and 0 for all the other combination of movement.</p>
<p>I hope it was clear.</p>
<p>I know I should put what I began to do, but that is my problem. I really don't know where to start. I mean I know how to count how many times a digit or a string appears in a text, but to count the changes and especially by groups, I have no clue where to start.</p>
<p>I hope you can help me at least start.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
<p>EDIT: Here is what I have for now thanks to @Tojrah</p>
<pre><code>f1=open("My_file_where_the_coordinates_for_one_group_are_all_in_one_line.txt","r")
f2=open("File_of_counts.txt","a")
line=f1.readline()
s=line.split()
count=0

for i in range (0,len(s)-1):
    for j in range (1,len(s)-1):
        if s[j]==s[i] and s[j+1]==s[i+1]:
            count+=1
    f2.write("from {} to {} , result= {}\n".format(s[i], s[i+1], count))
    count=0
f1.close()
f2.close()
</code></pre>
<p>But you can surely guess, here are the result partially shown:</p>
<pre><code>from 20 to 7 , result= 5
from 7 to 7 , result= 9
from 7 to 20 , result= 6
from 20 to 20 , result= 28242
from 20 to 20 , result= 28242
from 20 to 20 , result= 28242
from 20 to 20 , result= 28242
</code></pre>
<p>You can see that the counts are good but it counts the same movements several time. How to stop it from counting the movements already counted?</p>
<p>EDIT 2:
Here are the changes I made to @Tojrah 's code:</p>
<pre><code>for i in range (1,118):
for j in range (1,118):
    count=0
    for k in range (0, len(s)-1):
        if (str(i)==s[k] and str(j)==s[k+1]):
            count+=1
    f.write("from {} to {} , result= {}\n".format(i, j, count))
    count=0
</code></pre>
<p>Now it works perfectly fine.<br/>
Thanks again to @Tojrah for helping me.</p>

<p>You can append all the values at the second place (number b) in a list for a particular group (say, 789). Then just iterate over the list using nested loops and you can get all the moves you want. Hope this is what you want. 
Code:</p>
<pre><code>for i in range(1,118):
    for j in range(1,118):
         count=0
         for p in range(len(list)-1):
             if(list[p]==i and list[p+1]==j):
                 count+=1
         if(count!=0):
             #print/write Statement here
</code></pre>
<p>If you're still stuck I can help you :)</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Thank you for your answer, I will try that.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I added some code from what you said, and I edited my first post with it. If you could tell me what I'm doing wrong I would be so grateful. Thanks</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Can you show me what is s. I mean how are you splitting the line (what is the separator for splitting?). Also ,readline should return only one line</span>
<span class="comment-copy">f1 is my file of coordinates written like that: <code>20 20 7 7 8 10 20 20</code> in one line. s is just a list of the coordinates, meaning <code>[20,20,7,7,8,10,20,20]</code>. The separator is a space.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Okay,got it. (Sorry as I didn't see the file name F1!). So actually to avoid repetition I suggest instead of checking for pairs in the list itself,you should use nested loops ,each one going from 1 to 117 as you said,and check the number of pairs, <code>i,j</code> in the list(a third loop would iterate over list,so nesting thrice).This would be simplest way to handle this problem and avoid repetition!(you can avoid printing those  with zero counts).</span>
