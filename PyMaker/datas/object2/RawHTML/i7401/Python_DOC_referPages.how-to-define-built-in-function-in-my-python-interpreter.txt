<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I would like to add a python function in my interpreter that exists by default whenever I run python in my shell. The scenario I want is:</p>
<p>write a function like this once: </p>
<pre><code>def clear():
  import os
  os.system('clear')
</code></pre>
<p>And run python in shell</p>
<p>Then I type <code>clear()</code> and the screen gets cleared without having to define clear each time I invoke python interpreter. </p>
<p>I am interested in a solution that fits Ubuntu or any Linux distribution. however, any solution for any platform is welcome. </p>

<p>Use Customisation Modules: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/appendix.html#the-customization-modules" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/appendix.html#the-customization-modules</a></p>
<p>With it, you can run code and define methods that are available when Python starts up interactively.</p>
<p>First, find where Python is looking for the user customisation directory is. Start <code>python</code> and type:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import site
&gt;&gt;&gt; site.getusersitepackages()
'/home/user/myuser/.local/lib/python3.5/site-packages'
</code></pre>
<p>The last string given is the customisation directory. If it does not exist, create it. Then create a file in your customisation directory called <code>usercustomize.py</code>. Add your code from the question to it. Save and restart Python.</p>
<p>Voila! You can now type:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; clear()
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">thanks for your reply. is there a way that this personal library gets loaded by default whenever I start python?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you just want clear, then why don't you use iPython interpreter instead of the default repl? Try it out. You will thank me later :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@cricket_007 thanks a lot. you answered my question.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@BanachTarski though it is not just clear I want, but I will try it. thanks a lot ^_^</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Voting to re-open. The duplicate does not answer the question. The question is not about ipython nor numpy.  Using User Customisation from <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/appendix.html#the-customization-modules" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/tutorial/â€¦</a> is the generic way to do this</span>
