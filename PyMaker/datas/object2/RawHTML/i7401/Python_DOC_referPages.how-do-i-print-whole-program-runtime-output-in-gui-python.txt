<p>well basically what i am trying to do is that i want to show the output being executed in a graphical interface. 
i have a bash script that i am running using following code</p>
<pre><code>from subprocess import call
myscript= call("Myscript.sh", shell=True)
</code></pre>
<p>Now this Myscript performs some set of tasks. i want to show everything that is happening in output to a graphical interface.
some logic that i was trying to do here is by storing all the output in a string and printing it but it displays the final conlusion and its an integer value! i want all the strings to be printed of myscript working. 
code is as following that i tried :</p>
<pre><code>root = Tk()
words=[]

a= call("sh amapt.sh", shell=True)
w = Label(root, text=words.append(a))
w.pack()
print w
root.mainloop()
</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9eJCH.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer">This is my script output that i want to be displayed in a Gui somewhere as in label or form. i dont know how. im confused please guide me</a></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>call</code> returns the exit code, which is an integer value. Try <code>check_output</code>, which returns the text. </p>
<pre><code>from subprocess import check_output

root = Tk()

# to get the error message you need to catch stderr too
a = check_output("sh amapt.sh; exit 0", shell=True, stderr=subprocess.STDOUT)
w = Label(root, text=a)
w.pack()
root.mainloop()
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">subprocess.CalledProcessError: Command 'Myscript' returned non-zero exit status 255  Now what?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That means 'Myscript' failed to run correctly. Fix whatever is preventing Myscript from running.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">script is running perfectly and doing its work.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">its fails to run with this check_output</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>call</code> and <code>check_output</code> both pass the work to <code>Popen</code>, so if it works in one it should work in the other... I can't really help you with that further without seeing what you are trying to run. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.check_output" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Read the docs</a> and make sure you are passing the variables correctly.</span>
