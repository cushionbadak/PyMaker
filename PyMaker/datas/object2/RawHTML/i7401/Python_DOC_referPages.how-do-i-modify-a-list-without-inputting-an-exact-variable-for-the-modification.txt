<p>I'm in an intro programming course and struggling a bit with lists in Python. The following problem is from my textbook and I'm having an issue getting my code to pass both tests:</p>
<p>Modify short_names by deleting the first element and changing the last element to Joe. Sample output from given program:
['Sam', 'Ann', 'Joe']</p>
<p>Here is my code (which passes the test for the sample output): </p>
<pre><code>short_names = ['Gertrude', 'Sam', 'Ann', 'Joseph']
short_names[1] = ['Sam' , 'Ann' , 'Joe']
short_names = short_names[1]
my_list = short_names[2:4]


print(short_names)
</code></pre>
<p>When other names are substituted in for the original short_names (ex: ['Jessica' , 'Erin' , 'Max', 'Josepfine'] then my code fails to execute properly. I think that having the actual names in my "short_names[1]" variable is the reason for this. I'm just not sure how to fix it. Any direction/advice would be great. Thanks! </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>short_names = ['Gertrude', 'Sam', 'Ann', 'Joseph']

# remove first element
del short_names[0]

# set last element to 'Joe'
short_names[-1] = 'Joe'
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You shouldn't hard code the names when you do <code>short_names[1] = ['Sam' , 'Ann' , 'Joe']</code>.
Instead, do this:</p>
<pre><code>short_names = short_names[1:] # removes first element
short_names[-1] = "Joe" # set last element
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>short_names[0]</code> always refers to the first element, regardless of what is stored there.  Similarly, <code>short_names[-1]</code> always refers to the last element.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You should do what the instructions say - delete the first element, and change the last one. Not replace the entire list. If you don't know how to do that, the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists" rel="nofollow noreferrer">official docs</a> or the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/documentation/python/209/list#t=201707152121229967559">SO docs</a> are good places to find out.</span>
