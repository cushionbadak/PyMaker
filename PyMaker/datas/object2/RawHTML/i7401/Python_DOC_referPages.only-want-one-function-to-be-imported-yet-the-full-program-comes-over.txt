<p>I made 2 programs for show porpose. I would like to import the global variable from the transmitter function into another file, yet the problem that I encounter is that the While true loop also comes along spoiling my whole second program, because the second problem now also starts to show the itiration.</p>
<p>Program 1:</p>
<pre><code>import time

def transmitter():
    global temp

global temp
temp = 2

transmitter()

while True: # a random task just to see if I only imported the function
    x = 0
    print(x + 1)
    time.sleep(0.2)
</code></pre>
<p>Program 2:</p>
<pre><code>from transmitguy import transmitter

def valuepullup():
    newval = transmitguy.transmitter()
    print(newval)

valuepullup()
</code></pre>
<p>I only need my second program to show the value of 2 once. (2 is the globalvar from file 1)</p>

<p>The short answer is that you can't get only one piece of a module.  <code>from x import y</code> imports <code>x</code> in the same way <code>import x</code> does.  The only difference is that, in the former case, <code>y</code> is added to your current global namespace, and in the latter case, <code>x</code> is.  The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#import" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs for <code>import</code></a> say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <code>from</code> form ... find[s] the module specified in the <code>from</code> clause, loading and initializing it if necessary ...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am not sure exactly what you are trying to accomplish.  As the commenters noted, you can check for <code>__main__</code>.  However, you might do better to put your variable in its own module, then import that module from both of your existing modules.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Where is <code>OpenUSB</code> defined?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">fixed the file, the original program was called openUSB, changed the name for upload</span>
<span class="comment-copy">put it in the [if <b>name</b> == "<b>main</b>":], it now gives the value none</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Your function returns <code>None</code>, since you haven't written it to return anything else. It's a useless function, since it doesn't do anything at all. I'm not sure what you expect your <code>global</code> statements to do, but currently they're completely pointless.</span>
