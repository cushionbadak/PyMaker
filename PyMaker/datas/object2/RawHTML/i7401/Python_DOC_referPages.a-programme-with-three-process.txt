<p>The programme is like a door key use for opening the door of the agency. Firstly, name has to be typed, if correct, then go to the next step, if incorrect, then say 'you are not permitted to get in'.Secondly, you have to type your agent number, which is 007 or 070.if you type it incorrectly, the computer will ask you to type again, else, go to the next step. Thirdly, you have to type your password(secret), if you type it incorrectly, you will have 5 more seconds to type the correct one(actually i want to add a timer which count 5 seconds and after that a message say"Time over" will print out)&lt;-but i dont know how to do that while the user is type the password.</p>
<pre><code>import time

Agent_one = "Fong Ching Hin"
Agent_two = "Leo seven"
Agent_one_number = "007"
Agent_two_number = "070"
secret = "2180000"


name = input("What's is your name: ")
if name == Agent_one or name == Agent_two:
    number = input("PLease enter your number: ")
else:
    print("You are not permitted to get in")

    if number == Agent_one_number or Agent_two_number:
        password = input("PLease enter the secret \n&gt;&gt;&gt;")
    else:
        print("Your number is incorrect, please make sure you type it right")
        if password == secret:
            print("Welcome", name, "number", number, "you have been permitted to get into the 51 space")
        else:
            print("The answer is wrong, you have five more seconds to enter it")
            password = input("PLease enter the secret \n&gt;&gt;&gt;")

<p>Use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.sleep" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>time.sleep(seconds)</code></a></p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>import time
print("Counting to 5 seconds...")
time.sleep(5)
print("Time over buddy")
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Side note: <code>if number == Agent_one_number or Agent_two_number</code> will not do what you probably think it does. You probably want <code>if number in ( Agent_one_number,  Agent_two_number)</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>time.sleep()</code> should help you achieve the 5 second timer.</span>
