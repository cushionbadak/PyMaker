<p>I have enabled logging to python code.</p>
<pre><code>logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s %(levelname)s : %(message)s')


logging.info('Log this message')
</code></pre>
<p>However I am not able to use any of other logging methods. Other methods don't print anything.</p>
<pre><code>logging.debug('This is to debug only')
</code></pre>
<p>Is this related to <code>level=logging.INFO</code> ? Which level should i set so it could work with all logging methods?</p>
<p>Thanks for help.</p>

<p>The whole point of <code>logging.DEBUG</code> level is so that your, or any code you use, can log debug messages - if you don't want debug messages set your level to something higher.</p>
<p>If you still want to print debug messages but want to suppress messages from some of the modules you're using, like the <code>requests</code> and <code>urllib3</code>, set the level of their loggers to something higher than <code>logging.DEBUG</code>, e.g.:</p>
<pre><code>logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG, format='%(asctime)s %(levelname)s : %(message)s')
logging.getLogger("requests").setLevel(logging.WARNING)
logging.getLogger("urllib3").setLevel(logging.WARNING)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You should use <code>level=logging.DEBUG</code> to log everything.</p>
<p>But <code>logging.error</code> should print the error message even with <code>level=logging.INFO</code></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The python logging module have multiple level of configuration</p>
<ul>
<li>DEBUG</li>
<li>INFO</li>
<li>WARNING</li>
<li>ERROR</li>
<li>CRITICAL</li>
</ul>
<p>This logs that will be shown are in the sorted order shown above depending on what level you choose. It will show the selected stage and any other stage "levelled above" the selected stage.</p>
<p>For example, if you choose INFO, the logs will show for all INFO/WARNING/ERROR logs except DEBUG.</p>
<p>This helps in the way that you can sort them by environment variables according to the environment you are currently in, such as you can set it to DEBUG when you are in Development mode, and then set it to WARNING when you are in Production mode.</p>
<p>You can read more about it in the link below</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python Logging Module</a></p>
<p>And finally, to give a concrete answer to your question. You should set it to DEBUG to see all the logs.</p>
<p>Hopefully this gives you a better idea on what the python logging module is for!</p>
<p>Cheers!

<blockquote>
<p><strong>DEBUG</strong> Detailed information, typically of interest only when diagnosing problems.</p>
<p><strong>INFO</strong> Confirmation that things are working as expected.</p>
<p><strong>WARNING</strong>   An indication that something unexpected happened, or indicative of some problem in the near future (e.g. ‘disk space low’).
  The software is still working as expected.</p>
<p><strong>ERROR</strong> Due to a more serious problem, the software has not been able to perform some function.</p>
<p><strong>CRITICAL</strong>  A serious error, indicating that the program itself may be unable to continue running.</p>
<p>The default level is WARNING, which means that only events of this
  level and above will be tracked, unless the logging package is
  configured to do otherwise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>when you set you level to info you must get <code>info</code>,<code>warning</code>,<code>error</code> and <code>critical</code> logs</p>
<p>If you want to log all of level set your level to <code>logging.DEBUG</code></p>

<span class="comment-copy">Are you sure your <code>logging.error</code> doesn't print anything?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@zwer logging.debug doesn't print anything.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">that's because your logging level in the <code>logging.basicConfig()</code> call is set to <code>logging.INFO</code> - switch it to <code>logging.DEBUG</code> to use 'lower' levels of logging.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@zwer If i do that,  It prints everything in debug format.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@zwer setting  <code>logging.debug</code> enables debugging for <code>requests</code> and <code>urllib3</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks a lot @zwer</span>
<span class="comment-copy">loggin.error works but not <code>logging.debug</code>.  If i set level at <code>logging.DEBUG</code> it prints debugged version of everything.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">setting  <code>logging.debug</code> enables debugging for <code>requests</code> and <code>urllib3</code></span>
