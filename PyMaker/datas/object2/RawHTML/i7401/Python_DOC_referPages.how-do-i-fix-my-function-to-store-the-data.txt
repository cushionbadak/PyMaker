<p>My function runs URLcrazy and I figured out it is not storing the output into any variables and I cannot figure it out. The tmp variable shown is not storing the output into that list. How I can fix this to store the data executed. </p>
<pre><code>def run_urlcrazy():
   tmp = []
    for domain in grab_domains():
      np = os.system("urlcrazy " + domain)
      tmp.append(np)
   return tmp
</code></pre>
<p>I am trying to get the output of URLcrazy ran against all the domains in the loop and be able to slice the ouptut. I think the way URLcrazy is outputting data I am unable to format the data in another function. Which I need to be able to do in order to store information in a database. </p>

<p><code>os.system</code> does <em>not</em> return the output of the command executed, only the exit code (signals success or error).</p>
<p>I believe you want <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.Popen" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>subprocess.Popen</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>import subprocess

def run_urlcrazy():
    tmp = []
    for domain in grab_domains():
        proc = subprocess.Popen(["urlcrazy", domain], stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
        (out, err) = proc.communicate()
        tmp.append(out)
   return tmp
</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively, you can use <code>subprocess.check_output</code> if you just want the output and are not interested in checking for errors:</p>
<pre><code>out = subprocess.check_output(['urlcrazy', domain])
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Are you sure that <code>grab_domains()</code> has any elements?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The return value of <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/os.html#os.system" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>os.system</code></a> is the process <i>return code</i>, not the process <i>output</i>. To capture output <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/923079/how-can-i-capture-the-stdout-output-of-a-child-process">see this question</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This seems the correct route, but it is not running urlcrazy with domain as the arguement anymore. what do you think could be the problem?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@jakethesnake I believe the issue was that the first arg should not be a list when shell is set to True. I have edited my answer. It should work now.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@COLDSPEED Hmmmm that cleared up the errors but it still is not running urlcrazy anymore with domain as arg.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@jakethesnake Try <code>out = subprocess.check_output(['urlcrazy', domain])</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">That didnt not work either, I have urlcrazy in the same folder as my scripts. I don't get why it is not working. I appreciate your help!</span>
