<p>I have worked through a number of other threads on this, but not of their solutions seem to work here, that or I am not understanding properly, and would love your help. </p>
<p>I am getting a:</p>
<pre><code>IOError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: 'W:\\test\\Temporary Folder 195\\Sub-fold1 
</code></pre>
<p>This is the general code i started with.</p>
<pre><code>    summary_file = r'W:/test/SDC Analysis Summary.docm'
    shutil.copyfile(summary_file, os.getcwd())
</code></pre>
<p>I have also varied this a little bit based on other threads, specifically replacing summary_file with the actual text and also adding \ to the end of working directory without success. Really don't know what I'm missing here. I know that the Documentation is looking for complete paths, but I believe I am satisfying that requirement. What am I missing here? </p>
<p>Note: there is a desire to use copyfile over copy due to the speed increase. </p>

<p>From the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation</a>:</p>
<pre><code> dst must be the complete target file name
</code></pre>
<p>You can't just use <code>os.getcwd()</code> as the destination.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>you should be the complete target file name for destination</p>
<p>destination = pathdirectory + filename.* </p>
<p>I use this code fir copy wav file with shutil :</p>
<pre><code>    # open file with QFileDialog

    browse_file = QFileDialog.getOpenFileName(None, 'Open file', 'c:', "wav files (*.wav)")

    # get file name 

    base = os.path.basename(browse_file[0])
    os.path.splitext(base)
    print(os.path.splitext(base)[1])

    # make destination path with file name

    destination= "test/" + os.path.splitext(base)[0] + os.path.splitext(base)[1]
    shutil.copyfile(browse_file[0], destination)
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">why not, doesnt os.getcwd() get the complete target file path&gt;?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@WolVes: The docs don't say <i>target file PATH</i>. They say <i>target file NAME</i>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It's a directory name.  You need to give the filename as well: <code>os.path.join(os.getcwd(), "SDC Analysis Summary.docm")</code>, for example.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">O.o gotcha. Thanks Eduffy!</span>
