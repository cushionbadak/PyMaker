<p>As the title suggests, I'd like to pass a byte array from c++ to python. I understand I would need to convert my byte array into a PyObject somehow but this is where I got stuck. Is there anyone who can help me out with this.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance, </p>

<span class="comment-copy">I'm using an opencv matrix to byte conversion like this  &lt;br/&gt;std::memcpy(bytes,image.data,size * sizeof(byte));  so this is not a string. How do I use it with PyBytes_FromString?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@las <code>*_FromString</code> functions take <code>const char*</code> as arg. You say that you have a byte array. So I assume that's exactly what it is. It's a bit confusing but strings and byte arrays meant the same thing back in days. If you allow nulls in your sequence of bytes then <code>*_FromStringAndSize</code> might be a better choice.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Anyway I don't know opencv but if you have anything else then first you have to find a way to convert it to <code>char*</code>.</span>
