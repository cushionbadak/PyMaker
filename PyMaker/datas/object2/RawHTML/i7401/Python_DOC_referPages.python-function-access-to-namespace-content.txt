<p>I have two statements:
1) "In the variable explorer, the namespace content (all global object references)  of the current console can be seen.
A function can access all variables in the namespace content, without explicitly passing them as function arguments." </p>
<p>2) "Usually, only the arguments passed to the function are in your environment.
Variables not passed as arguments are not necessarily available."</p>
<p>Is one of them correct or can somebody explain, to which objects Python functions DO have access? Thanks!</p>

<p>Functions have access to <code>__builtins__</code>, globals (which is actually scoped in the module), and locals which includes arguments.</p>

<p>I'd say this is pretty much correct, although lacking.</p>
<p>It is correct when it says a function has accesses to all of the programs global names. If Python cannot find a name used in the current local scope, it assumes the name is global and will attempt to retrieve its value from there. </p>
<p>However, one point the above definition does not mention is builtin names. They are always accessible at any point in the program anywhere.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Usually, only the arguments passed to the function are in your environment. Variables not passed as arguments are not necessarily available.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'd disagree with the claim made that only variables passed in as arguments are part of the functions local scope (a.k.a environment). If a variable is not declared global using the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#grammar-token-global_stmt" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>global</code></a> or <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#nonlocal" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>nonlocal</code></a> statements, any variable created in a functions local scope belongs to that scope and can be accessed throughout that scope.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for this. Can you maybe elaborate what is a functions local scope in Python?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Sylvi0202 A functions local scope is any name defined inside of the functions indented definition block.</span>
