<p>I was doing a quick test on the "if" statement and the following code fragment results in the print producing output as expected.</p>
<p><strong>Case 1</strong></p>
<pre><code>x = True
if x:
    print("Roses are red")
</code></pre>
<p>Results in &gt;&gt;&gt; Roses are red, in the interpreter</p>
<p>Also: </p>
<pre><code>type(x)
&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;class 'bool'&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>As expected.</p>
<p>Then I tried:</p>
<p><strong>Case 2</strong></p>
<pre><code>x = "True"
if x:
    print("Roses are red")
</code></pre>
<p>Again I got the result: Roses are red</p>
<p>and :</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; type(x)
&lt;class 'str'&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Can someone explain in the second case why the "if condition is satisfied" (if that is an appropriate way to describe the situation) and the print() is executed?</p>
<p>I would have thought the correct operation would be something like</p>
<pre><code>if &lt;expression&gt;:
    &lt;do this&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>where "do this" is executed <strong>only</strong> when "expression" evaluates to the <strong>Boolean</strong> value True. Why is "do this" executed when "expression" is a <strong>string</strong>?</p>

<p>The string "True" is <a href="https://docs.python.org/2.4/lib/truth.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">truthy</a> meaning that it evaluates to true in your if condition. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">Thank you for the incredibly speedy responses and references. I understand.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Balanced unnecessary downvote. The question has to be closed as a duplicate, <i>but</i> 1) it is not trivial to search for a similar question if you don't quite know what you are looking for; 2) I think the OP - which is a newcomer in the SO community as well as in the Python community, I suppose - didn't write an appalling question and doesn't quite deserve to get a -1 with no explanation.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@gd1. Thanks. No worries. I will live.</span>
