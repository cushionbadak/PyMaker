<p>So I am outputting a CSV using Python and Pandas, based on a certain criteria I have. Once building the the CSV file, I'd like to run a command that has Python open the CSV file in Excel. </p>
<p>Would something like this people possible?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you know the location of your Excel executable:</p>
<pre><code>import subprocess

subprocess.call(("path/to/Excel.exe", "path/to/your.csv"))
</code></pre>
<p>If you don't know the location (but Excel is set as default app for <code>.csv</code> files) it depends on the OS you're using, but since you want Excel I assume it's either Windows or OSX:</p>
<pre><code>import os
import subprocess

if os.name == "nt":
    os.startfile("path/to/your.csv")
else:
    subprocess.call(("open", "path/to/your.csv"))
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">It is, provided that Excel is set as the default application to open <code>.csv</code> files on the system or you know the location of Excel executable.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Say I know both of those things, how would I then go about doing this?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.call" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>subprocess.call()</code></a> to call either the Excel executable, passing it an absolute path to your CSV file, or call your OS's default command to open a file with a known extension.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Any chance you could show me the code for that.. Sort of a newb.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>subprocess.call("path_of_excel_exe")</code></span>
