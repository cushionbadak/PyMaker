<p>I have two two csvs with many columns in each.  I am looping through the rows in each and would like to combine the rows as i go into a third csv that has the columns of both. so far this is the only way i can do it:</p>
<pre><code>ee = csv.reader(open("ab.csv"), delimiter=",")
cc = csv.reader(open("cd.csv"), delimiter=",")

ofilePosts = open('complete.csv', 'ab')
writerPosts = csv.writer(ofilePosts, delimiter=',')

for e in ee:
    for c in cc:
         complete.writerow(e[0], e[1], e[2]...................
</code></pre>
<p>This takes along time to manually write out e[x] for the number of rows in x. </p>
<p>How can i just do something like this without getting a run time crash:</p>
<pre><code>complete.writerow([e+c])
</code></pre>

<p>Use <code>pandas</code>, marge them by index so the missing rows from the file with fewer records will be filled by NA.</p>
<pre><code>import pandas as pd
ee = pd.read_csv('ab.csv')
cc = pd.read_csv('cd.csv')

merged = pd.concat([ee, cc], axis=1) # merge by index
merged.to_csv('complete.csv') # to dump to a csv
print merged
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Read the data from file1 and file2 into a <code>list</code> and then append them like so:</p>
<pre><code>l =["row1","row2"] #list1
ll = ["row1","row2"] #list2

a = [[l[x],ll[x]] for x in range(len(l))]

print(a) # [['row1', 'row1'], ['row2', 'row2']]
</code></pre>
<p>This will only work properly if number of rows is same.</p>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>getting a run time crash</code> : please elaborate.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Nested loops is the wrong way to go. You want to read a line from each file; concatenate those two lines; write the result to the new file.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Please include an <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve">Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Use <code>csv DictReader/DictWriter</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">sadly, the two csvs being read from have different numbers of rows. any ideas?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">what should happen to the rows when you are appending it then?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@majorcoder you can append till the size of the smaller file using that code and then run another loop to add the remaining lines.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">well they should jjust have a column for every of the columns in each of the inputs. so if input csv1 has 5 columns and inputs csv2 has 9 columns then the output csv3 should have 14 columns</span>
<span class="comment-copy">that is what this will do but lets say file1 has 10 rows and file2 has 20 rows, you will have 9 columns but how many columns in the output file?</span>
