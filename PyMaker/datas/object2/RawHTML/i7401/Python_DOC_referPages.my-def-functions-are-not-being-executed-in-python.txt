<p>The loop runs but the def functions are not being executed. Can someone tell me where is my mistake? I try to fix the indentation many times but apparently that's not the error...
Thank you in advance for the help.</p>

<p>You have to define the functions first, and call them in the while loop, like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Edit</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I made an edit correcting all the errors you have, I will explain step by step:</p>
<p>First, is not necessary at all the creation of all that methods, if you create them in order to practice, it's ok, but if you don't return the data, it get loss in the cider space :D:</p>
<pre><code>def student_height():
  return float(input("Please enter student's height in inches:")) #here you return the data

def student_weight():

  return float(input("Please enter student's weight in pounds:")) #float is used to say the type of the input, because it came as a string

def bmi_profile(name, height, weight):
  print(name, "'s BMI profile:")
  print("Height:", height, '"')
  print("Weight:", weight, "lbs.")

def bmi_index(height, weight):
  bmi = float(weight * 703 / height ** 2)
  print("BMI Index: " + str(bmi))
  return bmi


print("Welcome to the BMI Index Calculator.")    
student_name = " "    
while student_name != "0":    
  student_name = input("Please begin by entering the student's name, or 0 to quit:")
  if student_name == "0":
    print("Exiting program...")
    break

  height = student_height() #here you store the data in a variable
  weight = student_weight()
  bmi_profile(student_name, height, weight) #here you use the data stored before
  bmi_index(height, weight) #here also
</code></pre>
<p>A shorter answer:</p>
<p>This only two has sense... to make it a little readable</p>
<pre><code>def bmi_profile(name, height, weight):
  print(name, "'s BMI profile:")
  print("Height:", height, '"')
  print("Weight:", weight, "lbs.")

  print("BMI Index: " + str(bmi))

while student_name != "0":    
  student_name = input("Please begin by entering the student's name, or 0 to quit:")

<span class="comment-copy"><code>def</code> DEFINES functions.  At no point are you actually calling them!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You're confused in how things work. Your functions are getting defined but you never call them. I'd suggest taking a tour of the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python Tutorial</a> for a nice introduction.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What kind of error are you getting? It seems you want to use functions instead of create them like you are doing. Create all your functions before and put your code inside a main function.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This still raises errors due to <code>student_weight</code> and <code>student_height</code> not returning anything and the fact that they are being used as variable names. The question has many issues, either address them all or vote to close.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Your example is still incorrect. You are correctly calling the functions, but you aren't storing the results of the inputs in variables to operate on them later.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@reticentroot okey you convinced me, I updated the answer, I think you are right</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@JimFasarakisHilliard that's true, providing an answer with more error, it's worse, that's why I edited the answer, thanks for the feed back</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@JimFasarakisHilliard Thanks :)</span>
