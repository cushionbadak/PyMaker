<p>I am opening a volume in Windows, like this:</p>

I've tried:
<code>os.sta</code>t, <code>os.path.getsize</code>, <code>seek/tell</code>
nothing works, says invalid parameter or argument.</p>

class FolderSize:
    """
    This class implements an efficient technique for
    retrieving the size of a given folder or volume in
    cases where some action is needed based on a given
    size.

    The implementation is designed to handle situations
    where a specific size is desired to watch for,
    in addition to a total size, before a subsequent
    action is taken. This dramatically improves
    performance where only a small number of bytes
    are sufficient to call off a search instead of
    waiting for the entire size.

    In addition, the design is set to handle problems
    encountered at points during the search, such as
    permission errors. Such errors are captured so that
    a user could further investigate the problem and why
    it occurred. These errors do not stop the search from
    completing; the total size returned is still provided,
    minus the size from folders with errors.

    When calling a new search, the errors and total size
    from the previous search are reset; however, the stop
    size persists unless changed.
