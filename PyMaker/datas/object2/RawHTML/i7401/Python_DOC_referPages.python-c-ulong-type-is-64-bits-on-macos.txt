<p>It seems that on macOS Python's <code>c_ulong</code> type is 64 bits, instead of the 32 bits that it would be on Windows. From what I've found in my google search, based on this post: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3323778/is-pythons-ctypes-c-long-64-bit-on-64-bit-systems">Is Python's ctypes.c_long 64 bit on 64 bit systems?</a></p>
<p>It looks like it's because of macOS's memory model. Is there any fix for this?</p>

<p>Just like if you are writing C, if you know that you specifically need a 32 bit unsigned integer, you shouldn't use <code>c_ulong</code> but instead <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html#ctypes.c_uint32" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>ctypes.c_uint32</code></a>. This way you can ensure it will be 32 bits no matter the platform you are on.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Define fix. Do you mean you want it to be 32 bits instead? What's wrong with 64 bits?</span>
