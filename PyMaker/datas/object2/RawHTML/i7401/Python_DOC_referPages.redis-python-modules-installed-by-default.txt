<p>Is there a way to determine which Redis Python modules are installed by default? I do not have a Redis installation, but would like to know for planning purposes.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>None of the Redis client modules are part of the Python standard library. </p>
<p>To work with Redis, you will need to install a client module, I recommend redis-py, using your preferred package manager.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Thank you Tague . Do you know where something about which libraries are installed by default is written or is the best way to just install Redis?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Take a look at the Redis documentation on StackOverflow for the section on working with Python, it should get you started. (<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/documentation/redis/9103/connecting-to-redis-using-python#t=201707172214509908715">stackoverflow.com/documentation/redis/9103/â€¦</a>).  The Python tutorial (<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/index.html</a>) should give you information on what libraries are included in the standard library.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Tague, I have installed Redis. Do you happen to know if there is a command I can run to see which libraries are installed on the server?</span>
