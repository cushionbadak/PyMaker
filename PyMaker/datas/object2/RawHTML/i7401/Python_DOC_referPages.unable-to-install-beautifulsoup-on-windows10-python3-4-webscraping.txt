<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have researched this whole website on how to install beautiful soup. I have installed selenium</p>
<p><img alt="selenium scrnshot" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/v5ftO.png"/></p>
<p>I am currently trying to pull jobs which use Python, also to include the details of the job like location, i,e; job title, salary(if posted), etc.. off the internet as a final in a html table. Dont chew me up completely.. give me a little break, I am learning as I go. </p>
<p>I understand I need to seperate the paragraphs by <p>, but how to go about it, is where I am getting stuck. This is what I have so far.</p>
<pre><code>import parser
import urllib.request
import html.entities
import selenium
import re

sauce = urllib.request.urlopen('http://Indeed.com/').read()
tb = re.find_all('&lt;p&gt;')
print(sauce)
</code></pre>
<p>I get this as an error:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Traceback (most recent call last):   File "C:/Devel/BSoup4.py", line
  8, in 
      table = re.find_all('<p>') AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'find_all'</p>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Please help. Thank you in advance! </p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Per the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs</a></p>
<p>syntax is <code>re.findall()</code> not <code>find_all</code></p>

<span class="comment-copy">why arent you using bs4 findall method</span>
<span class="comment-copy">When i use bs4, it gives me an error, no module named 'bs4'. Any ideas of how to fix this?? Thank you for the help!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">you need to install bs4. You can do that through your interpreter sometimes or through <code>pip</code>  Just google pip usage and you will find a ton</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you! I have downloaded bs4, and I am still sifting through how to use the pip through either the shell, idle, or cmd</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>pip</code> works well should be pretty straight forward. If you are still having problems try using PyCharm IDE. You can install modules through the gui and it is really easy. When installing bs4 take note of where your interpreter is and ensure that you are installing and using pip from them same location</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you! Feedback is awesome!</span>
