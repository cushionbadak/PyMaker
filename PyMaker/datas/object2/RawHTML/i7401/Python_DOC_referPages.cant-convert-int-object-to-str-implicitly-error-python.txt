<p>I am trying to test if the decimal representation of a certain number contains the digit 9 at least twice, so I decided to do something like that:</p>
<pre><code>i=98759102
string=str(i)
if '9' in string.replace(9, '', 1): print("y")
else: print("n")
</code></pre>
<p>But Python always responds with "TypeError: Can't convert 'int' object to str implicitly". </p>
<p>What am I doing wrong here? Is there actually a smarter method to detect how often a certain digit is contained in the decimal representation of an integer?</p>

<p>Your problem is here:</p>
<pre><code>string.replace(9, '', 1)
</code></pre>
<p>You need to make <code>9</code> a string literal, rather than an integer:</p>
<pre><code>string.replace('9', '', 1)
</code></pre>
<p>As for a better way to count the occurrences of <code>9</code> in your string, use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=str#str.count" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>str.count()</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; i = 98759102
&gt;&gt;&gt; string = str(i)
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; if string.count('9') &gt; 2:
    print('yes')
else:
    print('no')


no
&gt;&gt;&gt;

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You need quotes around the nine.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>string.replace('9', '', 1)</code> (note the single quotes around 9). Also, there is: <code>string.count('9')</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>str(i).count('9') &gt; 1</code></span>
