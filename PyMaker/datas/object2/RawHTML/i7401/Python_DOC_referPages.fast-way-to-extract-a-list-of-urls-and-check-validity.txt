<p>I am working on a chat bot. I want it to post matching data from an API whenever a link to a gallery on an imageboard is posted. The gallery link looks like this </p>
<pre><code>https://example.com/a/1234/a6fb1049/
</code></pre>
<p>where 1234 is a positive number (id) and a6fb1049 is a hexadecimal String of fixed length 10 (token).
Right now I am only able to process messages starting with a gallery link.</p>
<pre><code>if message_object.content.startswith("https://example.com/a/"):
</code></pre>
<p>I am looking for a fast way to process the message string, because every time a message is sent this will be invoked.</p>
<pre><code>if message_object.content.startswith("https://example.org/a/"):

        temp = message_object.content.split("/")

        # Check if link is actually a valid link
        if temp[2] == "example.org" and temp[3] == "a" and 0 &lt; int(temp[4]) and len(temp[5]) == 10:
            gallery_id = temp[4]
            gallery_token = temp[5]

            response = requests.post(url, payload, json_request_headers)
</code></pre>
<p>I thought about using urllib.parse.urlparse and posixpath.split to split the string and checking the different substrings, but I feel like this is inefficient.</p>
<p>Because I am really not good with Regex, this is all I came up with.</p>
<pre><code>searchObj = re.search( r'https://example.org/a/(.*)/(.*)/', message)
</code></pre>
<p>It's fine if there is just one matching pattern, and it's right, but as soon as there are two links this is already failing.</p>
<p>I would rather get all of the messages matching links in a list then iterate over the list and check the header of the page if the link is valid. Then create an API request to retrieve the data.</p>
<p>The regular expressions to match URLs on Stackoverflow don't show how you only match such specific cases, so I am sorry if this is a newb question.</p>

<p>I don't understand why you wrote: <code>https://example.org/a/(.*)/(.*)/</code> when at the same time you precisely know that <em>"1234 is a positive number (id) and a6fb1049 is a hexadecimal String of fixed length 10"</em> <em>(&lt;= or perhaps 8)</em>. Translating this sentence into a pattern is very easy and needs only simple notions:</p>
<pre><code>re.findall(r'(https://example.org/a/([0-9]+)/([0-9a-f]{10})/)', message)
</code></pre>
<p><code>re.findall</code> is the method to get several results <em>(<code>re.search</code> returns only the first result, see the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">re module manual</a>)</em></p>
<p>You obtain a list of lists where each item contains matched parts enclosed by round brackets (capture groups), feel free to put them where you want.</p>
<p>If you want to know if there are links that don't match the format you want, you can also use something like this:</p>
<pre><code>re.findall(r'(https://example.org/a/(?:([0-9]+)/([0-9a-f]{10})/)|.*)', message)
</code></pre>
<p>Then you only have to test is the group 2 is None or not to know if a link has the good format.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">"I would rather get all of the messages matching links in a list then iterate over the list" - sounds like you need <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html#re.findall" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>re.findall</code></a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">thank you, this is exactly what i was looking for</span>
