<p>Assume you have tow dictionary A and B:</p>
<pre><code>A = {'a':[5, 3], 't':[4], 'd':[2, 5, 6]}
B = {'s':[11,5], 'a':[4,6], 'd':[0, 6, 3]}
</code></pre>
<p>How can you get differences between A and B values in new dictionary? 
Difference meaning A - B =&gt; for example for 'a' key is  [5, 3] - [4,6] result is [1, -3]</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I assume you mean <code>A - B</code> and only on <code>key</code>s that exist in both. These are a lot of assumptions but your question is a bit vague..</p>
<p>How about this:</p>
<pre><code>A = {'a':[5, 3], 't':[4], 'd':[2, 5, 6]}
B = {'s':[11,5], 'a':[4,6], 'd':[0, 3]}

C = {k: [x - y for x, y in zip(v, B[k])] for k, v in A.items() if k in B}
print(C)  # {'d': [2, 2], 'a': [1, -3]}
</code></pre>
<p>If you do not care whether the <code>key</code>s exist in both and want to simply "subtract" <code>B</code> go with <code>.get()</code> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.zip_longest" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>zip_longest</code> from <code>itertools</code></a> with a default parameter of <code>0</code> like so:</p>
<pre><code>from itertools import zip_longest
C = {k: [x - y for x, y in zip_longest(v, B.get(k, []), fillvalue=0)] for k, v in A.items()}
print(C)  # {'a': [1, -3], 'd': [2, 2, 6], 't': [4]}
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>How about this? it adds any values in B missing from A and if the key is not missing it subtracts the sum of the value in B from the sum of the value in A:</p>
<pre><code>A = {'a':[5, 3], 't':[4], 'd':[2, 5, 6]}
B = {'s':[11,5], 'a':[4,6], 'd':[0, 3]}

def merge_and_differences(d1,d2):
    d3 = d1.copy()
    for k,v in d2.items():
        if k not in d3:
            d3[k] = v
        else:
            d3[k] = sum(d3[k]) - sum(d2[k])
    return d3

C = merge_and_differences(A,B)

print (C)
</code></pre>
<p>results:</p>
<pre><code>{'a': -2, 's': [11, 5], 't': [4], 'd': 10}
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Define "difference". Is it wrt A or wrt B? Also, the keys aren't even the same between the two.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">keys difference you want? or value dif?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I think an example of your desired result is needed.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sorry, I edited my question.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Should've waited for a clarification from OP before posting, this question deserves to be closed as it is.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@cᴏʟᴅsᴘᴇᴇᴅ You are right, I regretted posting this. Should I delete?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Mm, it's not really my place to say, though I would suggest you did so (save yourself from any dv'ers), and then undelete once OP clarifies you've done what they want...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hi @ Ev. Kounis, Thanks for your help. Sorry my weak explain for question.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hi @ cᴏʟᴅsᴘᴇᴇᴅ Thanks for your guide.</span>
