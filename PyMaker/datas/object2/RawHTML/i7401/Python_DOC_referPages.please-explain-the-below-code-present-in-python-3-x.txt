<p>I am a beginner in Python and cannot understand the below code. Somebody please explain the execution flow.</p>
<p>The Question is to enter a number 'N' and calculate N+NN+NNN.</p>
<pre><code>  a = int(input("Input an integer : ")) 
  n1 = int( "%s" % a )
  n2 = int( "%s%s" % (a,a) )
  n3 = int( "%s%s%s" % (a,a,a) )
  print (n1+n2+n3)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>It simply does the task of the question- <strong>TO ENTER A NUMBER 'N' AND CALCULATE 'N+NN+NNN</strong><br/>
So first line it stores the input number in a variable 'a'.<br/>
Then in next line it simply passes the value of a as an integer to n1.<br/>
In the next line(as the question wants NN of the input number N)it just uses %s token to insert it as a string so a now becomes aa then it converts it to integer by using the int() method. Same goes with line 3.<br/>
Then the print line just prints the sum of the three values n1,n2 and n3.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Your code does the following.</p>
<pre><code>a = int(input("Input an integer : ")) 
  n1 = int( "%s" % a )
  n2 = int( "%s%s" % (a,a) )
  n3 = int( "%s%s%s" % (a,a,a) )
  print (n1+n2+n3)
</code></pre>
<p>Line 1 -  It displays 'Input the integer:" and stores the input in variable a.<br/>
Line 2 -  n1 stores the value of variable a.<br/>
Line 3-   n2 stores the value of variable 'aa' as integer.<br/>
Line 4 -  n3 stores the value of variable 'aaa' as integer.<br/>
Line 5 -  It adds the values present in n1, n2, n3 and prints it.  </p>
<p>Here %s is the formatting string which is replaced by the value present at the end after % sign. For more details on this, visit <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/997797/what-does-s-mean-in-python" title="here">here</a> </p>

<pre><code>a = int(input("Input an integer : ")) # takes integer as input and stores it as integer in variable a # consider input as 7
n1 = int( "%s" % a ) # when "%s" will give you result "7" and it is stored in n1 as integer 7 because int() is used as int("7")
n2 = int( "%s%s" % (a,a) ) # similarly when %s is written twice it requires two numbers in this case it is same hence you will get "77" to converted to integer and stored in n2
n3 = int( "%s%s%s" % (a,a,a) ) # just like n2 number is used three times instead of two so you will get n3=777 in this case
print (n1+n2+n3) # as all values of n1,n2 and n3 are integer it can be added 7+77+777 and you will get result 861
</code></pre>
<p>You can achieve same with many approach below is another attempt to it:</p>
<pre><code>a = input("Input an integer : ") # gets any input but if you need validation you can try it using while loop and if condition or try block
aa = a+a # in python when two string are concatnated i.e. "71"+"71" result will be like "7171"
aaa = a+a+a # concatnated three string
print(int(a)+int(aa)+int(aaa)) # Note: if input won't be a number this will throw ValueError

<p>The code you're showing is a very clumsy way of doing the sum of numbers composed of 1 to 3 digits of a number.</p>
<p>Just for fun, with a generator comprehension fed to <code>sum</code>, and using string multiplication to generate a string composed of the same digit/number 1 to 3 times:</p>
<pre><code>a = input("Input an integer : ")  # python 2 would need raw_input or the result would be incorrect
print (sum(int(a*i) for i in range(1,4)))
</code></pre>
