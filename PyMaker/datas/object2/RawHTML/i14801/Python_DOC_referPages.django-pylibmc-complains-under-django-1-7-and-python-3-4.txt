<p>My environment:
Django 1.7
Python 3.2</p>
<p>As a disclaimer, I'm new to Django and Python.</p>
<p>I'm going through this <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/django-memcache#start-using-memcache" rel="nofollow">doc</a> in order to use Memcachier with Django. </p>
<p>The installion process didn't give me any errors, but when I fire up my tests with <code>./manage.py tests</code> I get the following error: </p>

SyntaxError: invalid syntax

<p>I'm looking at the python 3.x <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html" rel="nofollow">docs for errors</a> and it <em>seems</em> that line 92 of that file is indeed not valid syntax, but I'm not sure. </p>
<p>Can anyone suggest a possible fix? </p>

<p>That library does not appear to be compatible with Python 3.</p>
<p>However, as Amir suggests, there is no need to use it anyway; Django comes with a pylibmc backend, as described in <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/topics/cache/#memcached" rel="nofollow">the documentation</a>. </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I know you are following the Heroku docs which suggest using django-pylibmc, but Django supports Pylibmc out of the box with <code>django.core.cache.backends.memcached.PyLibMCCache</code>. Since these are just python wrappers over the pylibmc C libraries there should be really no reason to go with django-pylibmc.</p>
<p>Also if you look at the README (<a href="https://github.com/jbalogh/django-pylibmc#requirements" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/jbalogh/django-pylibmc#requirements</a>) for django-pylibmc it states that it was written and tested with Python 2.7, so the use of Python 3 is also problematic here.</p>
<p>I applaud your efforts for using Python 3 with Django, but please make sure that all your third party apps are compatible and I highly recommend reading this from the Django docs: <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/topics/python3/" rel="nofollow">https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/topics/python3/</a></p>

<span class="comment-copy">Any reason why you are using django-pylibmc? Django comes with a pylibmc backend: <code>django.core.cache.backends.memcached.PyLibMCCache</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Also have you installed <code>libmemcached-dev</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@AmirR. yes, I installed libmemcached-dev. I am using following this <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/django-memcache#start-using-memcache" rel="nofollow noreferrer">doc</a> which suggested installing <code>django-pylibmc</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">would that pylibmc backend work with the Memcachier Heroku addon?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@rexposadas Memcachier is just hosted memcached instances so unless they have some special API, any decent memcached client, pylibmc included, should work.</span>
