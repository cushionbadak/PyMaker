<p>I have a file name that I want to pass to a program or a bash script. For example if it's <code>my car's picture.jpg</code>, I have to change it to  <code>my\ car\'s picture.jpg</code> to pass it to os.system like <code>show my\ car\'s picture.jpg</code>. Is there a function to do it the backslashes automatically?</p>

<p>You should use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/subprocess.html" rel="nofollow"><code>subprocess</code></a> module to call shell scripts from Python. Then you don't have to worry about escaping things yourself.</p>
<pre><code>import subprocess
subprocess.call(['script_name', "my car's picture.jpg"])
</code></pre>
<p><code>subprocess.call()</code> will escape everything correctly for you. If you need to read the output of the shell script, use <code>subprocess.check_output()</code> instead.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can simply pass as is and use <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/subprocess.html" rel="nofollow">subprocess</a>, <code>os.system</code> is depreciated.</p>
<pre><code>c = check_output(["file","/home/padraic/Pictures/my cars' picture.png"])
print(c)
b"/home/padraic/Pictures/my cars' picture.png: PNG image data, 1366 x 768, 8-bit/color RGB, non-interlaced\n"
</code></pre>
<p>To call a script use <code>check_call</code>, if you want to pipe you can use <code>Popen</code>, there are lots of example in the docs linked above including <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/subprocess.html#replacing-os-system" rel="nofollow">replacing-os-system</a>.</p>

<p>I can offer several incomplete suggestions that could be helpful to you.</p>
<p>Use <code>"my car's picture.jpg"</code> -- double quotes escape single ones</p>
<p>Using spaces in a UNIX file system generates only headaches.  You could pass the filename inside of double-quotes.  </p>
<pre><code>os.system('cp "my car\'s picture" myCarPicture.jpg')
</code></pre>
<p>If you are using filenames with backslashes in a Windows system, use raw string</p>
<p><code>r"C:\Foo\bah\baz.jpg"</code></p>

<span class="comment-copy">What version of Python are you using?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">there's <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/pipes.html#pipes.quote" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>pipes.quote</code></a> / <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/shlex.html#shlex.quote" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>shlex.quote</code></a> -- neither will add backslashes like you want, but both will make the string safe to pass to <code>os.system</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I think the <i>depreciated</i> is actually <i>deprecated</i></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@BhargavRao, lol yes, watching two screens simultaneously is probably not  good for my grammar.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You could multithread both your eyes to work on different screens :P</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@BhargavRao, think it is time to call it a night and concentrate on the large flatscreen in the corner ;)</span>
