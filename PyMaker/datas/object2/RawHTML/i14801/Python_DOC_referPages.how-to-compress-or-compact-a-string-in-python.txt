<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I'm making a python "script" that sends a string to a webservice (in C#). I NEED to compress or compact this string, because the bandwidth and MBs data is LIMITED (yeah, in capitals because it's very limited).</p>
<p>I was thinking of converting it into a file and then compressing the file. But I'm looking for a method to directly compress the string.</p>
<p>How can I compress or compact the string?</p>

<p>How about <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/zlib.html" rel="noreferrer">zlib</a>?</p>
<pre><code>import zlib

a = "this string needs compressing"
a = zlib.compress(a)
print zlib.decompress(a) #outputs original contents of a
</code></pre>
<p>You can also use <code>sys.getsizeof(obj)</code> to see how much data an object takes up before and after compression. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">Will your web service understand your compressed string?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Selcuk That's the idea. My webservice will descompress the string and store it in a database. If is important, the web service is in C# (.NET)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Is there zlib avalaible in other lenguages? My web service is in C# (Sorry for not adding that information).</span>
