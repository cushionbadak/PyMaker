<p>So in python class we are going over files and exceptions but the professor didn't explain it thoroughly hence why I'm lost to what exactly it is that he wants me to do, I would appreciate any help please. I understand that he wants us to copy the table 2 example but not quite sure. Here is the question.</p>
<p>The file ALW.txt contains the information shown in Table 1. Write a program to use the file to produce a text file containing the information in Table 2, in which the baseball teams list W-L percentage, as well as the total percentage.</p>
<hr/>
<pre><code> Table 1:
ALW,W,L,W-L%
----------------
Oakland Athletics,96,66
----------------------
Texas Rangers,91,72
-------------------
Los Angeles,78,84
-------------------
Seattle Mariners,71,91
-----------------------
Houston Astros,51,111
---------------------------
</code></pre>
<p>Table 2:</p>
<pre><code>-----
**Team.........................................W L W-L%**
-----
Oakland Athletics....................96           66       0.593
--------
Texas Rangers.........................91           72       0.558
------
Los Angeles.............................78           84       0.481
--------
Seattle Mariners.......................71           91       0.438
--------
Houston Astros.......................51          111       0.315
--------
Total:........................................387          423       0.484 
</code></pre>
<p>so I came up with this code but I don't think I'm doing it right.</p>
<pre><code>fob= open("C:/Users/Manny/Documents/Chapter 5 Assignments/ALW.txt","r")
fob.readline()
print ("Total number of teams: 5 ")
print ("Teams")

Oakland_Athletics_win = 96
Texas_Rangers_win = 91
Los_Angeles_win = 78
Seattle_Mariners_win = 71
Houston_Astros_win = 51
Oakland_Athletics_lose = 66
Texas_Rangers_lose = 72
Los_Angeles_lose = 84
Seattle_Mariners_lose = 91
Houston_Astros_lose = 111
total_win = Oakland_Athletics_win + Texas_Rangers_win + Los_Angeles_win + Seattle_Mariners_win + Houston_Astros_win
total_lose = Oakland_Athletics_lose + Texas_Rangers_lose + Los_Angeles_lose + Seattle_Mariners_lose + Houston_Astros_lose
win_lose_ratio = (Oakland_Athletics_lose + Oakland_Athletics_win)
win_lose_ratio2 = Oakland_Athletics_win / win_lose_ratio
total_ratio = total_win + total_lose
total_ratio2 = total_win / total_ratio

for line in fob:
    x = line.split(",")
    x2 = win_lose_ratio2
    print ('\t','\t','\t','\t',"Wins",'\t',"Losses",'\t','\t',"Win-Lose%")
    print (x[0],'\t',x[1],'\t',x[2],'\t','\t',(x2)) 
print ("Total: ",'\t','\t',total_win,'\t',total_lose,'\t',total_ratio2)
</code></pre>

<p>He basically wants you to convert how the statistics are displayed from one file and copy it to a different file in a different format.</p>
<p>I'd suggest that you first read the first file line by line and then split the line with commas. Then the elements at each index of the returned array can be formatted and written to an out file in the format he wants you to.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You teacher wants you to parse the file and produce a similar result than table 2 has.</p>
<p>You will need to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>open the file</p></li>
<li><p>Go through each line until you find the first Team</p></li>
<li><p>Add the strings separated by commas in that line to a list </p></li>
<li><p>Calculate the percentages </p></li>
<li><p>Carry on till the end</p></li>
<li><p>Write everything in anew file</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It's a good exercise and Python is really good doing it</p>

<span class="comment-copy">you lost me when after you said to go through each line until I find the first team... so I opened the file but opened it line by line</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Well, yeah... You need to skip blank lines, if they exist, and that  "Table 1: ALW,W,L,W-L%"... :D</span>
