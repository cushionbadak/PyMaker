<p>The question might sound stupid but i think its pretty simple.</p>
<p>so i have a function called </p>
<pre><code>def print_location_summary(location_name):
and it dose its thing. and prints out a results.
</code></pre>
<p>i now have another function that ask user of input:</p>
<pre><code>def main():
"""Prompts for user to input a location name"""
location_name = input("Please enter location name:")  

(NEED A CODE HERE)

main()  
</code></pre>
<p><strong>how do i print out the results of the first function as the results of second function</strong></p>
<p>for example: </p>
<pre><code>def main():
"""Prompts for user to input a location name"""
location_name = input("Please enter location name:")  
print(def print_location_summary(location_name))

main() 
</code></pre>
<p>but that clealy won't work. please help :)
if you need more information please let me know.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I'm not 100% sure I understand your question. But instead of having a function that prints I would have the function just return the information you want to print. i.e </p>
<pre><code>def get_location_summary(location_name):
    output = "This is my output stored in a variable. My location is: " + location_name
    """ return the output to the caller """
    return output

def main():
    """Prompts for user input to a location name"""
    location_name = input('Please enter a location name: ')
    """print below calls the function which returns the value that was stored in the output variable inside get_location_summary. This value is then printed"""
    print(get_location_summary(location_name))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
</code></pre>

<p>Sorry guys. it was a stupid question. 
this actually works.</p>
<pre><code>def main():
"""Prompts for user to input a location name"""
location_name = input("Please enter location name:")    
print ("")
print (print_sorted_stock_summary(location_name))

main()
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Just call it <code>print_location_summary(location_name)</code></span>
