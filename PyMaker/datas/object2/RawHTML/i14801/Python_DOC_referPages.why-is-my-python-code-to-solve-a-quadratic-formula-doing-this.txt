<p>So I am quite a novice at coding python, so I decided to try my hand at making a quadratic equation solver. After entering all my user inputted variables i get this error: </p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:/Users/insertnamehere/Desktop/quadratic formula solver.py", line 6, in &lt;module&gt;
    root=math.sqrt((b**2)-4*a*c)
ValueError: math domain error
</code></pre>
<p>My code is:</p>
<pre><code>import math

a=float(input("A?: "))
b=float(input("B?: "))
c=float(input("C?: "))
root=math.sqrt((b**2)-4*a*c)
x=(-b+root)/2*a
x2=(-b-root)/2*a
print(x)
print(x2)
</code></pre>
<p>Any help would be appreciated a lot.</p>
<p>Edit:
Forgot to add the actual values i entered.</p>
<pre><code>A?: 6
B?: 1
C?: 2
</code></pre>

<p>Python can handle complex numbers, but the <code>math</code> module won't do square roots of negative numbers, for that you need to use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/cmath.html#cmath.sqrt" rel="nofollow">cmath</a>.</p>
<p>Demo:</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python

import cmath

a = 1.0
b = 1.0
c = 1.0

root = cmath.sqrt(b * b - 4.0 * a * c)
x1 = (-b + root) / (2.0 * a)
x2 = (-b - root) / (2.0 * a)
print x1
print x2
</code></pre>
<p><strong>output</strong></p>
<pre><code>(-0.5+0.866025403784j)
(-0.5-0.866025403784j)
</code></pre>
<p>Although <code>i</code> is commonly used by mathematicians as the symbol for the square root of negative one, Python uses <code>j</code>; that convention is common among electronics engineers, since they use <code>i</code> to represent current.</p>
<p>So the above output is equal to (-1 ± sqrt(-3))/2</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>That is a basic 9th grad math question:</p>
<p>Quadratic equations don't always have real-valued solutions, because you can't take the square root of a negative number. You've entered values for a quadratic equation that simply can't be solved within the real numbers.</p>
<p>EDIT: you posted your values:</p>
<p>so, what <strong>is</strong> the square root of (1² - 2*6*2) ? You cannot find a solution in the real numbers to that question, and neither can python, that's why it's giving you a math domain error.</p>
<p>Look at it this way: 6x² + x + 2 = 0 really has no real solution. Hint: Look at the <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/share/clip?f=d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427ef5dqt5nd05&amp;mail=1" rel="nofollow">graph</a></p>

<span class="comment-copy">your code is wrongly indented. please correct.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">why do you <code>import random</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sorry about that, I was planning on adding a randomly generated quadratic and showing the steps needed to solve it as another feature. As for the indentation, that was simply an error in putting the code onto this post.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Debus: don't worry. Do you understand the solutions proposed?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, I now realize that the inputted data was what was causing the problem, I should of thought of one myself instead of googling for a sample quadratic.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I see, Thank you for the help. I will rewrite this using the cmath module instead.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Oh,@Debus: sorry that I've misjudged you. I was assuming you weren't aware of complex numbers.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I was not aware python had a cmath module as well as a math module, reading the documentation for cmath now.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Debus: If you like my answer you can <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5234/how-does-accepting-an-answer-work">accept</a> it. That way, people will know that your question has been answered satisfactorily. And we'll both get some points. :)</span>
