<p>I understand that one shouldn't be able to replace the behaviour of the "del" ("return" etc) keyword, but I do not understand why it is not possible to do this:</p>
<pre><code>myobj.del(mystr)
</code></pre>
<p>What could the parser confuse it with? Is there a way to allow it?</p>
<p>Of course, I could use a different name, but I want to have a little custom wrapper around the AWS tool s3cmd and do things like <code>s3cmd.del("s3://some/bucket/")</code> and have the "del" handled by a <code>__getattr__</code> in my s3cmd class... so the name "del" is something I'd be really happy to manage to use.</p>

<p>That is because such words are keywords. Keywords in Python are reserved words that cannot be used as ordinary identifiers. </p>
<p>The list includes <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/keyword.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">from the doc function <code>keyword</code></a></p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import keyword  
&gt;&gt;&gt; import pprint
&gt;&gt;&gt; pprint.pprint(keyword.kwlist)
['and',
 'as',
 'assert',
 'break',
 'class',
 'continue',
 'def',
 'del',

<p>The reason as to why is beautifully mentioned in <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29346945/why-is-it-a-syntax-error-to-have-an-object-attribute-named-del-return-etc/29346977#comment46879825_29346945">Konrad's comment</a></p>

<p>There’s nothing magical about keywords. However, it makes parsers <strong>vastly</strong> easier to write when disallowing keywords for identifiers. In particular, it makes it easier to provide human-readable error messages for parse errors, because the parser is able to infer more context about the error.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You can still use <code>del</code> as an attribute, just not as an <i>identifier</i> (needed when accessing attributes). You can use <code>getattr(myobj, 'del')(mystr)</code>, but that's not nearly as convenient of course.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">My goal is to have support for all the s3cmd ("s3cmd {put, get, del, ls etc}") in a nicely readable way. I guess using "delete" instead will be the next best option for me;</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@KonradRudolph could you do a write-up of this comment? I feel the argument about making parsers easier is really what I was looking for, as I intended my question as a "philosophical" why.</span>
