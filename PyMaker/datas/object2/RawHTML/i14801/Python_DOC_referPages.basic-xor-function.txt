<p>I am in need of some guidance as to how to program an XOR Python function XOR(x,y) that returns the XOR(x,y).</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>XOR is defined as a bitwise operation and is a standard operator...That being said there is nothing stopping you from defining it.</p>
<pre><code>def XOR(x, y):
    return x ^ y

<span class="comment-copy">What have you tried so far? Please include the code you've written, even if it is wrong, so that we can see what part of the problem you are stuck on.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I am just not sure how to create function in general.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Suggest you read about <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#function-definitions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">function definitions</a> in the documentation (or in one of the many books and online Python tutorials).</span>
