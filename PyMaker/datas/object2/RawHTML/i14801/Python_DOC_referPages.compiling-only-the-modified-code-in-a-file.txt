<p>I have a Python script around 5,000 lines long. If I make a single change in the file, do I have to recompile the entirety of the file, or is it possible to compile only that part or particular code?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>CPython will re-generate the bytecode for an altered source file from scratch. There is no 'partial' compilation option for just the lines that you changed. Recompilation is transparent and automatic.</p>
<p>I'm not aware of any Python implementation that would behave otherwise.</p>
<p>I'd not be worried about speed here though; compiling a 5000 line module doesn't take all <em>that</em> long. But from a maintenance point of view you should still look into refactoring your module into a smaller separate modules.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Ok, I admit that _C_Python has a compilation step ;-) In any case, consider refactoring your large source file into many smaller files. It's good style, and I expect it will cut down on compilation time.</span>
