<p>I've been having trouble getting functions to work that rely on the output of another function. When I run the following code (this is a very simplified version)...</p>
<pre><code>from random import randint

def event():
    if m == 1:
        r = randint(0, 4)
    else:
        r = randint(3, 7)

def random():
    if r == 1:
        print "Test A"
    elif r == 2:
        print "Test B"
    elif r == 3:
        print "Test C"
    elif r == 4:
        print "Test D"
    elif r == 5:
        print "Test E"
    elif r == 6:
        print "Test F"


m = 1
event()
random()

m = 2
event()
random()

m = 3
event()
random()
</code></pre>
<p>...I get <code>NameError: global name 'r' is not defined</code></p>
<p>I need to keep these in separate functions because in my actual code they are very complicated. How can I get random() to recognise the random number generated by event()?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>A simple way is to use <code>return</code> and <code>args</code></p>
<pre><code>def event():
    if m == 1:
        r = randint(0, 4)
    else:
        r = randint(3, 7)
    return r                        # return variable r here


r = event()                         # accept variable r here from event
random(r)                           # pass it to random function

def random(r)                       # receive r from the caller
    ....                            # Use r as a variable
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>While returning a variable is a good way to achieve your goal, sometimes you do need to have <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#global" rel="nofollow">global</a> variables. In that case, put <code>global r</code> in the definition of <code>event()</code> before you assign to it. e.g.:</p>
<pre><code>def event():
    global r

    if m == 1:
        r = randint(0, 4)
    else:
        r = randint(3, 7)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">This worked perfectly, thanks Bhargav!!!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You're welcome. All the best!!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for the help! "global r" worked in some parts of my code but threw me off later when variables kept being being reassigned.</span>
