<p>I want <code>jobber()</code> to do the following: if user inputs "talk" it runs <code>chat()</code> and "calc" for <code>calculator()</code>.</p>
<p>This is my very first project and I am completely new so thanks for any help.</p>
<pre><code>import sys
import time
def chat():
    print('Hello there. What is your name?')
    name = sys.stdin.readline()
    print('Your name is %s...interesting. My name is Chat I was created to have a small planned out conversation when you call me :)' % (name))
    time.sleep(2)
    print('How is the weather in your town today?')
    weather = sys.stdin.readline()
    time.sleep(1.5)
    print('Your weather is %s? The weather in my town is quite sunny.' % (weather))
    time.sleep(2)
    print('This is all the conversation I can make at the moment. Please be patient while my creator trys to update me.')


def calculator():
    print('How much money do you have?')
    money = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    print('How much are you paid?')
    job = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    print('How much do you usually spend?')
    spent = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    for week in range(0,30):
            money = money + job - spent
            print('Week %s. Money %s' % (week,money))



def jobber():
    print('Type talk for a short chat. Type calc for a money calculator.')
    choice = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    if choice == 1:
            chat()
    if choice == 2:
            calculator()

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>use <code>input()</code> and convert to <code>lowercase</code></p>
<pre><code>def jobber():
     choice = input('Type talk for a short chat. Type calc for a money calculator.').lower()
    if choice == "talk":
            chat()
    if choice == "calc":
            calculator()

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>For gathering user input, you'd better use input() function.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You should use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input" rel="nofollow"><code>input()</code></a> built in function, for example setting the <code>money</code> variable in the <code>calculate</code> function should simply be:</p>
<pre><code>money = int(input('How much money do you have?'))
</code></pre>
<p>Since you are only using the <code>choice</code> variable to determine which function to perform, you can even consider placing the input in the if statement:</p>
<pre><code>if input('Type talk or chat.') == 'calc':
    calculator()
else:
    chat()
</code></pre>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html" rel="nofollow">python tutorial</a> is a good guide as to how use if statements and other control flow tools.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">what is your problem, what does not work? what help do you need?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">So where do you ever call <code>jobber</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>raw_input</code> doesn't exist in python 3.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks this helps. I'm still learning python right now so that would explain why I haven't tried that. This was really just a test to see what I could do with what I'd already learned.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Now it's giving me a syntax error</span>
<span class="comment-copy">that is a good idea.. the answer lacks depth</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Or even better a <code>dict</code>-dispatch: <code>{'calc': calculator, 'talk': chat}[choice]()</code>, then at least if it's not valid, you'd get an exception</span>
