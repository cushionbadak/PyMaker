<p>I am fairly new to programming and I've been experimenting with dictionaries in Python. However, I just updated to Python 3.4 and code that was previously usable is not functioning properly after the update. I thought I had cleared most everything up, but now my dictionary seems to be broken.</p>
<p>The code runs fine until I try to call on the dictionary. Here is an example of code that previously worked correctly in Python 2.7:</p>
<pre><code>userPrompt = input("Month: ")

months = {
        1: jan,
        2: feb,
        3: mar,
    }

months[userPrompt]()
</code></pre>
<p>It seems to have an issue with that final line. Do I need to write the dictionary differently, or address it differently?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Use the following:</p>
<pre><code>int(userPrompt)
</code></pre>
<p>to get the integer value of your input string. In python 3, the <code>input</code> function doesn't use the <code>eval</code> function. Instead, it returns the raw string, like python's 2 <code>raw_input</code> function. It's up to the programmer to convert it to an integer.</p>
<p>For example in python2:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; type(input())
42
&lt;class 'int'&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>In python3:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; type(input())
42
&lt;class 'str'&gt;
</code></pre>

Either convert your keys to strings, or the input to integers. See e.g. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/20449427/3001761">stackoverflow.com/q/20449427/3001761</a></span>
