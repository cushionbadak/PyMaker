<p>I have a string <code>color_line</code> which I need to check whether it starts with a substring which takes values only in <code>'red'</code>, <code>'blue'</code>, <code>'green'</code>, or <code>'magenta'</code>.  </p>
<p>Is there a shorter way of doing the check than the obvious way of</p>
<pre><code>if line.startswith( 'red' ) or ... or line.startswith( 'magenta' ): ...
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can pass a tuple of values to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.startswith"><code>str.startswith</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>if line.startswith(('red', 'blue', 'green', 'magenta')):
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">In general, would this work for a general boolean function <code>f( x )</code> and <code>x</code> is a variable that takes values in a list <code>li</code>?  Your answer suggests <code>if f( tuple( li ) ):</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No.  In that case, you would want to use <code>any</code> and a generator expression: <code>if any(f(x) for x in li):</code>  My answer was for the problem you stated in your question.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you have a list of values you want to use with <code>str.startswith</code>, you just need to call <code>tuple()</code> on it:  <code>if line.startswith(tuple(li)):</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@iCodez Hi, please follow this initiative and invite other people: <a href="http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/85335/tkinter-and-ttk">area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/85335/tkinter-and-ttk</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Rinzler - I have looked over your proposal, and appreciate being invited, but I am not sure I want to commit to it.  An entire site for just Tkinter/Ttk questions is too limited (as per the guidelines listed <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/09/merging-season/">here</a>.  The [tkinter] tag only has 340 followers and SO is currently handling these type of questions just fine.  If anything, a site for <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/tags/winforms/info">Windows Forms</a> would be more useful than one for Tkinter/Ttk.  I think it is best to leave Tkinter/Ttk questions to SO for now.</span>
