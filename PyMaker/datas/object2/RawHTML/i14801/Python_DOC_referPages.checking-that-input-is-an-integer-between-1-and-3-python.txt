<p>I want to be able to check that an input is an integer between 1 and 3, so far I have the following code:</p>
<pre><code>userChoice = 0

while userChoice &lt; 1 or userChoice &gt; 3:
    userChoice = int(input("Please choose a number between 1 and 3 &gt; "))
</code></pre>
<p>This makes the user re-enter a number if it is not between 1 and 3, but I want to add validation to ensure that a user cannot enter a string or unusual character that may result in a value error.</p>

<p>Catch the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html?highlight=valueerror#ValueError" rel="nofollow"><code>ValueError</code></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Raised when a built-in operation or function receives an argument that
  has the right type but an inappropriate value</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>while userChoice &lt; 1 or userChoice &gt; 3:
    try:
        userChoice = int(input("Please choose a number between 1 and 3 &gt; "))
    except ValueError:
        print('We expect you to enter a valid integer')
</code></pre>
<p>Actually, since the range of allowed numbers is small, you can operate directly on strings:</p>
<pre><code>while True:
    num = input('Please choose a number between 1 and 3 &gt; ')
    if num not in {'1', '2', '3'}:
        print('We expect you to enter a valid integer')
    else:
        num = int(num)
        break
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Alternatively try comparison of <code>input</code> in desired results, and <code>break</code> from the loop, something like this:</p>
<pre><code>while True:
    # python 3 use input
    userChoice = raw_input("Please choose a number between 1 and 3 &gt; ")
    if userChoice in ('1', '2', '3'):
        break
userChoice = int(userChoice)
print userChoice
</code></pre>
<p>Using <code>Try/Except</code> is a good approach, however your original design has a flaw, because user can still input like "1.8" which isn't exactly an integer but will pass your check.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Do add the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python-3.x">python-3.x</a> tag if you are using python3 as <code>input</code> has been changed from 2 to 3</span>
