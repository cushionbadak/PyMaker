<p>For starters, I read this: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4928297/all-permutations-of-a-binary-sequence-x-bits-long">all permutations of a binary sequence x bits long</a></p>
<p>This is similar to what I want, but I don't want to generate all permutations in advance. What I want is more of a generator that I can step through and stop whenever I want (for efficiency reasons, I have cutoff conditions where I want to halt).</p>
<p>I was wondering if there is an elegant way to do this Python. The answers to the question above all involved ".join"s, but I don't think that will work here. I assume I need to use itertools.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>Since you like the solution in the answer you link to, here's the generator version:</p>
<pre><code>for pattern in ("".join(seq) for seq in itertools.product("01", repeat=3)):
    ...
</code></pre>
<p>Using parens instead of square brackets <code>[ ... ]</code> gives you a generator that creates the values on demand. </p>
<p>It's easy to turn almost any function into generator; see <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#generators" rel="nofollow">the python tutorial</a> for the details.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Python has <i>very</i> elegant generators. Just google "python generator".</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@alexis This is interesting: <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/Generators" rel="nofollow noreferrer">wiki.python.org/moin/Generators</a>. However, I have never worked with generators before, do you mind showing me how it would work in my case?</span>

<span class="comment-copy">Excellent, thanks. Now I know about generators, they seem very handy.</span>
