<p>I have a for loop:</p>
<pre><code>for x in range(1,13):
   print ("This was the average temperature in month number " + str(x) + " in Boston, 2014: ", Boston_monthly_temp(x))
</code></pre>
<p>This prints out the average monthly temperatures in Boston in 2014, such as:</p>
<pre><code>This was the average temperature in month number 1 in Boston, 2014:  26.787096774193547
</code></pre>
<p>all the way up until Month Number 12 (December):</p>
<pre><code>This was the average temperature in month number 12 in Boston, 2014:  38.42580645161291.
</code></pre>
<p>All in all, this for loop produces 12 lines. </p>
<p>However, I can't figure out how to store the results of this "for" loop into a single variable, like (output_number_one).</p>
<p>I'm trying to store the results into a single variable, so I can dump / write the variable (and its contents) into a pickle file, called:</p>
<pre><code>output.pkl
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Try this</p>
<pre><code>result = []
for x in range(1,13):
    result.append((x, Boston_monthly_temp(x)))
</code></pre>
<p>Now result contains the <code>x</code> and <code>avg</code></p>
<pre><code>for x, avg in result:
    print ("This was the average temperature in month number " + str(x) + " in Boston, 2014: ", avg)
</code></pre>
<p>You can save it to <code>sample.pkl</code> by</p>
<pre><code>import pickle
pickle.dump(result, open("sample.pkl","w"))
</code></pre>
<p>Then check by</p>
<pre><code>res = pickle.load(open('sample.pkl'))
&gt;&gt;&gt;for i in res:
       print i
This was the average temperature ...
This was the average temperatu ...
.....
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You could simply store the results in a dictionary, pickle that and store it:</p>
<pre><code>import pickle

d = {}
for x in range(1,13):
   d[x] = Boston_monthly_temp(x)
res = pickle.dumps(d)
# write res to a file

<span class="comment-copy">save to a <code>list</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Since 'saving to a variable', you can ditch the <code>print</code> (because it is used for a side-effect and not value generation) in which case a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">List Comprehension</a> would be an idiomatic approach (the link also shows how to explicitly build a list).</span>
