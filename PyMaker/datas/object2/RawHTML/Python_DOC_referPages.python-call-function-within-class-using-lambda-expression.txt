<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have a class inside a .py file that contains two functions.</p>
<p><code>new_column</code> generates a new column based on values of existing columns (Col1 and Col2).</p>
<p><code>transform_df</code> applies the previous function to a dataframe, via a lambda expression.</p>
<p>The end result looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>Col1    Col2    col3
0   a   b   ab
1   a   b   ab
2   a   c   None
3   a   b   ab
</code></pre>
<p>How do I use these functions in a new file/notebook?</p>
<pre><code># kept within file df_functions.py
class Functions():

    def __init__(self, path):
        self.path = path # path to .csv

    # function to create new column, based on Col1 and Col2 values
    def new_column(self, row):
        if (row['Col1'] == 'a') &amp; (row['Col2'] == 'b'):
            return 'ab'

    # apply previously defined function via lambda expression
    def transform_df(self, path):        
        df = pd.read_csv(self.path)

        # apply function 'new_column' to df
        df['col3'] = df.apply(lambda row: self.new_column(row), axis=1)

        # other potential functions applications here

        return df
</code></pre>
<p>I have tried the following:</p>
<pre><code>from df_functions import Functions

df_path = '../datafile.csv'
FunctionsObject = Functions(path=df_path)

new_df = FunctionsObject.transform_df(path=df_path)
</code></pre>
<p>However this returns</p>
<pre><code>NameError: ("name 'new_column' is not defined", 'occurred at index 0')
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Appears to be a problem related to making edits to the .py file containing the class. After making changes, I restarted the kernel and the imported functions work as expected.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>FunctionsObject.transform_df()</code> this must have caused error since <code>transform_df()</code> requires <code>path</code> parameter. This shows that your code has few missing statements, without which we cannot determine what went wrong.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What is the point of having the two functions be part of a class? You are passing the path to <code>transform_df</code> anyway</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Additionally, there is inconsistency in your class name. Is it called <code>Functions</code> or is it called <code>FunnelFunctions</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I suggest adding pandas tag to the question, because it is specific to the library</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Please provide a minimal example that allows us to reproduce your error. There are currently several inconsistencies in your code. For example, you import <code>Functions</code> but use <code>FunnelFunctions</code>, and you define <code>transform_df</code> as taking a <code>path</code> parameter but do not supply one.</span>
