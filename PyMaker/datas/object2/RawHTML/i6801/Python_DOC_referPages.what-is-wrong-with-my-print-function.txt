<p>I am in an introduction to Anaconda class and I need to write a program to determine how many times a dice roll(s) land on a certain amount of faces. However, I cannot get it to print my answer correctly.</p>

<p>Your problem is your print statement. You try to print a string then something called <code>end</code> then another string, and so forth. I think you want that <code>end</code> to be an end-of-line character.</p>
<p>Instead of printing something like</p>
<pre><code>print("a string" end "another string" end "a third string")
</code></pre>
<p>use</p>
<pre><code>print("a string\n" "another string\n" "a third string")
</code></pre>
<p>Note that <code>"\n"</code> is the end-of-line character in Python. My code also uses a feature of Python where you can combine <em>string literals</em> by placing them next to each other. Let lets you see the individual lines more clearly. Your code failed because you tried to do this with a <em>string variable</em>, namely <code>end</code>, and you did not even define that variable.</p>

<p>From Python docs: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>print(*objects, sep=’ ‘, end=’\n’, file=sys.stdout, flush=False)</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you can see, the <code>end</code> is one of the parameters for the <code>print()</code> function, and by default, <code>end=’\n’</code>. So to use it correctly, you just have to change the <code>end</code> variable (which may not be directly applicable to your code)</p>
<p>Here are some examples:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; for i in range(3):
    print(i, end =' ')


0 1 2 
&gt;&gt;&gt; for i in range(3):
    print(i, end ='')


012
&gt;&gt;&gt; for i in range(3):
    print(i) # by default end=\n


0
1
2
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
</code></pre>
<p>And also, if I am understanding your logic correctly, the same code can be re-written as such. </p>
<pre><code>import random

RollDice = int(input("Number of Rolls:"))
numbers = [0 for _ in range(6)] # array of 6 spaces with int 0

for i in range(RollDice):
    Roll = random.randint(1,6)
    numbers[Roll-1] += 1 # the array index starts from 0 hence you need Roll-1

plusMinus = "+-----"*6 + "+\n" # since you are repeating this you might want to assign it to a variable
print(plusMinus + "| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |\n" + "| " + " | ".join(map(str,numbers)) + " |\n" + plusMinus)
</code></pre>
