<p>First of all, I am very new at programming.
I am trying to save a variable from bash shell </p>
<pre><code>  &gt;curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/
</code></pre>
<p>this line would return data such as local-ipv4. And I am trying to use phython and flask to save those variables. I wrote</p>
<pre><code>from flask import Flask, request
app  = Flask(__name__)
@app.route('/')
def testRequest():
  url1 = "http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/"
  name1 = request.get(url1)
  nameText = name1.text
  return nameText

testOutput = testRequest()
print testOutput
</code></pre>
<p>But this gives me runtime error : working outside of the request context.
can someone guide me to where to look for possible solution?</p>

<p>To things to comment here:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>First, it seems that you'll be just fine by using <code>requests</code>, a highly recommended library for HTTP requests. With it you could do:</p>
<pre><code>import requests
url = "http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/"
resp = requests.get(url)
print resp.text
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Regards to the error you're getting <code>runtime error : working outside of the request context</code>, is because by <code>testOutput = testRequest()</code> you're calling a method that's part of the <code>Flask</code> app <code>app</code>. Another thing related to the error is that you never ran the <code>Flask</code> app. To do this, include this at the end of your code.</p>
<pre><code> if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
</code></pre>
<p>But again, <code>Flask</code> is rather a web framework that it's useful to create web sites, APIs, web apps, etc. It's very useful, but I don't think you may need it for what you're trying to achieve.</p></li>

<p>Since you only need to make an HTTP GET request and print the response, you don't need Flask. You can use the <code>urllib</code> standard library to send the GET request (<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.request.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.request.html</a>):</p>
<pre><code>import urllib.request

def testRequest():
  url1 = "http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/"
  response = urllib.request.urlopen(url1)
  nameText = response.read().decode('utf-8')
  return nameText

testOutput = testRequest()
print testOutput

<span class="comment-copy">I'm a little confused; are you trying to save data from <i>incoming</i> requests? Or are you trying to query url1 and return data from that? My understanding is that Flask's <code>request</code> is for the former, whereas you'd probably want to use the <code>requests</code> module for the latter. Looking at your code, it seems like <code>requests</code> is what you want, rather than Flask's <code>request</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you so much! first method worked. The reason why I wanted to implement flask is that because I want to make the web apps by using those data. I guess I will implement flask later on. I am not very familiar with either flask or python...</span>
