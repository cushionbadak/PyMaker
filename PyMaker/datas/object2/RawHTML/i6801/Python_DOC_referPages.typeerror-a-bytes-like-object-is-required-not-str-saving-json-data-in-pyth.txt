<p>I am getting data from twitter in json format and storing the same in a file.</p>
<pre><code>consumer_key = 'Consumer KEY'
consumer_secret = 'Secret'
access_token = 'Token'
access_secret = 'Access Secret'

auth = OAuthHandler(consumer_key, consumer_secret)

auth.set_access_token(access_token, access_secret)

api = tweepy.API(auth)

os.chdir('Path')

for status in tweepy.Cursor(api.home_timeline).items(15):
    simplejson.dump(status._json,file,sort_keys = True)
file.close

<p>But I am getting the below error:</p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 2, in &lt;module&gt;
  File "/Users/abc/anaconda/lib/python3.6/json/__init__.py", line 180, in dump

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>From the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html#json.dump" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>json.dump()</code> documentation</a>: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The json module always produces str objects, not bytes objects. Therefore, <code>fp.write()</code> must support str input.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You opened the file in binary mode. Don't do that, remove the <code>b</code> from the file mode:</p>
<pre><code>file = open('TwData.json','w')
</code></pre>
<p>It's better to use an absolute path rather than change the working directory, and if you used the file as a context manager (with the <code>with</code> statement), it'll be automatically closed for you when the block is done. That helps avoid errors like forgetting to actually call the <code>file.close()</code> method.</p>
<p>And if you are going to write multiple JSON documents to the file, at least put a <em>newline</em> between each document, making it a <a href="http://jsonlines.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">JSON lines file</a>; this is <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12451431/loading-and-parsing-a-json-file-with-multiple-json-objects-in-python">much easier to parse again</a> later on:</p>
<pre><code>with open('Path/TWData.json', 'w') as file:    
    for status in tweepy.Cursor(api.home_timeline).items(15):
        json.dump(status._json, file, sort_keys=True)
        file.write('\n')
</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively, put everything into a top-level object like mapping or list, and write that <em>single</em> object to the file to create a valid JSON document.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><em>Don't</em> store separate json objects. Append each one to a list, and then dump at once.</p>
<pre><code>with open('TwData.json','w') as file:    
    data = []
    for status in tweepy.Cursor(api.home_timeline).items(15):
        data.append(status._json)

    simplejson.dump(data, file, sort_keys=True)
</code></pre>
<p>Should also note here that you shouldn't open the file in binary mode if you want to write text to it.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">@GhilasBELHADJ: sure it can.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why did you open the file in binary mode? You are also not actually <i>calling</i> the <code>file.close()</code> method, that line is rather redundant as it stands.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">very useful..appreciate it</span>
<span class="comment-copy">my bad,  i wasnt aware about that..wanted to accept both of these, but since i had accepted Martjin's earlier, its not letting me accept yours..still both are equally useful for me..</span>
