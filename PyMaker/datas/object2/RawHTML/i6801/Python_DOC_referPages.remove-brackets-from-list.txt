<p>I have some problems with using a list in python.
Right now, I open a .txt file with data, and read it into my python file. 
However, when I put the input from the datafile into variable <code>data</code> and print this to check if it works or not, I see a lot of extra brackets which I don't want. Right now, it looks like:</p>
<pre><code>["['sports','pizza','other']"]
</code></pre>
<p>and I want it to have it in a way like this:</p>
<pre><code>['sports','pizza','other']
</code></pre>
<p>Can someone help me to get this work? Reason why I want it in a format like I mentioned above, is that I want to compare the list with another list, and that does not work in the format with the <code>]"]</code></p>
<p>I hope someone will help me.</p>

<p>Simply use <code>eval</code> function from Python.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = ["['sports','pizza','other']"]
&gt;&gt;&gt; eval(a[0])
['sports', 'pizza', 'other']
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Maybe this will help:    file.write(str(data)[1:-1])</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You probably rather want <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html#ast.literal_eval" rel="nofollow noreferrer">ast.literal_eval</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hmm.. Still doesn't work. I will edit the post with my code, maybe you can see then whats wrong?</span>
