<p>I am encountering a wide variety of error codes while scraping through a list of urls.</p>
<p>Heres a outtake I have currently encountered:</p>
<pre><code>[Errno -2] Cannot connect to host msecnd.net:80 ssl:False [Name or service not known]
...
[Errno 113] Cannot connect to host ru4.com:80 ssl:False [Can not connect to ru4.com:80 [Connect call failed ('75.98.46.13', 80)]]
...
[Errno 111] Cannot connect to host mail.me.com.akadns.net:80 ssl:False [Can not connect to mail.me.com.akadns.net:80 [Connect call failed ('17.172.34.92', 80)]]
...
[Errno 104] Connection reset by peer
...
[Errno 101] Cannot connect to host mqtt.c10r.facebook.com:80 ssl:False [Can not connect to mqtt.c10r.facebook.com:80 [Network is unreachable]]
</code></pre>
<p>However I cannot find any clear documentation on how to avoid these errors.
<code>Errno -2</code> is caused by invalid cert chain, but I cannot find how I can fix this issue on my machine.
<code>Errno 113</code> is connection refused or no route to host
The other errnos are not very well documented.</p>
<p>My question is: How can I find the documentation that describes these error codes and additionally how can I handle them the best way ?</p>

<p>aiohttp has no specific error codes, you are observing standard <code>OSError</code> exceptions from python internals.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/errno.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/errno.html</a> could help. Or even better google query like <code>errno 101</code> return comprehensive list of articles.</p>
