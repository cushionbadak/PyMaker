<p>I'm trying to use the pyrouge to calculate the similarity between automated summary and gold standards. When it process both summaries, Rouge works ok. But when it writes the result, it complains that "tuple index out of range" Does anyone know what cause this problem, and how I can fix it? </p>

error: nothing to repeat
</code></pre>
<p>The gold standards are BookRags.txt, GradeSaver.txt, GradeSummary.txt, Wikipedia.txt
The summary that needs to be compared with is automated.txt<br/>
Shouldn't either *.txt or [a-z0-9A-Z]+ work? But the previous one gives me "nothing to repeat error", the latter "tuple index out of range" error</p>
<pre><code>r = Rouge155("D:\ComputerScience\Research\ROUGE-1.5.5\ROUGE-1.5.5")
r.system_dir = 'D:\ComputerScience\Research\summary\Grendel\\automated'
r.model_dir = 'D:\ComputerScience\Research\summary\Grendel\manual'
r.system_filename_pattern = '[a-z0-9A-Z]+.txt'
r.model_filename_pattern = '[a-z0-9A-Z]+.txt'
output = r.convert_and_evaluate()
print(output)
</code></pre>
<p>I'm manually setting both directory. It seems like the Rouge package can process the txts in it. </p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The problem is that the rogue library never accounted for the case where no matches are found for your regular expression. The line in the rogue source code <code>id = match.groups(0)[0]</code> is the problematic one. If you look this up in the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.match.groups" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation</a> it says the groups function <code>Return a tuple containing all the subgroups of the match, from 1 up to however many groups are in the pattern...</code>. Because no matches where found, an empty tuple was returned, and the code is trying to grab the first item from an empty tuple which results in an error.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">I see. So I changed my regular expression to *.txt, which will match any summaries in the folder. But it now gives me new error--nothing to repeat.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Often a * will be treated as a wildcard character that matches any number of any character, but when using regex the * behaves differently. See <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31386552/nothing-to-repeat-from-python-regex" title="nothing to repeat from python regex">stackoverflow.com/questions/31386552/â€¦</a> for more info on that. As you mentioned <code>[a-z0-9A-Z]+</code> should pick anything up. Could you print out the system_dir variable being used by the write_config_static function and make sure your .txt files are inside of this folder, and not in a sub-directory of this folder.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It seems like the Rouge can find summaries in both system directory and model directory because from its output, it has processed txts in both directories. The problem still happens in write_config_static function. My system_dir and model_dir are set manually to an absolute address.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Nat, Where you ever able to solve this issue? I am running into the same problem using the same regex you were. I noticed the files are being processed by rouge and put into a tmp folder. However, when write_config_static is called it throws the same exception saying it cannot find files. When manually viewing the tmp folder, the files are there.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Sabolis I couldn't solve it. I switched to a Java version Rouge. That one works fine.</span>
