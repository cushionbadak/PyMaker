<p>I am using global variables but I can't do it with out any errors. I can't remember how to completely use global variables. If you have any tips please tell me.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The declaration of your globals is wrong. You declare your globals as a description of how they should be calculated. That will just not work. The global keyword in python is used to bring a variable in the local scope. Then you can alter it. Like this:</p>
<pre><code>def updateGlobals():
    global global_variable
    global_variable = "new value"
</code></pre>
<p>However, I would put them your globals in a class and add functions that will update the variables accordingly. I think people call this the singleton design pattern, but maybe you don't need this in your little project. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">Why are you using global variables here? And so many too</span>
<span class="comment-copy">And what error are you getting?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I have used global varibles because I thought I needed to please make any changes neccesery</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm not getting an error I just need to put the global variables through out the code but I am not sure where</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You fundamentally misunderstand how variable scope and the <code>global</code> keyword works. Please read up before asking a question. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/faq/programming.html#what-are-the-rules-for-local-and-global-variables-in-python" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/faq/â€¦</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">I get an error on line 4 column 14 with an =</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This tells honestly nothing. If you want to have help with an error, you should state what the error is, and where the error occured (so what is on line 4).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">the = sign is the issue</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You still haven't shared any code, nor did you tell me what the error was.</span>
