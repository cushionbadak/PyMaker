<p>This is the python code which is to be edited </p>
<pre><code>import os    
while True:
    command=input("Entre Command:")
    if command==1:

    elif command==3:
            os.system("aplay /home/abhi/C_music.wav")
</code></pre>
<p>.The Output is coming from Command==2 Which needs to be saved in files(Dynamic names) each containing 200 lines.This means that i want to make batches of outputs coming from </p>
<pre><code>os.system("sudo /home/abhi/rpi_x4driver_Final/rpi_x4driver/Runme")
</code></pre>
<p>and save them in files with dynamic names.</p>
<p>i have tried this code but it doesn't work</p>
<pre><code>command=input("Entre Command:")
if command==1:
    sys.exit()
elif command==2:
proc = 
subprocess.Popen(["sudo/home/abhi/rpi_x4driver_Final/rpi_x4driver/Runme"], 
stdout=subprocess.PIPE)

while True:
    line = proc.stdout.readline()
    if line != '':
        # save to a file instead of printing
        print "test:", line.rstrip()
    else:
        break

<li><p>If you want to extract a part of the output from the stream and then save it, consider using <code>subprocess.check_out</code> as follow:</p>
<pre><code>import subprocess

s = subprocess.check_out(['path/to/the/executable','-option'])

s.decode('utf-8')
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>If you don't care about extracting, consider using the shell redirection as suggested by @Someprogrammerdude with the <code>&gt;</code> redirection in the shell.

<span class="comment-copy"><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.system" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>os.system</code></a> runs a <i>shell</i>. That means you can use all available shell functionality, like <i>redirection</i> using <code>&gt;</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Someprogrammerdude It should be noted that in general this comes at the cost of portability. But with hardcoded paths like that, I doubt that OP's code is meant to be very portable to begin with.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Thomas Cosidering the otherwise hardcoded commands and paths I'd say portability is less of an issue. Furthermore, redirection works on just about all modern platforms (Unix-y like Linux or macOS as well as Windows).</span>
