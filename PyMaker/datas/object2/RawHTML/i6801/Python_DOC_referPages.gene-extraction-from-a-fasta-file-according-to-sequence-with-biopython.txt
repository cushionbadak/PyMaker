<p>I have a fasta file that I am parsing. The file is composed of several sequences that belongs to the same gene from a different bacterial strain. What I want to do, and the script does is to check if the sequence are equal or different to the reference seq. With that information I want to produce a new file BUT I only one one sequence of each.</p>

For some clarification :</p>
<pre><code>original file                           desire output
    &gt;gene_1 strainIDx                     &gt;gen1_strainIDx

<p>I don't mind about the ID just I would like to have one seq of each. I have tried to use 'break'but I don't get the output I would like to. Help will be appreciate</p>

<p>Use a Lookup Table, for example:  </p>
<pre><code>lookup = Set()

with open('/files/' + 'corrected_gene_1', "w") as handle: 
    for record in SeqIO.parse('/files/gene_A.fasta', "fasta"):
        seq_hash = hash(str(record.seq))

        if not seq_hash in lookup:
            # Not in lookup, save
            lookup.add(seq_hash)
            SeqIO.write(records, handle, "fasta")
        else:
            # already saved - Skip
            pass

<span class="comment-copy">And in wihich part of my script I should place it, please?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I don't understand your code very much. Before I create my file I firstly need to see if len(seq) are equal. If there are equal then I add them to the file. Now I'm very puzzled.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Ana: Equal Length don't mean equal sequence, but equal <code>hash</code> does. My Example code <b>filters</b> all duplicate sequence. If you need another Condition <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/posts/46178155/edit">Edit</a> your Question accordingly.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@stovfl Why adding an <code>else</code> statement? seems unnecessary here</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@rodgdor: Remove it if don't need it. You can use it for Statistics e.g. count, print or write to another File duplicate sequence.</span>
