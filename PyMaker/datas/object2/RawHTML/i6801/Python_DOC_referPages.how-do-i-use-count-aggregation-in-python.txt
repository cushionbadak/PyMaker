<p>I'm trying to do a SQL thing where I change a column to the count of its values in Python.</p>
<p>Like</p>
<pre><code>A Blue
B Red
C Blue
</code></pre>
<p>Would be replaced with </p>
<pre><code>Blue 2
Red 1
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can try something like below with your column names. Try using this as example</p>
<pre><code>    import pandas as pd
    mydata=[['A','Blue'],['B','Red'],['C','Blue']]
    df= pd.DataFrame(mydata,columns=['var','color'])
    x=df.groupby(by=['color'])['var'].count()
    print(x)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">@Ryan is that what you were looking for ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sorry, I got really swamped with the number of things I needed to do, and I'm still new to stack overflow- I had some errors with the code you provided, but upon further research, I was able to make it work. The issue was probably an issue with the way my code was written, but your answer helped lead me to the right answer. Thank you</span>
