<p>I'm trying to solve this algorithm with basic python, due to the fact that I'm only in my first computer science class in my freshman year at college. What are your recommendations on how I should go about creating this algorithm? I'm open minded to anything! Excited to hear back. Thanks.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use a <code>for</code> loop</p>
<pre><code>N = 10
for i in range(1,N+1):
    print(i)
</code></pre>
<p>You can also use a <code>while</code> loop</p>
<pre><code>N = 10
i = 1
while i &lt;= N:
    print(i)
    i += 1
</code></pre>
<p>(Assuming natural numbers means positive integers)</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Algorithm? Isn't this just running a loop?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yeah, I suppose so. Sorry, just going by it as my professor wrote the question. "Design an algorithm that prints all natural numbers less than or equal N."</span>
<span class="comment-copy">please define "natural numbers". (if it just means integers, well, look at 'for' and 'range')</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, I was confused about natural numbers as well. I believe the professor just meant integers, he's not exactly great at communicating...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Take some time to work your way through <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the Tutorial</a> it will give you an idea of what tools are available to solve your problems.  Many times the best place to start designing an algorithm is on paper with a pencil.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@cᴏʟᴅsᴘᴇᴇᴅ oops thanks for the heads up</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@BlakeMcLaughlin Ok do let me know if it works</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No assuming - The set of Natural numbers are values greater than 0 i.e. counting numbers.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Chinny84 idk some places might refer to 0 as a natural number</span>
<span class="comment-copy">then they would be wrong ;).</span>
