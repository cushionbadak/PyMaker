<p>Let I developed a program in pycharm not only using  the default python library,but also import different different  plugins to pycharm. But I want to run this program in another  machine which doesn't have any other separate plugins except default python. How can I run this program on that machine?</p>

<p>You could use a <code>requirements.txt</code> file in which you can note down your dependencies either manually or through using <code>pip freeze &gt; requirements.txt</code> over the command line. The easiest way to accomplish this is probably by using <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/working-with-embedded-local-terminal.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PyCharm's embedded Terminal</a>. After putting your requirements in a <code>requirements.txt</code>, you can use <code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code> to install the requirements you specified. Here is some further information from the pip documentation: <a href="https://pip.readthedocs.io/en/1.1/requirements.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://pip.readthedocs.io/en/1.1/requirements.html</a></p>
<p>It's recommended to use a virtual environment. The standard library has a built-in module for this, about which you can read here:

<span class="comment-copy">By all means use a virtualenv to install the program and it's requirements - unless you don't care breaking some other program that depends on different versions of the same packages... Also beware that outside a virtualenv, <code>pip freeze</code> will list ALL available packages from your installation, whether your app needs them or not, so better to write your requirements file manually (grepping for <code>import</code> in your project tree should be a good starting point).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, I forgot to mention that. I edited my reply to include a link to the documentation.</span>
