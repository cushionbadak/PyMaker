<p>I'm implementing this <a href="https://github.com/fastai/courses/blob/master/deeplearning1/nbs/lesson5.ipynb" rel="noreferrer">notebook</a> on Windows with Python 3.5.3 and got the follow error on load_vectors() call. I've tried different solutions posted but none worked.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;ipython-input-86-dd4c123b0494&gt; in load_vectors(loc)
      1 def load_vectors(loc):
      2     return (load_array(loc+'.dat'),
----&gt; 3         pickle.load(open(loc+'_words.pkl','rb')),
      4         pickle.load(open(loc+'_idx.pkl','rb')))

UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xe2 in position 0: ordinal not in range(128)
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You should probably give encoding for <code>pickle.load(f, encoding='latin1')</code>, but please make sure all the characters in your file will follow the encoding.</p>
<p>By default, your pickle code is trying to decode the file with 'ASCII' which fails. Instead you can explicitly tell which one to use. See this from <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html#pickle.load" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Documentation</a>. </p>
<p>If latin1 doesn't solve, try with <code>encoding='bytes'</code> and then decode all the keys and values later on.</p>

<p>I solved this issue by copying and pasting the entire csv file into text and reading it with:</p>
<pre><code>with open(self.path + "/review_collection.txt", "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    read = f.read().splitlines()
    for row in read:
        print(row)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">i am facing this issue when use csv. did you know how to fix it?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@radityagumay You could try encoding option while reading. How are you reading the file, and what's in the file?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">just trying to write a csv file. and file looks like this <a href="https://paste.ofcode.org/CZk4aHSjvTwFfMU28JeRXk" rel="nofollow noreferrer">paste.ofcode.org/CZk4aHSjvTwFfMU28JeRXk</a></span>
