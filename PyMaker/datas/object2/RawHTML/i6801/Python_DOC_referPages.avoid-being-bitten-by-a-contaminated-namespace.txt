<p>I just spent almost an hour tracking down what was- at the time- a very confusing error message. The source of the error was this block of code (for the purposes of this question, the meaning of all the pieces really doesn't matter):</p>
<pre><code>fspec_prsrs = tuple(compile('{{{}{}}}'.format(fstr_tup.field_name
                                                if fstr_tup.field_name else '',
                                              ':'+fstr_tup.format_spec
                                                if fstr_tup.format_spec else ''
                                              )
                            )
                    for fstr_tup in fstr_tuples)
</code></pre>
<p>Which resulted in this error:</p>
<pre><code>*** TypeError: Required argument 'filename' (pos 2) not found
</code></pre>
<p>The cause of the error is that I had neglected to do an import of the <code>compile</code> function at the top of the file (from the <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/parse" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>parse</code> module</a>).</p>
<p>As a result, <code>compile</code> is referring to the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#compile" rel="nofollow noreferrer">built-in <code>compile</code> function</a>. Although the error message seems very clear to me now that I understand the cause, I ended up wasting a bunch of time looking at the package source code from which <em>thought</em> I had imported the function, thinking the error was coming from there. Instead, it was coming from the built-in <code>compile</code> all along.  </p>
<p>The <code>compile</code> function is something I tend to forget even exists. I hardly ever use it, if ever, and indeed there are a number of functions in the built-in list just like <code>compile</code> that I also never use (I'm looking at <strong>YOU</strong>, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#id" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>id</code></a>, and <strong><em>YOU</em></strong>, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#filter" rel="nofollow noreferrer">filter</a>!), and as a result they are sitting there doing nothing other than contaminating my namespace.</p>
<p>Typically when forgetting to import something, one will just get a <code>NameError</code> in which case the cause is obvious; but when there are things lurking about in the namespace I did not put there it is much less obvious. Is there a full-proof way to avoid issues like this?</p>
<p>What can be done? Or is this just something every Python coder has to learn to live with?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The only idea I have that avoids this problem is to not import objects into the namespace to begin with. For example, instead of:</p>
<pre><code>from parse import compile
</code></pre>
<p>One would do:</p>
<pre><code>import parse
parse.compile(...)
</code></pre>
<p>This fixes the problem. However, I do not like this solution because the only thing I plan to use from the <code>parse</code> package in that module is <code>compile</code> in the first place. It is a bit more direct and clear to the reader (i.e., Future Me) <em>WHY</em> and <em>WHAT</em> I am making use of the <code>parse</code> module when what is being imported is right up front.</p>
<p>A better solution would be a "set it and forget" way to eliminate things from the global namespace that aren't of use to me in the module in which I'm working.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Perhaps use an IDE that highlights built-in names? That way, it'll be clear if you're code refers to a built-in name. Pycharm does this. As well as Sublime.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ChristianDean Since I have never regularly used an IDE that solution wasn't obvious to me, though I'm sure it probably seems obvious to people who have. I have generally said "I don't need an IDE" (I just use Notepad++) but I suppose tonight I have proven that I do.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">would <code>from parse import compile as &lt;some unique name&gt;</code> be suitable for the understanding of future you?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Eric i don't know... future me is pretty stupid. it's a good suggestion in general but my complaint would be that in order <i>remember</i> i need to do that, i would need to be mindful- <i>today</i>- of the bulit-in namespace pollution in the first place... lack of this mindfulness was the source of the problem to begin with.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>from &lt;module&gt; import &lt;function&gt;</code> is a pattern that is relatively easy to grep, so you could automatically scan your code for this kind of aberration. Or you could even write a plugin for <a href="https://pylint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how_tos/plugins.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Pylint</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Eric that sounds like a really workable solution- thanks!</span>
