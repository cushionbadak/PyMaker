<p>i want adding and subtracting this type of data: $12,587.30.which returns answer in same format.how can do this ?</p>
<p>Here is my code example:</p>
<pre><code>print(int(col_ammount2.lstrip('$'))-int(col_ammount.lstrip('$')))
</code></pre>
<p>I removed $ sign and convert it to int but it gives me base 10 error.</p>

<p>You mentioned you want to do arithmetic operations to the numbers (addition/subtraction) so you probably want them in <code>float</code> instead. The difference between an integer (<code>int</code>) and <code>float</code> is that integers do not carry decimal points.</p>
<p>Additionally, as @officialaimm mentioned you need to remove the commas too, for example</p>
<pre><code>float('$3,333.33'.replace('$', '').replace(',', ''))
</code></pre>
<p>will give you</p>
<pre><code>3333.33
</code></pre>
<p>So putting it into your code</p>
<pre><code>print(float(col_ammount2.lstrip('$').replace(',', ''))
      - float(col_ammount.lstrip('$').replace(',', '')))
</code></pre>
<p>An additional note for when you parse a floating point number (same applies to integers too), you may want to watch out for empty values, i.e.</p>
<pre><code>float('')
</code></pre>
<p>is bad. One of the things u can do in case <code>col_amount</code> and <code>col_amount2</code> may be empty at some point is default them to <code>0</code> if that happens</p>
<pre><code>float(col_amount.lstrip(...).replace(...) or 0)
</code></pre>

<p>There are two things you are missing here. Firstly python <code>int(...)</code> cannot parse numbers with commas so you will need to remove commas as well by using <code>.replace(',','')</code>. Secondly <code>int()</code> cannot parse floating point values you will have to use <code>float(...)</code> first and after that maybe typecast it to int using <code>int</code> or <code>math.ceil</code>, <code>math.floor</code> appropriately as per your choice and needs. </p>
<p>Maybe something like this will solve your problem: </p>
<pre><code>col_ammount2='$1,587.30'
col_ammount = '$2,567.67'
print(int(float(col_ammount2.lstrip('$').replace(',','')))-int(float(col_ammount.lstrip('$').replace(',',''))))
</code></pre>
<p>If you are doing these sorts of things quite often in your code, making a function as such might be handy:</p>
<pre><code>integerify_currency = lambda x:int(float(x.lstrip('$').replace(',',''))) 
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">what is the input and expected output? do you want to retain the decimal points or round it up/down?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">actually i have an excel file where i get data in this form $470.21  $1,788.98 i want adding and subtracting this type of values. and want print them in same format.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">this is working.one more thing this code i use for calculation but after that how can i get data back in original format ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">if u mean turning it back to string then just use <code>str</code>, i.e. <code>str(33.3)</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">also there's this <a href="https://github.com/jmoiron/humanize" rel="nofollow noreferrer">github.com/jmoiron/humanize</a></span>

<span class="comment-copy">@habib original form?? you mean including dollar-sign and commas??</span>
