<p>What is the correct python syntax for searching by artist with Spotify's API? Maybe I'm missing something obvious (been staring at this for way too long)  </p>
<p>Per documentation, header 'authorization' &amp; param 'q' and 'type' are required.<br/>
<a href="https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/search-item/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/search-item/</a> </p>
<p>What I've tried:  </p>
<pre><code>artist_name = 'Linkin%20Park'
artist_info = requests.get('https://api.spotify.com/v1/search', header = {'access_token': access_token}, q = artist_name, type = 'artist')

ERROR: TypeError: requests() got an unexpected keyword argument 'q'
</code></pre>
<p>Then I thought, maybe the parameters has to be sent as a list?:</p>
<pre><code>artist_info = requests.get('https://api.spotify.com/v1/search', header = {'access_token': access_token}, query = list(q = artist_name, type = 'artist'))
</code></pre>
<p>But:</p>
<pre><code>ERROR: TypeError: list() takes at most 1 argument (2 given)
</code></pre>

<p>A list is a list, not a hybrid of a map and a list, such as in PHP. The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-list" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>list()</code> builtin</a> accepts either 0 or 1 positional argument, which should be an iterable. I'd highly recommend you go through the official <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">tutorial</a>.</p>
<p>You're probably using the <a href="http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">python-requests</a> library. In order to pass query parameters such as the <code>q</code> parameter, <a href="http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/quickstart/#passing-parameters-in-urls" rel="nofollow noreferrer">you'd pass a <code>dict</code> of parameters as the <code>params</code> argument</a>:</p>
<pre><code>artist_info = requests.get(
    'https://api.spotify.com/v1/search',
    headers={ 'access_token': access_token },
    params={ 'q': artist_name, 'type': 'artist' })
</code></pre>
<p>Note that the headers argument <a href="http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/quickstart/#custom-headers" rel="nofollow noreferrer">must be in its plural form, not "header"</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, you might be interested in <a href="https://github.com/plamere/spotipy/blob/master/README.md" rel="nofollow noreferrer">spotipy</a>, a simple client for the Spotify web API.</p>

<p>@Ilja's answer is good. Alternatively, you can embed the params in the URL (since you have only two of them and both relatively short), example:</p>
<pre><code>artist_info = requests.get('https://api.spotify.com/v1/search?q={}&amp;type={}'.format(artist_name, 'artist'), header = {'access_token': access_token})
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>@Ilja's and @alfasin's answers provide good guidance but don't seem to work anymore as is. </p>
<p>You have to change to the <code>headers</code> params to <code>authorization</code> and add the string <code>Bearer</code>. </p>
<p>This works for me:</p>
<pre><code>artist_info = requests.get('https://api.spotify.com/v1/search',
    headers={ 'authorization': "Bearer " + token}, 
    params={ 'q': artist_name, 'type': 'artist' })
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">This is exactly what I was looking for :) Thanks. I also had to fix a type error because access_token and artist_name were variables instead of str. Does that mean I have to hard code values in the params, or is there a way to put a variable in there?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Nah, the variables most probably just contained something else than you expected them to. As usual, hard to say from just "type error" :P</span>
