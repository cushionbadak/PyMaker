<p>Trying out Python here and I have question about the use of functions on lists.
I`m currently running into trouble with an assignment to check new usernames against current users. What I want to do is change the values in the list to lower cases so that if a new user "Kim" is not accepted since there is a current user "kim". Here is my code:</p>
<pre><code>new_users.lower() = ["Jeroen","naj","Kim","henk","ayla","nimda"]

current_users.lower() = ["Jeroen","jan","kim","henk","ayla","admin"]

for new_user in new_users:
    if new_user in current_users:
        print("\tHello, " + new_user + ". Please choose a different username")       
   else:
        print("\nHello "+ new_user + " We accept your username. Welcome.")
</code></pre>
<p>Unfortunately Python gives me the following error: "can't assign to function call". But I have no idea what Python means with this. Why can`t I use a simple lowercase function on the values in a list before I check them in my for loop?
Please explain / help.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You have to iterate through the list and convert each string to lower(). You can do this with list comprehension: </p>
<pre><code>new_users = ["Jeroen","naj","Kim","henk","ayla","nimda"]
new_users = [s.lower() for s in new_users]
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Firstly You are assigning value for function call.</p>
<pre><code>new_users.lower() 
</code></pre>
<p>is function call.</p>
<p>You can achieve what you what to do like this.
lets say the current users are in the following list</p>
<pre><code>current_users = ["Jeroen","jan","kim","henk","ayla","admin"]
current_users_lower=[ x.lower() for x in current_users]
</code></pre>
<p>and new user be in the following list</p>
<pre><code>new_users = ["Jeroen","naj","Kim","henk","ayla","nimda"]
new_users_lower=[x.lower() for x in new_users]
</code></pre>
<p>you can now do the following</p>
<pre><code>for new_user in new_users_lower:
    if new_user in current_users_lower:
        print("\tHello, " + new_user + ". Please choose a different username")       
   else:
        print("\nHello "+ new_user + " We accept your username. Welcome.")
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>As @timgeb said, maybe you should go through some python basic tutorial first.</p>
<p>But what you want to do here can be done with a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#map" rel="nofollow noreferrer">map</a> :</p>
<pre><code>raw_list = ["Paul", "marc", "HenrY"]
list(map(lambda x: x.lower(), raw_list))
</code></pre>
<p>It will return:</p>
<pre><code>Out[2]: ['paul', 'marc', 'henry']
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Unfortunately, I think if you are stumped by the fact that you can't assign to a function call, you need more help than we can provide in a short answer. Giving you a oneliner to build a list of lower case strings won't help you. You need to work through a tutorial before you will be able to ask good questions here.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">try <code>new_users = [x.lower() for x in ["Jeroen","naj","Kim","henk","ayla","nimda"]]</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for your help. This is an question from a tutorial after the section that explains if/else functions. Unfortunately I didn<code>t read or made an exercise explaining the difference of calling a function or making a list. Thanks for the answer and I</code>ll delve into it a bit more. Hopefully this stuff gets explained.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks MedAli, I`ll give it a try :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks Mitiku, as I see it now I need to perform the function independently from the values assigned to the list? Thanks again.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">map/list comprehension is way out of OP's league. He should learn how to write a <code>for</code> loop today, that's tough enough for now. The vanilla one. Create empty list and append to it in a loop.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Indeed, but he will hold the cards to achieve <i>everything</i> he wants now!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for the help. Have not yet come across the mapping in the book but I`ll give it a try :)</span>
