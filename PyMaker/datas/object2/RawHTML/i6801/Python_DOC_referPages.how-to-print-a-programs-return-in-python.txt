<p>I am completely new to Python. </p>
<p>I have a simple Program that finds the greatest common denominator (GCD) of two numbers. It goes like this</p>
<pre><code>def gcd(a, b):
 if a == b:
     return a
 else:
     if a &gt; b:
         return gcd(a-b, b)
     else:
         return gcd(a, b-a)
</code></pre>
<p>This text is currently in a notepad document titled <code>gcd.py</code> on my desktop. As you can see the program doesn't actually print anything it just returns the greatest common denominator. </p>
<p>I need to actually print the results by doing the following <code>print(gcd(25,10))</code>. I don't know where I can put that line to get the results I need. I tried inputting it into the windows command line by doing <code>python print(gcd(25,10))</code>. But that doesn't work. Neither does <code>print(gcd(25,10))</code> in the python interpreter. </p>
<p>I think I am supposed to put it in the python interpreter, but that the interpreter has to be set to the correct directory of my desktop (where the gcd file is found)but I cant seem to do that. I tried <code>o.chdir</code> and when I <code>print(cwd)</code> it prints the correct directory but it still doesn't work.</p>
<p>This is my first time using python so I'm a little confused. </p>

<p>Try this. You need to print it out in the same file or import it from another:</p>
<pre><code>def gcd(a, b):

 if a == b:

     return a

 else:

     if a &gt; b:

         return gcd(a-b, b)

     else:

         return gcd(a, b-a)

print(gcd(25,10))
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you want to print from inside the file, put this line at the end after the function definition as suggested in the previous answer.</p>
<p>If you want to print from outside the file, navigate to the directory and type:</p>
<pre><code>from gcd import gcd
</code></pre>
<p>This will load your function into the interpreter. You can then print the value.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Are you trying to have it take input from the terminal and then print out the answer? Please clarify what you want to do.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I think you need to take a little look-see at the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs</a>...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">There's a reasonably good tutorial at Python.org. You should take the time to work your way through it. This isn't a tutorial site.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">But what If I don't want the two numbers too always be 25 and 10. What if I want to input the numbers in the console.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Then you can import from the console like the other answer says</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Just be in the same directory as the file and type: <code>from gcd import gcd</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Do I still include the "print(gcd(25,10))" at the end or do I remove it?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Remove it from the file. You can type it in the console</span>
