<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I am a beginner in Python , I tried to understand how this (2nd line) works.
Is it comparing the lowercase letters based on the key (which is the repetition of the letter in the text string) ?</p>
<pre><code>    text = text.lower()
    return max(string.ascii_lowercase, key=text.count)
</code></pre>
<p>From documentation , I found max(arg1, arg2, *args[, key])
but there is no definition for what is the key in the function </p>
<p>What are the guidelines for the key in the max function &amp; is that key related to the dictionary keys in Python ?</p>
<p>Thanks for illustration</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>For every character in <code>string.ascii_lowercase</code>, this calls <code>text.count()</code>, and picks the character for which <code>text.count()</code> has returned the highest count.</p>
<p>In other words, this finds the lowercase ASCII letter that occurs in <code>text</code> most frequently.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The key is the criteria in which the <code>max()</code> function will consider a maximum (the criteria used when comparing elements), so when <code>key=text.count</code>, you're having the following conversation with <code>max()</code> :</p>
<ul>
<li>you : Get the maximum letter.</li>
<li><code>max()</code> : what do you consider a maximum letter.</li>
<li>you : the maximum letter is the letter that has the most count.</li>
</ul>

<span class="comment-copy">Look over the documentation for the built-in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html?highlight=max#max" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>max</code></a> function</span>
<span class="comment-copy">There is almost certainly a description of the named <code>key</code> parameter.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">did you read the docs?  The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/sorting.html#key-functions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">key function for sorting</a> provides a similar function.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">"The key argument specifies a one-argument ordering function like that used for list.sort()".</span>
<span class="comment-copy">in docs , only <code>key=keyfunc</code> is written , so I didn't understand this. I have already checked docs for the max function , but the key part is still ambiguous for me , is it the same as the python keys of the dictionary ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for illustrating , for the <b>key</b> is it the same as the python keys of the dictionary ? what are the guidelines for that key ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@AhmedElkoussy: It's a callable that gets applied to every element. <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#max" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#max</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you , I got lost by the other definitions (iterable, ...) &amp; mixed up with the dictionary keys</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for illustration</span>
