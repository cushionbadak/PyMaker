<p>I am having troubles importing many (but not all!) modules in python.
I am very new to python. I have read up  about setting pythonpath. I did it as this:</p>
<pre><code>import sys
sys.path.append("pathtomypythoninstallation")
print sys.path
</code></pre>
<p>still I get error:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import numpy
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'numpy'
</code></pre>
<p>My OS: OS X 10.9.5, using python 3.6</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Try installing Numpy library. Enter this in the terminal:</p>
<pre><code>pip3 install numpy
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Hi I think you will be more successful using a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">virtual environment</a> try this on a shell (if you are using python3):
</p>
<pre><code>$ python3 -m venv myenv
$ source myenv/bin/activate
$ pip install numpy
$ pip install pymvpa2
$ python -c 'import numpy'
</code></pre>
<p>Remind the prepending $ has to be removed as it only means you should run the command as your usual user.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">you can check if <code>numpy</code> is installed using <code>pip show numpy</code> on the command line.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Happy numpy worked. But now I try to install mvpa2 from here with command pip install mvpa, or in python import mpva2.suite, <a href="http://www.pymvpa.org/examples/searchlight.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">pymvpa.org/examples/searchlight.html</a>. It does not work. Error:    InsecurePlatformWarning   Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement mpva2.suite (from versions: ) No matching distribution found for mpva2.suite You are using pip version 7.1.2, however version 9.0.1 is available. You should consider upgrading via the 'pip install --upgrade pip' command.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">try upgrading your pip installation:    "pip install --upgrade pip"</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I did that already, so I don't know why this always shows up..path mismatch?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I will try now! Do you manage download mvpa2 from my comment above? Never works for me..</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I have added also instructions to install pymvpa2</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you. But: no module called venv. And it seems when I try to install venc same problem. I tried: pip install venv</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That's odd, venv is part of the core python library since 3.3 Are you sure your python version is 3.6?  <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html</a></span>
