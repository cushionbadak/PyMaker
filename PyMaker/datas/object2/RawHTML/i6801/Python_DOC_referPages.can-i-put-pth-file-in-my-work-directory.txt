<p>I write <code>gettime.py</code> in <code>mymodule</code>, I'd import <code>gettime</code> in <code>helloworld</code>. I write <code>"G:\\code\\Python\\hello\\mymodule"</code> in <code>mypath.pth</code>. 
Can I put <code>mypath.pth</code> in the directory <code>"G:\code\Python\hello"</code>?</p>

<p>No, it won't work, per <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/site.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the <code>site</code> documentation</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A path configuration file is a file whose name has the form name.pth and exists in one of the four directories mentioned above.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The four directories mentioned "above" are specific to the Python install, they're not related to the working directory. It's actually more than four (they're not including the optional user site-packages directory for instance), but the list is not arbitrarily long, and the working directory is never involved in determining what <code>.pth</code> files to use.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You <i>could</i> implement a <code>sitecustomize</code> module which implements something like this (or make a package which installs a <code>.pth</code> file into site-packages which implements something like this) -- sounds insane but I've seen a (closed source) package which bootstraps a dev environment that does just this.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@AnthonySottile: Yeah, if you're at that point, you could do it, but it's not just a "drop .pth in working directory, stuff works" solution. It's a "use hooks to execute arbitrary code" solution, and answering with "arbitrary code can do whatever you want" feels like cheating. :-)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The <code>site</code> documentation gives you a way to do this with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/site.html#site.addsitedir" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>site.addsitedir</code></a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@AnthonySottile: Yar. Though again, you'd have to gain execution in some way before you could do it. Normally, if you're in such a position, the better solution is to install the package to a normal location (global or user site-packages, or a virtualenv); if you're hoping to have <code>.pth</code> files automatically processed, it sounds more like a hack to avoid installation, when the real answer is "just install it!".</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I totally agree that it's a -bad- <b>terrible</b> idea :) just wanted to dispute that it's impossible.</span>
