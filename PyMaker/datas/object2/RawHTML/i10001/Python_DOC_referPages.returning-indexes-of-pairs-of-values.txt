<p>I'm trying to create a function that takes a list of numbers and a number b and will print the indexes of all pairs of values in the list that sum to b. My code so far includes the list operations</p>
<pre><code>def pairSum(a,b):
    for i in a:
        for j in a:
            if i+j==b: 
</code></pre>
<p>it should run like this</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt;pairSum([7,8,5,3,4,6], 11)
0 4
1 3
2 5
</code></pre>
<p>Note that it returns the positions of the values in the list and not the actual numbers and this is what I cannot wrap my head around.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Use <code>enumerate</code></p>
<pre><code>for i, x in enumerate(a): #i is index of x
    for j, y in enumerate(a[i+1:], start=i+1): #j is index of y
        if x+y == b:
            print(i, j)
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>a[i+1:]</code> is to prevent duplicates and to stop values from being added to themselves.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">This is usually referred to as two sum problem. Googling for two sum will give you a lot of explanations and solutions to the problem.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Your code is incomplete, it does not print or return anything.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I am aware of this. My problem is in returning the output.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you very much. Your answer helped. I feel silly not thinking about enumerate.</span>
