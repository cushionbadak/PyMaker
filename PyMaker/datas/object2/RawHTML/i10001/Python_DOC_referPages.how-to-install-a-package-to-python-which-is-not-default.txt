<p>I am trying to add zlib package to my python. However, after I install it using "yum install zlib", only the default python (which is python 2.4.3) can import it. While the other python (3.4.4) still cannot use zlib.</p>
<p>When I try to import zlib in python 3.4.4 by</p>
<blockquote>
<p>import zlib</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It displays</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Traceback (most recent call last):</p>
<p>File "&lt; stdin &gt;", line 1, in </p>
<p>ImportError: No module named 'zlib'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My question is, how can I install package to python which is not default?</p>
<p>PS. I installed both zlib and zlib-devel</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>You might need to install the <code>zlib-devel</code> package as well: <code>yum install zlib-devel</code>.
Otherwise you need to post the full error message when you try to run <code>import zlib</code>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>"yum install zlib"</code> installs library for Linux, not module for Python.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I think you might need <code>zlib-devel</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">module <code>zlib</code> is in python standard library. See: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/zlib.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">zlib</a>. Do you get error when you <code>import zlib</code> ? Always add full error message in question.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I installed zib-devel as well and still have the problem. The error information is updated. Thank you so much for your help</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you so much for your help. I've posted the error message. And I did install zlib-devel but seems it doesn't fix the problem</span>
