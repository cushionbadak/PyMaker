<p>I have a Windows app originally written in Python 3.4 with PyQt4 which had stderr redirected to a dialog box by means of signals and slots.  <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28505462/display-stderr-in-a-pyqt-qmessagebox">This posting</a> describes how I got it working (see the final code at the end).  It worked great, catching all the nice detailed stderr messages you would normally see on the console.  Here is a typical screen shot:
<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GAx16.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img alt="enter image description here" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GAx16.png"/></a></p>
<p>When I installed Python 3.5.2, PyQt5, and upgraded several of my packages, though, it no longer worked.  Now when I hit an error my entire app shuts down immediately and I have no way to trace the error.</p>
<p>When I run my app in the pydev debugger, however, my nice windowed stderr messages are back.  I have the debugger set to break on all errors, which it does, and this allows my windowed stderr text to appear.</p>
<p>There is another way to get the windowed error messages back, too: revert one of my core packages (lmfit) from the most recent 0.9.5 to the earlier 0.9.3 I was using.</p>
<p>Can anyone suggest what might be happening?  I've asked the lmfit developers what they might have changed and tried a dozen different alternatives with no luck.</p>

<p>Filtering stderr messages is somewhat hackish. Use an <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.excepthook" rel="nofollow">excepthook</a> to centralise the processing of unhandled exceptions. The <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/traceback.html" rel="nofollow">traceback</a> module can be used for formatting the exceptions in various ways.</p>
<p>If you also want to process Qt messages, use <a href="http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtglobal.html#qInstallMessageHandler" rel="nofollow">qInstallMessageHandler</a>. To format these messages, you can use <a href="http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtglobal.html#qFormatLogMessage" rel="nofollow">qFormatLogMessage</a> and <a href="http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtglobal.html#qSetMessagePattern" rel="nofollow">qSetMessagePattern</a>. All these functions are in the QtCore module.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">@ekumoro -- thank you, it looks like this will provide the same information I get from stderr.  I will work it out and report back.</span>
