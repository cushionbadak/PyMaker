<p>I have a Python web crawler which is downloading files with different extensions. To get the extension from the HTTP header content type, I am using the Python library <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/mimetypes.html#module-mimetypes1" rel="nofollow noreferrer">mimetypes</a>.</p>
<pre><code>http_header = session.head(url, headers={'Accept-Encoding': 'identity'})
extension = mimetypes.guess_extension(http_header.headers['content-type'])
</code></pre>
<p>Everything is working fine, except when the HTTP header content type contains<br/>
<code>;charset=UTF-8</code>. E.g. <code>mimetypes.guess_extension</code> is returning <code>None</code> for the following examples</p>
<pre><code>content-type: text/plain;charset=UTF-8 # extension should be .txt OR  
content-type: text/x-c;charset=UTF-8   # extension should be .java
</code></pre>
<p>Check with mimetypes:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import mimetypes
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(mimetypes.guess_extension('text/plain;charset=UTF-8'))
None
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Question: How do I handle this and get the correct extension from content-types ending with <code>;charset=UTF-8</code>?</strong> </p>
<p>I guess it is not a good solution to catch such exceptions with an if statement since I never know if the whitelist is complete or whether I am missing some content-type.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>One simple way to deal with that is to split the MIME string and get only the first element.</p>
<p>The following code will return the expected result for both conditions.</p>
<pre><code>http_header = session.head(url, headers={'Accept-Encoding': 'identity'})
extension = mimetypes.guess_extension(http_header.headers['content-type'].split(";")[0])))
</code></pre>
<p>Remember it is a guess. You can't expect much from it for such broad definitions such as plain text. It seems like mimetypes.guess_extension() just takes the first element of this list. This is also the reason guessing the mimetype of text/plain returns .h when .txt is the obvious choice.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for your answer, unfortunately this doesn't work. For <code>text/plain;charset=UTF-8</code> I get <code>.ksh</code> instead of <code>.txt</code> as a result. For <code>text/plain;charset=UTF-8</code> I get <code>.c</code> instead of <code>.java</code>.</span>
