<p>How do I remove punctuation from a string in python? I followed the approach that someone posted on Stackoverflow, but it is not working. </p>
<pre><code>punctuation = ['(', ')', '?', ':', ':', ',', '.', '!', '/', '"', "'"]

str = input("Hi, my name is Yael Shapiro!")

for i in punctuation:
    str = str.replace(i,"")

print(str)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I find using a combination of <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/364802/generator-comprehension">gencomp</a> and <code>"".join()</code> works well:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import string
&gt;&gt;&gt; s = "Does this string. Have punctuation?"
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; "".join((char for char in s if char not in string.punctuation))
'Does this string Have punctuation'
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
</code></pre>
<p>And as a side note, do not use <code>str</code> as an identifier as it <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=str#str" rel="nofollow noreferrer">already has a meaning in the Python language</a>.</p>
<p>The reason that your code is not working, is probably because you're misunderstanding what <code>input()</code> does. <code>input()</code> simply gets input from the user and returns the input. It looks to me that all you want to do is have a string, in which just do: <code>sstr = "Hi, my name is Yael Shapiro!"</code></p>

<span class="comment-copy"><i>"not working"</i> is a completely useless problem description</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Also, do not use built-ins as variable names. <code>str</code> is a built-in, and you will certainly run in to problems shadowing built-in names.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks so much! So I am changing it to the following, but it is still not removing the punctuation:    import string sstr = "Hi, my name is Yael Shapiro!"  "".join((char for char in sstr if char not in string.punctuation)) print(sstr)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You need to assign the value of <code>sstr</code> to your stripped string. In other words, use <code>sstr = ".join((char for char in sstr if char not in string.punctuation)) </code> instead of <code>".join((char for char in sstr if char not in string.punctuation)) </code>.</span>
