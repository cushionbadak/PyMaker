<p>I want to write a python code that can fetch out Devanagari text from the given string, but I don't know how to use Unicode for the same.<br/>
My input will be in this form  </p>

<p>I want text written in Devanagari only not that numbers or English alphabets.<br/>
My output should be in this form<br/>
अंक  अ  ं  ं(क  क  </p>
<p>I Have tried this code   </p>
<pre><code>import codecs

file = codecs.open("C:/Users/prince/Desktop/hindi.txt",mode = "r", encoding = "utf-8")
file_dic = codecs.open("C:/Users/prince/Desktop/dic.txt",mode = "w", encoding = "utf-8")
for i in range (0, 330):
    u = file.read()
    if (u[i] &gt;= 0900) &amp;&amp; (u[i]&lt;= 097F):
        file_dic.write(u)
        file_dic.write('  ')
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>A regular expression will keep your Devanagari text together.  Your example would print spaces between every character.  Below also adds the Devanagari Extended range in Unicode as well:</p>
<pre><code>#!python3
#coding:utf8

import re

text = '''\
Translate 'अंक'  
36  अ       [V]  
36  ं       [n]  
57  ं  (क [N]

'''

print(' '.join(re.findall(r'[\u0900-\u097f\ua8e0-\ua8ff]+',text)))
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>अंक अ ं ं क क
</code></pre>
<p>Writing to the files in your example:</p>
<pre><code>import re

with open("C:/Users/prince/Desktop/hindi.txt",mode = "r", encoding = "utf-8") as file:
    text = file.read()
with open("C:/Users/prince/Desktop/dic.txt",mode = "w", encoding = "utf-8") as file_dic:
    file_dic.write(' '.join(re.findall(r'[\u0900-\u097f\ua8e0-\ua8ff]+',text)))

<span class="comment-copy">Can you provide a more specific example, perhaps some sample code that you've tried?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I did not get any information on how to use Unicode value of text in python. I have included code in question. @Daenyth</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sir can you please explain   <code>{ print(' '.join(re.findall(r'[\u0900-\u097f\ua8e0-\ua8ff]+',text))) }</code> this piece of code. And sir I also want to include some symbols in my output like [ '(' ,  ')' , '_' and 'B' ]. How can I include them in output @MarkTolonen</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">re</a> is a module that implements <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntax" rel="nofollow noreferrer">regular expressions</a>.  <code>[\u0900-\u097f\ua8e0-\ua8ff]+</code> matches one or more Unicode characters in the ranges 900h-97fh and a8e0h-a8ffh.  <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.findall" rel="nofollow noreferrer">findall</a> returns a list of the matching strings, and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.join" rel="nofollow noreferrer">join</a> merges the list of strings into a single string separated by spaces.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you sir. Sir what about including those extra symbols and alphabets in output?  I am making a dictionary for speech recognition so I need those extra symbols in my dictionary. So please help me out with that thing also.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Prince your question does not include how you want the extra symbols in your output.  Ask a new question with a new example.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">To trim extra symbols also with Devanagari text just add them to the range class and the new range class will be  <code>[\u0900-\u097f\ua8e0-\ua8ff()_B]</code></span>
