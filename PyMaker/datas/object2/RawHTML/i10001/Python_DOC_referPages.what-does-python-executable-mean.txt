<p>I'm writting something about 'sys.prefix', related with <strong>PEP405</strong>.
What does 'Python executable' mean in this <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0405/#specification" rel="nofollow">specification</a>?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This PEP proposes to add a new first step to this search. If a pyvenv.cfg file is found either adjacent to the <strong>Python executable</strong> or one directory above it (if the executable is a symlink, it is not dereferenced), this file is scanned for lines of the form key = value . ...</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The "Python executable" in Python documentation and specifications is either the <code>python</code> binary itself or a symlink to the binary. The exception is <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.executable" rel="nofollow"><code>sys.executable</code></a>, which always returns the executable that was used to invoke the interpreter even though the documentation states "executable binary".</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>It just means a python script which you can call in some manner. That pyvenv is a virtual environment created by python.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">It is not necessary to be the file that can be used to invoke python compiler,isn't it?</span>
