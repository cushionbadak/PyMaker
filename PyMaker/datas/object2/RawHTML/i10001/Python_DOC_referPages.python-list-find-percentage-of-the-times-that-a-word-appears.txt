<p>I have a list in python: <code>[adam,josh,drake]</code>
I want to output the percentage of the times that a word is used out of all of the words(eg. adam-33%, josh 33% etc.). So that if I add a word to the list, the percentage will change accordingly. </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.Counter" rel="nofollow"><code>collections.Counter</code></a> to count how often each word occurs.</p>
<p>Then you can iterate through the resulting object and divide each count by the length of the original list to get a decimal percentage from 0.0 to 1.0, which can be multiplied by 100 to give a percentage between 0 and 100 to be printed out.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You should look at the collections module, in particular <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.Counter" rel="nofollow">https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.Counter</a></p>
<pre><code>from collections import Counter

names = ['adam','josh','drake']

count = Counter(names).items()

percentages = {x: int(float(y) / len(names) * 100) for x, y in count}

for name, pct in percentages.iteritems():
    print '%s - %s%s' % (name, pct, '%')
</code></pre>
<p>The <em>items</em> method on the Counter produces a list of tuples of the name and the number of times that name appears in the original list.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Edit the question and post your code, my suggestion would be to run a loop or two through the list and get the frequency of each name then divide that by the total number of names in the list for each name</span>
<span class="comment-copy">How do I print it out later?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">for name, pct in percentages.iteritems():     print '%s: %s' % (name, pct)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That would be one name and count per line, but there are lots of ways to print it out. What sort of output were you wanting to get?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">adam - 33%  josh  - 33%</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I will assume that means one per line.</span>
