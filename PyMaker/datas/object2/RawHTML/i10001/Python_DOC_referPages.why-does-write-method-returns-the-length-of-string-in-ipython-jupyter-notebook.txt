<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I've seen some strange (at least for me) behavior while using write() method in Ipython as well as Jupyter notebook:</p>
<pre><code>In [1]: f = open('test.txt','w')
In [2]: f.write("This is the first line")
Out[2]: 22
</code></pre>
<p>It is actually returning the length of the string which I wrote in the file.</p>
<p><em>I am bit curious about this behavior. Can someone please explain why this happens?</em></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This is not something specific to IPython.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html?highlight=write#io.TextIOBase.write" rel="nofollow"><code>write()</code></a> method returns the number of characters written. 
The reason you are seeing this is because you are using an interpreter.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">because it's in the specification of the <code>write</code> method maybe? and when you run this in an interactive interpreter you always get the return values (unless it's <code>None</code>)</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html?highlight=write#io.TextIOBase.write" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>write()</code></a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">It does exactly what it is documented to do so what is your actual question?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@PadraicCunningham Didn't actually look at the documentation carefully. Apologies!!!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You can suppress that kind of display with <code>;</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It was a silly question out of negligence! Anyways thanks for pointing towards the documentation.</span>
