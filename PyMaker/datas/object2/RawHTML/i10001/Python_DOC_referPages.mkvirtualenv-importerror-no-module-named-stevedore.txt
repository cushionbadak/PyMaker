set properly.

<p>Curious and curiouser.</p>
<p>Any suggestions on what's going wrong and how to fix this?</p>
<p>Thanks

<p>I was very confused with this problem, too. And I have solved it by uninstalling the old stevedore and reinstall it.</p>
<pre><code>sudo pip uninstall stevedore
sudo pip install stevedore

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Looks like you managed to install virtualwrapper without <code>stevedore</code>, which is a dependency. Try installing it.</p>
<pre><code>pip install stevedore

<span class="comment-copy">Hi, thanks for that. Unfortunately I've tried all suggestions on that and it doesn't seem to work for me. So the first answer says the ~ in the PATH was causing an issue. But my $PATH is <code>/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/opt/X11/bin</code>. Another answer says that I need to put the path of where the virtualenv is installed into my PATH. But virtualenv is in /usr/local/bin - and my PATH, as mentioned above, does have that path. Third answer said the python path is in different location. So I changed bash_profile (in question above now) to specify python path but it gives another error</span>
<span class="comment-copy">python on the mac is here: <code>which -a python</code> <code>/usr/local/bin/python</code> <code>/usr/bin/python</code> which is what I set my VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_PYTHON to in the bash_profile (updated question with those details) but it gives similar error. 4th answer says he had virtualenv installed via easy_install so he had to install it via pip. I don't know how virtualenv was installed on my machine (or how I can check) but it was in /usr/local/bin so I uninstalled with <code>sudo /usr/local/bin/pip uninstall virtualenv</code> and then installed via <code>sudo /usr/local/bin/pip install virtualenv</code> but didn't help.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Last suggestion said he didn't have it installed, but I do have it. Any other suggestions?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Do you really need <code>stevedore</code> or is it a <code>can</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The stranger part is that nothing changed in the system, yet suddenly this stopped working until reinstalling it :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hi, thanks for the response (and sorry if you got lots of notifications about edits on this comment!!). It seems stevedore is already installed - but with some warnings (on sudo pip install) and errors (on sudo -H pip install). Maybe it's a permission issue? (I've updated my main question with the details of the pip install as it seems the formatting via comments are limited). Thank you!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ok that is messed up. Your installation attempt with sudo [without -H] shows that it is installed for the user. That it doesn't work with sudo -H presumably is a "feature" of MacOS and probably the fix for that is here: [<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/32661637/6930916]">stackoverflow.com/a/32661637/6930916]</a>. My personal strategy to deal with that mess is to have the essentials (in this case virtualenv, virtualwrapper) installed on the system level, everything else in the virtualenv where it is needed, and not install anything on the user level (don't use pip install --user).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you want to follow that path, clean out everything under $HOME/Library/Python, get proper admin rights, and install virtualwrapper for the system (sudo -H pip install). Otherwise you might want to have a look at environment variable <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONPATH" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PYTHONPATH</a> so that the modules installed for User are found.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">So I did a search for stevedore and I got <code>sudo find / -name stevedore</code> <code>/Users/sidharthnayyar/Library/Python/2.7/lib/python/site-packages/stevedore</code>. Could this be the issue? I.e. it's not in /usr/local/bin?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sorry I didn't see your message until after I had posted the comment. Sorry, I'm a newbie on Mac but when you saying "clean out" I presume it's just a case of deleting? Or can I do a pip uninstall (/usr/local/bin/pip?)? I checked System Preferences and apparently my account is an admin - do you mean do what that stackoverflow answer suggested and "csrutil disable"? They also said not to do it unless you are not a newbie! .. it's got me worried! :)</span>
