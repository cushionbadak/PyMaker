<p>I'm using bisect to find first occurence of datapoint &gt; -6, but when I run my script it only finds the second (and last) occurence.  </p>
<pre><code>    import bisect

    kk = [-9, -6, -4, -6, -8, -8, -7, -7, -6, -6, -5]

    first = bisect.bisect(kk, -6)
    print(first)
</code></pre>
<p>This piece of code outputs "10" but should be "2". Can anyone tell me why?
I'm sorry in advance for a propably stupid question - I'm VERY new to Python!</p>

<p>As <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the documentation</a> says (emphasis added):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This module provides support for <strong>maintaining</strong> a list in sorted order</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You have to sort your list before you can do anything with <code>bisect</code>.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>bisect</code> performs binary search, so it assumes that your list is sorted. Yours isn't sorted.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Okay - so how would I find the index of the first time data reaches threshold?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Blochio either sort your list, or do a linear search</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Blochio: I'm not sure what you think <code>bisect</code> does or why you're using it here.  If you have a question about how to do something (like how to find the first occurrence of a given value in a list), then ask that question directly instead of asking about <code>bisect</code>.</span>
