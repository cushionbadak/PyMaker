<p>I want the user to input in 8 digits followed by a space and another single digit number. If the entered number is part of my pre made list, then the program would output the name of that item and how much of the user wants to purchase. </p>
<p>Here is my code</p>
<pre><code>orange = 12345670
pineapple = 87654325
items = [orange, pineapple]
print("Input a 8 digit number followed by a space and a 1 digit number")
print("E.g. 12345670 2")
c = input("Number: ")
c1 = int(c[0])
c2 = int(c[1])
c3 = int(c[2])
c4 = int(c[3])
c5 = int(c[4])
c6 = int(c[5])
c7 = int(c[6])
c8 = int(c[7])
c9 = int(c[9])
c10 = (str(c1)+str(c2)+str(c3)+str(c4)+str(c5)+str(c6)+str(c7)+str(c8))
if str(c10) not in items:
    print("Item not found")
else:
    print("That would be "+str(c9)+" of "+str(c10))
</code></pre>
<p>The problem is that, </p>
<ul>
<li>It always outputs <code>Item not found</code> </li>
<li>If it <em>does</em> work, it outputs <code>That would be *x* of number inputted</code> instead of <code>That would be *x* of orange/pineapple</code>.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you are going to use these numbers as lookups, I would store it in a <code>dict</code>, which is what that data structure is for.</p>
<pre><code>foods = {12345670 : 'orange',
         87654325 : 'pineapple'}
</code></pre>
<p>Then you could do something like this</p>
<pre><code>c = '12345670 2'
item, count = c.split()
item = int(item)

if item in foods:
    print('That would be {} of {}'.format(count, foods[item]))
else:
    print('Item not found')
</code></pre>
<p>Output</p>
<pre><code>That would be 2 of orange
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>c10</code> is a string, while <code>items</code> is a list of <i>integers</i>!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You should look at dicts and the split function.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'd encourage you to move away from dealing with individual characters and treat the entire number (both numbers, in fact) as an <code>int</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Oh great thanks! But because im kind of new to python could you explain why you did what?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Which line specifically are you unclear about?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">print('That would be {} of {}'.format(count, foods[item]))</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The syntax <code>foods[item]</code> is how you <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries" rel="nofollow noreferrer">lookup an item by its key from a <code>dict</code></a>. The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/string.html#string.Formatter.format" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>format</code></a> method allows you to insert values into a string without a bunch of concatenations.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">ohh okay thanks :D</span>
