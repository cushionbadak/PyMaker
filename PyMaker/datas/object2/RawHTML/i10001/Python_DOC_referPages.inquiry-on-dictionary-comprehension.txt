<p>The following code is a bit from a bigger piece. lines is a 2D list and keyss is a 1D list. All element in lines is the same length as keyss.</p>
<pre><code>datadict = []
for element in lines:
    for index in range(len(element)):
        datadict.append({keyss[index]: element[index]})
</code></pre>
<p>I was wondering if there was a way of writing this using dictionary comprehension? This is more of a curious question as the shown code works just fine for what I'm doing. I've been trying and couldn't find a way too. If you can could go over the syntax of how it would look a bit as well, Thanks!</p>
<p>EDIT#1:</p>
<p>Reading through the responses, I realized it wasn't really working. I'm trying to do a list comprehension where every element is a dictionary comprehension. I'm not entirely sure if that is possible or not. I want to make a list of dictionaries where I take every element in keyss and match index for index in a element in lines which is a list, if that makes sense.</p>
<p>EDIT #2:
I found <code>data_list = [{keyss[i]:row[i] for i in range(len(keyss))} for row in lines]</code> to work.</p>

<p>A dictionary comprehension creates a dictionary. You want a <em>list</em> comprehension:</p>
<pre><code>datalist = [{keyss[index]:element[index]}) for element in lines
            for index in range(len(element))]
</code></pre>
<p>You can find the documentation on the syntax <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#displays-for-lists-sets-and-dictionaries" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Your current code doesn't create a dictionary, but if that was your intent, this can be accomplished by</p>
<pre><code>dict(zip(keyss, elements))
</code></pre>
<p>or the dictionary comprehension</p>
<pre><code>{key: value for key, value in zip(keyss, elements)}
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>As mentioned by eugene, it will be <em>list comprehension</em> and not dict comprehension. You may further simplify the code by using <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#zip" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>zip()</code></a> as you need the from <code>element</code> and <code>keyss</code> list corresponding to same index. Hence, your simplified <em>list comprehension</em> expression should be as:</p>
<pre><code>datalist = [{k: e} for elements in lines for e, k in zip(elements, keyss)]
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">I think you have confused lists and dictionaries. What you call <code>datadict</code> is actually a list containing dictionaries with one key only. Is this the expected result or do you want to construct one large dictionary?</span>
