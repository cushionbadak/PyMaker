<p>My code is running infinitely even though i have limit the len, I have also tried <code>count(i) &gt;= 6</code> but then it returns an error:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TypeError: a number is required</p>

<pre><code>for i, x in enumerate(cycle('raghav')):
    print(x)

</code></pre>
<p>This is a perfect use case for enumerate</p>
<p>Oh, you want to repeatedly print <code>'raghav'</code>.  For that use <code>repeat</code> not <code>cycle</code>:</p>
<pre><code>from itertools import repeat
for i, x in enumerate(repeat('raghav')):
    print(x)
    if i == 5:
        break
</code></pre>
<p>Or just </p>
<pre><code>for i in range(5):
    print('raghav') 
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Set up a <code>count</code> object outside the loop and use its <code>next</code> method:</p>
<pre><code>from itertools import count, cycle

c = count()
for i in cycle("raghav"):
    print(i)
    if next(c) &gt;= 6:
       break
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>len(i)</code> will always be <code>1</code> as <code>i</code> is just one character in <code>'raghav'</code>. If you just want it to print out <code>'raghav'</code> letter-by-letter, as it seems, you can do this</p>
<pre><code>for i in 'raghav':
    print(i)
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can slice the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.cycle" rel="nofollow"><code>itertools.cycle</code></a> object using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.islice" rel="nofollow"><code>itertools.islice</code></a>:</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I don't think you actually want to use <code>cycle</code> here anyway? <code>for i in "raghav"</code> would achieve what you're trying to make <code>cycle</code> do.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MosesKoledoye absolutely, but the misunderstanding with <code>len(i)</code> when <code>i</code> is being printed as single letters made me more inclined to think there was a misunderstanding with <code>for</code> loops in general.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">So what would be the <i>expected</i> output? Are you trying to limit this to printing 6 individual characters, or to printing the letters from <code>raghav</code> 6 times?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@EliSadoff. What do you find unsatisfactory about OP's currently posted code? I agree that the description of the requirement is imprecise but I don't think that the MCVE or its description are an issue.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Dr._Duck: without an MCVE this question isn't useful to future visitors however. Even the accepted answer has 3 different interpretations of what is wanted, how is anyone supposed to recognise that they have the same issue?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">so here enumerate is actually working on index if i am not wrong</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Dr._Duck Try for yourself! replace <code>print(x)</code> with <code>print(i, x)</code> and <code>if i &gt;= 6:</code> with something larger, like <code>if i &gt; 20:</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Dr._Duck i misunderstood your question.  please see my edits</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks @Patrick Haugh for your solution</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>repeat()</code> has a repeat keyword: <code>for char in repeat('raghav', 6)</code> will repeat iteration over the letters of the string 6 times.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>enumerate</code> does the counter for you.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MadPhysicist They already gave an hint at <code>count</code> and had it imported</span>
<span class="comment-copy">OP does not strike me as someone that is intimate with the intricacies of Python iteration.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">From the comments it is clear this isn't what the OP was trying to achieve. I've closed the post until a proper MCVE is provided.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Upvoting this because it is a potential solution to XY problem, even if it is not exactly what OP is asking.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@roganjosh Since OP wants to print the word 6 times as of the latest edit, this won't work.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MadPhysicist I know, I edited my comment as I was unclear. It was definitely a case of the XY problem but got 4 answers.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Crafty. Much cleaner than the <code>enumerate</code> and <code>count</code> options since we know the termination condition up front.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">According to the update, the last argument to <code>islice</code> should actually be <code>6 * len('raghav')</code>.</span>
