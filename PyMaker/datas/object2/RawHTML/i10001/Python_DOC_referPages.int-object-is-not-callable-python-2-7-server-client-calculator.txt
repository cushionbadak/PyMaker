<p>Okay, first off I know this question has been asked quite a few times, however, none of the previous questions have included the use of UDP sockets.
I've tested this code without using UDP sockets and it works just fine.
Thank you in advance, here's my code:</p>
<p>Client.py:</p>
<pre><code>from socket import *
serverName = "localhost"
serverPort = 12000
clientSocket = socket(AF_INET , SOCK_DGRAM)
num1 = int(input("1st number: \n"))
func = raw_input("Function (+,-,*,/): \n")
num2 = int(input("2nd number: \n"))
clientSocket.sendto(int(num1), func, int(num2)(serverName, serverPort))
modifiedMessage, serverAddress = clientSocket.recvfrom(2048)
print (modifiedMessage)
clientSocket.close()
</code></pre>
<p>Server.py:</p>
<pre><code>from socket import *
serverPort = 12000
serverSocket = socket ( AF_INET , SOCK_DGRAM )
serverSocket.bind (( '', serverPort ))
print ('The Server is ready ')
while 1:
    num1, func, num2, clientAddress = serverSocket.recvfrom(2048)
if func =='+':
    modifiedMessage = num1 + num2
    else:
        pass
if func =='-':
    modifiedMessage = num1 - num2
    else:
        pass
    if func =='*':
        modifiedMessage = num1 + num2
    else:
        pass
    if func =='/':
        modifiedMessage = num1 / num2
    else:
        pass
    serverSocket.sendto(modifiedMessage, clientAddress)
</code></pre>
<p>Traceback (most recent call last): 
File"C:\Users\Myhat2you\Desktop\client.p", line 8, in         clientSocket.sendto(int(num1), func, int(num2)(serverName, serverPort))  TypeError: 'int' object is not callable</p>

<p>Problem is indeed here: </p>
<pre><code>clientSocket.sendto(int(num1), func, int(num2)(serverName, serverPort))
</code></pre>
<p>According to <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/librarysocket.html#socket.socket.sendto" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs</a>, <code>sendto</code> accepts <code>str</code>, not <code>int</code>, <code>str</code> and <code>int</code>.</p>
<p>However, traceback You got is there because You tried to call some <code>int</code> value as function (say <code>num2</code> is <code>"5"</code>, then, <code>int(num2)</code> will be <code>5</code>, and You're calling <code>5(serverName, serverPort</code>).</p>
<p>If You want to send those values to server, I suggest one of the following:</p>
<p>1) send them one by one</p>
<p>2) send them as string separated by some special character (ie. <code>|</code>) </p>

<span class="comment-copy">Could you post the <i>exact</i> error your getting directly in your question?</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>int(num2)(serverName, serverPort)</code> is suspicious. but a traceback would be welcome...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">When asking about an Exception that your program produces, you should post the complete Traceback - it has clues in it, like which line caused the problem.  Did you try to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#handling-exceptions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">catch the exception</a> and inspect the variables by printing them?  Are they what you expceted?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is the error I got: TypeError: 'int' object is not callable.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What exactly you expect a value of <code>int(num2)(serverName, serverPort)</code> to be, and why?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Any idea how I could send num1, func and num2 to the server to respond with a calculation?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks I'll try that out!</span>
