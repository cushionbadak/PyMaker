<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>So I've created a method to strip an email pages source code of html, style/script tags, and new line tags:</p>
<pre><code>def extract_message(url):
    markup = open(url)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(markup, "html.parser")
    for script in soup(["script", "style"]): script.extract()
    text = soup.get_text()
    text_clean = re.sub(r"\n", " ", text)
    text_clean_more = text_clean.replace(u'\xa0', u' ')
    a = text_clean_more.find('From:')
    print (text_clean[a:])
</code></pre>
<p>Then, I have it return everything from the instance of 'From:' in the email, all the way to the end of the email. However, after it goes through this process, I get in return a very spaced out and overall sloppy passage of text such as:</p>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uUTuJ.png" rel="nofollow"><img alt="enter image description here" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uUTuJ.png"/></a></p>
<p>My goal is to print out a clean passage of text. Is there anyway that I could do this? I've been wracking my brain with this for several hours now, and haven't come up with anything rational at all. Just looking for a push in the right direction, Thanks.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Use the module <code>email</code> to extract message bodies instead of hacking them apart by hand. Use the module <code>textwrap</code> to format message text into nice paragraphs.  This will probably work:</p>
<pre><code>paras = rawtext.split("\n\n")  # Split into paragraphs, if any
formatted = "\n\n".join(textwrap.fill(p) for p in paras)
</code></pre>
<p>But take a look at the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/textwrap.html" rel="nofollow">textwrap documentation</a> for keyword options you can specify.</p>
