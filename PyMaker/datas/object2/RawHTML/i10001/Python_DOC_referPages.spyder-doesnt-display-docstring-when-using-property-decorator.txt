<p>Using <code>Ctrl + i</code> in <a href="https://pythonhosted.org/spyder/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Spyder</a> generally displays the docstring for the object the cursor is at, but for the <code>B</code> method in the following code, it returns a red "No further documentation available" message:</p>
<pre><code>class A():
    @property
    def B(self):
        ''' This is a docstring. '''
</code></pre>
<p>If the <code>@property</code> decorator is commented out, it works fine. I get that <code>property</code> is wrapping around B somehow, but it seems like there should be an easy, built-in way to get the docstring to pass through and I can't find an answer.</p>
<p>Is there a way to get around this? What's the best way to get the <a href="https://pythonhosted.org/spyder/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Spyder</a> interactive help to display the docstring for potentially many class methods that each have the <code>@property</code> decorator? </p>
<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1782843/python-decorator-handling-docstrings">This question</a> certainly seems related, and may help answer why it behaves in this way, but does that mean I need to subclass the <code>property</code> built-in in some way?</p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Maybe it's something internal to Spyder, because this works with <code>@property</code>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print(A.B.__doc__)    
 This is a docstring. 
</code></pre>

<p>I found that upgrading from Spyder 2.3.8 to Spyder 3.0.1 fixes this issue. The docstring now displays properly.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">If you set the doc param of the <code>property</code> function (It’s one of the arguments, but I don’t know how to pass it in decorator form), that will be the doc for the property.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Maybe it's something to do with Spyder itself. The voltage example in the following link says that <code>property</code> should pass the docstring through: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#property" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#property</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">If it helps, I'm using Python 3.5.1 and Spyder 2.3.8</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I’ve never used Spyder, so I’ve got no idea.</span>
