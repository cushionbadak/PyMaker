<p>Hoping someone can help. I mainly work in Java and have an assignment that I have to do in Python and I know next to nothing about it.</p>
<p>I have a CSV file which I'm reading in and have managed to create a list or lists of each item. Each line represents a thingID, time of request, time requested, time needed to fill. I need to place these into a priority queue, run them through and print results. Though I haven't gotten farther than what is shown below as I clearly have no idea how functions work. The whole self and <code>__init__</code> stuff has me confused, along with everything else that this language requires to operate.</p>
<pre><code>def main():
    with open('things.csv', 'r') as file:
        reader = csv.reader(file)
        index = 0
        for row in reader:
            print(row)

main()
</code></pre>
<p>This gives me a list of arrays like so:</p>
<pre><code>['Thing1', '0', '1', '4']
['Thing2', '1', '1', '3']
</code></pre>
<p>I have another Things.py (am not supposed to have multiple classes in a single .py) in which I have:</p>
<pre><code>class Things(object):
    def __init___(self, row, thingInfo):
        self.row = row
        self.thingInfo = thingInfo
</code></pre>
<p>I tried creating another <code>def</code> below the <code>__init__</code> but I can't do anything.
I'm trying to separate out the different parts of the list object so I can then operate on the various parts of it like ID, time requested, etc., but have no idea how to do this. I've tried various things but get Attribute Error of Type Error. I'm at a total loss. Any help would be greatly appreciated. I just need a few steps in the right direction as I've completely hit a wall.</p>

<p>List unpacking may be what your want:</p>
<pre><code>class Things(object):
    def doSomething(self):
        thing_id, time_of_request, time_requested, time_needed_to_fill = self.row
        # do whatever u want with the above variables
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Hope this template helps:</p>
<pre><code>class Things(object):

    def __init___(self, row, thingInfo):
        self.row = row
        self.thingInfo = thingInfo

    def doSomething(self, arg1, arg2): # beware the `self`
        for x in self.row:
            # do something with x, like:
            print(x)

# here is where you use Things
thing = Things([1, 2, 3], 'info')
thing.doSomething(1, 2)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You could explicitly separate out the different parts of the list object passed to <code>Things.__init__()</code> by indexing them like this (same as in Java ):</p>
<pre><code>class Things(object):
    def __init___(self, row, thingInfo):
        self.row = row
        self.id = thingInfo[0]
        self.time_requested = thingInfo[1]
        self.another_thing = thingInfo[2]
        # etc ...
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Methods in Java don't operate any different than Java. The init method doesn't act much different than Java class constructors. It's not very clear what you are trying to do with each row of the CSV</span>
<span class="comment-copy">And Python doesn't care if you have multiple classes per script... Is your question how to import the Things class?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you don't know anything about Python, your first step should be learning it via a course or tutorial. SO is not a tutorial service.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm voting to close this question as off-topic because SO is not a tutorial service.</span>
