<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I would like to not only import several python modules/files into Google Colab, but an entire directory (which might itself have sub-directories).</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The simplest mechanism to synchronize a directory is to use the <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/io.ipynb#scrollTo=u22w3BFiOveA" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Drive FUSE client</a></p>
<p>To mount your Drive files on the Colab backend, run:</p>
<pre><code>from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/gdrive')
</code></pre>
<p>Then, you can upload files to <code>drive.google.com</code>, or use <a href="https://www.google.com/drive/download/backup-and-sync/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Backup and Sync</a> on your desktop to sync directories efficiently.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">What did you try, and what error did you encounter? Can you share a self-contained notebook that reproduces the problem you observe?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@BobSmith Using the Upload feature on the File tab, it seems to me I can only upload files, not directories.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks Bob. How would I import specific modules from Drive after mounting it? The first link you provide only talks about reading from and writing to files from Drive.</span>
