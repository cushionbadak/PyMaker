<p>I am trying to write a code that takes a file with data points in hex and convert them to binary. I need to check that the 2nd entry point of the converted binary is a valid point (equal to 1). If all four converted binary are valid I then move that line to a new file</p>
<pre><code>f = open("valid.txt","w+")

with open('pz_muon_halflife.txt') as csv_file:
    csv_reader = csv.reader(csv_file, delimiter=' ')
    col = 1
    for line in csv_reader:
        while col &lt;=5:
            if col == 5:
                f.write(f'{" ".join(line)}')
            else:
                check = bytes.fromhex[{line(col)}] #converts the hex in the column to binary (error here)
                if check[:2] == 1: #checks to see if the 3rd entry is valid
                    col += 1 #resets col to 1
                else: #value is invalid
                    col = 6 #sets column to 6 so that the while loop ends
        col = 1
    print(f'Processed {line_count} lines.')

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Assume <code>line[col]</code> is a hex string, e.g. "DEADBEEF", you should write that line as:</p>
<pre><code>check = bytes.fromhex(line[col])
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Your error seems to be the line </p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>check = bytes.fromhex[{line(col)}]
</code></pre>
<p><code>line</code> is a list so to index into it you need to use <code>[]</code>, e.g. <code>line[col]</code>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, <code>fromhex</code> is a function, so it should be <code>bytes.fromhex(line[col])</code>. I am not sure why you have the curly braces around <code>line[col]</code> since that would give you a set and <code>fromhex</code> would throw an error.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong> If you want to get from hex to binary, a simple solution (in Python3) is</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>check = bin(int(line[col], 16))
</code></pre>
<p>This converts the hex string to a corresponding hex integer and then calling <code>bin</code> on it turns it into a binary string which will give you what you need.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You might want to check out python binascii module, the specific API will depend on what the input is</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Everything is all clear now</span>
<span class="comment-copy">it is now giving me the error "fromhex() argument must be str, not set"</span>
<span class="comment-copy">any chance you can print <code>repr(line[col])</code> right before that line?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">it was because I had curly brackets in the code</span>
<span class="comment-copy">it now gives an error on the same line stating "list index out of range"</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That means your <code>line</code> list only has one element. Are you sure the line <code>col += 1</code> is doing what you intend to do? That is incrementing <code>col</code> and not resetting it to 1.  You seem to be very new to Python so I highly recommend figuring out the basic workings of python data structures. :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes I had to teach myself because my school doesn't give introductory course for Python but requires me to know it for projects in later classes</span>
