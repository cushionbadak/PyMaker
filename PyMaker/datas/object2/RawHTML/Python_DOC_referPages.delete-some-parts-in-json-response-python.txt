<p>I'm assuming you already have your JSON as dictionary, in the code above I just load it from a text file. The command you're looking for is <code>del</code>. It's a good idea to have it in a try/catch block just in case you're dealing with a dictionary that doesn't have the meta field, because in that case it would throw a <code>KeyError</code> and break.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">welcome to stackoverflow. what have you tried? what errors are you getting? did you try the python <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/json.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">JSON</a> module? a direction for you to follow would be: convert your json to a python object, remove the part you dont need and convert it back to a json</span>
