<p>All, </p>
<p>I am wondering how to write an "if" statement that check if a string follows a specific format. </p>
<p>Imagine the following:</p>
<pre><code>if username == 'user1' or \
   username == 'user2' or \
   username == 'user3' or \
   username == 'user4' or \
   username == 'user5' or \
   username == 'user6' or \
   username == 'user7' or \
   username == 'user8' or \
   username == 'user9' or \
   username == 'user10' or \
   username == 'user11' or \
   username == 'user12' or \
   username == 'user13' or \
   username == 'user14' or \
   username == 'user15' or \
   username == 'user16' or \
   username == 'user17' or \
   username == 'user18' or \
   username == 'user19' or \
   username == 'user20' or \
   username == 'user21' or \
   username == 'user22' or \
   username == 'user23' or \
   username == 'user24' or \
   username == 'user25' or \
   username == 'user26' or \
</code></pre>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>Obviously, I cannot write out a condition for every number out there...</p>
<p>How can I write some parameters that checks if the input for "username" contains 'user', then followed with an integer converted into a string?</p>
<p>Thanks, and sorry if the question is vague, I am new to Python.</p>

<p>Hint:You can use string methods, there are plenty of <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#text-sequence-type-str" rel="nofollow noreferrer">them</a> , and apply <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/509211/understanding-pythons-slice-notation">slicing</a>.</p>
<pre><code>if username.startswith('user') and username[4:].isdigit():
   print(int(username[4:]))

<span class="comment-copy">@divibisan From the OP: '..that checks if the input for "username" contains 'user', then followed with an integer converted into a string?' So, I think my suggestion is right.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">While it might be correct, code only answers are not very helpful for others and tend to be deleted. Just add a single sentence explaining what you did and why should be fine.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@divibisan You are very right in general, but in that case the code sample speaks for itself, this is one of the strengths of python.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@kantal I understand what you're saying - but it's not really true. Sure, I understand what's going pn, but many beginners won't. Please consider adding a sentence or two explaining the functions and methods you're using. Remember that the person who asked this question probably didn't know about most of the methods you are using here.</span>
