<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I've a <strong>Treeview</strong> widget, and I need only one row/item to be selected at a time. I've been reading <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.ttk.html#tkinter.ttk.Treeview" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the doc</a>, but I can't find any property or method to do so, nor I've found something useful on SO.</p>
<p>Is it posible? How to?</p>

<p>The answer is <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.ttk.html#id7" rel="nofollow noreferrer">a bit higher up the page</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>selectmode</p>
<p>Controls how the built-in class bindings manage the selection. One of “extended”, “browse” or “none”. If set to “extended” (the default), multiple items may be selected. If “browse”, only a single item will be selected at a time. If “none”, the selection will not be changed.</p>
<p>Note that the application code and tag bindings can set the selection however they wish, regardless of the value of this option.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Setting <code>selectmode="browse"</code> should give the behavior you're asking for.</p>
