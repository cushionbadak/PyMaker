<p>So I tried upgrading pip ...</p>
<pre><code>sudo pip install --upgrade pip

    from pip import main
ImportError: cannot import name main

<p>Apparently, I have some old python 2.7 on my computer. I am not using it. If the solution involves uninstalling that, it's okay by me.
Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>Also just tried sudo pip3 as I read in some instructions. Here's what I get now...</p>
<pre><code>sudo pip3 install beautifulSoup
[sudo] password for joe:

<p>This seemed to work. But then I ran sudo pip3 and sudo pip ...</p>
<pre><code>sudo pip3 install beautifulSoup

    from pip._internal import main
ImportError: No module named 'pip._internal'

<p>Ok, first let's fix your Pip install:</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt-get install --reinstall python3-pip
</code></pre>
<p>Now you should be able to run <code>pip3 --version</code> to check that Pip is installed and working properly. If not, let me know before you try anything else.</p>
<p>Key points to note:</p>
<ul>
<li>When running Pip outside a virtualenv, you'll need to use <code>pip3</code>, otherwise your system will try to use Python 2's Pip.</li>
<li>If you ever need to run Pip as root, it's best to use <code>sudo -H</code> rather than just <code>sudo</code> – this will fix the warnings about <code>The directory ... is not owned by the current user</code>.</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<p>If you want to install Pip 18, I would recommend doing so in a virtualenv – upgrading the system Pip is fraught with things that can go wrong.</p>
<p>e.g.:</p>
<pre><code># Create a new virtualenv:
python3 -m venv my_virtual_environment
# "Activate" it (you need to do this once per shell)
source my_virtual_environment/bin/activate
# Now you can use `pip`, `python` etc. and the changes will be kept in the `my_virtual_environment` directory
pip install -U pip setuptools wheel
</code></pre>
<p>Also, to install BeautifulSoup, you need the <code>beautifulsoup4</code> package – <code>beautifulSoup</code> is old and doesn't work with Python 3:</p>
<pre><code>pip install beautifulsoup4
</code></pre>

</blockquote>
<p>because you are running pip install under a normal user.</p>
<p>You can either run this same command with <code>sudo pip install 'packagename'</code>. This will give you root privileges when installing, or you can check out running this in a virtualenv.

<span class="comment-copy">Try using <code>python3 -m pip install ...</code> to install packages. And as far as I recollect you get <code>pip3</code> when you install python. So you can install packages with <code>pip3 install ...</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">You can try using <code>pip3</code>, not <code>pip</code> for Python3, as <code>pip</code> might refer to Python2 which is still on your system.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><b>sudo python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip</b></span>

<span class="comment-copy">Hi Josh, @Josh Installed python3-pip with no incident. Unfortunately, I get this on pip3 --version:  ` pip3 --version Traceback (most recent call last):   File "/usr/local/bin/pip3", line 7, in &lt;module&gt;     from pip._internal import main ImportError: No module named 'pip._internal'`</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hmm. Can you run <code>sudo mv /usr/local/bin/pip{,.old}</code> and <code>sudo mv /usr/local/bin/pip3{,.old}</code> and see if it works then?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you, I just caught that too. I added into post, what happens with sudo pip3. and sudo pip.</span>
