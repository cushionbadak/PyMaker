<p>Using regular expression I'm trying to get the positions of string inside the parenthesis.</p>
<p>For example I want to get the position of "Home Depot" ;</p>
<pre><code>sent = "Sales to two of the segment's customers, The Home Depot and Lowe's Home Improvement Warehouse, accounted for greater than 10% of the Corporation's consolidated sales for 2004, 2003, and 2002."

regex_ = re.compile("Sales to two of the segment's customers, The (Home Depot)
</code></pre>
<p>However, </p>
<pre><code>regex_.search(sent).span()
</code></pre>
<p>returns <code>(0, 55)</code> not <code>(45, 55)</code></p>
<p>Since, there could be multiple "home depot" in sent, I am not able to use <code>re.search('Home Depot', sent).span()</code> which might not return the exact position of Home Depot I am looking for.</p>

<p>If you want to get the position of the text in parentheses, you need to specify that you're matching the first group as an argument to <code>span()</code>:</p>
<pre><code>sent = "Sales to two of the segment's customers, The Home Depot and Lowe's Home Improvement Warehouse, accounted for greater than 10% of the Corporation's consolidated sales for 2004, 2003, and 2002."

regex_ = re.compile("Sales to two of the segment's customers, The (Home Depot)

regex_.search(sent).span(1)

<p>Use a positive lookbehind:</p>

<p>Your regex is correct. But you are asking for the position for the whole match and not for the submatch. To get the position of the first submatch, use <code>span(1)</code></p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; regex_ = re.compile("Sales to two of the segment's customers, The (Home Depot)")
&gt;&gt;&gt; regex_.search(sent).span(1)

<span class="comment-copy">Why is the string hard-coded into the regex? That doesn't make much sense</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@CertainPerformance Oh.. actually all I tried to know was finding out where the word 'Home Depot'  located when I know what strings are behind it. The first thing came up to my mind was Regex, hence I gave it a shot. Is there any way that you can recommend for me?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks! This is exactly what I needed ! Thanks!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks! It worked perfectly!</span>
