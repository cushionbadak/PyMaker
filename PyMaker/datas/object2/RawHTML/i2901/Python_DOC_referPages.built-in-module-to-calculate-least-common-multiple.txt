<p>I have currently using a function that accepts two numbers and uses a loop to find least common multiple of those numbers,</p>
<pre><code>def lcm(x, y):
   """This function takes two
   integers and returns the L.C.M."""

   # choose the greater number
   if x &gt; y:
       greater = x
   else:
       greater = y

   while(True):
       if((greater % x == 0) and (greater % y == 0)):
           lcm = greater
           break
       greater += 1

   return lcm
</code></pre>
<p>Is there any built-in module in python that does it instead of writing a custom function?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>There is no such thing built into the stdlib.</p>
<p>However, there is a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html#math.gcd" rel="noreferrer">Greatest Common Divisor</a> function in the <code>math</code> library. (For Python 3.4 or 2.7, it's buried in <code>fractions</code> instead.) And writing an LCM on top of a GCD is pretty trivial:</p>
<pre><code>def lcm(a, b):
    return abs(a*b) // math.gcd(a, b)
</code></pre>
<p>Or, if you're using NumPy, it's come with an <a href="https://www.numpy.org/devdocs/reference/generated/numpy.lcm.html" rel="noreferrer"><code>lcm</code></a> function for quite some time now.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Try this instead:</p>
<pre><code>def lcm(x, y):
    from fractions import gcd # or can import gcd from `math` in Python 3
    return x * y // gcd(x, y)
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">AFAIK, there is not. I think there used to be a copy-pastable <code>lcm</code> implementation in the docs as one of the examples for `reduce, but it's long gone.</span>
