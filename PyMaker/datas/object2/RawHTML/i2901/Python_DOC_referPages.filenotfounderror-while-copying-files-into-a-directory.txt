<p>I've a text file "Flickr_8k.testImages.txt" that contains filenames of 1000 files separated by new line. These files are inside the directory 'Flickr8k_Dataset' which contains 8000+ files. All I want to do is, copy the files that are listed in the text file into a separate directory 'dstn' which is located in same path where this script is.
On executing this script it shows following error:</p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):

<p>From the error message, you don't have the correct path to the file.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Are you sure this is the code you are running? The error message says there was something wrong with the line <code>copy(filename, dstn)</code>, but there is no such line in the code you provided.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@PaxVobiscum I assumed it was just a typo as <code>copy2(filename, dstn)</code> exists in the code above and it just has a <code>2</code> in it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Adi219 <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html#shutil.copy2" rel="nofollow noreferrer">This import</a> makes me want to think otherwise.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes I'm sure. <code>copy(filename, dstn)</code> may be shown because  <code>copy()</code> and <code>copy2()</code> are very similar functions of shutil.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@PaxVobiscum Yep, you're right!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks. I finally figured it out.</span>
