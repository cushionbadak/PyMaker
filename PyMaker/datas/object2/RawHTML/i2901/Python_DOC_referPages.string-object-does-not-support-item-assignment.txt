<p>As a starting programmer I am currently working on a hangman project, in which the given letters must return every time. Therefore I would like to work with a list that returns with the by the player given letters. However, this gives me the following issue:</p>
<pre><code>  File "Hangman.py", line 65, in &lt;module&gt;
    word_blank[i] = guess
TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment
</code></pre>
<p>This is for the following part of my code:</p>
<pre><code>while game_on == 'yes':
    answer = select_word(selection)
    if answer != 'error123':
        word_blank = answer_form(answer)
        break

# start guessing letters
count = 1
guesses = []

while count &lt;= 10:
    print(f'\n\nYour guess count:\t{count}')
    print(f'Your guesses:\t\t{guesses}')
    guess = input('Guess a letter: ').lower()
    count += 1
    guesses.append(guess)

    for i in range(0, len(answer)):
        if answer[i] == guess:
            word_blank[i] = guess
            break

    print(' '.join(word_blank))

print('\n\nGame over..')
</code></pre>
<p>With answer form being:</p>
<pre><code>def answer_form(answer):
    word_blank = []
    word_blank.extend(answer)

    for i in range(0, len(word_blank)):
        word_blank[i] = '_'

    return(' '.join(word_blank))
</code></pre>
<p>I have checked various answers on Stack Overflow already, but unfortunately I cannot relate these well to my personal code. I felt the solution in <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10631473/str-object-does-not-support-item-assignment-in-python">this link</a> came close, but unfortunately it has been without results. How should I improve my code to get rid of the error, while being able to stay within the loop to add all the guessed letters to <code>word_blank[i]</code>?</p>

<p>Your <code>def answer_form(answer):</code> returns a joined list - making it a string. You can not modify strings, they are immutable (see f.e. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8056130/immutable-vs-mutable-types">Immutable vs Mutable types</a>). You can however recreate them, f.e. by slicing or using them as list of characters. See <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1228299/change-one-character-in-a-string">Change one character in a string?</a> for that.</p>
<hr/>
<p>You can simplify your hangman if you use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#sets" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>sets</code></a>. It is easier to print <code>'_'</code> for any character that was not guessed yet, then manipulating strings (and you avoid manipulating lists as well ;o):</p>
<pre><code>data = ["hang","man","carrot","supercalifragilisticexpialidocious"]

# random.choice solver (I am lazy ;o) ) - set to False for human player
autosolve = True

import random
from string import ascii_lowercase 
aslow = set(ascii_lowercase) 

# what should the user guess? random choice from data
what = random.choice(data).lower()

# store the length and characters used in what instead of calculating each time
lwhat = len(what)
swhat = set(what)
# these letters where already guessed 
guessed = set()

# amount of tries reached, we quit when twice the amount of characters got tried
tries = 0
while True and tries &lt; 2*lwhat:

    # use list comprehension to print _ if a char was not guessed yet, else print char
    print("The secret word is: ", ' '.join(x if x in guessed else "_" for x in what))

    # we are done if all characters of what are guessed 
    if swhat.issubset(guessed):
        print(f"You did it! It took you {tries} tries") 
        break

    if not autosolve: 
        guess = input("Guess one letter or the complete word:").lower() 
    else:
        guess = random.choice(list(aslow))
        print("Guess one letter or the complete word:", guess)
        aslow.remove(guess)

    lguess = len(guess)

    # only count 1-character and full word guesses
    if lguess not in (1,lwhat):
        print("1 letter or the while word, try again") 
        continue

    tries += 1
    # one character was guessed
    if lguess == 1:
        guessed.add(guess) # add to set and print some feedback
        if guess in what:  
            print("Correct.")
        else:
            print("beeeeeep - that was wrong.")

    # whole word was guessed
    elif guess == what:
        print(f"You did it! It took you {tries} tries") 
        break
else:
    print("Too many tries: try again later")

print("The end")
</code></pre>
<p>The win-condition is: the set of the word you look for <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#frozenset.issubset" rel="nofollow noreferrer">is a subset</a> of all guessed characters.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">@CupinaCoffee I added the parts where word_blank initializes and how it is constructed.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">strings are immutable - meaing: you can not change them. You can create a new one, f.e. by slicing: <code>s = "abcdk"</code> and then <code>s = s[:-1]+""efghij" + s[-1]</code>. For your game, use a list of characters, you can manipulate them easier.</span>
