<p>I would like to measure the performances of my Rpi 3 while a program I made (in Python)is running on it. The program is getting data from the UART and is then supposed to launch a song or an image. Which way do I measure this time between a coming data and an output (here image or song as mentionned above) ... Thanks</p>

<p>One possible way:</p>
<pre><code>import time
...
start = time.perf_counter()
# Your code that you want to time
end = time.perf_counter() - start
print('{:.6f}s for the calculation'.format(end))
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Look into the <code>timeit</code> module <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/timeit.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/timeit.html</a></span>
