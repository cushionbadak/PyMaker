<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I would like to create a temporary file with an specific name (and if its possible with an specific extension).</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>-mytempfile.txt
-mytempfile2.xml
</code></pre>
<p>I've been reading about tempfile library, but as far as I know I can only set the following parameters</p>
<pre><code>(mode='w+b', buffering=None, encoding=None, newline=None, suffix=None, prefix=None, dir=None)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The most secure method to do what you are asking for is, as Dan points out there is no need to specify any name to the file, I am only using suffix and prefix as OP asked for it in the question. </p>
<pre><code>import os
import tempfile as tfile
fd, path = tfile.mkstemp(suffix=".txt",prefix="abc") #can use anything 
try:
    with os.fdopen(fd, 'w') as tmpo:
        # do stuff with temp file
        tmpo.write('something here')
finally:
    os.remove(path)
</code></pre>
<p>to understand more about the security aspects attached to this you can refer to this <a href="https://security.openstack.org/guidelines/dg_using-temporary-files-securely.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">link</a></p>
<p>well if you can't use os and are required to perform these actions then consider using the following code.</p>
<pre><code>import tempfile as tfile
temp_file=tfile.NamedTemporaryFile(mode="w",suffix=".xml",prefix="myname")
a=temp_file.name

temp_file.write("12")
temp_file.close()
</code></pre>
<p>a will give you the complete path to the file eg as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>'/tmp/mynamesomething.xml'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>in case you don't want to delete the file in the end then use:</p>
<pre><code>temp_file=tfile.NamedTemporaryFile(delete=False) #along with other parameters of course.
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">If you do fopen on a file which doesnt exist, it will create it. You can delete it at the end of your program</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What have you tried ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@RemyJ OP showed effort by listing <code>tempfile</code> package and concerning about lost parameter.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Check <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/tempfile.html#tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile" rel="nofollow noreferrer">NamedTemporaryFile</a>. It doesn't provide name specification, but you can use generated name to open the file a second time.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@vishes_shell OK, it's just that I was expecting a some code.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Note that you don't have to care about the name of the file.  In fact, it's critical that you <i>not</i> specify a full temporary file name to make sure the name is and always will be unique.  Using <code>tempfile</code> is a strong suggestion, because it automatically guarantees tempfile uniqueness, and it also automatically cleans up after itself.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Dan Farrell thanks for the suggestion, made edits to include this important point.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks@Inder I'll take a look at the link you provided me. Also if you guys feel like getting the whole picture. I just explain why I want to create temporary files with specific names, on a comment to the original post.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@jajdp updated my answer kindly check if it satisfy your requirements</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for your updated answer, actually I'm currently finding new ways to achieve what I want. Your code is helping me understand this better. I'm giving you a thumb up for the moment. This might take a few days... I'll update this post when I have a solid answer and understanding of what would be the best way to do this. Thanks~</span>
