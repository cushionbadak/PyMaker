<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The following code adapted from a website for removing punctuations from words.          </p>
<pre><code>import string    
filename = 'some_file.txt'
file = open(filename, 'rt')
text = file.read()
file.close()
# split the text into words
words = text.split()

table = str.maketrans('', '', string.punctuation)
stripped = [w.translate(table) for w in words]
print(stripped[:100])
</code></pre>
<p>The error is <code>"TypeError: maketrans() takes exactly 2 arguments (3 given)"</code>.
I read the Python documentation that says the options for having 1, 2 or 3 arguments of maketrans(). The docs.python.org says: "If there is a third argument, it must be a string, whose characters will be mapped to None in the result".
I'm using Python 2. Any idea to clear the error?                 </p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I think you are confusing the python3.1 docs(where in the "If there is a third argument, it...... " statement is mentioned.) with Python2. As per python2 documentation - <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html</a>, it cannot have 3 parameters.</p>
<p>But if you want to achieve the functionality of having a 3rd parameter (to map a set of characters to None), you can do it by adding the string to <code>translate</code>,</p>
<pre><code>stripped = [w.translate(table, string.punctuation) for w in words]
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">If you're using Python 2 it would be <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html#string.maketrans" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>string.maketrans</code></a>, and it takes only two arguments.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><i>I read the Python documentation that says the options for having 1, 2 or 3 arguments of maketrans().</i> -- Could you provide a link to where you read that?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I tried your code it is not producing any error in python 3</span>
<span class="comment-copy">agree with @khelwood, python2 doesn;t support 3 argument maketrans function</span>

<span class="comment-copy">I tried your code,  it is not working.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Now I'm using Python 3.4 and it is producing error <code>type object 'str' has no attribute 'maketrans'</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">I unistalled Python and Anaconda and re-installed the whole bunch of Anaconda3 with Python 3.6. Now it is properly working. Thanks to all.</span>
