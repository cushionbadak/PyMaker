<p>I have a text file, that has data.</p>
<pre><code>PAS_BEGIN_3600000
    CMD_VERS=2
    CMD_TRNS=O
    CMD_REINIT=
    CMD_OLIVIER=
</code></pre>
<p>I want to extract data from that file, where nothing is after the equal sign.</p>
<p>So in my new text file, I want to get </p>
<pre><code>CMD_REINIT
CMD_OLIVIER
</code></pre>
<p>How do I do this?</p>
<hr/>
<p>My code is like that righr now. </p>
<pre><code>import os, os.path

DIR_DAT = "dat"
DIR_OUTPUT = "output"

print("Psst go check in the ouptut folder ;)")
for roots, dir, files in os.walk(DIR_DAT):  
    for filename in files:
        filename_output = "/" + os.path.splitext(filename)[0]   
        with open(DIR_DAT + "/" + filename) as infile, open(DIR_OUTPUT + "/bonjour.txt", "w") as outfile:
            for line in infile:
                if not line.strip().split("=")[-1]:
                    outfile.write(line)
</code></pre>
<h2>I want to collect all data in a single file. It doesn't work. Can anyone help me ?</h2>
<p>The third step, it do crawl that new file, and only keep single values. As four files are appended into a single one. Some data might be there four, three, two times.</p>
<p>And I need to keep in a new file, that I will call output.txt. Only the lines that are in common in all the files.</p>

<p>You can use regex:</p>
<pre><code>import re

data = """PAS_BEGIN_3600000
    CMD_VERS=2
    CMD_TRNS=O
    CMD_REINIT=
    CMD_OLIVIER="""

found = re.findall(r"^\s+(.*)=\s*$",data,re.M)

print( found )
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>['CMD_REINIT', 'CMD_OLIVIER']
</code></pre>
<p>The expression looks for </p>
<pre><code>^\s+  line start + whitespaces
(.*)=  anything before a =  which is caputred as group
\s*$   followed by optional whitespaces and line end
</code></pre>
<p>using the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.MULTILINE" rel="nofollow noreferrer">re.M (multiline)</a> flag. </p>
<p>Read your files text like so:</p>
<pre><code>with open("yourfile.txt","r") as f:
    data = f.read()
</code></pre>
<p>Write your new file like so:</p>
<pre><code>with open("newfile.txt","w") as f:
    f.write(''.join("\n",found))
</code></pre>
<p>You can use <a href="http://www.regex101.com" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.regex101.com</a> to evaluate test-text vs regex-patterns, make sure to swith to its python mode.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I suggest you the following short solution using comprehension:  </p>
<pre><code>with open('file.txt', 'r') as f, open('newfile.txt', 'w') as newf:
    for x in (line.strip()[:-1] for line in f if line.strip().endswith("=")):
        newf.write(f'{x}\n')
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Try this pattern: <code>\w+(?==$)</code>.</p>

<p>Using a simple iteration.</p>
<p><strong>Ex:</strong></p>
<pre><code>with open(filename) as infile, open(filename2, "w") as outfile:
    for line in infile:                          #Iterate Each line
        if not line.strip().split("=")[-1]:      #Check for second Val
            print(line.strip().strip("="))
            outfile.write(line)                  #Write to new file
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>
<pre><code>CMD_REINIT
CMD_OLIVIER
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">It worked fine ! Just had to modify this part : open(filename2, "w"). Now it can write in filename2 txt file. Thanks :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You are welcome :)</span>
