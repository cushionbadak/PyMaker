<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I am having an array 'commit'  with following values and have country list in seprate array - Self.Countries (UNITED STATES, CHINA, GERMANY). </p>
<pre><code>commit = [['UNITED_STATES-Consumer1_SymPercChg'],
          ['UNITED_STATES-Housing1_StndDev'],
          ['UNITED_STATES-Auto1_SymPercChg'],
          ['CHINA-Finance1_SymPercChg'],
          ['CHINA-Transport1_StndDev'],
          ['CHINA-Housing1_SymPercChg'],
          ['GERMANY-PMI1_StndDev'],
          ['GERMANY-Manufacturing1_SymPercChg'],
          ['GERMANY-Survey1_SymPercChg']
         ]
</code></pre>
<p>I need help in splitting the array 'commmit' based on the countries list. I tried below code but its not working. Its returning a empty list:</p>
<pre><code>    for country in self.countries:
        self.select_columns = [x for x in commit if country in x]
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Assuming you've countries with multi word countries name separated by space(in your question) and not <code>_</code>.</p>
<p>You could do something like:</p>
<pre><code>countries = ['UNITED STATES',
            'CHINA',
            'GERMANY'
            ]
commit = [['UNITED_STATES-Consumer1_SymPercChg'],
      ['UNITED_STATES-Housing1_StndDev'],
      ['UNITED_STATES-Auto1_SymPercChg'],
      ['CHINA-Finance1_SymPercChg'],
      ['CHINA-Transport1_StndDev'],
      ['CHINA-Housing1_SymPercChg'],
      ['GERMANY-PMI1_StndDev'],
      ['GERMANY-Manufacturing1_SymPercChg'],
      ['GERMANY-Survey1_SymPercChg']
     ]
for c in countries:
    c = "_".join(c.split(" "))
    print c, [x for x in commit if c in x[0]]
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>UNITED_STATES ['UNITED_STATES-Consumer1_SymPercChg', 'UNITED_STATES-Housing1_StndDev', 'UNITED_STATES-Auto1_SymPercChg']


CHINA ['CHINA-Finance1_SymPercChg', 'CHINA-Transport1_StndDev', 'CHINA-Housing1_SymPercChg']

GERMANY ['GERMANY-PMI1_StndDev', 'GERMANY-Manufacturing1_SymPercChg', 'GERMANY-Survey1_SymPercChg']

<span class="comment-copy">You don't have <code>array</code> in python, you have <code>list</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Use this list comprehension instead <code>[x for x in commit if x.startswith(country)]</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Please specify output which you want to get.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">For UNITED_STATES , I need three values - UNITED_STATES-Consumer1_SymPercChg, UNITED_STATES-Housing1_StndDev, UNITED_STATES-Auto1_SymPercChg. Similar approach for other countries .</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Made changes to the question.Sorry! I having array values inside a array. I am still getting empty list as output.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ArvinthKumar Ah. You've list of lists eh? I wonder why. Modified the code now.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Its still not working. I am having values in this format [ [], [], [] ] . Please help.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ArvinthKumar Ah . My bad . Can you check now please . <a href="https://repl.it/repls/MenacingAlarmingFtpclient" rel="nofollow noreferrer">demo</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Made changes to the question.Sorry! I having array values inside a array. I am still getting empty list as output.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Please provide the full code you are using as I still don't understand what you need.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Have modified format of your input value.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ok, I've updated my code to deal with your list of lists input. This solution will return a dictionary of lists tied to countries that you can work with.  Why you need a list of lists containing a single string value I do not know. Ideally we avoid unnecessary nesting of data structures.</span>
