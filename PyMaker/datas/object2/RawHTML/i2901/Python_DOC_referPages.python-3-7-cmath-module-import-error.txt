<p>i installed python3.7 on ubuntu using ppa:deadsnakes/ppa repository.</p>
<p>When I try to run</p>
<pre><code>import cmath
</code></pre>
<p>in python shell it fails with message:</p>
<pre><code>ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'cmath'
</code></pre>
<p>I didn't find any info about depracation of this library or anything in python3.7 changelog. It works fine in pythons 3.5 and 2.7. I tried installing it on different ubuntu virtual machines and computers and I always get the same result.</p>
<p>Do I need to install some specific library or something (which I doubt because the module is listed in standard library <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html</a>) or is problem elsewhere?</p>

<p>This was a bug in the deadsnakes backport of python3.7 <em>specifically</em> for xenial.</p>
<p>During the 3.7 beta period (when the package was imported).  The cpython build system used <code>PY_CORE_CFLAGS</code> as a make variable.  It was later changed to <code>PY_STDMODULE_CFLAGS</code>.  debian ships a patch with their package that adjusts a generated makefile line using a <code>sed</code> expression for that specific variable.  Since this was missing it caused the <code>cmath</code> module to build incorrectly.</p>
<p>This has been fixed in <a href="https://github.com/deadsnakes/python3.7/commit/5f22e97fb7633f3f017429fdef4e6e83578131a9" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this commit</a></p>
<p>This fix is available in 3.7.0-1+xenial2 (debian version)</p>

<p>I installed python3.7 by downloading and installing it using make and cmath started working. It looks like ppa:deadsnakes/ppa repository had missing cmath module.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">interestingly the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/cmath.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs</a> say: <code>This module is always available.</code> so i'm guessing its an issue with the repository you're using</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Using Pyenv I have the cmath module installed in 3.7 so I guess the issue comes from the repository.  Side note: If you use multiple versions of python on the same machine taking a look at tools like Pyenv may make your job easier</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is happening again for <code>3.7.2-1+xenial1</code> now. For whatever reason.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Urgh, this is probably the new link flags, will fix - - can you make an issue on <a href="https://github.com/deadsnakes/issues" rel="nofollow noreferrer">github.com/deadsnakes/issues</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Fixed again for 3.7.2-1+xenial2 -- cpython changed the variable again -- this time to <code>PY_BUILTIN_MODULE_CFLAGS</code></span>
