<p>Here is the prompt: 
On the first line display the first, last and middle element of the list separated by the , character.</p>
<p>I have been trying to get this figured out for a few hours now, but do not know the correct process to return the middle of the array. Here is my code so far:</p>
<pre><code>primary = []
length = 0
i = ("MORE")
while i != "NOMORE":
    i = str(input("?"))
    print(i)
    if i == "NOMORE":
        break
    primary.append(i)
    length = length + 1
mid = (length/2)

print(primary[0]," , ", primary[-1]," , ",primary.pop([mid]))
</code></pre>
<p>The code works to get the correct inputs from the program, but as the lists will be variable lengths I assume some form of a loop will be used. The primary.pop([mid]) was my poor attempt at getting the median printed. I know that the mid will not be printed as it is the wrong variable type, but how would I replace this?</p>
<p>Any help is appreciated.</p>

<p>You're unnecessarily calling the <code>pop()</code> method on <code>primary</code> with <code>[mid]</code> when you should simply be indexing <code>primary</code> with <code>mid</code>. You should also use the <code>//</code> operator instead of <code>/</code> to obtain an integer value for the index. Since the index is 0-based, the mid point should be <code>(length - 1) // 2</code> instead:</p>
<pre><code>primary = []
length = 0
i = ("MORE")
while i != "NOMORE":
    i = str(input("?"))
    print(i)
    if i == "NOMORE":
        break
    primary.append(i)
    length = length + 1
mid = (length - 1) // 2

print(primary[0]," , ", primary[-1]," , ",primary[mid])
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>length/2</code> will often return a float.  You should always use <code>//</code> for integer division if you are going to use the result to index a list</span>

<span class="comment-copy">(length - 1) // 2 would return the incorrect location for the prompt, (length -2) // 2 fixed this instead. Thank you for the help</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You're welcome. I don't think <code>(length - 2) // 2</code> is correct though. Try entering <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, <code>3</code>, and <code>NOMORE</code>. The expected output should be <code>1  ,  3  ,  2</code>, but with <code>(length - 2) // 2</code> the output is <code>1  ,  3  ,  1</code>.</span>
