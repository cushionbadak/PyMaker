<p>I have a list of strings like</p>
<pre><code>l1 = ['John', 'London', '219980']
</code></pre>
<p>I want to remove elements of this list from given string say:</p>
<pre><code>s1 = "This is John Clay. He is from London with 219980"
</code></pre>
<p>I know I can do it like</p>
<pre><code>for l in l1:
    s1 = s1.replace(l, "")
</code></pre>
<p>But if the list is big it takes too much time. <br/>
Is there any other alternative solution for this?</p>
<p>Desired Output:</p>
<pre><code>'This is  Clay. He is from  with '
</code></pre>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong>:</p>
<p>The list is made in such a way that all the elements from the list are present in string(sentence).</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>you simply use regex-or (<code>|</code>)</p>
<pre><code>import re
l1 = ['John', 'London', '219980']
s1 = "This is John Clay. He is from London with 219980"
re.sub('|'.join(l1),'',s1)
</code></pre>
<p>in case your l1 contains <code>|</code> you can escape it with <code>r'\|'</code> first</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Using regular expressions and in particular 
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.sub" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>re.sub</code></a>, you can try:</p>
<pre><code>import re

l1 = ['John', 'London', '219980']
s1 = "This is John Clay. He is from London with 219980"
p = '|'.join(l1)  # pattern to replace
re.sub(p, '', s1)
# 'This is  Clay. He is from  with '
