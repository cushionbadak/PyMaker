<p>I am writing the test case in python. I need to delete the folders after completed the all the test cases, which <code>test fixture</code> can be used to run after completing every thing. So that I could perform clean up operation</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>

<p>you should keep the cleanup codes inside tearDownClass(). Even if exception occurs in any of the test method or in the setupClass(), tearDownClass() will work.</p>

<p>After all the tests have run the final tearDownClass and tearDownModule are run.</p>
