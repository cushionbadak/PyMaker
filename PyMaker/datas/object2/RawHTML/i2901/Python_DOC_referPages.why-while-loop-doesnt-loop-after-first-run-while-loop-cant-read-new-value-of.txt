<p>I'm new to Python, and wondering why this might of occurred.
Here's the code:</p>
<pre><code>import turtle


What_Calculate = turtle.numinput("Area of Different Shapes Calculator", "Type 1 to calculate the area of a square, Type 2 to calulate the area of a rectangle, Type 3 to calculate the area if a triangle, Type 4 to calulate the area of a circle, or click [q] to quit:")

while What_Calculate !="q":

    if What_Calculate == 1:
        Length_Square = eval(input("What is the length of the square?:"))
        Area_Squ = Length_Square * Length_Square
        print("The area of the square is ", Area_Squ, ".")
        What_Calculate = input("Click another number or click [q] to exit:")

    elif What_Calculate == 2:
        Length_1 = eval(input("What is the first length?:"))
        Length_2 = eval(input("What is the second length?:"))
        Area_Rec = Length_1 * Length_2
        print("The area of the rectangle is ", Area_Rec, ".")
        What_Calculate = input("Click another number or click [q] to exit:")

    elif What_Calculate == 3:
        Length = eval(input("What is the length?:"))
        Height = eval(input("What is the height?:"))
        Area = Length * Height / 2
        print("The area of the triangle is", Area)
        What_Calculate = input("Click another number or click [q] to exit:")

    elif What_Calculate == 4:
        Diameter = eval(input("What's the diameter of the circle?:"))
        Radius = Diameter / 2
        Pie = 3.14
        Area = Pie * Radius * Radius
        print("The area of the circle is ", Area, ".")
        What_Calculate = input("Click another number or click [q] to exit:")
</code></pre>
<p>Here's the problem:
After the user inputs which calculator they want to use, the code works until after the answer is given.
At <code>What_Calculate = input("Click another number or click [q] to exit:")</code>, typing <code>q</code> to exit works perfectly, but <code>1</code>-<code>4</code> doesn't work at all. If I'm not wrong shouldn't the <code>while</code> loop in this scenario, loop until <code>What_Calculate</code> is null?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The problem is that <code>What_Calculate = input("Click another number or click [q] to exit:")</code> returns a string, which ALWAYS fails in the if/elif/elif/elif. Because it is a string and not a number, <code>"1" != 1</code>. The easiest way to do it that I could see is to add</p>
<pre><code>try:
    What_Calculate = int(What_Calculate)
except ValueError:
    #Some code to handle what happens if What_Calculate cannot be turned into an int.
</code></pre>
<p>to the beginning of the while loop. Having this contained in a try/except loop allows you to detect if the user input something that is not an integer and is not the letter 'q'.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The input() functions returns a string, and since all of your comparisons in the loop are numbers it will loop forever after the first time through. You should not be using <code>What_Calculate</code> as both an int and a string - my suggestion (trying to change as little of the code as possible) would be to change your comparisons from <code>if What_Calculate == 1:</code> to <code>if What_Calculate == "1":</code> and so on, then change your <code>turtle.numinput</code> call to ask for a string input instead of a number.</p>
