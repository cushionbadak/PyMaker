<p>I have this problem with trying to figure how to change this code to something useable for me. I have created this combination below that gives me ADABTC, ADAETH, ADAUSDT, BCCBTC,...... and so on.
I'm trying to have each one of these feed into a reference field to pull this information.</p>
<pre><code>alt = ["ADA", "BCC", "EOS"]
base = ["BTC", "ETH", "USDT"
alt_base = []
for x in alt:
   for y in base:
      alt_base.append(x + y)
</code></pre>
<p>I'm trying to get this to feed into as an independent into feeding for some data calls.</p>
<p><code>"Variable" = client.get_orderbook_ticker(symbol = alt_base)</code> where I need this to basically end up with multiple version to be pulled from the source.</p>
<p>Didn't know if I could try something like</p>
<pre><code>ada_btc = client.get_orderbook_ticker(symbol = "ADABTC")
ada_eth = client.get_orderbook_ticker(symbol = "ADAETH")
</code></pre>
<p>It doesn't have to list these out, but the variables would need to have those meanings.
So I could parse data from these feeds to get the info I need.
Figured something like this, but that doesn't work. I'm new to coding, but can't see some of the things that I need or what they are called to look them up.</p>
<pre><code>coin[] = client.get_orderbook_ticker(symbol = alt_base)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>It looks like you're getting close. Here's a list comprehension in IDLE:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; x = [letter for letter in "Hello World"]
&gt;&gt;&gt; x
['H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', ' ', 'W', 'o', 'r', 'l', 'd']
</code></pre>
<p>You could use something similar to create a list of all the pairs:</p>
<pre><code>coin[] = client.get_orderbook_ticker(symbol = alt_base)
</code></pre>
<p>becomes</p>
<pre><code>coin = [client.get_orderbook_ticker(symbol=ab) for ab in alt_base]
</code></pre>
<p>If the objects don't have an easy way to track what pair they are, you could do:</p>
<pre><code>coin = [ (ab , client.get_orderbook_ticker(symbol=ab)) for ab in alt_base]
</code></pre>
<p>to create a tuple of <code>(ab, whatever-that-object-is)</code>. Or, use a dict comprehension:</p>
<pre><code>coin = {ab : client.get_orderbook_ticker(symbol=ab) for ab in alt_base}
</code></pre>
