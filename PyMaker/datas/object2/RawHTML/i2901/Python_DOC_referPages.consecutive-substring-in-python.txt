<p>I need to find count of substring like 'ACA' in a string like ACACA. I tried <code>count(str)</code> method but it gave me only 1 instead of 2. How can I find actual number of occurrences in python on these strings?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The documentation for the <code>count</code> <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods" rel="nofollow noreferrer">method of strings</a> says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Return the number of non-overlapping occurrences of substring sub in the range [start, end].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your substrings overlapped, which is why the <code>count</code> method did not do what you wanted. You can use the <code>find</code> method's optional parameter to start at a place other than the string's start to find your count:</p>
<pre><code>string = 'ACACA'
substr = 'ACA'

substr_count = 0
start = 0
while True:
    loc = string.find(substr, start)
    if loc == -1:
        break
    substr_count += 1
    start = loc + 1
</code></pre>
<p>This routine's loop count is the same as the number of occurrences of your sub-string in the string. You could use a simpler routine that checks each location of your string to see if the sub-string is at that location, but that take more loops and would be slower.</p>
