<span class="comment-copy">1. Why do you think you need other "imports functions"; have you had specific problems using <code>requests</code>? Give a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve">Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example</a>. 2. Why does it matter how many files you use, have you had any particular issue with how many you have now? 3. No.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Well I initially replied stating I just started programming so I am not sure 90% of stuff.  so I am not even sure what <code>requests</code> and etc on other questions you asked.  Based on my input. you think you can help me make GET call to 1 of the API end point URL in just general programming with Python 3.7?  I know I might not be making much sense I am learning how to ask questions and such...</span>
