<p>I would like to convert hundreds of PDF files (of varying formatting and sizes) to txt and have struggled to find a layman's option for this. </p>
<p>What is the best way to do this?
I have tried some pre-packaged software (PDF2Text Pilot) but it just... didn't work.</p>
<p>I also followed a guide to do so in python, but couldn't seem to get python to open from the right directory as I am not too knowledgeable in this area. </p>
<p>What method would you recommend?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Why not use the shell <code>pdftotext</code> command from the <a href="https://poppler.freedesktop.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>poppler</code></a> utils if you are not apposed to not using python. It works shockingly well for digital PDFs. You could then run </p>
<pre><code>find /path/to/pdfs -name '*.pdf' -print0 | xargs -0 -n1 pdftotext
</code></pre>
<p>in your shell to get all the text versions of the pdfs. This will be quite fast. You could run this command from python with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>subprocess</code></a> if necessary. </p>
<pre><code>import subprocess
command = 'find /path/to/pdfs -name \'*.pdf\' -print0 | xargs -0 -n1 pdftotext'
process = subprocess.Popen(command, shell=True, stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
process.wait()
print(process.returncode)
</code></pre>
<p>I think this will be faster and simpler than going with a native python approach - but I can provide one if necessary. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">That sounds interesting! I am a big newbie with python though, is that easy to install etc? @modesitt</span>
<span class="comment-copy">yes - quite. what operating system are you on @Lewis?</span>
