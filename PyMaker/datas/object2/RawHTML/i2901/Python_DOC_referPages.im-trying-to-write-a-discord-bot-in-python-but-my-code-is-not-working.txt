<p>I'm trying to code my first discord bot in python and I need a bit of help with this piece of code, keep in mind im new to python and I started learning about 2 weeks ago.</p>
<pre><code>    @bot.event
async def on_message(message):
    content = message.content
    author = message.author
    if content == "example yes":
        bot.say("example @%s" % (author))
</code></pre>
<p>I want the bot to write "example2 @user" if a user says "example yes"</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You're not <code>await</code>ing <code>bot.say</code>, and that's not how you mention a user (you use the  <a href="https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#discord.User.mention" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>User.mention</code></a> attribute instead)</p>
<pre><code>@bot.event
async def on_message(message):
    content = message.content
    author = message.author
    if content == "example yes":
        await bot.say("example {}".format(author.mention))
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks Patrick! :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">And can you please tell me what does the await do in the sixth line of the code.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>await</code> says that your code is going to wait for a coroutine to finish, but it's okay if other code runs in the meantime.  It was introduced in <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0492/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PEP 492</a>.  If that's a little too much of a technical document, I recommend searching for Python tutorials covering coroutines, async, and await.  See also <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Tasks and Coroutines</a> from the documentation.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Alright thank you</span>
