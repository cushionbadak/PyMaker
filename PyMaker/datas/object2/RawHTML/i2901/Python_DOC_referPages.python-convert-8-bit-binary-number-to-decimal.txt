<p>I've just been browsing this site looking for tips on how to complete an assignment, the basics of the assignment is to have the user input an 8 bit binary number, and convert it to decimal. Or pop up an invalid input error in situations where it doesn't fit the requirements. The code above seemed interesting so I tested it and I genuinely don't understand which part of the code converts the binary to decimal. Any tips for the assignment as well as explanations would be appreciated.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The part that converts the binary is <code>int</code>. From <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the documentation</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>if <em>base</em> is given, then x must be a string, <code>bytes</code>, or <code>bytearray</code> instance representing an integer literal in radix <em>base</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This means that <code>int</code> accepts a string representing an integer, that you tell it the base of. E.g. here we give it <code>"11"</code>, and tell it this is in base <code>2</code>, so it returns the integer <code>3</code> in decimal.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; int("11", 2)
3
</code></pre>
<p>Note that when supplying the <code>base</code> argument, you have to give a string:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; int(11, 2)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
TypeError: int() can't convert non-string with explicit base
</code></pre>
<p>And you can't use digits that are invalid in the given base:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; int("21", 2)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 2: '21'
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>int(num, 2)</code> will give you a decimal number from a base 2 binary number.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">as a follow up question, is there an easy way to also get it to print out a message if the number input isn't 8-bit? atm it just puts out an error if I dont use 1's or 0's.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>int(num, 2)</code> technically doesn't give you a decimal number from a base 2 number. It gives you an integer, which you can then print in any base (default being 10).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you don't mind me asking, i've barely worked with the try and except functions. Would it be simple to add another ValueError for if the number inputted isn't 8-bit?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It would be pretty simple, but given that this is an assignment, I'd have you think about what an 8-bit number would look like and how you would check if your input was 8-bit.</span>
