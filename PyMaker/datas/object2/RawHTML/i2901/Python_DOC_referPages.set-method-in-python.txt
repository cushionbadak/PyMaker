<p>I am taking the course "Machine Learning with the Experts: School Budgets" at Data Camp and there is one part in the exercise I don't understand. I was unable to find anything on the Internet on it.</p>
<pre><code>def combine_text_columns(data_frame, to_drop=NUMERIC_COLUMNS + LABELS):
    """ converts all text in each row of data_frame to single vector """

    # Drop non-text columns that are in the df
    to_drop = set(to_drop) &amp; set(data_frame.columns.tolist())
    text_data = data_frame.drop(to_drop, axis=1)
</code></pre>
<p>I don't understand the line <code>set(to_drop) &amp; set(data_frame.columns.tolist())</code>, "set" in particular. What function does it have?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>According to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#sets" rel="nofollow noreferrer">python documentation</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A set is an unordered collection with no duplicate elements. Basic
  uses include membership testing and eliminating duplicate entries. Set
  objects also support mathematical operations like union, intersection,
  difference, and symmetric difference.</p>
<p><strong>Curly braces or the set() function can be used to create sets</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You are creating a set when you do <code>set(to_drop) &amp; set(data_frame.columns.tolist())</code></p>
<hr/>
<p>In sets, <code>&amp;</code> performs <strong>Intersection</strong> i.e. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The resulting set has elements that are common to both source sets. An
  element is in the result if it is in one set and the other.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; fib = set((1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13))
&gt;&gt;&gt; prime = set((2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13))
&gt;&gt;&gt; fib &amp; prime  
    set([2, 3, 5, 13])
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>A Set is an unordered collection data type that has no duplicate elements.</p>
<p><code>set(to_drop)</code> selects unique values from <code>to_drop</code>. </p>
<p><code>set(data_frame.columns.tolist())</code> selects unique values from the list <code>data_frame.columns.tolist()</code></p>
<p>The <code>&amp;</code> operator perform the intersection of both the sets (just like in mathematics).</p>

<p>Thank you for the comments. Yes, it is a basic function, it has been less than one month since I got my hands on Python. I hope next time I won't raise such silly questions.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">This is not an answer</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes ) I just wanted to thank for the comments on my question.I already market the answer by Agile as a correct answer.</span>
