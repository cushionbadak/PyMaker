<p>While <code>exec(open("filename").read())</code> is often given as an alternative to <code>execfile("filename")</code>, it misses important details that <code>execfile</code> supported.</p>
<p>The following function for Python3.x is as close as I could get to having the same behavior as executing a file directly. That matches running <code>python /path/to/somefile.py</code>.</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>def execfile(filepath, globals=None, locals=None):
    if globals is None:
        globals = {}
    globals.update({
        "__file__": filepath,
        "__name__": "__main__",
    })
    with open(filepath, 'rb') as file:
        exec(compile(file.read(), filepath, 'exec'), globals, locals)

# execute the file
execfile("/path/to/somefile.py")
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Uses binary reading to avoid encoding issues</li>
<li>Guaranteed to close the file <em>(Python3.x warns about this)</em></li>
<li>Defines <code>__main__</code>, some scripts depend on this to check if they are loading as a module or not for eg. <code>if __name__ == "__main__"</code></li>
<li>Setting <code>__file__</code> is nicer for exception messages and some scripts use <code>__file__</code> to get the paths of other files relative to them.</li>
<li><p>Takes optional globals &amp; locals arguments, modifying them in-place as <code>execfile</code> does - so you can access any variables defined by reading back the variables after running.</p></li>
<li><p>Unlike Python2's <code>execfile</code> this does <strong>not</strong> modify the current namespace by default. For that you have to explicitly pass in <code>globals()</code> &amp; <code>locals()</code>.</p></li>

<p>As <a href="https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2014-June/134992.html" rel="noreferrer">suggested on the python-dev</a> mailinglist recently, the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/runpy.html" rel="noreferrer">runpy</a> module might be a viable alternative. Quoting from that message:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/runpy.html#runpy.run_path" rel="noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/runpy.html#runpy.run_path</a></p>
<pre><code>import runpy
file_globals = runpy.run_path("file.py")
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>There are subtle differences to <code>execfile</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>run_path</code> always creates a new namespace. It executes the code as a module, so there is no difference between globals and locals (which is why there is only a <code>init_globals</code> argument). The globals are returned.</p>
<p><code>execfile</code> executed in the current namespace or the given namespace. The semantics of <code>locals</code> and <code>globals</code>, if given, were similar to locals and globals inside a class definition.</p></li>
<li><p><code>run_path</code> can not only execute files, but also eggs and directories (refer to its documentation for details).</p></li>

<p>You could write your own function:</p>
<pre><code>def xfile(afile, globalz=None, localz=None):

</code></pre>
<p>If you really needed to...</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This one is better, since it takes the globals and locals from the caller:</p>
<pre><code>import sys
def execfile(filename, globals=None, locals=None):

    if locals is None:

        exec(fh.read()+"\n", globals, locals)

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If the script you want to load is in the same directory than the one you run, maybe "import" will do the job ?</p>
<p>If you need to dynamically import code the built-in function <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html#__import__" rel="nofollow noreferrer">__ import__</a> and the module <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/imp.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">imp</a> are worth looking at.</p>

<p>Here's what I had (<code>file</code> is already assigned to the path to the file with the source code in both examples):</p>
<pre><code>execfile(file)
</code></pre>
<p>Here's what I replaced it with:</p>
<pre><code>exec(compile(open(file).read(), file, 'exec'))

<p>My favorite part: the second version works just fine in both Python 2 and 3, meaning it's not necessary to add in version dependent logic.</p>

<p>Note that the above pattern will fail if you're using PEP-263 encoding declarations
that aren't ascii or utf-8. You need to find the encoding of the data, and encode it 
correctly before handing it to exec().</p>
<pre><code>class python3Execfile(object):
    def _get_file_encoding(self, filename):
        with open(filename, 'rb') as fp:
            try:
                return tokenize.detect_encoding(fp.readline)[0]
            except SyntaxError:
                return "utf-8"

    def my_execfile(filename):
        globals['__file__'] = filename
        with open(filename, 'r', encoding=self._get_file_encoding(filename)) as fp:
            contents = fp.read()
        if not contents.endswith("\n"):
            # http://bugs.python.org/issue10204
            contents += "\n"
        exec(contents, globals, globals)

<p>Also, while not a pure Python solution, if you're using IPython (as you probably should anyway), you can do:</p>

<span class="comment-copy">If you are using Python interactively consider using IPython: <code>%run script_name</code> works with all version of Python.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Since 3.4 <code>imp</code> is <code>importlib</code>  (which must be imported): <code>importlib.reload(mod_name)</code> imports and executes <code>mod_name</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">what's wrong with runfile("filename.py") ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Any idea why they would do such a thing? This is so much more verbose than before. Also, it doesn't work for me on Python3.3. I get "No such file or directory" when I exec(open('./some_file').read()). I have tried including the '.py' extension and also excluding the './' as well</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Less trivially, this doesn't provide line numbers when exceptions are raised, as did execfile().</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You'll need to <code>close</code> that file handle too. Another reason to dislike the change from python 2.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Rebs you don't need to close the file handle in that example, it will be done automatically (at least in regular CPython)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Rebs in CPython objects are garbage-collected as soon as their reference count goes to 0, only circular references may delay this (<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9449489/when-are-objects-garbage-collected-in-python" title="when are objects garbage collected in python">stackoverflow.com/questions/9449489/…</a>). In that case that should happen right after read() returns. And file objects are closed on deletion (NB: I realize this link explicitly says "always close files", which is indeed good practice to follow in general)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This works for me. However, I noticed that you've written the local and global arguments in the wrong order. It's actually: exec(object[, globals[, locals]]). Of course if you had the arguments flipped in the original, then 2to3 will produce exactly what you said. :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Was pleased to discover that, if you can omit global_vars and local_vars, the python3 replacement here works under python2 as well. Even though <code>exec</code> is a statement in python2, <code>exec(code)</code> works because the parens just get ignored.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">+1 for using compile. My <code>"somefile.py"</code> contained <code>inspect.getsourcefile(lambda _: None)</code> which was failing without the compile, because the <code>inspect</code> module couldn't determine where the code was coming from.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That's... really ugly. Any idea why they got rid of execfile() in 3.x? execfile also made it easy to pass commandline args.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>open("somefile.py")</code> may be incorrect if <code>somefile.py</code> uses a character encoding different from <code>locale.getpreferredencoding()</code>. <code>tokenize.open()</code> could be used instead.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">For some reason, it outputs to the screen a lot of information it was not asked to print ('<b>builtins</b>' etc in Anaconda Python 3). Is there some way to turn this off so that only the information which I output with print() gets visualized?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Is it also possible to get all the variables in the current workspace instead of them all being stored in <code>file_globals</code>? This would save having to type the <code>file_globals['...']</code> for every variable.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Adriaan <code>globals().update(file_globals)</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">-1: the exec statment doesn't work this way. Code doesn't run in any version of python.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">-1: Not reliable.  Some uses of execfile are incompatible.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">-1: The default parameter values are evaluated at function definition time, making both <code>globals</code> and <code>locals</code> point to the global namespace fo the module containing the definition of <code>execfile()</code> rather than to the global and local namespace of the caller.  The correct approach is to use <code>None</code> as default value and determine the caller's globals and locals via the introspection capabilities of the <code>inspect</code> module.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What is "the above pattern"? Please use links when referring to other posts on StackOverflow. Relative positioning terms like "the above" don't work, as there are 3 different ways of sorting answers (by votes, by date, or by activity) and the most common one (by votes) is volatile. Over time your post and posts around yours will end up with different scores, meaning they'll be rearranged and such comparisons will be less useful.</span>
