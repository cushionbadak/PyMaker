<p>Currently doing a task that has given to me which is partly related to machine learning. The task is to <strong>parse a string input from the user into a date,</strong> given that I could have 2 parameter for the function: <strong>date_from</strong> and <strong>date_to;</strong> something like the given example below. </p>
<p>Any classes/functions that could help or an idea on how to do it would be a big help to me.</p>
<pre><code>2.a 8th of July -&gt; 2018-07-08
2.b July to December -&gt; 2018-07 to 2018-12
2.c July -&gt; 2018-07
2.d July 1st -&gt; 2018-07-01
2.e Last week -&gt; 2018-08-02 (curr_date - 7days)
2.f next week -&gt; 2018-08-16 (curr_date + 7days)
2.g today -&gt; 2018-08-09
2.h tomorrow -&gt; 2018-08-10
2.i next monday -&gt; 2018-08-13
2.j last monday -&gt; 2018-07-30
2.k next month -&gt; 2018-09 (or curr_date + 30days)
2.l last month -&gt; 2018-07 (or curr_date - 30days)
</code></pre>
<p>Currently I'm using Flask for the development and testing.</p>

<p>Several modules which could help:</p>
<ol>
<li>The <code>calendar</code> module (pre-installed) --&gt; <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/calendar.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Link for more information</a></li>
<li>The <code>datetime</code> module (also pre-installed) --&gt; <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Link for more information</a></li>
<li>The <code>dateutil</code> module (<strong>not pre-installed</strong>). However, installing it is easy using <code>pip</code> (<code>pip install dateutil</code>) --&gt; <a href="https://dateutil.readthedocs.io/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Link for more information</a></li>
</ol>
<p>There's tons of functions and methods in the modules above which allow you to work with dates (and times).</p>
<p>As for the actual parsing of the strings, it's likely you'll have to check for words like 'to' and 'of' manually. However, for months (like 'July' and 'December'), you could use a <code>list</code> to store them and then calculate the difference in months using the indices.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Hi, can you give a sample code on how I'm going to parse those kind of input. For example 10th of August to <b>08-10-2018</b>. I just need an idea for me to get started. Thanks!</span>
