<p>Hello my dear educated programmers,</p>
<p>I am trying to execute a command in the cmd prompt using Python. My research showed, that the <em>subprocess</em> module should give me what I need.</p>
<p>However, when using even the most basic test cases, Python always shows the error "<em>[WinError 2] The system cannot find the file specified</em>". I have checked, that <em>subprocess.py</em> is where it's supposed to be and there's no problems importing. There are loads of other questions on StackOverflow, but all of the which I read were about a specific file actually missing or some problems with setting correct paths, etc..</p>
<p>In my case though, I get this error even when testing things like:</p>
<pre><code>import subprocess
subprocess.call("dir")
</code></pre>
<p>Any hints or tips what I could do wrong? I tried opening the cmd prompt as an admin, no luck still.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>I just tried the following in Windows 10 command prompt </p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import subprocess
&gt;&gt;&gt; subprocess.call("dir", shell=True)
</code></pre>
<p>Works fine. What OS/Python version are you using?</p>

<span class="comment-copy">"dir" is a shell (cmd.exe) built-in command. Try adding <code>shell=True</code> as a parameter to <code>subprocess.call</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@AndyBrown Thank you! Originally I tried this from the python console in Spyder from the Anaconda Navigator and      shell=True did not make a difference there, so when I went over to try this within the CMD prompt, somehow I discarded this parameter altogether..</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You're correct, @AndyBrown advised me to use <code>shell=True</code> in his comment as well.  @mikeg Now this works! My problem was that I'm coming from MATLAB and I am hence so prone to working with the integrated command window of any IDE, so I typed all of this into Spyder's IPython console. When trying it out in the CMD shell, I was so annoyed because nothing would work, that I ditched the shell=True altogether, where it was actually supposed to be used..  Still struggling getting my head out of the MATLAB way of "programming"</span>
<span class="comment-copy">How about <code>os.listdir()</code>. It will run on more machines than just Windows. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html?highlight=listdir#os.listdir" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/os.html?highlight=listdir#os.listdir</a></span>
