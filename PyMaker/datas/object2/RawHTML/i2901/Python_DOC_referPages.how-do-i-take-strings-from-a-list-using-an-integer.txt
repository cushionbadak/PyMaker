<p>How do I take strings from a list using an integer?</p>
<p>I tried this but it just gives an error:</p>
<pre><code>list = ['1', '2', '3', '4']
listlength = (len(list) + 1)
int1 = 1
int2 = 1
while (int1 &lt; listlength):
    int2 = list[int1]
    print(int2)
    int3 = (int1 + 1)
    int1 = (int3)
</code></pre>
<p>On the line where I'm trying to set <code>int2</code> to be the part of the <code>list</code> that is 1, since <code>int1</code> is 1, if <code>int1</code> was 2, I would want 2. The code is how I set it up on my computer and it doesn't work. It just says this:</p>
<pre><code>    int2 = list[int1]
IndexError: list index out of range
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Python uses indices that start at <em>zero</em>. The indices for your list run from 0 trough to 3, not 1 through to 4. Your code assumes that the latter is true and sets <code>listLength</code> to <em>5</em>, so when <code>int = 4</code> then <code>int1 &lt; listlength</code> is true, but <code>list[4]</code> fails because that index doesn't exist.</p>
<p>Start <code>int1</code> at <code>0</code> and use <code>listlength = len(list)</code> instead, to run from 0 through to 3.</p>
<p>Note that Python has much better tools to loop over a list. Use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#for-statements" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>for</code> statement</a> to just loop directly over the values:</p>
<pre><code>for int2 in list:
    print(int2)
</code></pre>
<p>That's much simpler and less likely to go wrong.</p>
<p>Note that it's not a good idea to use the name <code>list</code> as a variable, because that masks the built-in <code>list</code> type. You'd be better of with different names:</p>
<pre><code>values = ['1', '2', '3', '4']
for value in values:
    print(value)
</code></pre>
<p>or, if you must use <code>while</code>:</p>
<pre><code>values = ['1', '2', '3', '4']
values_length = len(values)
index = 0
while index &lt; values_length:
    value = values[index]
    print(value)
    index = index + 1
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">your <code>int2</code> ect are still strings of length 1 - what do you want to accomplish? creating <code>[1,2,3,4]</code> from <code>['1','2','3','4']</code> ? lists are 0 based, your listlength makes not much sense - the len() of your list is 4, its indexes range from 0,1,2,3 thats why you get an IndexError</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@PatrickArtner: where do you see <code>int1</code> being set to a string?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why did you add 1 to <code>listLength</code>? Python indices start at <i>zero</i>, not 1.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MartijnPieters typo,thx</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You might also avoid using names that python already uses as variable-names - this includes the builtins: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html</a>  - and most datatypes like <code>list, set, frozenset, dict, tuple</code>...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">that worked Thanks!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Glad to have been of help! Feel free to <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5234/how-does-accepting-an-answer-work">accept my answer</a> if you feel it was useful to you. :-)</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>print(*values,sep="\n")</code> would be another way to go</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@PatrickArtner: the OP almost certainly will need to do more with the values once they have the looping working.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@PatrickArtner: otherwise, see <a href="//stackoverflow.com/a/20774626">Python: for loop inside print()</a> for information on how that works.</span>
