<p>When I use this code, my aim is to try and make sure that any input will not break the code like letters or numbers not between 0-3. But when i use this code the whole list isn't coming up. How would i fix this?</p>
<p>The output should look like this </p>
<pre><code>Hello Megan the four games avaliable are:
0   Mario Cart
1   Minecraft
2   Angry Birds
3   Grabd Theft Auto
What number game do you want? h 
Please choose a valid number 

What number game do you want? 23
Please choose a number between 0 and 3

What number game do you want? 1
You have chosen Minecraft
</code></pre>
<p>Instead, the output is </p>
<pre><code>Hello the four games avaliable are:
0   Mario Cart
What number game do you want? 2
1   Minecraft
What number game do you want? h
Please enter a valid value
</code></pre>
<p>The code i am using is:</p>
<pre><code>#Ask user what game they would like to play
def game () :
    global gametype,gamelist
    gamelist = ["Mario Cart","Minecraft","Angry Birds","Grabd Theft Auto"]
    gamecount = 0
    print ("Hello the four games avaliable are:")
    while gamecount &lt; 4:
        print (gamecount," ",gamelist[gamecount])
        gamecount = gamecount + 1


        try:
            gametype = int(input("What number game do you want? "))

            while gametype &lt;0 or gametype &gt;3:
                print (" Please enter a value between 0 and 3")

        except ValueError:
                print ("Please enter a valid value " )

                return gametype

game ()
</code></pre>
<p>I have also tried another way, using 'while True' before 'try' but the program says that is an invalid syntax. </p>
<p>SECOND TRY </p>
<p>I have used this new code, but again it won't let me run the code as it says I have an invalid syntax when I put While True, with True highlighted in red. </p>
<pre><code>#Ask user what game they would like to play
def game () :
    global gametype,gamelist
    gamelist = ["Mario Cart","Minecraft","Angry Birds","Grabd Theft Auto"]

    while gamecount &lt; 4:
        print (gamecount," ",gamelist[gamecount])
        gamecount = gamecount + 1

    while True:
        try:
            gametype = int(input("What number game do you want? "))

            if 0 &lt;= gametype &lt;= 3 :
                return game
            print ("Please enter a value between 0 and 3 ")

        except ValueError:
                print ("Please enter whole number from 0 to 3 " )
                return game

<p>I think you want something like this:</p>

<p><strong>demo output</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"><code>What's your name? Megan

</code></pre>
<hr/>
<p>The main change I made to your code is to put the <code>try.. except</code> stuff inside a <code>while True</code> block, so we keep asking for input until we get something valid. I also used <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#enumerate" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>enumerate</code></a> to print each game with its number. That's neater than your <code>while gamecount &lt; 4:</code> loop.</p>
<hr/>
<p>If you <em>have</em> to print the list of games using a <code>while</code> loop then you can do it like this:</p>
<pre><code>gamelist = ["Mario Cart", "Minecraft", "Angry Birds", "Grand Theft Auto"]

def game(name):
    """ Ask user what game they would like to play """
    print ("Hello, {}, the four available games are:".format(name))
    gamenum = 0
    while gamenum &lt; len(gamelist):
        print(gamenum, ":", gamelist[gamenum])
        gamenum += 1

    while True:
        try:
            gamenum = int(input("What number game do you want? "))
            if 0 &lt;= gamenum &lt;= 3:
                return gamenum

            print("Please enter a value between 0 and 3")
        except ValueError:
            print ("Please enter a whole number from 0 to 3")

name = input("What's your name? ")
gamenum = game(name)
print("You chose", gamelist[gamenum])    
</code></pre>
<p>I made <code>gamelist</code> a global list so we can access it outside the <code>game</code> function. We don't need to use the <code>global</code> statement in the function because we aren't changing <code>gamelist</code>. In general, you should avoid using the <code>global</code> statement.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Please fix the indentation in your code. The way you present it, it's not valid Python, because <code>try</code> and <code>except</code> are not on the same indentation level.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Also, the <code>while</code> loop will never terminate, but run indefinitely if the condition is fulfilled.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Last, can you please show us the exact error the Python interpreter shows? Usually, there will be a clear hint on what is wrong.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The problem is not in the code you show above, but in <code>yup.py</code> and it is exactly what the interpreter says: The variable <code>name</code> you are trying to print is not defined (has not been introduced and set to any value).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@michelle It looks like you're a bit lost. But I can tell that you're trying hard to make this work, so I'll post an answer shortly. In future, please post the <i>exact</i> code that you're trying to run, and make sure the indentation is <i>identical</i> to what's on your machine. And when you get an error message please include the full error message in your question, starting from the Traceback line. Put the error message into a code block to preserve the formatting.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">is there anyway to do it without the enumerate?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@michelle Sure! But using <code>enumerate</code> is the neat &amp; Pythonic way to do it. You can also do it with <code>for gamenum in range(4):</code>. See if you can figure it out. You could also do it with a <code>while</code> loop, like you were trying to do before, but that's the messiest way.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I tried changing it, I have added it at the bottom of my question, would you be able to look at it. I think I need it in the while loop as a requirement</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@michelle You have to be careful when coding to make sure you type keywords &amp; variable names <i>exactly</i>. You need <code>while</code> to be all lower case. You use capital <code>W</code>, so here on Stack Overflow it gets printed in light blue instead of dark blue.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thank you, that made it work now but i believe there is a problem with my 'except ValueError' because when i put in a letter it prints ("Please enter a whole number from 0 to 3") but it does not reask the question like with the 'if'</span>
