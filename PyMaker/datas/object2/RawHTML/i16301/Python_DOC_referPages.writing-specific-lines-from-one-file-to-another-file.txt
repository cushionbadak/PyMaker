<p>I'm trying to read a file, look for a specific word and if a line contains that word, remove the line and send the remaining lines to a new file.
Here's what I have but it is only finding one of the lines not all of them;</p>
<pre><code>with open('letter.txt') as l:
  for lines in l:
    if not lines.startswith("WOOF"):
      with open('fixed.txt', 'w')as f:
        print(lines.strip(), file=f)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The problem is that when you do <code>with open('fixed.txt', 'w') as f:</code> you basically <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open" rel="nofollow">overwrite the entire content of the file</a> with that one next line. Either open the file in <em>append</em> mode <code>a</code> ...</p>
<pre><code>with open('letter.txt') as l:
    for lines in l:
        if not lines.startswith("WOOF"):
            with open('fixed.txt', 'a') as f:
                print(lines.strip(), file=f)
</code></pre>
<p>... or (probably better) open the file in <code>w</code> mode, but just once at the beginning:</p>
<pre><code>with open('letter.txt') as l, open('fixed.txt', 'w') as f:
    for lines in l:
        if not lines.startswith("WOOF"):
            print(lines.strip(), file=f)
</code></pre>
