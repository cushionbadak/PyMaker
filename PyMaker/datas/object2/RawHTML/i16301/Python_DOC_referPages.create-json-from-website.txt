<p>I am trying to scrape a website, and convert its contents to JSON. I have been able to write the code to scrape it and all of its subcategories, but I can't figure out how to generate a nice JSON File, using the following structure</p>
<pre><code>Category[1]: "Name of category"
    Article[1]
        Title: "Some title"
        Text: "Some Text"
        Image: "Some image"
    Article[2]
        ...
        ...
        ...
    ...
Category[2]: "Name of category"
    Article[1]
        Title: "Some title"
        Text: "Some Text"
        Image: "Some image"
    Article[2]
        ...
        ...
        ...
    ...
</code></pre>
<p>I am a newbie in python, so any explanation is appreciated. Thanks!</p>

<p>Since the output you showed isn't anything close to valid JSON, I'm not sure exactly what output you want. But the answer is the same:</p>
<p>Never worry about "creating a JSON file". Just create a dict full of dicts and lists, then call <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html#json.dump" rel="nofollow"><code>json.dump</code></a> to turn that dict into a JSON file.</p>
<p>For example, maybe something like this:</p>
<pre><code>categories = {}
for thing in thingies:
    name = get_next_category_name()
    articles = get_articles(name)
    categories[name] = [convert_article(article) for article in articles]
with open(path, 'w') as f:
    json.dump(categories, f)
</code></pre>
</div>
