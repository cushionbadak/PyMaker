<p>Before anyone gives me crap about this being asked a billion times, please note that I've tried several of the answers in many a thread but none of them seemed to work properly for my problem. </p>
<pre><code>import json
def parse(fn):
    results = []
    with open(fn) as f:
        json_obj = json.loads(open(fn).read())
        for r in json_obj["result"]:
            print(r["name"])

parse("wine.json")
</code></pre>
<p>I'm basically just opening a json file and iterating it for some values. Obviously, whenever I read a value with some unicode in it I get this error.</p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "json_test.py", line 9, in &lt;module&gt;

UnicodeEncodeError: 'charmap' codec can't encode character '\u201c' in position
15: character maps to &lt;undefined&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>As people said in other threads I've tried to encode it and whatnot, but then I get a similar error, no matter how I encode and/or decode it. Please help.</p>

<p>Everything is fine up until the point where you try to print the string. To print a string it must first be converted from pure Unicode to the byte sequences supported by your output device. This requires an <code>encode</code> to the proper character set, which Python has identified as <code>cp850</code> - the Windows Console default.</p>
<p>Starting with Python 3.4 you can set the Windows console to use UTF-8 with the following command issued at the command prompt:</p>
<pre><code>chcp 65001
</code></pre>
<p>This should fix your issue, as long as you've configured the window to use a font that contains the character.</p>
<p>Starting with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.6.html#pep-528-change-windows-console-encoding-to-utf-8" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><strong>Python 3.6</strong></a> this is no longer necessary - Windows has always had a full Unicode interface for the console, and Python is now using it in place of the primitive code page I/O. Unicode to the console <em>just works</em>.</p>

<p>What I ended up doing as a possible temporary fix (depending on if anyone have a better answer) was using <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Unidecode" rel="nofollow">Unidecode</a>. Unfortunately I lost all the accents but maybe someone has a fix for that.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">The problem is that you're printing to a Windows console that doesn't have any way to print the character. Python is detecting this for you before you get gibberish on the screen.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">But when I paste the character <code>â€œ</code> which is \u201c into the console I can see it just fine?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Have a look at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cp850" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>cp850</code></a>, the character is not there. When I try pasting it on my system it gets substituted with <code>"</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I see. What would you recommend I do?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I've already left my recommendation in the form of an answer.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">it works for me. thanks!</span>
