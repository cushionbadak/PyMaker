<p>just found out how to write and read to a csv file. It's very helpful, but im having some trouble with it. 
I noticed that when I scroll down in the csv file, it creates new lines, which then messes up when I want to append data to the csv file (it shows up at the bottom of a bunch of empty lines). 
So what I plan on doing is: 
Going down the document until it finds an empty row and get that line number with the line_num  reader object.
So then I would just need to be able to write to a specific line. Is that possible? </p>
<p>I have been using this webpage as a guide. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html" rel="nofollow">https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html</a></p>

<p>Can't be done. If you want to write to the middle of the file, you need to read the whole thing in and write the whole thing back out with your change.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Also see the accepted answer to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/1325927/908494">Inserting Line at Specified Position of a Text File in Python</a>. Of course you can't directly wrap the <code>csv</code> module around the <code>fileinput</code> module, but your idea of getting the line number and then <i>doing something</i>, the <code>fileinput</code> stuff is that <code>something</code>; you'll just need to use <code>csv</code> to write a row to an <code>io.BytesIO</code> or <code>io.StringIO</code> instead of to the real file, then use <code>fileinput</code> to write its <code>getvalue()</code> as a line.</span>
