<pre><code>def functION():

<p>I am having trouble opening this file while located in a sub-directory directly underneath my Python file... is there a better way to open files from ANY directory on my computer?</p>
<pre><code>FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'WebSource\\EXAMPLE SOURCE.htm'
</code></pre>
<p>I can't read from the file because I get the following error:</p>
<pre><code>C:\python34\python.exe G:\Robot\test.py
Process started &gt;&gt;&gt;
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "G:\Robot\test.py", line 118, in &lt;module&gt;
    functION()
  File "G:\Robot\test.py", line 64, in functION
    data = Source_obj.read()
AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'read'
&lt;&lt;&lt; Process finished. (Exit code 1)
================ READY ================
</code></pre>
<p>BTW:  The file to be read is just a source file from an HTML Chrome webpage.</p>
<h2>EDIT</h2>
<p>I'm looking for more help with the path and wondering why I get the first mentioned Traceback regarding the path</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html#os.path.relpath" rel="nofollow"><code>os.path.relpath()</code></a> returns a <strong>string</strong>, not an open file object. You'll need to open a file first; use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open" rel="nofollow"><code>open()</code> function</a>:</p>
<pre><code>def functION():
    Source_obj = path.relpath(r"WebSource\EXAMPLE SOURCE.htm")
    with open(Source_obj) as fileobj:
        data = fileobj.read()
</code></pre>
<p><code>with</code> here treats the file object as a context manager; when the indented codeblock under the statement is exited (either because the code completed or an exception occurred), the file object will automatically be closed.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Your <code>Source_obj</code> is just a string, not a file.</p>
<pre><code>def functION():
    Source_obj = path.relpath("WebSource\EXAMPLE SOURCE.htm")
    with open(Source_obj) as f:
        data = f.read()
</code></pre>
<p>By <code>open()</code>-ing it you can read from the file. Using the <code>with</code> context manager, the file will be properly closed for you when you leave that block of code.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Why the downvotes on this question?  It includes both code and a traceback.  I wish most newbie questions were written like this one.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The error message tells you what you need to know.  <code>data = Source_obj.read()</code> fails because <code>'str' object has no attribute 'read'</code>.  You can conclude that <code>Source_obj</code> is a string.  Then you look back and see that <code>Source_obj</code> was assigned the result of <code>path.relpath</code> function.  Then you go <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html#os.path.relpath" rel="nofollow noreferrer">read the docs</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks! I just started learning Python a few days ago and am starting to implement it now</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The read data will remain, yes; the read data is not tied to the file object, open <i>or</i> closed.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you @MartijnPieters any help with the path?</span>
