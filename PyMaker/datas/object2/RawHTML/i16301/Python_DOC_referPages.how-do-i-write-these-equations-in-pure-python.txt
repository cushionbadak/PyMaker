<p>Given these example equations with all but the word degrees in broken python:</p>
<p><code>L = 280.460</code> degrees <code>+ 0.9856474</code> degrees <code>* n</code></p>
<p>and</p>
<p><code>lamtha = L + 1.915</code> degrees <code>* math.sin(g) + 0.020</code> degrees <code>* math.sin(2*g)</code></p>
<p>How can I can I write these in functional python to get the correct values for L and lamtha?</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html#math.sin" rel="nofollow"><code>math.sin</code></a> requires that you pass radians to it when you call it. If you pass your input as degrees, you will not get the correct result - convert to radians before you call <code>math.sin</code>.</p>
<p>The return value of <code>math.sin</code> won't be in degrees <em>or</em> radians - it's just a ratio, so there's nothing to convert there.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>It's necessary to convert all degrees where degrees are called for into into radians when operating on them or along with <code>math.sin</code> and similar functions that require radians as an argument. Finally, if I need to, I can convert the resulting lamtha into degrees with <code>math.degrees</code>.

<pre><code>L = math.radians(280.460) + math.radians(0.9856474) * n
g = math.radians(g)
lamtha = L + math.radians(1.915) * math.sin(g) + math.radians(0.020) * math.sin(2*g)

<span class="comment-copy">This is better suited for <a href="http://math.stackexchange.com">math.stackexchange.com</a> because your question fundamentally is about radians vs degrees and not really about Python.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The <code>sin</code> function does not <i>return</i> radians. It expects radians as input. So you <i>have</i> to convert the arguments for <code>sin</code> and <code>cos</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>math.sin</code> takes radians. Basically all of those functions are defined in terms of radians, not degrees, so this conversion should be the first you do with input (<code>math.radians</code>) and the reverse the last you do with output (<code>math.degrees</code>).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@BurhanKhalid It's about how to deal with degrees and radians in Python. I understand radians. I edited the math.radians returns radians bit.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Like Lev says, sin and cos take an <i>angle</i> as an argument and return a dimensionless number as a result. Geometrically, this is the ratio of the lengths of two sides sides of a triangle. I'm not sure what you mean by converting that into degrees.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I think you're right @Matthew. To add, since the ratios are figured by radians, all other angles in the equation must be in radians so to be correct. The answer below would be the pure Python code: â€“  MansaMusa</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The ratios won't be in radians <i>or</i> degrees. You won't need to convert them - they're ratios. If you convert the result of sine to degrees, that result will be wrong.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Let me change my answer to reflect that.</span>
