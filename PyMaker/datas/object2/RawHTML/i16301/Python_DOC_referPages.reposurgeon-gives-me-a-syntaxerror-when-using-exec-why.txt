<p>Using <a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/reposurgeon/" rel="nofollow"><code>reposurgeon</code></a> and trying to extend its functionality, I am faced with:</p>
<pre><code>reposurgeon: invalid syntax in extension function
</code></pre>
<p>which translates to a <code>SyntaxError</code> extension raised from the <code>execfile()</code> call in <code>RepoSurgeon.do_exec()</code>. What gives? The code I am trying to <code>exec</code> is as simple as:</p>
<pre><code>print "Hello world"
</code></pre>
<p>I have also used the Python CLI and <code>execfile</code> and there are no complaints whatsoever?</p>
<p>Used version: <code>reposurgeon</code> 3.10</p>

<p>This one took me a while to figure out, which is why I am posting it here.</p>
<p>The key is indeed in the single line of code we're trying to "source". While this is perfectly valid Python 2.x code, <code>reposurgeon</code> uses the <code>print</code> function from Python 3.x by doing:</p>
<pre><code>from __future__ import print_function
</code></pre>
<p>Which causes <code>print</code> to <strong>require</strong> the use of parentheses, as it makes <code>print</code> a function instead of a statement.</p>
<p>Obviously we're running our extension code in the context of <code>reposurgeon</code>, which means that we're dependent on the rules it defines.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/pyporting.html#from-future-import-print-function" rel="nofollow">this document</a>.</p>
<p>Hence the following will work just fine:</p>
<pre><code>print("Hello world")
</code></pre>
