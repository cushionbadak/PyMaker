<p>I have a list of dictionaries, and I need to get a list of the values from a given key from the dictionary (all the dictionaries have those same key).</p>
<p>For example, I have:</p>
<pre><code>l = [ { "key": 1, "Val1": 'val1 from element 1', "Val2": 'val2 from element 1' }, 
      { "key": 2, "Val1": 'val1 from element 2', "Val2": 'val2 from element 2' }, 
      { "key": 3, "Val1": 'val1 from element 3', "Val2": 'val2 from element 3' } ]
</code></pre>
<p>I need to get 1, 2, 3.</p>
<p>Of course, I can get it with:</p>
<pre><code>v=[]
for i in l:
    v.append(i['key'])
</code></pre>
<p>But I would like to get a nicer way to do so.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Using a simple <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions" rel="nofollow">list comprehension</a> (if you're sure every dictionary has the key):</p>
<pre><code>In [10]: [d['key'] for d in l]
Out[10]: [1, 2, 3]
</code></pre>
<p>Otherwise you'll need to check for existence first:</p>
<pre><code>In [11]: [d['key'] for d in l if 'key' in d]
Out[11]: [1, 2, 3]
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">do they all definitely have the key?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">One line... Or less ;)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That's what I was looking for, doing it on a single line. Will test it, thank you.</span>
