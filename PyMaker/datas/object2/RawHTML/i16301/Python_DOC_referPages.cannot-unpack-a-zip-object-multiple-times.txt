<p>Why is this not working?:</p>

<p>We cannot unpack a second time in Python, why is that?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#zip" rel="nofollow"><code>zip</code></a> returns an <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html" rel="nofollow">iterator</a> in Python 3.x instead of a list like it did in Python 2.x.  This means that, after you unpack it once, it will become exhausted and no longer usable:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; t = zip([3],[4],[3])
&gt;&gt;&gt; print("1:",*t)
1: (3, 4, 3)
&gt;&gt;&gt; list(t) # t is now empty
[]
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>You need to explicitly convert the iterator into a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html" rel="nofollow">sequence</a> (a list, tuple, etc). if you want to unpack it multiple times:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; t = tuple(zip([3],[4],[3]))
&gt;&gt;&gt; print("1:",*t)
1: (3, 4, 3)
&gt;&gt;&gt; print("2:",*t)
2: (3, 4, 3)
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">How is it not working? What happens when you try it?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you dont know why its not obvious</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What is missing is a decent problem description. <i>This is not working</i> doesn't tell us anything about what you were expecting and what happened instead. Sure, the experts can take a good guess, but that's not helpful for other future visitors with the same issue, they won't find this question.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@TimCastelijns: I realised, and edited the comment already. :-)</span>
