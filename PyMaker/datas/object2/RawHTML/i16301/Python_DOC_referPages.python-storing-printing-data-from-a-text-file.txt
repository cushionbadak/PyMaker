<p>I'm trying a Python script that takes from the user a sequence of certain letters, (A, C,G ,T) and prints the percentage of A's, C's, G's, and T's. </p>
<p>For example if the user types
AGGTGACCCT
then the output should be
A: 20
C: 30
G: 30
T: 20</p>
<p>I'm fairly experienced with Java, but new to Python. I don't how to use Scanners like I would in Java. I tried searching through a reference library but couldn't really figure anything out.</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/collections.html#collections.Counter" rel="nofollow">collections.Counter</a>  is a very handy tool and worth learning about when you start using python.</p>
<pre><code>from collections import Counter

inp = input("Enter letters") # input() if using python 3

l = len(inp.strip()) # get length of input string ,inp.strip() removes any whitespace, just use len(inp) if you want to include

c = Counter(inp)

for char in c:
    c[char] = c[char] * 100 / l  # don't need to cast as float for python 3
print (c)
Counter({'C': 30.0, 'G': 30.0, 'A': 20.0, 'T': 20.0})
</code></pre>
<p>There is a module <code>csv</code> that has a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.DictWriter" rel="nofollow">DictWriter</a> that will be able to write the data to file. </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can read directly from the standard input stream, <code>sys.stdin</code>, like so:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat read.py 
import sys

userin = sys.stdin.read()
print [c for c in userin]

$ python read.py 
HELLO
['H', 'E', 'L', 'L', 'O', '\n']
</code></pre>
<p>And then you can pipe a text file to stdin, like:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat input.txt 
HELLO
$ python read.py &lt; input.txt 
['H', 'E', 'L', 'L', 'O', '\n']
</code></pre>
<p>Or, if you want to read a file directly:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import io
&gt;&gt;&gt; with io.open('input.txt', mode='rb') as f:
...     print [c for c in f.read()]
... 
['H', 'E', 'L', 'L', 'O', '\n']
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you can save the sequence in a comma separated file (csv), then you could do something along the lines of:</p>
<pre><code>import pandas as pd

sequence = pd.read_csv(file_name)
As = 0
Cs = 0
Gs = 0
Ts = 0
total = len(sequence)

for letter in sequence:
    if letter == 'A':
        As += 1.0
    elif letter == 'C':
        Cs += 1.0
    elif letter == 'G':
        Gs += 1.0
    elif letter == 'T':
        Ts += 1.0

percent_A = As/total
percent_C = As/total
percent_T = As/total
percent_G = As/total
</code></pre>
<p>Or:</p>
<pre><code>import pandas as pd

sequence_list = []
sequence = pd.read_csv(file_name)
for letter in sequence:
    sequence_list.append(letter)

As = sequence_list.count('A')
Cs = sequence_list.count('C')
Gs = sequence_list.count('G')
Ts = sequence_list.count('T')

total = len(sequence_list)

percent_A = As/total
percent_C = As/total
percent_T = As/total
percent_G = As/total
</code></pre>
<p>This general structure holds for tsvs as well.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">What's the module to import for raw_input?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Muffinman, it is a builtin for python 2, you don't need to import</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm not using Python 2, that's why I was wondering. I'm using the latest version of 3.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I added a note beside that if you were using python 3 use <code>input()</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">I just noticed as I posted that comment, thanks for the help.</span>
