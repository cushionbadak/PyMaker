<p>I'm trying to write a program in python that uses commands and files that are os dependent and I don't have access to a mac. What is the exact system name for the <code>os.name()</code> command?</p>
<p>Better yet what is the <code>platform.system()</code> answer. I have windows which of course is 'windows' and I have Linux which in my case is 'Linux' but what is mac? So right now I need the output for os.name() and platform.system(). Preferably a more recent version of OS X like either mountain lion or Maverick. </p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The platform name for <em>all</em> OS X releases is <code>Darwin</code>:</p>
<pre><code>Python 2.7.6 (default, Apr 28 2014, 17:17:35) 
[GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 5.1 (clang-503.0.40)] on darwin

&gt;&gt;&gt; import platform
&gt;&gt;&gt; platform.system()
'Darwin'
</code></pre>
<p><code>platform.system()</code> uses <code>os.uname()</code>, and you can look up responses on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uname" rel="nofollow">uname Wikipedia page</a>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I think Martijn's answer is exactly what you want. But if you need a specific recent version of OS X, check <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/platform.html#platform.mac_ver" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>platform.mac_ver</code></a>. <code>platform.mac_ver()[0]</code> will be the release number (e.g., <code>'10.9'</code>), which you can parse and compare. (Just don't compare it as a string, or your code will tell everyone running Yosemite that they need at least 10.8â€¦)</span>
