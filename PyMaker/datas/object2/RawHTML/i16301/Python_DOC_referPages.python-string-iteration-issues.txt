<p>I have just started learning python and I am a bit confused. Why does this code not work? When I call pie, it returns 1 instead of 5. What am I not understanding here?</p>
<pre><code>score = {"a": 1, "c": 3, "b": 3, "e": 1, "d": 2, "g": 2, 
     "f": 4, "i": 1, "h": 4, "k": 5, "j": 8, "m": 3, 
     "l": 1, "o": 1, "n": 1, "q": 10, "p": 3, "s": 1, 
     "r": 1, "u": 1, "t": 1, "w": 4, "v": 4, "y": 4, 
     "x": 8, "z": 10}

 def scrabble_score(word):
     total = 0
     word = word.lower()
     for letter in word:
         total =+ score[letter]
     else:
         return total
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You have got the operator incorrectly. It should be +=, not =+.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">It should be <code>+=</code> instead.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">you can do this nicely as <code>sum([score[letter] for letter in word.lower()])</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">I don't understand why there's an else clause without an if. Unindent the return statement and eliminate the else:</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If @vaultah's comment doesn't explain it: <code>=+</code> means nothing, so <code>total =+ score[letter]</code> means <code>total = (+ score[letter])</code>. So, each time through the loop, you replace <code>total</code> with <code>+ score[letter]</code>. The last letter scores <code>1</code>, so you replace <code>total</code> with <code>+1</code>, which is <code>1</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Actually I am quite wrong per <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#for" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation</a>.  It's used for when the list is exhausted.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why the downvote?  This is the correct answer.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@vaultah so close the question.  don't penalize the answerer.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It's been useful to me. I learned about the "else" condition in a "for" loop. It's not very searchable, but it's a good exchange of information.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I do think downvoting my question is a bit unfair though. I admitted right away how dumb I was</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If the problem is really a simple typo, the question is useless. If the problem is that the OP really meant <code>=+</code> because, say, he's coming from a language that uses <code>=+</code>, then the answer needs to be more than a one-liner. I'm not sure either possibility deserves a downvote, but I can't see why anyone would _up_vote it, eitherâ€¦</span>
