<p>I'd like to run my python script in such a way that every line is printed as it is executed (for debugging purposes), like how you can add <code>set -x</code> to a bash script. Is this possible? If not, what other strategies are there for debugging python that don't involve adding log lines everywhere? I usually use pdb but this isn't always suitable for time sensitive applications eg networking.</p>

<pre><code>$ python -m trace -t myscript.py | grep myscript.py
