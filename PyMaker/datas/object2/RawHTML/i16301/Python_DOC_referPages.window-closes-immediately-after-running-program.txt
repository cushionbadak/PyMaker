<p>I am new to all programming and I just started to get interested in learning how to program. So to do so I started with what most people consider the easiest language: Python.</p>
<p>The problem I am having right now though is that if I say to Python <code>print("Hello!")</code>, save it in a file, and then run it, a black window opens up and closes right away. I just do not understand why it is doing this.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>It is normal for the window to close as soon as your program runs to completion. If you want it to stay open, you can add a call to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input" rel="nofollow"><code>input</code></a> (or <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#raw_input" rel="nofollow"><code>raw_input</code></a> if you are using Python 2.x) at the end:</p>
<pre><code>print("Hello!")
input("Press the &lt;Enter&gt; key on the keyboard to exit.")
</code></pre>
<p>This will keep the window open until you press the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key on the keyboard.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Well because a <code>print</code> command simply writes something to the terminal.</p>
<p>In order to <em>see</em> the output. Start <code>cmd</code> (or open a terminal in Linux) and then run:</p>
<pre><code>python &lt;file&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>with <code>&lt;file&gt;</code> the file you want to run...</p>
<p>Or you can, like @iCodez suggests, pause the input at the end of the program by adding a pause:</p>
<pre><code>print("Hello World!")
input()
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Insert input() in the last line. It will make the program wait for a input. While it doesn't occur the windows program will be open. If you press any key and then enter, it will close.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">That (mostly) black window probably shows <code>Hello!</code> in the top left corner just before it goes away.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">add <code>input()</code> to your code and try again</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I assume you're on Windows? When you double-click a <code>.py</code> file, by default, it opens a new <code>cmd</code> window, runs the script, then closes the window. You can add a `input('Press Return to quit') at the end of your script, but it's better to learn how to either use the command prompt to run scripts, or use an IDE (IDLE, PyCharm, Eclipse/PyDev, etc.), or ideally both.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Upvoted because I don't know why this was downvoted. (Sure, the poster is clearly a novice, but it's not like he didn't admit that right up front. He describes the problem pretty clearly, and specifically; maybe it doesn't belong on SO, but then we should migrate or close it, not leave it here and downvote it.)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@IanAuld: I can't remember any significant problems running linux under a VM since the 1.x kernel days. In fact, I've had far <i>more</i> problems running it on bare metalâ€¦ Also, running it in a VM doesn't affect navigating in any way; the virtual machine <i>is</i> a linux box. Also, what makes you think the OP is hoping to get a job as a professional developer in today's job market? For that matter, you really think all the people who work on iOS or Windows or other platforms are expected to know how to navigate on a linux box?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The only thing that can be clicked on to close the window is its OS close button in the upper right -- there's no "Enter" button displayed.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@martineau - I thought it was clear that I meant the Enter key on the keyboard.  Sorry, I'll edit my answer to say that.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@iCodez: But I can't get the mouse cursor to move off the screen and onto my keyboard. :P</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ugh.  I am starting to regret answering this. -_-</span>
<span class="comment-copy">oh like on powershell?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes... Indeed. Another option is to pause the program until you've read the output.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user3885968: Yes, you can use PowerShell, although cmd (aka "DOS prompt") can be easier to use once you get further along, because it fits in better with the Unix-like model Python was designed around (things like standard input, argv, etc. make more sense in cmd).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@abarnert thanks though I hope i wont annoy you but from cmd, how do I start the program that just print("Hello!")?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user3885968: The same way the answer shows. Assuming <code>python.exe</code> is somewhere on your path, and you've changed directory to the location of your script, <code>python myscript.py</code> will run it. If <code>python.exe</code> isn't on your path you'll have to do <code>C:\Python34\bin\python.exe myscript.py</code>; if the script isn't in your current directory, <code>python D:\myscripts\myscript.py</code>; or of course the two of those combined if necessary.</span>
