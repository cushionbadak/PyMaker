<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I've made a program as follows:</p>
<pre><code>x = input('Message? ')
x = x[::3]
for i in x:
  print(i, end=' ')
</code></pre>
<p>it's supposed to give me the letters of input (every third letter) which it does, although it also prints a white space at the end which I have been unable to get rid of. I've tried everything including the <code>.rstrip</code> and <code>[:-1]</code> with no luck</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You are telling <code>print()</code> to print that whitespace with <code>end=' '</code>.</p>
<p>Instead of calling <code>print()</code> repeatedly, pass in the whole list in one go:</p>
<pre><code>print(*x)
</code></pre>
<p>Now each element of <code>x</code> is printed as a <em>separate argument</em>, using the default 1-space separator, and a newline as <code>end</code>.</p>
<p>Outside of passing in the elements as separate arguments to <code>print()</code>, you can also use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.join" rel="nofollow"><code>str.join()</code></a> to build one string with separators; this does require that all elements in <code>x</code> are strings or you'd need to explicitly convert them:</p>
<pre><code>print(' '.join(x))
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Try this:</p>
<pre><code>x = input('Message? ')
x = x[::3]
print(' '.join(x[::3]))
</code></pre>
<p><code>join</code> lets you put a space between adjacent characters, leaving out the trailing white-space</p>
</div>

<span class="comment-copy">also, for future reference, what exactly does the * tell the program to do?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user3879060: it unpacks <code>x</code> into separate arguments. See <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/36901">What does ** (double star) and * (star) do for Python parameters?</a></span>
