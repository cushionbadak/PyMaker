<p>I have been trying break out of loop when a condition is matched. I've tried one-liners below:</p>
<pre><code>break if a is not None else time.sleep(1)
</code></pre>
<p>and this</p>
<pre><code>a is not None and break
time.sleep(1)
</code></pre>
<p>Both are not working &amp; throwing <code>SyntaxError</code> while the straight forward works fine.</p>
<pre><code>if a is not None:
    break
time.sleep(1)
</code></pre>
<p>While I've no problem with using it this way, I just want to know why the syntax for above is wrong.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The expression  <em>expression</em> <code>if</code> <em>expression</em> <code>else</code> <em>expression</em> is a ternary operator. The expressions are evaluated. <code>break</code> is a statement. It isn't evaluated, it's executed. You're getting a syntax error because the syntax is not correct.</p>
<p>As @hugo Rivera says below, "All expressions are statements, but not all statements are expressions."</p>

<p><em>All expressions are statements, but not all statements are expressions.</em></p>
<p>The ternary operator <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#conditional-expressions" rel="nofollow"><code>X if B else Y</code></a> only accepts expressions <code>X</code>, <code>B</code> and <code>Y</code>, but <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#grammar-token-break_stmt" rel="nofollow"><code>break</code></a> is a statement and cannot be used as an expression. </p>
<p>Similarly, you can't <code>return</code>, <code>import</code>, assign, etc... in a ternary operator. See the second link for a full list of statements.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">It's just because of the way the syntax is defined. <code>break</code> is a statement on its own, but not an expression, so it can't be combined with anything else in a single statement.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm not sure why you think that syntax should work. Can you give an example of a similar case where that works?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You also can't do things like <code>f(break)</code> or <code>x = break</code> for the same reason.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you both for very clear explanations. :)</span>
