<p>Suppose I have </p>
<pre><code>def foo:
    return a()

def bar:
    someObject = someObjectFactory()
    if someObject.field: 
       #do something
</code></pre>
<p>What if I want to change the value of someObject.field when I call foo.
Foo is a test and basically I want to be able to change someObject.field to test different values.</p>
<p>Edit: bar and foo are in different files </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Just create the class <em>outside</em> <code>bar()</code> so that <code>foo()</code> can modify it.</p>
<pre><code>someObject = someObjectFactory()

def foo():
    someObject.field = "something"
    return a()

def bar():
    if someObject.field:
        # code
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Since you are obtaining someObject from someObjectFactory, a possible solution is (for the unit-testing scenario) to modify someObjectFactory / provide an test-specific implementation of someObjectFactory such that it returns, for each test of bar, an object that has exactly the properties needed for that test.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">From the code you have posted, the relationship between foo and bar is not clear.  Made an attempt for a helpful answer nevertheless.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I strongly suspect that you need to take a look to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>mock</code></a> framework and spend some time on reading <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html#where-to-patch" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Where to patch</a> chapter.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">what if bar and foo are in separate files?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Articuno That is not a real issue but  you should write a simple runable example of that you would like to do. Otherwise is it impossible to answer.</span>
