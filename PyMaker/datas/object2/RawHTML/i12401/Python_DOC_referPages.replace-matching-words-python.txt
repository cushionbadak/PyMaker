<p>I have this codition:</p>
<pre><code>if "Exit" in name:
   replace_name = name.replace("Exit","`Exit`")
   name = replace_name
</code></pre>
<p>and it should replace Exit with 'Exit' but if I have another word like exited, it also replaces it 'Exit'. I only want it to replace the exact one "Exit" not exited. what is the best way to overcome this issue?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>You can use a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.sub" rel="nofollow">regular expression</a> with word boundary (<code>\b</code>) characters. Also, no need for the <code>if</code> check; if the word is not in the string, then nothing is replaced.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import re
&gt;&gt;&gt; s = "he exited through the exit"
&gt;&gt;&gt; re.sub(r"\bexit\b", "'exit'", s)
"he exited through the 'exit'"
</code></pre>
<p>You could also use flags to make the match case insensitive, or use a callback function for determining the replacement</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; s = "he exited through the Exit"
&gt;&gt;&gt; re.sub(r"\b(exit)\b", lambda m: "'%s'"%m.group(1).upper(), s, flags=re.I)
"he exited through the 'EXIT'"
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Use <code>re</code> for this.</p>
<pre><code>import re
replaced_name=re.sub(r"\bExit\b","`Exit`",name)
</code></pre>

<p>I should've wrote it this way:</p>
<pre><code>if name == "Exit":
   replace_name = name.replace("Exit","`Exit`")
   name = replace_name

<span class="comment-copy">what is name exactly? You could try replacing the if statement with: if name == 'Exit':</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You can try 'name.replace("Exit", "'Exit'", 1)' to replace only one time.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thanks alot. I don't know why i didn't think of that :).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you just mean: <code>if name=="Exit": name="`Exit`"</code> that is not the question you asked, and it is not really about replacing words.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">OP wants backticks in the replacement</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Maybe this should use case insensitive matching, since the OP is actually asking about "Exit", not "exit".</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@PM2Ring Replacing ' with ` is left as an exercise to the reader. They were escaped in the output, so I used<code>'</code> instead so the replacement is clearer.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Fair enough, Tobias.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Could I suggest the slightly less complicated-looking <code>re.sub(r'\b(exit)\b', r"'\1'", s, flags=re.I)</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you can guarantee that <code>name</code> is a single word, and you want this to be case-sensitive, why even bother doing a replace operation? Just do <code>if name == "Exit":</code> <code>name = "`Exit`"</code></span>
