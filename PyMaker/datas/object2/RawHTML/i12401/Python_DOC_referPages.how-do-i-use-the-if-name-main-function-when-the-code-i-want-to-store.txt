<p>In my code I am trying to use the <code>if __name__=='__main__'</code> function however the variables I want to share are after the code I don't want to run.<br/>
For example:</p>
<p>ProgramA.py</p>
<pre><code>if __name__=='__main__':
   fname = input('what is your first name')
   sname = input('What is your second name')
</code></pre>
<p>ProgramB.py</p>
<pre><code>import ProgramA
print(fname)
print(sname)
</code></pre>
<p>Now I don't want this code to run when importing the variables <code>fname</code> and <code>sname</code> to use in my other program, I only want the variables not the code that accompanies them. However when I use the <code>if __name__='__main__'</code> function and try and save the variables afterwards ProgramB says that the variables aren't defined. Sorry if this is already answered in another question, but so far I have found no solution.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>When you <code>import ProgramA</code> you can then reference <code>fname</code> and <code>sname</code> which are still the values from ProgramA given from:</p>
<pre><code>fname = input('what is your first name')
sname = input('What is your second name')
</code></pre>
<p>By referencing <code>ProgramA.fname</code> and <code>ProgramA.sname</code> like this:</p>
<pre><code>import ProgramA
print(ProgramA.fname)
print(ProgramA.sname)
</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively you could import it like this:</p>
<pre><code>from ProgramA import *
print(fname)
print(sname)
</code></pre>
<p>You shouldn't use <code>if __name__ == "__main__"</code> in ProgramA. <code>__name__</code> is only equal to <code>"__main__"</code> if Python is loading this source code file as the main program, and as it is being imported from ProgramB <code>__name__</code> does not equal <code>"__main__"</code> and therefore the variables <code>fname</code> and <code>sname</code> are never declared, which is why you get this error. You can use <code>if __name__ == "__main__"</code> in ProgramB though.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Where exactly are you using <code>if __name__ == '__main__'</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Edited original question</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you run <code>ProgramB.py</code>, then <code>__name__</code> will never be <code>__main__</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">TY, but how would I make the names print without running the code asking for the first and second names in ProgramB</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ABo I'm not sure what you're asking. Obviously you can put <code>fname = input('what is your first name')</code> and <code>sname = input('What is your second name')</code> in ProgramB and just delete ProgramA.py entirely and get rid of its import in ProgramB, but I thought that wasn't the point of the question.</span>
