<p>I'm writing a script to download a file from a website, and I'm able to successfully save the file using a path entered into the code, however if I use an input then things don't work.</p>
<pre><code>path = input("Save Location: ")
</code></pre>
<p>From here I'll use <code>os.path.join</code> to append the file type to the end of the path and then use PycURL to download the file. But getting a user input for the path gives a FileNotFoundError, for example <code>C:/Users/MyName/Desktop</code> become <code>C:UsersMyNameDesktop/v.mp4</code> after appending the file type. I've also tried <code>C:\\Users\\MyName\\Desktop</code> as well as <code>C:\/Users\/MyName\/Desktop</code> however they give the same thing, and ideally I'd like to avoid using double forward/back slashes in the input since they're not very user friendly.</p>
<p>If for whatever reason you need any more code/all the code don't hesitate to ask. Thanks :)</p>

<span class="comment-copy">show your code with <code>os.path.join</code>  and <code>C:/Users/MyName/Desktop</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks. I did something very similar to this but this seems to work. Not sure why mine didn't but hey. This one does :)</span>
