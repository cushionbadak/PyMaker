<p>I use <code>python</code>'s <code>pip</code> to install packages. Now I want to install <code>scipy</code>, which is already installed on the system, but an old version and on a part of the system where I don't have access to. If I try</p>
<pre><code>pip install scipy
</code></pre>
<p><code>pip</code> rightfully tells me that the package is already installed. If I do</p>
<pre><code>pip install scipy --upgrade
</code></pre>
<p><code>pip</code> tries to upgrade the package but I don't have the access rights to do that.</p>
<p>How can I tell <code>pip</code> to install the package local to my user and to ignore the other <code>scipy</code> package?</p>

<p>I think the best way for avoid override packages it's using a virtual environment. Python has it's own virtual environment and you could install it by:</p>
<p><strong>Python 2.7</strong></p>
<pre><code>&gt; sudo apt-get install python-virtualenv
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Python 3</strong></p>
<pre><code>&gt; sudo apt-get install virtualenv
</code></pre>
<p>With modern <code>python</code> versions, <code>virtualenv</code> is usually included. Once installed, you could generate a virtual enviroment typing:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; virtualenv venv
</code></pre>
<p>This would create a folder in the current directory named <code>venv</code> (you could name it whatever you want). In this package the libraries will be installed.</p>
<p>So, it's time to activate the virtual environment</p>
<pre><code>&gt; source venv/bin/activate
</code></pre>
<p>You could verify the environment has been activated by checking the prompt changes. If it happens, all the packages installed using pip will be installed locally.</p>
<pre><code>(venv)&gt; pip install scipy
</code></pre>
<p>You could check <a href="http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/" rel="nofollow">this website</a> for more info.</p>
<p>Don't forget that you eventually have to clear your <code>$PYTHONPATH</code> variable, in order for it to not pick up other packages.</p>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>pip help install</code> suggests <code>--user</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ah, I checked <code>pip help</code>, but not <code>pip help install</code>. It seems to work (taking a while). If you elevate this to an answer, I might accept it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Python has been providing its own virtualenv-like package for a while now: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">you are invited to edit or improve the answer with that info</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I fixed my problem. I had clean up my <code>$PYTHONPATH</code> variable. I added this to your answer. Thanks for the help.</span>
