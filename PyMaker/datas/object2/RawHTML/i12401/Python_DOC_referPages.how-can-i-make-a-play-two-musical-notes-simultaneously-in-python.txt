<p>I plan to do a music notation which allow the user to place the note where ever they want and allowed them to play the notes they placed.</p>
<p>If the user put the note in the same time which we have to play 2 or above notes together, any solution to solve that problem?</p>

<p>Answer is really simple and straightforward in theory - use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html" rel="nofollow">threads</a>. Your code has to be executed asynchronously.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Use <code>multiprocess</code> and <code>winsound</code> module to do so.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>import threading
....
....
....
threading.Thread(name='&lt;thread_name&gt;', target='&lt;your_target&gt;').start()
</code></pre>
<p>you can do it 2 times for 2 different targets</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">How are you playing the notes?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I tried pygame and winsound.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Even <i>in theory,</i> threads run in undefined order.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">if I have:  winsound.Beep(261,999) #C notes  winsound.Beep(293,999) # D notes  .How can i play it together with multiprocess</span>
