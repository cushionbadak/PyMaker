<p>I have a function which returns a tuple which includes numbers, strings and arrays.For example, <code>(1, 2, 3, [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]], ['a','b','c'])</code>. I need to run my function 100 times and save all the results. I'm thinking of save each result as a text file.  So I can have 100 *.txt fils like this:</p>
<pre><code>my number1: 1
my number2: 2
my number3: 3
My array:   [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]
My Names:   ['a','b','c']
</code></pre>
<p>How to write the python code? </p>
<p>Is there better way to save the results for easy data re-visit in future?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>yes, you can <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>import pickle</code></a> and use <code>pickle.dump()</code> and <code>pickle.load()</code> to read and write to a file.</p>
<p>Here is how you would write it to a file:</p>
<pre><code>data = (1, 2, 3, [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]], ['a','b','c'])
with open('data.pickle', 'wb') as f:
    pickle.dump(data, f)
</code></pre>
<p>To read it back in:</p>
<pre><code>with open('data.pickle', 'rb') as f:
     data = pickle.load(f)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you want easy data revisit across-language, you can use JSON.</p>
<pre><code>import json
data = (1, 2, 3, [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]], ['a','b','c'])
#save your data to a json file
with open('data01.json', 'w') as fjson:
    json.dump(data, fjson)

#json file can easily be read using other languages as well
with open('data01.json', 'r') as fjson:
    revis_data = json.load(fjson)
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The <code>revis_data</code> will be converted to a list and won't be a tuple anymore. If you want it to remain a tuple after reloading, just do <code>tuple(revis_data)</code></p>

<span class="comment-copy">Take a look at the python "pickle" package</span>
<span class="comment-copy">or if everything is serializable, try <code>json</code> module</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks guys, But I want it to be saved as *.txt file. So I can just click on the file to CHECK it and read it using other language. With picle or json, we still need to write code to read it, isn't it? ----I'm probably like Matlab too much. Don't we have something similar like Matlab cells that can store all my results?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">How will that create the format they want?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">he wrote 'is there [a] better way', so I assume he is open to suggestions</span>
<span class="comment-copy">"<i>easy data re-visit in future</i>": this could only be read by <code>pickle</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>open('data.pickle', 'r')</code> should be <code>open('data.pickle', 'rb')</code>. Because if you are writing it to a binary file you should read it back from a binary file. Otherwise you are gonna get an encoding error</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Good catch. fixed!</span>
