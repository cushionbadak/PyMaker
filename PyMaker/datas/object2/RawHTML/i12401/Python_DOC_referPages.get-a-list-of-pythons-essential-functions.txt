<p>For syntax highlighting of Python in Python, I'm using the "keywords" module to get a list of the keywords (for, in, raise etc.).</p>
<p>But how can I get a list of essential built-in functions? I.E. the ones listed here: <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html" rel="nofollow">https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html</a></p>
<p>(I want to do it programmatically of course, in case the list ever changes)</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>dir(builtins)</code> is not enough, simply because <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/builtins.html" rel="nofollow"><code>builtins</code></a> module also exposes exceptions and warnings, as well as <code>False</code>, <code>True</code>, <code>None</code> and lots of other constants and "internal" functions.</p>
<p>You could test the type of the object</p>
<pre><code>import builtins # __builtin__ in Python 2
from inspect import isbuiltin

for name, val in vars(builtins).items():
    if isbuiltin(val):
        print(name)
</code></pre>
<p>but even then, in Python 3 the output would include <code>__build_class__</code> which isn't in the list of <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html" rel="nofollow">Built-in Functions</a>.</p>
<p>Really, it's fine to hardcode names of built-in functions.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can get a list of the builtins functions in python typing the following:</p>
<pre><code>print dir(__builtins__)
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>dir(__builtins__)</code> perhaps?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That doesn't seem to work in an imported module, only in the main module.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you're trying to implement your own syntax highlighting, you might be better off looking at the python grammar.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Well, then <code>from __main__ import __builtins__ as builtins; dir(builtins)</code>. Cyclic imports ftw. (Damn, does not work in python2)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Works in the interpreter, but not inside an imported module!</span>
