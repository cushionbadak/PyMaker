<p>Simple python code</p>

<p>I want to change the arguments,if it is possible without return.When I run my code</p>

<p>Why?
With return</p>
<pre><code>def m(x,y):
  x=2
  y=[3,5]
  return x,y

a=1
b=[0,26]
print m(a,b)

<p>I got</p>
<pre><code>(2, [3, 5])
</code></pre>
<p>What I want is a and b printed.</p>

<p>What I assume you want to achieve is to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation_strategy#Call_by_reference" rel="nofollow">pass your arguments by reference</a>, so that they get changed by the function.</p>
<p>You cannot achieve that passing <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Python_Programming/Data_Types#Mutable_vs_Immutable_Objects" rel="nofollow">immutable</a> arguments (like numbers) into your function. To deal with that, take a look at the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/faq/programming.html#how-do-i-write-a-function-with-output-parameters-call-by-reference" rel="nofollow">official docs</a>. For clarity I'd strongly advise to use solution 1, though it uses a <code>return</code> statement:</p>
<pre><code>def m(x,y):
    x = 2
    y = [3,5]
    return x,y

a = 1
b = [0,26]
a,b = m(a,b)
print a,b
</code></pre>
<p>Achieving this "without <code>return</code>" is possible using one of the other solutions given in the documentation. From those I'd say solution 3 is preferable, though it's much less clear and straightforward than solution 1. You pass a <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Python_Programming/Data_Types#Mutable_vs_Immutable_Objects" rel="nofollow">mutable</a> argument to your function, like a <code>list</code>:</p>
<pre><code>def m(x):
    x[0] = 2
    x[1] = [3,5]

a = [1, [0,26]]
m(a)
print a
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">What do you want it to print?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Your question, and especially the title, is very unclear, but you probably want <code>m()</code> to <code>return</code> something.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Because all functions implicitly return <code>None</code> and you've printed return value from your function?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">As your <code>definition</code> does not <code>return</code> anything (<code>None</code>) it will print that out.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Ogaday: <code>global</code> is usually a symptom of bad design. I think beginners should not be trained to use it, also because they may face unexpected behaviors. However that's just my humble opinion :)</span>
