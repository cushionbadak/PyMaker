<p>What should I do? Reinstall pip? pip-scripts.py file, is not any more in the directory, I don't know what happened. 
Can't install/uninstall other modules. How can I fix it? I am using windows 7.</p>

<p>What you can do:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Python versions <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/whatsnew/2.7.html#pep-477-backport-ensurepip-pep-453-to-python-2-7" rel="nofollow noreferrer">python 2.7.9+</a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.4.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">python 3.4+</a> ship with <code>pip</code>. So you can choose any of them to avoid the hassle of getting pip and stuff. But...</p></li>
<li><p>I think you don't have any special reason to use python 2.7. So I suggest you remove python 2.7, <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-350/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">download</a> and install python 3.5 and start using it! As they say: <em>Python 2.x is legacy, Python 3.x is the present and future of the language</em>. <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/Python2orPython3" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Read more</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Then you can install/uninstall any package using <code>pip</code>, as pip is the default <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/13445719/3375713">package manager</a> in newer versions of python. Read pip <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs</a>.</p></li>
</ul>

<span class="comment-copy">Maybe you should give some more information.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm sorry for not being clear. I have installed pip some time ago and I have installed some modules. I wanted to install Django and it turned "Can't open C:\Python27\Scripts\pip-scripts.py"    What should I do? I wanted to uninstall pip, to install it again, but says the same thing.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm sorry I am very bad at Python but I was just mentioning it for other people, so they can help you maybe.</span>
