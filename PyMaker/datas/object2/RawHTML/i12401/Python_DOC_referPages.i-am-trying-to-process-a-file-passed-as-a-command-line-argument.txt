<p>I am trying to process a file passed as a command line argument.  Right now there is only one argument, but I plan to add others.</p>
<p>Here is my code so far:</p>
<pre><code>import argparse

parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="Sample arg parsing")

parser.add_argument('-f',type=file)

try:
    print parser.parse_args()
except IOError, msg:
    parser.error(str(msg))
</code></pre>
<p>I can't figure out how to pass the argument to file handle to open and process.
And yes, I am a n00b.
The try block is just there for testing.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You need to pass the filename as a string. Then, you can use open() to open the file from the filename. Refer to the python docs <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/inputoutput.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> (7.2 - Reading &amp; Writing Files).</p>

<span class="comment-copy">arguments are text - it can't be file - but you can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html#filetype-objects" rel="nofollow noreferrer">FileType objects</a> to convert filename to file.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for that link.  The seems to say that by using FileType it is opening the file implicitly for me.  So I am still stuck with how do I reference it so that I can process it?</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>args = parser.parse_args()</code> and then <code>args.f</code> because you used name <code>-f</code></span>

<span class="comment-copy">OK...that makes sense.  But how do I reference the passed argument to set it equal to a string?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It will already be a string, you just have to read its value. The first example here shows you how to read an argument value: <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/howto/argparse.html#introducing-positional-arguments" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/2/howto/â€¦</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ah!  So whatever is in the first position of the add_argument method becomes the argument's name that can then be referenced, right?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@CraigBoyd that's right.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks Patrick and furas ~ between the two of you I got there!</span>
