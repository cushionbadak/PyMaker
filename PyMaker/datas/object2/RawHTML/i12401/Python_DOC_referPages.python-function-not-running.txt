<p>I am having trouble with my <code>Room_Temp</code> function.  When I run the code and enter a temp nothing happens.  Any suggestions?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You also never defined the value 'n' which you are using in your define functions
def Room_Temp(n):
The value 'n' is not defined.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You're never calling the function <code>Room_Temp</code>, so that block of code is never run</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You also need to be careful with overriding functions with variables: <code>Turn_On = True</code> can lead to great confusion when you want to call the <code>Turn_On</code> function a few lines later. Remember, in Python functions are first-class, meaning that <code>def Turn_On():</code> is basically the same as <code>Turn_On = def():</code>. You possible intended to use <code>Turn_On(True)</code>? Also, <code>Temp &lt; 75</code> like that does nothing; if seems you're missing an <code>if</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Above the line <code>print "you are here [2]"</code> put a new line line <code>Room_Temp(user_input)</code> and see what the output says when you run it. (This is what @mhlester means by "calling the function"). Then you'll also see the relation between that and what @carpetsmoker says about Turn_On...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">All in all, it looks like you're having trouble understanding basic Python syntax and structure. While I'm all for experimenting,  I would <b>strongly</b> recommend reading up on basic Python; the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">tutorial</a> is a good place to start, although I would personally recommend Mark Lutz's <i><a href="http://learning-python.com/books/about-lp.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Learning Python</a></i>, as it's much more in-depth and explains things better (but it's not free). We all struggled when learning thisâ€”so that's normal, and don't give up hope or stop experimenting!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">if i change n to user_input then how do i call the function</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This answer makes no sense. The function isn't even called.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thanks both of those worked</span>
