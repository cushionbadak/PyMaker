<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I found the following line in Python code:</p>
<pre><code>from six.moves import urllib
</code></pre>
<p>Simultaneously, I can find <code>urllib.py</code> anywhere. I found that there is a file <code>six.py</code> in package root and it has <code>class Module_six_moves_urllib(types.ModuleType):</code> inside.</p>
<p>Is this it? How is this defined?</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>
<p>Sorry I am new to Python and the question is about Python syntax. I learned, that what is after <code>import</code> is Python file name without a <code>py</code> extension. So, where is this file in this case?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/six" rel="noreferrer">six</a> is a package that helps in writing code that is compatible with both Python 2 and Python 3.</p>
<p>One of the problems developers face when writing code for Python2 and 3 is that the names of several modules from the standard library have changed, even though the functionality remains the same.</p>
<p>The <code>six.moves</code> module provides those modules under a common name for both Python2 and 3 (mostly by providing the Python2 module under the name of the Python 3 module).</p>
<p>So your line</p>
<pre><code>from six.moves import urllib
</code></pre>
<p>imports <code>urllib</code> when run with Python3 and imports a mixture of <code>urllib</code>, <code>urllib2</code> and <code>urlparse</code> with Python2, mimicking the structure of Python3's <code>urllib</code>. See also <a href="https://pythonhosted.org/six/#module-six.moves" rel="noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong> to address the update of the question:</p>
<p>TLDR; There is not necessarily a direct relation between the imported module <code>urllib</code> and a file on the filesystem in this case. The relevant file is exactly what <code>six.__file__</code> points to.</p>
<p>Third party modules are defined in a file/directory that is 
 listed in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.path" rel="noreferrer"><code>sys.path</code></a>. Most of the time you can find the name of the file a module is imported from by inspecting the <code>__file__</code> attribute of the module in question, e.g. <code>six.__file__</code>. However with <code>six.moves</code> things are not as simple, precisely because the exposed modules might not actually map one to one to actual Python modules but hacked versions of those.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Are you asking what <code>six.moves.urllib</code> is for? Have you read the manual? <a href="https://pythonhosted.org/six/#module-six.moves" rel="nofollow noreferrer">pythonhosted.org/six/#module-six.moves</a> â€“ Or do you want to know how it's implemented exactly (in which case, the source code is available...)?</span>
