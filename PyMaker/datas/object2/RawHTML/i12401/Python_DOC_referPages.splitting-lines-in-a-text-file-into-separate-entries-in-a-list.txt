<p>So, I want to code a program that allows the user to do various tasks, one of which I am having some trouble with.<br/>
-Option A allows the user to search a text file by a job's 'Estimate ID', and it would search the file for that matching ID and return the relevant data in the following format:<br/>
Estimate Number: (<em>the estimate number</em>)<br/>
Customer ID: (<em>the customer ID</em>)<br/>
Estimate Amount: (<em>the final total</em>)<br/>
Estimate Date: (<em>the estimate data</em>)<br/>
Status: (<em>the status</em>)<br/>
 <br/>
Now, below is the format the data is stored in in the text file:<br/>
<em>E5346,23/09/2015,C107,970,N,0<br/>
E5347,23/09/2015,C108,1050,E,0<br/>
E5348,23/09/2015,C109,370,A,200</em><br/>
The data is shown as <strong>Estimate Number</strong>, <strong>Estimate Date</strong>, <strong>Customer ID</strong>, <strong>Final Total (in £ pounds)</strong>, <strong>Status (E for Estimate, A for Accepted Job or N for Not Accepted)</strong>, and <strong>Amount Paid (in £ pounds)</strong>. Obviously these are in the wrong order, and the different entries are all on one line, separated by commas, but the format cannot be changed.
 <br/>
Below is the code I wrote for this:</p>
<pre><code>Est_no = input ("Please enter the Estimate Number you wish to search: ")
data = []
search = open("paintingJobs.txt","r")
for line in search:
    if (Est_no) in line:
        data.append (line)
        print ("Estimate Number:",data[0])
        print ("Customer ID:", data[2])
        print ("Estimate amount:",data[3])
        print ("Estimate Date:",data[1])
        if data[4] == "E":
            status = ("Estimate")
        if data[4] == "A":
            status = ("Accepted Job")
        if data[4] == "N":
            status = ("Not Accepted")
        print ("Status:",status)
search.close()
</code></pre>
<p>I had what I thought was the great idea of putting the line into a list, and, as the entries are separated by commas, they would be independent entries in the list, and would print as required, but, it adds the line from the file as one entry; when I print the 1st entry in the list, which I want to be the Estimate Number, it prints the whole line, so I obviously need to split it into the separate entries I want. My question is, how?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.split" rel="nofollow">string.split()</a> to split the string by a delimiter (in this case, the delimiter is <code>","</code>).</p>
<p>Your code under the <code>if</code> block will now be as follows:</p>
<pre><code># Remove the data variable definition above the for loop
if (Est_no) in line:
    data = line.split(',')
    # Process data like a list like you are already doing
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">I think this should work for you <code>data+=line.split(', ')</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">This works perfectly! Thanks man :D It seems the delimiter ',' splits the line at every comma, which is exactly what I needed. Cheers!</span>
