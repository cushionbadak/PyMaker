<p>I am trying to make something that finds where a word is in a list and then tells you where it is here is what i have so far:</p>
<pre><code>whenAppears = 0
when = []
i = 0
phrase = str(input("What sentence? "))
phrase = phrase.lower()
phrase = phrase.split()
print(phrase)
wordel = str(input("What single word would you like to find? "))
wordel = wordel.lower()
if wordel in phrase:
    print ("That word is in the phrase, there are",phrase.count(wordel),wordel+"('s)""in the sentence")
for word in phrase:
    whenAppears += 1
    if wordel == phrase[i]:
        when.append(whenAppears)
print ("The word",wordel,"is in the slot",when)
</code></pre>
<p>no matter what i put in it says the word is in slot 1 and any other slots, i cant think of any ways to pic this, please help :D</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Put <code>whenAppears += 1</code> after the <code>if</code> block. Change <code>wordel == phrase[i]</code> to <code>wordel == word</code>. Delete the line <code>i = 0</code>.</p>
<p>Corrected code:</p>
<pre><code>whenAppears = 0
when = []
phrase = str(input("What sentence? "))
phrase = phrase.lower()
phrase = phrase.split()
print(phrase)
wordel = str(input("What single word would you like to find? "))
wordel = wordel.lower()
if wordel in phrase:
    print ("That word is in the phrase, there are",phrase.count(wordel),wordel+"('s)""in the sentence")
for word in phrase:
    if wordel == word:
        when.append(whenAppears)
    whenAppears += 1
print ("The word",wordel,"is in the slot",when)
</code></pre>
<p>You could make your code nicer with comprehensions and <code>enumerate</code>, but these are the errors you definitely have to fix.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You use the loop in an incorrect way.
You must compare <code>wordel</code> with <code>word</code>, because any time you loop over <code>phrase</code>, the value is stored in <code>word</code>.</p>
<pre><code>for word in phrase:
    whenAppears += 1
    if wordel == word:
        when.append(whenAppears)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You could rewrite your code more efficiently with <code>list.index</code>:</p>
<pre><code>phrase = str(input("What sentence? ")).lower().split()
print(phrase)
wordel = str(input("What single word would you like to find? ")).lower()
if wordel in phrase:
    print ("That word is in the phrase, there are",phrase.count(wordel), wordel+"('s)""in the sentence")
    print ("The word",wordel,"is in the slot", phrase.index(wordel))
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Take a look at the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#common-sequence-operations" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>list.index</code></a> method for a more efficient way to find the position of an item in a list of items.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank You SO Much :DDDDDD!!</span>
