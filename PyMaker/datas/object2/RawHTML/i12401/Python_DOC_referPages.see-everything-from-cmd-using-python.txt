<p>You can use the <code>cmd</code> module, or even program straight in python with <code>subprocess.Popen()</code></p>

<span class="comment-copy">thank you very much but its not what i meant..i move between folders in the cmd via python and want to know on what folder im in the cmd</span>
<span class="comment-copy">"The current working directory" means exactly the same as "what folder [I'm] in the cmd". If you mean something else, you'll have to show an example of the output you want.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">when using the os.getcwd() method it return the folder in which the python file is,not the current working dictionery that im using in cmd via python</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you change directories inside the command string that you send to the OS, then you'll have to issue an OS "show the current directory" command <i>inside the command string itself</i> . Your Python program can't get that information directly since the command string is being run in a separate subshell. BTW, what Python code are you using to send your command string to the OS?</span>
