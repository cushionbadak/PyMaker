<p>I want to write a program that, when the user types an integer from 1 to 7 inclusive, it prints out the corresponding day of the week. This is what I have so far. What I can't figure out is how to put that when <code>x</code> has a certain value, the program prints the string on another certain value, i.e. when the user writes <code>1</code>, the program should print str(0) which is <code>'MONDAY'</code>. </p>
<pre><code>x = (int(input('please type a number from 1 to 7, both inclusive: ')))

days_of_the_week = ['MONDAY',
                    'TUESDAY',
                    'WEDNESDAY',
                    'THURSDAY',
                    'FRIDAY',
                    'SATURDAY',
                    'SUNDAY']

for x in range(8):
    for d in range(0,7):
        print(days_of_the_week(d))

<p>Answered! I used a dictionary, and it worked better than using lists and all that loops. Thanks!</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Get rid of those nested loops; you don't need them at all. <code>list</code>s are accessed with square brackets, not parentheses. <code>list</code>s are 0-indexed (their first element is element number zero), so you would replace those loops with this:</p>
<pre><code>print(days_of_the_week[x-1])
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>To answer this directly,</p>
<pre><code>print(days_of_the_week[x-1])
</code></pre>
<p>would do what you want. But I would store the names in a dictionary instead:</p>
<pre><code>days_of_the_week = {1: 'MONDAY',
                    2: 'TUESDAY',
                    3: 'WEDNESDAY',
                    4: 'THURSDAY',
                    5: 'FRIDAY',
                    6: 'SATURDAY',
                    7: 'SUNDAY',
                    }
x = int(input('Please type a number from 1 to 7, both inclusive: '))
print(days_of_the_week[x])
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>What you want to do here is select the day whose number corresponds to the user's input. However, arrays start at 0, and so you'll want to subtract 1 from the input to match the corresponding day. If you did not perform (x-1), then typing 1 would output : TUESDAY, since TUESDAY is element 1 in array starting at 0. (In this case MONDAY is element 0.) I won't get into the details of why these start at zero, but there is a <a href="http://developeronline.blogspot.com/2008/04/why-array-index-should-start-from-0.html" rel="nofollow">good reason</a>. I'm not sure what you were doing with the for loops, though. </p>
<pre><code>x = (int(input('please type a number from 1 to 7, both inclusive: ')))

days_of_the_week = ['MONDAY', 'TUESDAY','WEDNESDAY', 'THURSDAY', 'FRIDAY', 'SATURDAY', 'SUNDAY']
print(days_of_the_week[x-1])
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>if( 1 &lt;=x || x =&gt; 7)
   print(days_of_the_week[x-1]);
else:
   print("incorrect input");
</code></pre>
<p>You can format the error statement however you would like.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">cant you just print specific index value of the array?   print(days_of_the_week[x-1]);</span>
<span class="comment-copy">you should have some kind of an error check to make sure the user hasn't entered any other number but 1 - 7 (both inclusive).  Something like this - if ( 1&lt;=x &amp;&amp; x&gt;=7).. else show error</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I tried the x-1 but didn't work or didn't get it right.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I would normally do an error check, but it is not specified in the assignment and actually might lead to an error</span>
<span class="comment-copy">what is your error?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The dictionary would have keys of consecutive integers, which is basically a <code>list</code>. I don't think a dictionary is called for here.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@TigerhawkT3 I get what you're saying, but I think the dictionary would represent GrilledSeismic's mental model much better: They want a mapping.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">And a <code>list</code> is a mapping where the keys are consecutive integers. You're emulating a <code>list</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you want to argue semantics: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-mapping" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-mapping</a>.  <code>from collections.abc import Mapping</code>, <code>isinstance(list(), Mapping)</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@GrilledSeismic Are you still using a loop of some kind? There's no reason for the <code>list</code> not to work.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This has syntax errors as well as style errors.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Nope, still not even compilable.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I wasn't writing syntax... or python code... basically just what I thought the answer should look for. but thanks.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You weren't writing syntax? What does that mean? And this is a Python question; answers should be in Python.</span>
