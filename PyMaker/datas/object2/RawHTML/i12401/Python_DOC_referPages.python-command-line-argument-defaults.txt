<p>I just wondered if there was a simple way to set a python command-line argument using sys.argv as a default. For example;</p>
<pre><code>sys.argv[2] = "defaultValue"
</code></pre>
<p>I know that in some other languages, you can do the following if it's blank;</p>
<pre><code>var myVar = "someValue" | "";
</code></pre>
<p>I am fairly new to Python but would love a simple solution to this. Thanks in advance ;)</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can top up the argument list so you have at least two arguments and then assign the correct value to <code>argsv[2]</code>:   </p>
<pre><code>import sys
sys.argv= sys.argv + ["" for x in range(2) ]
sys.argv[2]="defaultValue"
print sys.argv
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>One way to accomplish this would be:</p>
<pre><code>if len(sys.argv) &gt;= 3:
    myVar = sys.argv[2]
else:
    myVar = 'defaultValue'
</code></pre>
<p>You might also want to take a look at something like <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/optparse.html" rel="nofollow">optparse</a> or <a href="http://click.pocoo.org/5/" rel="nofollow">click</a> which make creating nice CLIs a bit easier.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for that, however I am working on a hotfix.. for a very large codebase. And this would allow us to use this tool without constantly having to pass a parameter which is no longer needed. I therefore cannot introduce any modules.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>sys.argv[2]</code> may not exist (if <code>len(sys.argv) &lt; 2</code>) and then you can't assign value.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You are free to re-assign <code>sys.argv</code> members as you like. But note that, as @furas points out, <code>sys.argv[n]</code> might not exist. Even in that case, though, you're free to append to it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I would rather use <code>myVar = sys.argv[2] if len(sys.argv) &gt; 2 else "defaultValue"</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Mmm, the only problem is that there this always a first argument passed.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If there is always a first argument, you can use <code>range(1)</code></span>
