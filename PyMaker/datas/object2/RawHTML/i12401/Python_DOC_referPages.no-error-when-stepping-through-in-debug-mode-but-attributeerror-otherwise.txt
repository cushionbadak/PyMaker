<p>Example code</p>
<pre><code>from pathlib import Path

for f in Path(&lt;dir&gt;).iterdir():
    print(f._str)
</code></pre>
<p>I'm using it to pass to a function but not even this works when running normally or debug without a breakpoint. Using a breakpoint and stepping through it prints everything out just fine (<code>_str</code> is the total path!</p>

<p>I'm really not sure what you are trying to do or print, but, yes, this throws an AttributeError. Probably because, well, <code>._str</code> is not an attribute of the <code>Path</code> class. </p>
<pre><code>from pathlib import Path

for f in Path('/tmp').iterdir():
    print(f._str)

AttributeError: _str
</code></pre>
<p>This does print the full path.</p>
<pre><code>for f in Path('/tmp').iterdir():
    print(f)

/tmp/com.apple.launchd.0CERUFd5eE
/tmp/com.apple.launchd.JLaC2VPWPS
/tmp/com.apple.launchd.jyIh6h3f8I
</code></pre>
<p>If you want just the names of the files &amp; directories, do <code>print(f.name)</code></p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">I think you want <code>f.path</code> or maybe just <code>f</code>, not <code>f._str</code>, which should be the same as <code>str(f)</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">No. That is not the case.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Humor me and try <code>print(f)</code> instead</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Calling the print function on an object invokes the <code>__str__()</code> method for that object (if it was defined). So, <code>print(f)</code> is the same as <code>print(f.__str__())</code> or <code>print(str(f))</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Makes sense, thank you.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>_str</code> must be an attribute of the <code>Path</code> class, as evidenced by the fact that it works when stepping through, and by using one's eyes while in the debugger.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It might be injected into the class by the debugger itself because it isn't <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">part of the documentation</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">You're talking over my head here (I don't mean that negatively). What do you mean? Looked at the docs myself but it seems like they don't have everything for the <code>WindowsPath</code> object (could be wrong though).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm just guessing that at run-time of the debugger, the <code>._str</code> attribute is added to all the objects for easier debugging. It probably maps to <code>__str__()</code></span>
