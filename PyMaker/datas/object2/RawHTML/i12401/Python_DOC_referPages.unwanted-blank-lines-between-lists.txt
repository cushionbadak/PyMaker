<p>I'm having some trouble with some test code. This code is meant to:</p>
<ul>
<li>read a csv file</li>
<li>take two inputs</li>
<li>put the inputs in a list</li>
<li>make a new list with the csv contents + the input list</li>
<li><p>overwrite the csv with the new list. </p>
<pre><code>import csv

input1 = input("input 1")
input2 = input("input 2")

original = []
with open('test.csv', 'r') as f:
   reader = csv.reader(f)
   original = list(reader)

data = [input1,input2]
original.append(data)

with open('test.csv', 'w') as f:
   writer = csv.writer(f)
   writer.writerows(original)
</code></pre></li>
</ul>
<p>For example, if 'cats' and 'dogs' were in the file, and I typed in 'zebras' and 'giraffes', I'd expect the csv to look like this when I open it in Notepad:

<p>However blank lines are produced in between the lists when I run the code more than once, and I don't know why.

<p>I am new to Python and any help is appreciated. </p>

<p>The solution is:</p>
<pre><code>open('test.csv', 'w', newline='')
</code></pre>
<p>In new versions of Python <code>csv.Writer</code> now handles newline, but <code>open</code> also does. Then you must tell <code>open</code> that it must not add newline when writing to the file. See <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html" rel="nofollow">API documentation</a> for more explanations.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Can you try to rstrip your input? For example, data = [input1.rstrip(), input2.rstrip()]</span>

<span class="comment-copy">thanks, I thought it would be something simple like that.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Gabriel Owens, You are welcome, if it is the solution, you may accept it</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What version of Python are you using? When I tried this, I got <code>TypeError: 'newline' is an invalid keyword argument for this function</code>.</span>
