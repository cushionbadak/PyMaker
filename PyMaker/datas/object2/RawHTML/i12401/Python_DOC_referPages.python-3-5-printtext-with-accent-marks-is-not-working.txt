<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have this in the code:</p>
<pre><code>print("Datos nos v치lidos")
</code></pre>
<p>but in the standard output is <strong>not showing anything.</strong></p>
<p>I'm in Python 3.5... why is it happening?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>you can print unicode directly:</p>
<pre><code>print(u"Datos nos v치lidos")
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You have to declare your encoding.  ASCII is the default character set, and <strong>치</strong> is not ASCII.  For instance:</p>
<pre><code># -*- coding: UTF-8 -*-
print("Datos nos validos")
print("Datos nos v치lidos")
</code></pre>
<p>... which fixes your problem.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">you see nothing ? Even error message ? Is it working without accent ? Maybe this part of code is not used by script.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">can you please post the rest of your code? this may be a unicode error, but we can't know without seeing the rest of the code.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Correct. The standard output is empty. I tried just that line of code in a script.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It's strange: just two days ago i updated my Python version.. could be that the reason?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">But there is no way to avoid the <b><i>u</i></b> prefix</span>
<span class="comment-copy">work in unicode, read topic about encoding as well</span>
<span class="comment-copy">ok, answer accepted</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Im in Sublime text 3: in this editor do i have to declare the encoding? or inside my .py code?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MigRome follow the instructions on the Unicode how to page. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/unicode.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/howto/unicode.html</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MigRome I don't think this is the problem, it should just give a weird looking square, not change the entire output of the function.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Prune: not solved the problem...</span>
