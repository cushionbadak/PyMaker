<p>i want to remove HTML tag and also replace \u00a0 with " ".
How to do it? </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Start with the Python <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html" rel="nofollow"><code>json</code> module</a>. That will allow you to read and write the JSON string into Python data structures. Then use the normal Python tools to process the data.</p>
<p>To process the HTML, look at <a href="http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/" rel="nofollow">Beautiful Soup</a>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">So what is the expected output? What have you tried yourself so far, where did you get stuck?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MartijnPieters i have already edit it</span>
<span class="comment-copy">There are plenty of answers here that show how to strip HTML from a string, or how to replace a certain character with another (here it is a newline with a space). <i>These problems have been solved</i>. Have you looked up those answers? What problems did you encounter when you tried to apply them?</span>
