<p>This is my code:</p>
<pre><code>sentence = input("Give me a sentence ")

word = input("What word would you like to find ")


sentence_split = sentence.split()


if word in sentence_split:
   print("have found",word,)
   print("The word comes in the position" )
else:
   print("error have not found",word)

wordfound = (sentence_split.index(word)+1)

print(wordfound)
</code></pre>
<p>I am able to get the index of the <em>first</em> occurrence of a word in string. How can I get <strong>all</strong> of the occurrences?</p>

<p>Use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.finditer"><code>re.finditer</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>import re
sentence = input("Give me a sentence ")
word = input("What word would you like to find ")
for match in re.finditer(word, sentence):
    print (match.start(), match.end())
</code></pre>
<p>For <code>word = "this"</code> and <code>sentence = "this is a sentence this this"</code> this will yield the output:</p>
<pre><code>(0, 4)
(19, 23)
(24, 28)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">@Cerbrus I haven't yet found a close reason that states "pure code writing requests" are off topic; and in fact we are OK with them explicitly, provided they don't ask for too much: <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/a/224104/16587">meta.stackexchange.com/a/224104/16587</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@GeorgeStocker How about closing it as a dupe? <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/4664850">Find all occurrences of a substring in Python</a>. I will wait to hammer till I get your approval.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I think it's worth pointing out, that it works only for "non-overlapping matches", therefore won't work for: sentence="ababa" and word="aba"</span>
