<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I am using python3, trying to split a text with note numbers after the period:</p>
<pre><code>text = "Reproduction now becomes posited as “natural” production.16 Fortunati joins Marx in a minute but crucial declension from usevalue to nonvalue. "
</code></pre>
<p>this is the closest sentence splitting regex I've gotten to that still works: </p>
<pre><code>sentences = re.split(r' *[\.\?!][\'"\)\]]* +', text)
</code></pre>
<p>I'm basically lost w/r/t catching the numeric instance immediately after a period via regex. Any help in properly incorporating [0-9] into the expression? Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>edit</strong> this is how it ideally is split:</p>
<pre><code>sentences[0]= "Reproduction now becomes posited as “natural” production.16"
sentences[1]= " Fortunati joins Marx in a minute but crucial declension from usevalue to nonvalue."
</code></pre>

<p>Using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.findall" rel="nofollow"><code>re.findall</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import re
&gt;&gt;&gt; re.findall(r'.*?\.\d+|.+', text)
['Reproduction now becomes posited as “natural” production.16',
 ' Fortunati joins Marx in a minute but crucial declension ...']
</code></pre>
<p>If you are okay using third party module, you can use <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/regex" rel="nofollow"><code>regex</code></a>, which allow non-fixed-width look-around assertion, split on empty string:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import regex
&gt;&gt;&gt; regex.split(r'(?&lt;=\.\d+\b)', text, flags=regex.VERSION1)
['Reproduction now becomes posited as “natural” production.16',
 ' Fortunati joins Marx in a minute but crucial declension ...']
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Could you clearly show us the desired output from that sentence?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Something like so could work: <code>\.\d+\b</code>, but it is unclear if it is what you are after.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">noted, updated the post with a bit more info</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Try changing the last <code>+</code> to <code>*</code> to make spaces optional. However, that might affect splitting other strings.</span>
