<p><code>__debug__</code> is a built-in constant, which, according to the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/constants.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs on constants</a>, doesn't seem like an implementation detail. </p>
<p>When trying to assign to it (which isn't supported as the docs state) the following error message is displayed:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; __debug__ = False
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1
SyntaxError: assignment to keyword
</code></pre>
<p>Apparently, according to the message, it's a keyword, but:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from keyword import kwlist
&gt;&gt;&gt; '__debug__' in kwlist
False
</code></pre>
<p>Which seems odd. <code>None</code>, <code>True</code> and <code>False</code>, also listed as constants, are contained in the <code>kwlist</code>. </p>
<p>Why isn't <code>__debug__</code> in the keyword list?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>It's technically not a keyword in the sense of the Python grammar. There's a <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/11e97f2f80bf65cc828c127eafc95229df35d403/Python/ast.c#L945" rel="noreferrer">specific check</a> in the compiler that prevents assignment to <code>__debug__</code>, but as far as the grammar is concerned, <code>__debug__</code> isn't a keyword, and <code>keyword.kwlist</code> is generated from the grammar.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">It's a constant not keyword. <code>def</code>, <code>class</code> etc are keywords.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@AshwiniChaudhary: <code>__debug__</code> does look like an oversight here.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The documentation, however does state: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#__debug__" rel="nofollow noreferrer">The names None, False, True and <b>debug</b> cannot be reassigned (assignments to them, even as an attribute name, raise SyntaxError), so they can be considered “true” constants.</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">I think @cᴏʟᴅsᴘᴇᴇᴅ is essentially right. Based on <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/70f52768fd1070b457d674bed368c69cb4a7483c" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this commit</a>, it looks like <code>__debug__</code> was checked alongside other keywords for simplicity, then people realised that had to change, and some slightly lazy copy pasting was done rather than thinking of a new error message.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@cᴏʟᴅsᴘᴇᴇᴅ I looked at the link the others posted, hit 'Blame', went to the line, looked at the latest commit for that line, saw it was irrelevant, and clicked 'View blame prior to this change'. Basically lets you see the history of a line.</span>
