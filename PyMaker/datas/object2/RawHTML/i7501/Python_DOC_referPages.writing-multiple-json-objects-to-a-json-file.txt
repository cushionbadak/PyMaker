<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have a list of <code>json</code> objects that I would like to write to a <code>json</code> file. Example of my data is as follows:</p>
<pre><code>    {
    "_id": "abc",
    "resolved": false,
    "timestamp": "2017-04-18T04:57:41 366000",
    "timestamp_utc": {
        "$date": 1492509461366
    },
    "sessionID": "abc",
    "resHeight": 768,

    "time_bucket": ["2017-year", "2017-04-month", "2017-16-week", "2017-04-18-day", "2017-04-18 16-hour"],
    "referrer": "Standalone",
    "g_event_id": "abc",

    "user_agent": "abc"
    "_id": "abc",
} {
    "_id": "abc",
    "resolved": false,
    "timestamp": "2017-04-18T04:57:41 366000",
    "timestamp_utc": {
        "$date": 1492509461366
    },
    "sessionID": "abc",
    "resHeight": 768,

    "time_bucket": ["2017-year", "2017-04-month", "2017-16-week", "2017-04-18-day", "2017-04-18 16-hour"],
    "referrer": "Standalone",
    "g_event_id": "abc",

    "user_agent": "abc"
}
</code></pre>
<p>I would like to wirte this to a json file. Here's the code that I am using for this purpose:</p>
<pre><code>with open("filename", 'w') as outfile1:
    for row in data:
        outfile1.write(json.dumps(row))
</code></pre>
<p>But this gives me a file with only 1 long row of data. I would like to have a row for each <code>json</code> object in my original data. I know there are some other StackOverflow questions that are trying to address somewhat similar situation (by externally inserting '\n' etc.), but it hasn't worked in my case for some reason. I believe there has to be a pythonic way to do this.</p>
<p>How do I achieve this?</p>

<p>The format of the file you are trying to create is called <a href="http://jsonlines.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">JSON lines</a>.</p>
<p>It seems, you are asking why the jsons are not separated with a newline. Because <code>write</code> method does not append the newline.</p>
<p>If you want implicit newlines you should better use <code>print</code> function:</p>
<pre><code>with open("filename", 'w') as outfile1:
    for row in data:
       print(json.dumps(row), file=outfile1)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Use the <code>indent</code> argument to output json with extra whitespace. The default is to not output linebreaks or extra spaces.</p>
<pre><code>with open('filename.json', 'w') as outfile1:
     json.dump(data, outfile1, indent=4)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">You can specify option of display within the <code>dumps</code> method, eg. can you try <code>json.dumps(row, indent=4, separators=(',', ': '))</code> to see how it goes? I will do a proper response if it works.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What kind of python type is your original data? Is it a string, list of dictionaries, files?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The data in your example is not valid json. Multiple objects must be inside either an array or another object.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Patthebug the code in your comment is missing a <code>write()</code> call, that's why there is no output.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you want to get help with this, include a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve">Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example</a>. This question is incomplete, since there's no way to tell what variable <code>data</code> is. The example "json" is not valid json, so presumably your actual input data is different.</span>
